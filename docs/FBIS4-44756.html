			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Bernard Broustet report: "Francois Leotard Strengthens </F> Bordeaux Scientific and Military Pole"]    [Text] The Aquitaine region is to receive some compensation  for the loss of thousands of jobs resulting from cuts in a  number of arms programs. In Bordeaux last Friday, Defense  Minister Francois Leotard confirmed that the European Molecular  Chemistry Institute (created on the initiative of the  Polytechnic School) would be sited in the city. He also  announced that a major investment concerning the region would be  included in the military planning law. The minister gave no  further details. One possibility is the installation of an  enormous laser in the region's Atomic Energy Commission [AEC]  establishment.  <H5>  Investment Worth 200 Million French Francs </H5>   The siting in Bordeaux of the Molecular Chemistry Institute  was announced two years ago, but the plan then seemed to get  bogged down. Certain members of the Paris scientific community  put up some resistance to the institute being located in the  provinces. Francois Leotard's very clear statements on the  subject appear to indicate that these objections have been  lifted, and that the institute will indeed be created.    Most of the estimated cost of 200 million French francs [Fr]  will come from local authorities (the Bordeaux city council, the  general council of the Gironde department, and the regional  council of Aquitaine) with the European Union also contributing  through the European Social Fund, according to the terms of  objective 2.    Based in Pessac, near the university, in two to three years  time the institute will be host to dozens of researchers from  the Polytechnic School and the universities of Louvain (Belgium)  and Lausanne (Switzerland). The number of researchers and  engineers could exceed 200 at the turn of the century. It will  serve to considerably strengthen the already not insignificant  potential of the region in the solid chemistry field.    The other investment announced by Francois Leotard could be  worth a great deal more. If the laser theory turns out to be  true, the figures could run into billions. Designed for nuclear  test simulation, this high-powered device could also be put to  other uses by Europe's scientific community.</p>

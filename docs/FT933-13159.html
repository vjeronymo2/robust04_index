			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Russia hints at attacks across Afghan border A TOP AIDE to Russia's security minister said yesterday that Russian forces in Tajikistan reserved the right to launch attacks across the Afghan border and that 'we have the moral right to invade their territory'. General Vladimir Bondarenko, the security minister's chief of staff, echoed the tough line taken last week by the Russian military establishment after 25 Russian border guards were killed on July 13 in a raid launched by Tajik opposition fighters who had taken refuge in Afghanistan after losing the struggle for control of their republic. Tajik and Russian officials have accused the fissiparous coalition government in Kabul of masterminding the attack, a charge the Afghan leadership has denied. Russian legislators, back from a trip to the embattled border region, admitted yesterday that Russian forces were behind a retaliatory attack into Afghan territory last week in which 380 people were killed or wounded and 6,000 villagers forced to flee their homes. Gen Bondarenko said yesterday that the security ministry, the body responsible for the border forces, had authorised its troops to fire into Afghanistan. 'The border guards have received an order to use fire to prevent any concentration of the enemy, even across the border, into Afghanistan,' he said at a press conference. 'I think they also should have the right to raid Afghan territory,' Gen Bondarenko added, but said the order for such attacks had not been given. Russian leaders and opinion makers are split on how to their country should react to the bloody conflict on the Afghan border. Hard-line communists and nationalists, accusing the military of 'criminal wavering,' believe its reaction has not been tough enough, but the foreign ministry, wary of becoming involved in an unwinnable guerrilla war, is adopting a moderate stance.</p>

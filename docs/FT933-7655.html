			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Two teams win defence radio deals TRANSATLANTIC competition to build a Pounds 1bn-plus battlefield radio system for the armed services entered a fresh stage last night when the Ministry of Defence awarded initial project development contracts to two consortia. The contracts, worth about Pounds 25m each, have been given to a consortium led by Siemens Plessey Systems, which is partnered with Racal, and a rival group led by ITT of the US, whose team includes Canada's Northern Telecom and BAeSema, jointly owned by British Aerospace and Sema Group. A third consortium, led by GEC Marconi and including Thomson CSF of France, has been dropped from the race, confirming industry speculation. The ministry said that the proposals from Siemens and ITT proved to be more attractive, but would not go into details. Racal's share price rose 1p to close at 248p yesterday in a falling market, while GEC's closed 2p lower at 345p. The competition to build the Bowman communications system has attracted virtually all the world's big defence communications groups. At stake is not only the final production contract - worth more than Pounds 1bn and due to be awarded in 1997 - but the prospect of spin-off orders from other armed services overseas. Bowman will become the UK's combat radio system, covering everything from hand-held radios for soldiers in the field to strategic radio systems at brigade headquarters. It is expected that it will replace the Clansman family of radios - used by the Army, the Royal Marines and the RAF - in 1999. Clansman was introduced in the 1970s and is a voice-only system. Bowman will be a voice and data system, necessary for running many modern weapon systems. It will also be more secure than Clansman, as it can 'frequency-hop' to prevent interception. The Ministry of Defence had been considering replacing Clansman for some years, and invited companies to tender for Bowman. This prompted the creation of three consortia - Yeoman for Siemens and Racal, Crossbow for the ITT team and Arrowhead for the GEC Marconi group - because the job was seen as too complex for one company alone. The two winners will now enter a three-year 'project definition' stage, funded by the ministry and industry. Mr Adrian Day, managing director of Racal Radio, said an eventual victory for the Yeoman team would be good news for the armed forces and British industry, and would help 'to maintain the UK technology base in a sector where this country leads the world.' ITT also expressed pleasure at winning a development contract, and said that, if Crossbow won, the UK content of the eventual production contract would be more than 75 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW HOUSE SALES AT SLOWEST PACE SINCE '82  </P> <P> Led by weakness in the fragile Northeast, sales of new homes fell to their  lowest level in September since the recession eight years ago, the Commerce  Department said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Single-family home sales plunged 6% last month after declines of 1.8% in August  and 0.9% in July, the department said.  </P> <P> The latest drop pushed home sales to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of  503,000 units in September, the slowest pace since the 480,000-unit rate in  recession-era October, 1982, it said.  </P> <P> With the economy widely expected to lose steam and possibly slip into a  recession, economists predict that things will get worse for the home-building  industry before they get better.  </P> <P> Depressed by high interest rates, slowing job growth and waning consumer  confidence, the home-building industry has been in a slump for more than a  year. Also slowing home sales has been a growing number of "move-up" buyers who  are slower to strike a deal than first-time buyers, economists said.  </P> <P> So far this year, the actual number of new homes sold has fallen 15% to  435,000. In September, the sales total before seasonal adjustment fell to  38,000 units from 47,000.  </P> <P> The slump has been particularly severe in the Northeast, where sales fell 15.6%  in September to an annual rate of 54,000 units.  </P> <P> In the South, sales fell 7.9% to a rate of 223,000, while in the Midwest, they  were down 2.2% to a 91,000-unit annual rate. Sales in the West slipped 0.7%  from August to a rate of 136,000 units.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Home Sales  </P> <P> Seasonally adjusted annual rate, thousands of units  </P> <P> Sept., '90: 503  </P> <P> Aug., '90: 535  </P> <P> Sept., '89: 638  </P> <P> Source: Commerce Department  </P> <P> Home Sales, Associated Press/ Los Angeles Times  </P></p>

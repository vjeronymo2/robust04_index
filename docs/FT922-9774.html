			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: Group that likes to take the plunge THE announcement that Sappi will pay DM400m to buy a 90 per cent stake in Hannover Papier, the German pulp and paper company, is the latest in a series of deals by the South African paper group. Coming on top of a R1.1bn (Dollars 380m) rights issue last October, the equity financing of the Hannover transaction will increase Sappi's equity base by 50 per cent in the course of a year. However, the company, part of the Gencor group, has a history of taking deep breathes and plunging in. The Ngodwana mill, built in 1982 for R1.3bn, remains the largest industrial investment undertaken by a private company in South Africa. It then cost 50 per cent more than the company's total assets. In July 1988, Sappi paid over R1bn to buy Saiccor, the world's single largest dissolving pulp producer, and the Usutu pulp mill, from Courtaulds. The purchase of five UK mills in 1990 was, at R500m, a large deal. Mr Eugene Van As, executive chairman of Sappi, concedes the Hannover deal was larger than what Sappi was looking for, but he says it was too good to walk away from. He adds that with the industry at the bottom of the commodity cycle, there are many assets for sale, but none of comparable quality to Hannover. The deal is certainly a watershed for Sappi. As Mr Van As comments: 'Sappi becomes quite an interesting animal in South Africa. We're no longer a South African company with a bit of exports.' After the Hannover deal roughly two thirds of Sappi's revenues and profits will come from exports and the activities of Sappi's non-South African subsidiaries. Few other South African industrial companies can make this claim. About 60 per cent of Hannover's sales are D-Mark denominated, the balance is sales into Europe. This should make Sappi attractive for local investors who attach a premium to rand hedge shares - those where a portion of earnings is non-Rand denominated, thus offering protection from a depreciating currency. Even better, Mr Van As notes, is that Sappi will also offer an assets hedge. Sappi consolidates all its controlled subsidiaries outside of South Africa, and the Hannover transaction appears not only to be cheap, but to offer considerable synergies. Mr Van As says they are acquiring a plant with the latest technology at an estimated 40 per cent discount to the replacement value of the assets. The transaction comes fairly heavily geared, with borrowings of DM370m. Sappi is confident this will be reduced to zero by 1996, assisted by Hanover's powerful cash flow. Sappi is not sitting still on the local front. The Saiccor plant is being expanded at a cost of about R900m, while the group is considering investments of R500m at the Tugela and Enstra operations. While Sappi's earnings performance in recent years has not been spectacular  -in the last economic cycle, from 1983 to 1990, compound growth in earnings per share was 18 per cent - management is confident the group will perform strongly in the next upturn.</p>

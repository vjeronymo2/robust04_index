			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIXON DEFENDS WIFE'S MINORITY BUSINESS DEALINGS  </P> <P> The chairman of the House Ethics Committee on Tuesday defended his wife's  participation in a minority business enterprise at Los Angeles International  Airport, asserting that she did not receive favoritism and was "very well  qualified for this type of operation."  </P> <P> At the same time, Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), whose committee  investigated alleged ethics abuses by recently resigned House Speaker Jim  Wright, insisted there was no connection between his wife's airport business  and a lucrative contract awarded by the Ethics Committee to the Los Angeles law  firm of Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. Cochran is a member and former chairman of the  Airport Commission.  </P> <P> "I don't know all the criteria involved in such contracts," Dixon said,  referring to the airport concessions franchise granted to his wife and a group  of other minority investors. "But I must point out that the Airport Commission  approved this contract. . . . And I have intentionally stayed out of it. I have  never discussed with anyone, including Johnnie Cochran, anything about Betty  Dixon's business."  </P> <P> The Times and two other news organizations, the Associated Press and the Wall  Street Journal, reported Tuesday that Betty Dixon earned more than $150,000  over the last two years on concession contracts at the airport on an initial  investment of less than $15,000 in 1986.  </P> <P> She derived the income by investing three years ago in two minority business  firms that qualified for airport work under a government program for minority-  and women-run enterprises.  </P> <P> "I'm emphatic in telling you that Betty Dixon is very well qualified for this  type of operation," Dixon said in an interview, citing her retail experience  with a gift shop she operated in Washington.  </P> <P> However, Betty Dixon acknowledged to The Times that she did little of the  hands-on management work in the airport enterprises intended by the government  program.  </P> <P> In addition, the Wall Street Journal disclosed that the Ethics Committee  earlier in 1986 awarded a contract to Cochran's Los Angeles firm to lead a  staff investigation into alleged financial irregularities involving former Rep.  Fernand J. St Germain (D-R.I.). The panel's investigation concluded in April,  1987, with no charges being filed against St Germain.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tells of Recommendation  </P> <P> Dixon said that he had recommended Cochran, a longtime friend, for the job but  that "he was interviewed and hired by the committee, not by me." He said  Cochran's fee was $170,000 for about 14 months of work.  </P> <P> "Much of the investigation centered in Los Angeles and he was eminently  qualified for the job," Dixon said. "He was formerly assistant district  attorney of Los Angeles County."  </P> <P> Cochran also told The Times that the concession contracts and his committee  appointment were unrelated. Cochran, who was Airport Commission chairman when  the concession agreements were approved, said he and Dixon "never discussed his  wife's business. That wasn't relevant to anything we talked about."  </P> <P> At the time the concession franchise was awarded to Duty Free Shoppers, the  prime contractor that had a joint venture with the minority firms, "we had no  knowledge at all of Betty Dixon," Cochran said. "She never appeared in records  or anything."  </P> <P> House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, who succeeded Wright in the top House post last  week, came to Dixon's defense Tuesday.  </P> <P> "As far as I know, there is no impropriety of any kind," the Speaker said,  adding that Betty Dixon's contract seems to be "a proper business arrangement."  </P> <P> Los Angeles airport officials have said they will review the concession  contracts to determine whether they are legal and meet the intent of the city's  minority contracting policy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Case May Be Reviewed  </P> <P> Irene Mields, senior attorney on the Federal Aviation Administration's general  counsel staff, said the agency probably will review the case based on the  recommendations of airport officials.  </P> <P> One question at issue is how much work Betty Dixon did for her pay. Regulations  published by the FAA's civil rights office state that officers of minority  firms should serve in a hands-on management role and gain actual work  experience. Absentee ownership is frowned upon.  </P> <P> Betty Dixon, a director of the two firms, Mir Kanon Inc. and Peideau Inc.,  acknowledged in an interview that aside from attending periodic board meetings  in Los Angeles, she has done no actual work at the airport concessions owned by  the firms.  </P> <P> A Washington resident, she spent most of her time in the capital while  operating her gift shop, Much Ado About Something Inc., and now distributes  advertising novelties from an office here.  </P> <P> Her husband said that she intends to work at the facilities this summer.  </P> <P> "What she wants to be able to do is bid independently on an airport concession  someplace," Dixon said. "She realized that the only way to do that was first to  get involved in a joint venture."  </P> <P> </P> <P> One of 10 Partners  </P> <P> Betty Dixon was one of 10 partners recruited by Duty Free Shoppers Group Ltd.  Partnership, the world's largest duty-free concessionaire, to boost its  minority and female participation and improve its chances of winning contracts  to operate gift shops at the airport.  </P> <P> Among the charges the Ethics Committee lodged against Wright this spring after  a yearlong investigation of his financial affairs was that his wife received an  $18,000-a-year salary, use of a condominium and a car from a Fort Worth, Tex.,  firm while doing little work. The committee charged that the income should have  been reported by Wright as a gift.  </P> <P> Another issue is that while FAA guidelines favor local business people for  minority contracts, three of Betty Dixon's partners live in Atlanta and -- like  her -- do not appear to fit the usual minority-business qualification of  "socially and economically disadvantaged individuals."  </P> <P> All are highly successful businessmen -- Jesse Hill Jr., president of Atlanta  Life Insurance Co.; Herman J. Russell, president of H.J. Russell Co., the  nation's largest black-owned construction company; and Felker W. Ward Jr., a  prominent attorney.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Atlanta Activist  </P> <P> Hill has been a major force in Atlanta for decades. He played a key role in  formulating civil rights strategy in the 1950s and 1960s and in the city's  commercial and political life. Russell, a longtime friend of Hill, was the  first black to serve on the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. Russell's company was  the fourth-largest black industrial firm in the United States in 1987, with  revenues that year of $141.9 million.  </P> <P> Ward now has his own investment banking firm, called Ward &amp; Associates Inc.  In September, 1988, he was elected to the board of the Atlanta Gas Light Co.,  the largest natural gas distribution company in the Southeast, serving more  than 1 million customers in 215 Georgia communities. The three men, who are 40%  owners of the duty-free shop at Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport, did not return  calls from The Times.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Glenn F. Bunting and Rich Connell in Los Angeles and David  Treadwell in Atlanta contributed to this story.  </P></p>

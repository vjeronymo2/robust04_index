They should have low  lights, a low ceiling, intimate seating and lots of stuff to absorb sound and  keep hushed conversations hushed. This one may be the coziest of the cozy.  </P> <P> Joe Jost's, 2803 E. Anaheim St., Long Beach. Open Monday through Saturday 10  a.m. to 11 p.m., Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (213) 439-5446. In the early 1920s it  was a barbershop, serving root beer and sandwiches to waiting customers. When  Prohibition ended, the health department said either serve food and beer or cut  hair. The beer still comes in frosted 20-ounce schooners, the eggs are pickled  on the premises, there's pool and snooker in the back room, and freshly roasted  peanuts and cigars are sold behind the bar.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yomei Tsuji] </F>   [Text] Riyadh, 24 Apr -- Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of  Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic Organizations], who is  currently visiting Saudi Arabia, met separately with Saudi  Arabian Foreign Minister Saud al-Faysal bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud,  Petroleum and Mineral Resource Minister Hisham Muhyi al-Din  Nazir, and other government officials in Riyadh city on 24  April. During these meetings, Saudi Arabia expressed strong  dissatisfaction with the fact Japan completely canceled the 1  trillion yen joint-venture project to transport crude oil to  Japan for refining last year, and urged resumption of  negotiations. Nazir said: "Japan should allow Saudi Arabia to  participate in subsidiary sectors of the oil business, such as  refining, in Japan. We are greatly disappointed with Japan's  withdrawal." Foreign Minister Saud, a member of the royal  family, also touched on the withdrawal from the project, and  said: "It is disappointing because we expected much from this  project."    The project involves a joint venture of three Japanese  companies--Nippon Oil Co. Ltd., Nikko Kyoseki Company (presently  Japan Energy Company), and Arabian Oil Co. Ltd.--and their Saudi  Arabian counterpart to build oil refineries in Japan to refine  Saudi Arabian crude oil and sell the finished products in Japan.  However, Japan judged this project was not profitable and  informed Saudi Arabia of its decision to cancel in November last  year.</p>

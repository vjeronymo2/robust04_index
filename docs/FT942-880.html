			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Emerging Markets: Romania shows commitment - The Emerging Investor Romania is on course to become the latest of eastern Europe's former communist states to open a stock exchange following parliament's acceptance this month of a securities bill. The bill, due to be promulgated within the next two weeks, paves the way for the establishment of an equity market and securities commission this autumn. The passage of the bill is being seen as a sign of greater commitment to reform by the government which in the past three months has pushed through parliament more reform legislation than it did in its first 16 months in office. Foreign investors have also been encouraged by signs of economic stabilisation and growth and by the agreement with the International Monetary Fund last month of Romania's first new loan agreement in two years. Under the terms of the deal the IMF will support the minority left-wing government's reform programme with loans worth Dollars 720m over 19 months. The reform programme, drawn up last autumn with the World Bank and IMF, has already had promising results. The tough monetary policy adopted by the country's reformist central bank since last November has brought inflation down to 6 per cent a month against last year's average of 12 per cent. The leu, the national currency, has been liberalised and made internally convertible. Exports are up 39 per cent over the first five months of last year while industrial production has stabilised after nearly halving between 1990 and 1993. Foreign investors and the country's emerging private sector hope that the government will now begin structural reform in earnest by speeding up privatisation and restructuring of the state sector. Emphasis is being placed on the stock exchange and the development of capital markets. Certificates of ownership (COs), representing the population's 30 per cent free share in the equity of the 6,300 state companies due for privatisation, have been distributed to some 15.5m Romanians. At first the new exchange is due to trade COs while the government finalises mechanisms for their transfer into shares. As a precursor to a mass privatisation programme, the authorities, advised by Hambros, the UK merchant bank, are preparing a series of public offers. The aim is to sell about five medium-sized companies at a time for a combination of cash and COs. So far, the only Romanians able to use their COs to buy shares have been those participating in the privatisation of some 500 small companies via management and/or employee buy-outs. The public offer programme will also provide foreign investors with a relatively quick and simple way to buy into a state company. Foreign companies will be able to purchase part of the 70 per cent offered for cash or to come in via a capital increase. Until now there has been little foreign participation in the privatisation scheme. This is partly because the first companies to be sold were generally too small to attract foreign interest. Uncertainty over commitment to reform, excessive bureaucracy and difficulties in setting up the six funds charged with implementing privatisation are other factors. This has meant that most of the Dollars 900m in direct foreign investment since 1990 has come through joint ventures rather than direct purchases. The hope is that the Bucharest exchange will attract significant foreign investment like those in other central European countries. Wasserstein Perella, the US boutique bank, has taken the lead, becoming the first western bank to set up a local merchant bank and investment fund. Capital markets will also boost the country's cash-strapped but rapidly expanding private sector. Larger private companies involved in production are beginning to emerge from the thousands of small trading companies and farming associations set up in the immediate post-communist period. There are also many state firms, such as the Agriculture Bank, one of the country's big four commercial banks, which have diluted state ownership through capital increases. The authorities believe that there are already enough private or partly state-owned companies planning a listing this autumn to pass the minimum of five companies needed to launch the stock exchange.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                        17/6/94    Week on week change Stock                      Country  Dollars close  Dollars    %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cho Heung Bank             S Korea     13.1416    2.1233    19.27 Eczacibasi Ilac             Turkey      0.1473    0.0203    16.00 Brisa                       Turkey      0.1097    0.0149    15.67 Manil Bank                 S Korea     12.7679    1.6276    14.61 Bank of Seoul              S Korea      9.7942    1.0910    12.54 Corticeira Amorin         Portugal     13.9165    1.4939    12.03 Eregli Denir Ve Celik       Turkey      0.2257    0.0199     9.68 Commercial Bank of Korea   S Korea      9.4223    0.8305     9.67 Kordosa                     Turkey      0.2853    0.0248     9.53 Alpha Leasing               Greece     22.1486    1.1986     5.72  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

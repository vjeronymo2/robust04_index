			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- European and Japanese  organizations involved in the development of fast breeder  reactors signed an agreement Friday [17 June] pledging  cooperation in the research and development of the  plutonium-fueled reactor type, the Science and Technology Agency  said.    Participating in the joint program are four Japanese  organizations including the governmental Power Reactor and  Nuclear Fuel Development Corp., which operates Japan's prototype  fast breeder reactor "Monju" in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture.    France's Atomic Energy Agency and British Nuclear Fuel Ltd.,  both involved in the development of the European Fast Reactor  (EFR), represent the European side.    Japan plans to have its first demonstration fast breeder  with  a planned output of 660 megawatts early next century. The EFR,  designed to generate 1,500 megawatts of electric power, is still  in a conceptual stage.    In the agreement both sides pledge to promote the mutual use  of existing research facilities to improve knowledge about  reactor coolants, fuel and safety measures.</p>

NODONG SINMUN today says they uttered this from a  cantankerous intention to lay hurdles in the DPRK-U.S. talks  and hinder the settlement of the nuclear problem, not satisfied  with the fact that the DPRK and the United States agreed to hold  the third round of the talks and discuss in a package deal the  issues for a fundamental solution of the nuclear problem.    The news analyst goes on:    If the Kim Yong-sam clique really wants the denuclearization  of the Korean peninsula for the sake of the nation, it should  welcome the successful progress of the DPRK-U.S. talks and do  favourable for it. However, the South Korean puppets are  misbehaving themselves, not satisfied with the DPRK-U.S. talks  because their attempt to realise an "international cooperation  system" and take sanction against the fellow countrymen may  fail. Furthermore, it stems from a criminal attempt to obstruct  the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and  leave South Korea to the mercy of the United States as a nuclear  base.    As to the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula, it was  raised as the United States shipped nuclear weapons into South  Korea.    If the traitor Kim Yong-sam worries a little about the  destiny of the fellow countrymen and really wants the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, he should not make  much ado about the settlement of the fictitious nuclear issue in  the North but take issue with the U.S. nuclear weapons and  bases in South Korea and talk about the question of their  withdrawal and dismantlement.    He is making a noise about the fictitious nuclear issue of  the North in a bid to find a pretext for putting out of argument  the U.S. nuclear weapons in South Korea to keep them and  justifying his move to develop nuclear weapons.    He should keep in mind that it precipitates his self-ruin to  keep North-South relations in a state of sharp confrontation and  rupture, taking issue with the unfamiliar "nuclear problem of  the North" at other's beck and call though he has no actual  power to resolve the nuclear problem.</p>

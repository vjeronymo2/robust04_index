			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / UN underlines commitment to Cambodian election next year UNITED NATIONS participation in the Cambodian peace process is expected to be strongly reaffirmed by the Security Council, despite the refusal of the Khmer Rouge to co-operate. A draft Security Council resolution, due to be passed within a week, underlines the determination of the international community to hold elections in May 1993 whether or not voting is possible in areas held by Khmer Rouge guerrilla forces. The resolution is likely to be acceptable to all the countries which played a big part in engineering last year's peace agreement which was intended to end the 13-year civil war. There are disagreements about the degree of response to failure of the Khmer Rouge, which was a party to the accord, to abide by it. The Khmer Rouge has refused to allow the UN access to the areas it controls, has violated the ceasefire, has fired on UN helicopters and has not disarmed or cantonned its troops. The resolution is expected to state that economic penalties would be used against the Khmer Rouge if it attempted to disrupt the elections or registration of voters, but to stop short of mandatory sanctions. It will also leave the way open for the Khmer Rouge to participate in the electoral process until the last possible moment. To deter disruption, UNTAC - the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia  - will maintain its military strength at 16,000 troops until the May elections instead of cutting it to about half that as planned. The troops will put less emphasis on cantonment of the military forces of Cambodia's factions - which has not been a success for most of them and has been ignored by the Khmer Rouge. Instead, UN troops will be deployed to help ensure undisturbed registration of voters. UNTAC is an unusually ex-tensive Dollars 1.6bn operation designed under last year's peace agreement to steer Cambodia from its civil war to the establishment of a freely elected government. It plans to keep voter registration lists open until around the end of January, giving time for UNTAC to mount a campaign to educate voters about the elections. A Security Council decision to reinforce UNTAC's mandate reflects a belief that Khmer Rouge forces are not strong - estimates vary from 5,000 troops to a maximum of 30,000 - and that elections can be held without serious disruption. Khmer Rouge violations of the ceasefire have sometimes been exaggerated by the Phnom Penh government, western officials say. It is estimated that areas not held by the Khmer Rouge represent about 85 per cent of Cambodia's territory and around 90 per cent of the populace. Officials say this would be sufficient for a new government to win international recognition. Officials who believe there has been progress in Cambodia point to the repatriation of 175,000 Cambodians from Thai border camps. They say most have chosen to return to their villages and that none has been killed despite the danger from land-mines. The target is to re-settle the remaining 100,000 or so before the elections. Mandatory sanctions are unlikely to be agreed because of the misgivings of some governments, including Thailand and France, about the value and effectiveness of sanctions against the Khmer Rouge. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, has recommended to the Security Council tighter immigration controls on Cambodia's eastern border with Vietnam and customs checks on the exportation of lumber and gems on the Thai border. In a report, he dismissed Khmer Rouge claims that Vietnamese troops had infiltrated Cambodia, saying there was no evidence of any formed units of foreign forces with the possible exception of those zones controlled by the Khmer Rouge, to which UNTAC had no access.</p>

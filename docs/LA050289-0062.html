			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Syrian gunners and their Lebanese allies sent rocket and artillery fire arcing  into Christian areas in a fierce new barrage in the capital city of Beirut. At  least three people were killed and four wounded. Fires flared from burning  apartment blocks and cars as shells and projectiles from rocket launchers  thundered across the Christian enclave, witnesses said. The shelling, the  heaviest in 10 days, followed the breaking of an Arab League-mediated truce.  Syrian guns also pounded Christian areas north of Beirut. Druze leader Walid  Jumblatt, whose forces are allied with Syria, demanded that Christians oust  their leader, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, as a condition for peace.  </P></p>

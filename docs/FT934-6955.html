			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Major acts to boost prince's envoy role Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday pledged to improve government co-operation with royal visits to Britain's trade partners. He was said to be 'keen' to do everything possible to assist Prince Charles, whose frustrations over lack of official co-operation were reported in yesterday's Financial Times. 'If it is put to us that there are problems, we will investigate them,' Downing Street said. Embarrassed officials revealed that Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister, will meet Prince Charles soon to discuss how he can help in promoting exports. The officials said the prince's comments - made during his recent tour of the Middle East - had taken ministers by surprise. The government resisted parallels between the prince's dismay and the shabby treatment of royalty in Michael Dobbs' To Play the King, currently on television. Officials said suggestions that the Prince of Wales was being 'frozen out' because of his marital difficulties and veiled criticisms of government policy were 'fiction'. Downing Street said: 'The prime minister is very keen to develop British exports overseas, and as far as that involves using members of the royal family he would be very keen to do that.' Nevertheless, the prince's public expression of his complaints shocked Whitehall, which replied by giving examples of government co-operation with overseas visits by royalty. The prince has tried with little success to encourage UK government departments to take a more strategic approach to his overseas visits, which he feels could be better exploited. His private office has been making fresh attempts recently to improve links with Whitehall, particularly through the DTI, which has launched an ambitious programme of export promotion events. Mr Needham's meeting with the prince is expected to explore ways of ensuring that co-operation between the DTI and the prince is given a higher priority. The DTI said the meeting was planned before the prince's frustrations over lack of government support for his role as a commercial ambassador were reported. However, the prince's office believes the DTI has not understood the full potential of the prince in helping to promote British companies and products overseas.</p>

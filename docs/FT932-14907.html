			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Assisted area map delayed THE GOVERNMENT is delaying until after next month's local elections an announcement on the redrawn assisted-area map that will determine which UK regions qualify for government and European Community aid. The Department of Trade and Industry announcement this month, as previously expected, would break informal Civil Service rules on announcements during local election campaigns. The re-drawing of the map - the first since 1984 - will provoke a political row as parts of inner London and south-east England benefit at the expense of areas in Wales, the Midlands and north-east England. European Community rules mean the total area covered by the map cannot be increased. The plan had to await the outcome of the government's energy review after a promise by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, that some regions hit by coal pit closures would be helped. The Civil Service has tough guidelines on politic-ally sensitive government announcements during general elections.</p>

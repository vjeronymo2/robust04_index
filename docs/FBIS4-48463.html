			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Johan Cuppen: "UNAMIR-II Does Not Solve </F> Rwandan Problems"]    [Text] There is no end in sight to the insanity which has  held Rwanda in its grip for six weeks now. Estimates of the  dead or the endless streams of refugees are so immense that they  exceed human comprehension. Increasingly better informed  sources talk of half a million dead and a couple million  refugees, horrifying figures which are rising every day because  the violence is not stopping and every day brings a new tale of  terror.    Considering this, the UN Security Council resolution  approved  Tuesday [17 May] must be met with a cheer. The resolution  announced an increased UN effort to ease the pain in Rwanda as  well as an international arms embargo against Rwanda. The  United Nations wants to increase its troops in Rwanda from the  current 400 to 5,500 military personnel in the long term.    However, there can be no talk of cheering. The resolution is  unduly late and there is no evidence that it will be implemented  quickly and smoothly. Meanwhile, the unrest continues, taking  new victims every day. The fact that the resolution comes so  late has everything to do with the broad dissension within the  United Nations and with the cumbersome structure of the  organization. The dissension has ensured that the resolution is  just the umpteenth nonbinding statement which the United Nations  and other international institutions seem to have a patent on.    The resolution illustrates the desperation with which the  international community views the carnage in Rwanda. The troops  which the United Nations wants to send to Rwanda will have  little impact on the belligerents because, once again, their  mandate will be very limited. The Belgian Blue Helmets found  out what kind of situations such a limited mandate can lead to  in the first few hours of the violence. The 10 paratroopers  killed remain a bloody accusation against so much UN laxness.  The diplomats in New York have obviously not yet learned this  lesson.    The implementation of the resolution has also proved to be  desperate. It is not only unclear which country will make the  required troops available for UNAMIR-II [UN Assistance Mission  in Rwanda] (the reservations shown by a number of countries  speak volumes), but there is nobody who can say with any  accuracy when the troops will be on the ground there and where  they will be deployed. Nor is it clear who will pay the bill.  In addition, there is the quite clear warning from the Rwandan  Patriotic Front (RPF), which announced that it would treat the  UN Blue Helmets as the enemy if they do not stick strictly to  their humanitarian mandate. That does not bode well. The RPF  attitude raises ever more questions. The military successes  which the RPF has had on the ground have made its leaders so  drunk with victory that the question arises as to whether the  RPF is still negotiating in good faith on the basis of or in the  spirit of the peace agreement reached last year in Arusha with  the then government in Kigali.    Belgian diplomacy still believes in the Arusha agreement, or  at least in "the spirit of Arusha." That is apparent in the  answers given by Foreign Minister Willy Claes yesterday [18 May]  in the Senate in reply to questions put to him. How this  "spirit" is supposed to be interpreted in the light of the  latest developments is no longer clear. For this reason, it is  wise to send Ambassador Johan Swinnen [ambassador in Rwanda] to  the countries neighboring Rwanda in order to assess the new  situation. However, just as important is to bring on board  other countries which in the past played a major role in Rwanda,  especially France, which is charting a bizarre course of its own.</p>

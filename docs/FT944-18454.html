			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Nine groups seek KL airport job Malaysia is considering tenders from nine consortia for one of the key contracts at the new Kuala Lumpur international airport being built on a greenfield site south of Kuala Lumpur. The MDollars 2bn (Dollars 780m) contract for the main terminal and baggage handling system is the largest single works package at the airport. Companies from South Korea, Japan, Germany, France, the US and Saudi Arabia are among those in the various consortia. Malaysian officials say no British companies are involved. At one stage an Anglo-Japanese consortium which included Balfour Beatty, Trafalgar House and GEC had been managing the airport project and seemed likely to win a substantial amount of the construction work. But the consortium was disbanded after Malaysia, angered by critical reports about its leaders in the British press, imposed a ban this year on giving government contracts to British companies. The ban was lifted last month. The new airport, with a total price tag of MDollars 9bn-MDollars 12bn, is at present south-east Asia's biggest infrastructure project.</p>

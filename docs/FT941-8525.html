			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Serbs take heart from Russian intervention: Smiling Milosevic meets Churkin and persuades his people Nato air strikes will be averted A television shot of President Slobodan Milosevic smiling after a meeting with Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian special envoy on Yugoslavia, has done more than anything else to convince Serbs that Nato air strikes will be averted. The Serbian president broke his silence on the Nato ultimatum to send thanks to Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president for 'his help in handling the biggest crisis so far in the peace process and reducing the danger of escalation of hostilities.' Mr Milosevic, facing an increasingly unstable Serbia, largely because of the impact of sanctions, has tried to distance his government from the Sarajevo ultimatum, even refusing an opposition request for a parliamentary debate on the threat of air strikes. Mr Milosevic's position was made more uncomfortable by the fact that his ally, President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, voiced support for the air strikes. Yesterday, however, state-controlled television for the first time carried reports from Sarajevo on withdrawals of heavy weapons by Bosnian Serb forces, in compliance with the ultimatum. The Belgrade daily Politika ran a headline saying: 'The Serbs are withdrawing, the Russians are coming.' The independent weekly Vreme wrote: 'After all these years, we now have the right to a little optimism, based on the hope that the worst will not happen.' Mr Yeltsin's letter, addressed jointly to Mr Milosevic, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and other Serbian officials, asked the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo and lift the siege of the city. The letter also asked the two Serb leaders to reinforce the security zone around Sarajevo and backed the UN plan for demilitarisation of the city. Mr Yeltsin's offer of 400 extra Russian troops to join the UN peacekeeping force in Sarajevo was seen as boosting the chances for achieving peace in the city. The presence in Sarajevo of troops from Russia, traditionally supportive of the Serbs, would 'give the Bosnian Serbs a sense of security from Moslem attack once the heavy weapons are withdrawn,' one analyst said. In Belgrade, the threat of Nato air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs served to divert attention from both a prolonged stalemate over forming a new government and worsening economic problems. Two months of political manoeuvring after an election in which Mr Milosevic's Socialist party was denied an overall parliamentary majority, denting his image as undisputed leader of the Serbs, has failed to produce any result, although some opposition leaders now appear willing to support the Socialists. At the same time, cracks in the Socialists' new economic programme are appearing, with a shortage of new dinars now evident. Following strike threats earlier this week by 12,000 Belgrade metal workers, the government has decided to resume subsidising production at the plant, reviving fears that a heavy bout of inflation will soon return.

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Finland (10): Pulp and paper near peak - Nobody cares if the country relies on its forests when things go well The fortunes of the Finnish economy are inextricably linked to the health of the country's pulp and paper sector. It is no accident that both are pulling strongly out of a slump at the same time. Forestry accounts for 36 per cent of Finnish exports and its success has done much to promote the country's export-driven revival over the past two years. This overdependence on one industry is widely acknowledged but critics find it harder to make their case when things are going well. And, right now, things are going well. In 1994 the Finnish pulp and paper sector will produce total profits of about FM5bn - a massive improvement on last year's break-even level. At the eight-month stage the country's four big quoted forestry groups, Repola, Kymmene, Enso-Gutzeit and Metsa-Serla, produced combined pre-tax profits of FM2.9bn, compared with a loss of FM64m in the same 1993 period. Although combined operating profits at FM5.52bn were higher than FM4.49bn in 1993, the major component of the improvement has been a reduction in financial costs. Debts are lower, average interest rates are down, and there have not been any big currency losses. At the operating level, a number of conflicting influences are at work. On the positive side, demand has risen strongly, driving up operating rates, and prices are increasing across all product lines. On the negative side, there has been a significant strengthening of the markka and wood and waste paper costs have risen sharply. Pulp and fine paper producers will undoubtedly benefit, with pulp prices up 80 per cent and fine paper prices around 50 per cent higher. But in other product lines - publication papers, for example - the stronger markka and higher costs will outweigh the impact of increased demand and prices, leaving earnings in markka terms lower than in 1993. Even so, there is no doubt that the pulp and paper sector is on the way to its next cyclical peak. Finland with its modern machines, its value-added emphasis, its stringent cost-cutting during the downturn and its still weak currency, is well positioned to benefit. Mr Jarl Kohler, head of the Finnish forest industries federation, cautions against over-optimism, saying profits this year will still fall short of the FM7bn level which he calls 'normal'. Past experience shows that gains can easily be squandered, he warns. It is a question both of costs and strategy. Can companies keep wood costs down? Can they keep wages down? Will they restrict investment? The 1991-92 downturn in the Finnish forestry sector was undoubtedly exacerbated by a huge corporate investment spree in the late 1980s which drove debt up sharply. Companies invested as much as 20 per cent of their annual turnover to create the world's biggest and most modern paper and board machines. When the markka fell by 30 per cent between 1991 and 1993, the cost of servicing the foreign portion of the debt rose sharply. The situation is improving rapidly due to consolidation, increased cash flow and reduced investment. But debt as a percentage of turnover is still around 75 per cent - down from a peak of 110 per cent but still higher than rivals in Canada and Sweden. 'The Finnish companies' most important task is to get their capital structure in a better condition. Debts must be paid back,' says Professor Eero Artto of the Helsinki School of Economics. However, it remains to be seen whether the big companies have learned their lesson. Ironically, the late 1980s investment programmes, widely castigated as over-ambitious at the bottom of the cycle, are now giving the Finns a real competitive advantage. Will they be tempted to go on another binge? So far, the signs are encouraging. Most current investment programmes involve upgrading and are designed to ease bottlenecks and add value rather than increase capacity. A significant exception is a FM3bn project to build a new pulp mill at Rauma in the west of the country. In any case the constraints will be greater. Greater levels of foreign ownership mean company strategies are being viewed more critically, says Mr Jukka Huuskonen, a forestry analysts with Protos Securities. He believes EU membership will force companies to keep costs under control to remain competitive. In the longer term, EU membership will take Finland along the path to monetary union so it will be unable to devalue its currency (as it has in the past) simply to rescue its forestry sector. There is, on the other hand, a strong chance that expansion will come through acquisition rather than investment. Enso-Gutzeit has just agreed to buy a 35 per cent stake in Veitsiluoto, the country's fifth largest pulp and paper group, for FM1.5bn, in a move which significantly strengthens its operations in fine papers and light-weight coated (LWC) magazine paper. The move in effect involves a switching of assets between one arm of the state and another as the state owns 91 per cent of Veitsiluoto and 52 per cent of the votes in Enso. Logic suggests Enso will acquire the state's remaining stake in Veitsiluoto as and when the government decides to sell. A much bigger merger involving Finland's two biggest forestry groups, United Paper Mills (the main unit in Repola) and Kymmene, was almost clinched during the summer. This would have created a company as big as Stora, the Swedish group which is currently Europe's largest pulp and paper producer. The plan is understood to have foundered because Kymmene's main owners were unhappy with the valuation placed on the company. Rumours have since circulated that the deal might be revived, although there have also been suggestions that the two companies are seeking other partners. A big question will be whether Finnish groups seek to expand at home or abroad. Already 26 per cent of the forestry industry's production capacity is based abroad - most of it in Europe near the big markets and sources of recycled material. There was always a danger that more investments would have been directed towards Europe if the country had voted to stay outside the EU.</p>

It also vigorously and  categorically denies reports irresponsibly disseminated by  Guatemalan Army spokespersons trying to use this situation to  implicate the URNG and create an unfavorable climate at a time  when, under a call from the United Nations, preliminary peace  talks will be resumed with the Guatemalan Government and Army in  Mexico on 6 January.    The URNG has been, is, and will be respectful of Mexico's  sovereignty. Therefore, our forces have no responsibility in  these types of events.    [Signed] URNG    [Dated] 3 January 1994</p>

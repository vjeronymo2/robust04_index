			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar trades in tight ranges THE DOLLAR traded in tight ranges against the D-Mark yesterday as conflicting economic data was issued in the US, writes James Blitz. The US currency could have been adversely affected by the figure for US GDP in the second quarter, which came in at a 1.4 per cent rise when 1.7 per cent had been expected. However, this figure was outweighed by an upward revised figure for first quarter GDP of 2.9 per cent from 2.7 per cent. Other indicators also kept the dollar above its lows. These included new home sales, which were up 7.9 per cent to 572,000 units in June, while the May figure was revised to a 0.9 per cent decline from the 5.6 per cent fall originally reported. Jobless claims for the week to July 18 slipped by 21,000 from the 420,000 reported the week before, reviving hopes that next week's monthly employment report will show a rebound. The data kept the dollar trading in tight ranges between DM1.4805 and DM1.4920, before closing at DM1.4820, down from a previous DM1.4840. In New York it finished lower at DM1.4767. The dollar's performance underlined the view of those who believe that the currency is destined for a long period of range trading following the recent central bank intervention. Dealers are unwilling to have their fingers burned again by the central banks if they push the dollar lower, while the differential between US and German interest rates makes it too expensive to be long of dollars. A number of chartists also believe that DM1.49 is roughly where the dollar now lies on a trend line drawn since it started to drop in April. On the European crosses, the Italian lira was again the centre of attention following the resignation of Mr Vincenzo Scotti as the country's foreign minister. Although he has no direct impact on economic policy, his resignation signalled a new crisis among the Christian Democrats, the biggest party in the coalition government. The lira came under pressure in the morning, falling to L757 against the D-Mark from a previous close of L755.4. It later recovered, however, to end at L755.5. The markets have clearly been impressed by the Italian parliament's decision earlier in the week to pass a much reduced budget programme. Other European currencies were mostly unchanged. Sterling eased to DM2.8430 from a previous finish of DM2.8450, hindered by dollar weakness. The French franc shrugged off disappointing unemployment data for June, with the seasonally adjusted figure rising by 12,100 to 2,924,700. The fundamental features of the French economy are strong, however, and the D-Mark softened to FFr3.377 from a previous close of FFr3.378.</p>

			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Spain prepares for austerity budget SPAIN'S minority socialist government will this week present to parliament the country's most restrictive budget in a decade, in a clear signal to the trades unions that efforts to trim the state's runaway deficits are being given priority over any quick fixes for Spain's record number of unemployed. The cabinet approved the draft 1994 budget at the weekend and officials were later insisting, despite scepticism from the opposition, that it was not alterable. This means that, after three weeks of fruitless talking to the unions on the terms of a 'social pact' - an effort to develop a common front on pulling the country out of recession - the government has had to impose a series of budgetary targets it had initially hoped to reach by negotiation. Officials say three measures being negotiated with the unions - a freeze in civil service pay for 1994, a limit of 3.5 per cent in state pension increases for next year and cuts in the budget of the employment benefits - are now set in stone. Almost Pta300bn (Pounds 1.52bn) has been trimmed from Inem, the national employment institute which funds benefits. The unions, which last year called an unsuccessful strike in protest at earlier cuts in benefits, appear to have miscalculated again. 'The unions only hear what they want to hear,' said Mr Pedro Solbes, the finance minister, after Friday's cabinet meeting. 'We have been telling them since August that we had until now, today, to solve our deficit problems.' Nevertheless the government hopes to resume taking to the unions, and employers, early next week about a wider pay agreement. Madrid is looking for a three-year wage moderation pact (under which employers would restrict dividend payments and raise investment) crucial to the credibility of the recovery programme it is trying to construct. These broader talks will be made more difficult by the budget and the realisation by the unions that they may have been outsmarted. 'The unions thought that if they promised to talk to us later about a global (private and public sector) wages deal, we would be prepared to give way on pension, benefits and the civil service freeze in the budget,' said a senior Finance Ministry official. 'But we were saying the opposite. If we go on now and get a global three-year agreement to moderate wages by the end of November, we are saying that we may ease some of our criteria. But only after 1994.' On the surface at least, the government is being uncommonly tough. Once the budget is presented, the upper and lower houses of parliament have until the end of the year to debate it and sceptics will be watching not the unions but the Catalan party, the CiU, to dent the government fiscal resolve. Mr Gonzalez needs CiU support to pass the budget but the Catalans are balking. Primarily, the Catalans want agreement from Madrid that 15 per cent of the income tax raised by the central government should be given to the government of the region in which it was raised. Madrid agrees but there are arguments about how. Poor regions claim Catalonia will become progressively richer. The CiU, not without cause, worries about the speed at which Madrid would implement this new system. In reality the CiU should have little problem supporting the budget. Mr Solbes has tried to present a more realistic set of targets than had become common under his more ebullient predecessor, Mr Carlos Solchaga, even though his 1994 growth forecast of 1.3 per cent may look optimistic after an expected decline in GDP this year of 0.8 per cent. Even at 1.3 per cent growth, though, Spain will not create jobs. Mr Solbes has also committed himself to an annual inflation target of 3.5 per cent for next year though this probably had more to do with fixing next year's pension increases to the expected rate of inflation than to what is seriously achievable. The government is being very cautious on how quickly it can draw down its deficits. Mr Solchaga had planned a central government deficit (the social security system included) of 3 per cent of GDP for 1993. Mr Solbes said it would turn out closer to 6.2 per cent and his target for 1994 is 5.7 per cent. By last August the central deficit was Pta1,000bn higher than planned. Conservative new targets will appeal to the CiU, who are also likely to be attracted by an annex to the budget containing a slew of tax breaks designed to help small businesses and stimulate industrial activity. CiU support comes from small business and the party could anger its grass roots if, in the end, it were not to come in behind Mr Gonzalez and give him his budget. That would leave only the unions on the outside. Government officials know they cannot force private employers to moderate pay but warn that, in the absence of a wages pact, they will punish overgenerous employers. Officials do, however, say they have the power to implement a series of labour market reforms which are to be negotiated along with the global wages deal from next week. The more reluctant the unions are to commit themselves to pay restraint, the tougher the labour market reforms will be.</p>

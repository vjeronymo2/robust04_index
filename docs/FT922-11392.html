			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Motoring: Banning bangers LIFE WILL become tougher for motorists who drive cars unfit to be on the road when a proposal by the Department of Transport comes into effect later this year. At the moment, so long as a car three or more years old passes its annual inspection (the MoT test), it can be taxed, insured and driven for another 12 months. What if it deteriorates and becomes unsafe during that period? In theory it should be repaired. In practice, many old cars in poor shape continue to be driven while they remain driveable. The police will prosecute if the car is involved in an accident or if the driver is stopped for a traffic offence and they find it has, say, illegally worn tyres or bad brakes. But, rightly or wrongly, many owners of decrepit old cars think a current MoT certificate is a permit to keep on driving them until the next MoT inspection falls due. If they break down, they call one of the long-suffering rescue services - the subscription is seen as a financially attractive alternative to having the car properly maintained. The department is planning to treat cars in the same way as heavy commercial vehicles. If one of its examiners at a roadside checkpoint finds a lorry in bad enough condition to be a danger to other road users, the driver is handed a prohibition notice. That means it has to be repaired on the spot or towed away by a recovery vehicle. Now the department proposes to treat cars and lorries alike. An old banger held to be dangerous will be banned immediately and have to be taken to a repair garage on a trailer. In less serious cases, the owner will be allowed to drive it to a garage. The prohibition notice stays in force until the car has been made roadworthy, given an MoT test and the owner has taken the certificate to a police station. The proposal is going through the usual consultative process on how it can be implemented. When it becomes law on July 1, it will help road safety. As a spin-off, roadside spot checks should catch a lot of irresponsible motorists who reckon the rules about taxing and insuring cars only apply to other people.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- The National Alliance  for Democracy and Reunification in South Korea issued a  statement denouncing the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique's  suppression of the South Korean Federation of General Student  Councils (Hanchongnyon), a South Korean newspaper reported.    The statement said the suppression of Hanchongnyon angers  the  people as it is an anti-national act.    The inaugural ceremony of the second-term Hanchongnyon as a  reasonable independent mass organisation was a very legitimate  meeting, said the statement, adding that the invocation of the  "National Security Law" charging Hanchongnyon with the "tendency  toward benefiting the enemy" is an open suppression to stifle  Hanchongnyon.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: DISCUSS WEALTH WITH CHILDREN  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My husband, and the father of my children, grew up in  terrible poverty. He's now a wealthy man, but he never discusses money on the  grounds that he wants to protect our two children from ever having to worry  about it the way he did. Our son and daughter are about to become adults and  they still have no idea of the concept of work. I believe this is important  even though both will inherit enough to live on.  </P> <P>  -- N.J.  </P> <P> DEAR N.J.: I think teen-agers, and certainly adults, need to know what it is to  hold a job. When they don't have this experience they're robbed of a source of  self-esteem that can never come from simply having others present you with  money, gifts and all the necessities of life.  </P> <P> People don't work only for money. They work because through work they gain a  sense of competence and of identity. Children need to experience firsthand the  frustrations, challenges and setbacks that they meet in the work force. If  they're protected from all of this, the moment life gets rough, they're apt to  give up or try to buy their way out of the problem.  </P> <P> John Levy of Inherited Wealth Consultants, an organization in San Francisco,  warns parents to talk about family money and how it was made. If the wealth and  its eventual transmission to the children is dealt with covertly, he warns that  children are apt to see it as something dark and shameful and themselves as not  trusted.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My wife and I are both in our 60s and at our recent physical  we were told by our family doctor that we'd profit in many ways if we started a  physical fitness program. What surprised me was that he mentioned this after we  confessed we were concerned because of our loss of interest in sex.  </P> <P>  -- O.F.  </P> <P> DEAR O.F.: Many people who lose interest in sex in their late 50s and 60s do so  because they're buying into old stereotypes of aging. They feel they're getting  old and have been told that older people aren't very interested in sex. This is  a myth. What happens is that when older people get out of shape, when they let  their bodies become flabby, they begin to lose self-esteem, which is a vital  ingredient in sex. If a person feels ugly, he or she is much less apt to want  to make love.  </P> <P> Regular exercise can improve one's sex life. In a study, Harvard anthropologist  and sociologist Phillip Whitten and his research associate Elizabeth Whiteside  found that swimmers who trained about an hour a day, four or five days a week  were much more sexually active than would normally be expected for people in  their age bracket.  </P></p>

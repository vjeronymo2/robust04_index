			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Slow Christmas trade makes retailers shiver: Sales should rise but margins are in doubt Wednesday's rise in interest rates was another blow to a retail trade already feeling jittery about prospects for the busiest shopping period of the year. With sales of winter clothing hit by the warm weather in October and November, and other sectors reporting a slow start to Christmas, stores groups were concerned that the rate rise could damage fragile consumer confidence. The importance of Christmas to retailers cannot be overstated. Some retailers see 50 per cent of annual turnover in the three months from November to January and - with fixed costs spread over the year - up to 90 per cent of annual profits. Marks and Spencer, the clothing and food chain, said: 'The biggest proportion of our profits are made at Christmas. Our food market share all but doubles in the six weeks to Christmas. It's the time when people traditionally flock to us.' Back in September the outlook for Christmas seemed bright. A survey of stores groups by retail analysts at Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, found several experiencing strong reactions to their Christmas ranges and gifts - a month earlier than usual. Most believed this showed an underlying improvement in consumer confidence. The next two months, however, were patchy. Mr Grenville Peacock, chief executive of Bentalls, the south-east department stores, said: 'Business in general was a bit flat in October and November. But things picked up a bit again at the start of this month.' Part of the reason for lacklustre sales was the mild weather, causing many consumers to postpone buying winter coats and woollens, with a knock-on effect on other purchases. Mr Tim Daniels, president of London's Oxford Street Association, cites one retail chain which sold 30,000 pairs of gloves in a week in November last year, but only 3,000 in the equivalent week this year. Meanwhile, John Lewis Partnership reported sales of winter coats in the third week of November were down from last year in all its 22 department stores, by between 2.5 per cent and 30 per cent. Clothing shops hope to recoup some lost sales provided there is a cold spell soon. But with Christmas fast approaching many are nervous of being left with excess stock that would have to be marked down to clear in the new year sales - cutting profits. The temptation is to cut prices now, to encourage sales before Christmas and reduce markdowns in January. A stroll around London's Bond Street suggests some independent retailers and specialist chains are already doing so. At least one chain is rumoured to be toying with the idea. One department store group said: 'Our fear is that someone will be panicked into breaking ranks and launching a pre-Christmas sale. Then everyone follows suit and loses the benefit of selling at full margin when demand should be at its highest.' Other sectors are performing better. Toy retailers report healthy demand. Mr Stephen Woodbridge, managing director of Hamleys, said: 'Judging by the supply problems our suppliers are having, toys are selling well everywhere.' John Lewis has reported encouraging sales of some household goods, as well as furnishing accessories and furniture. The reality is that, in spite of the interest rate rise, this Christmas is almost certain to be better than last. The question is by how much, and how much of the sales will be at full margin. In today's low-inflation environment no one expects the double-digit sales increases common in the late 1980s. Mr Hugh Clark, trading policy director of the British Retail Consortium, the industry body, said: 'In no month in the last two years have retail sales been down year on year, either by value or volume. But they have only been modestly up.' Year-on-year increases in monthly sales have varied between 3.5 per cent and 4.6 per cent this year, and there is no reason why December should mark a strong break with the underlying trend. John Lewis forecast an increase of 4.7 per cent in total group sales in its second half-year, including the Christmas period. With 17 weeks gone, cumulative sales growth is ahead of its forecast, at 5.8 per cent, in spite of the problems with clothing. Furthermore, many retailers believe the trend in recent years has been for consumers to start Christmas shopping later. That tendency may have been heightened this year by the fact that Christmas day is a Sunday, at the end of a full trading week. Move over, mutant turtles, Page 9</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts advance despite weakness of sterling THE UK government bond market advanced in the face of the country's deepening economic gloom yesterday, even though sterling slipped to below DM2.46 by the end of the day. Figures for September showed unemployment at its highest for five years, while this week's announcement of job cuts in the coal industry and renewed fears about the the European fighter aircraft project look set to increase the pressure on jobs. The gilt market's reaction was relatively modest, though, given the severity of the latest economic signals. 'Under normal circumstances, people buy bonds at times like this and keep buying,' said Mr Chris Anthony,of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Investors continued to hold back because they were waiting for firmer indications of the future direction of UK economic policy, he said. Although the government continued to hold back from an expected rate cut, the market continued to discount such a move. Gilts rose across the maturity spectrum, with gains of  1/2 to  2/3 of a point. On Liffe, the long gilt futures contract jumped almost a point to end the day at 97 23/32 , though trading volume was moderate at around 30,000 contracts. EUROPEAN bond markets remained subdued yesterday as the latest Bundesbank council meeting passed without any further cuts in German interest rates. Nor were the markets enlivened by the prospect of the summit of European leaders, starting in Birmingham today. With ministers around the EC having ruled out significant discussions about the future of the exchange rate mechanism, traders sensed little prospect of any agreements which would reawaken European bond market convergence. German government bonds ended the day firmer despite the lack of any Bundesbank move on interest rates, with gains once again concentrated among longer-dated bonds. The bund futures contract on Liffe rose from its opening of 90.97 to end the day at 91.16, while the Euromark contract ended where it had begun the day, at 91.64. Norway will today announce the longest bond issue in more than a decade. Analysts expect the 10-year issue to raise between NKr7bn and NKr10bn with the funds earmarked for budget deficit financing. AFTER a firm opening, US Treasury prices traded slightly lower late yesterday in the wake of some mixed economic news. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/32 at 97, yielding 7.494 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged at 100, yielding 3.982 per cent. The bearish news for bonds was the 16,000 decline in weekly state unemployment insurance claims. The data disappointed bond investors, who sold Treasuries on the news. Prices picked up later on three sets of bullish data. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve reported a drop in its index of regional business activity in September, an ABC/Money magazine measurement of consumer confidence fell for the second straight week, and the government reported a 0.2 per cent increase in consumer prices last month, a figure that was better than the market had anticipated.</p>

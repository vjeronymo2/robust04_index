			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Pact curbs shipbuilding subsidies The world's leading shipbuilding countries yesterday signed a pact to end the subsidising of large vessels and adopt international trade rules by January 1 1996. After five years of negotiation, the industries agreed to eliminate both direct and indirect subsidies, to create common rules for domestic and export credit financing of ships, and to establish a strong enforcement mechanism to discourage violations of rules. The pact was signed in Paris by Japan, South Korea, Norway, the EU and the US. It also extends to shipbuilding the protection of anti-dumping regimes, which US shipbuilders said would raise ship prices to 'more realistic levels'. Mr Thomas Jones, chairman of the US shipbuilders council, yesterday applauded the agreement. 'Foreign governments have been in a subsidy competition to assist their shipyards to capture market share.' Without the pact 'this situation would continue and even escalate, thereby perpetuating the competitive disadvantage of unsubsidised US shipyards. He called on the Clinton administration to 'actively oppose' the introduction of new subsidies which would violate the agreement - specifically, subsidies for French shipyards 'as reported in the press'. The shipbuilding pact was provisionally agreed in July but opposed by the French for months.</p>

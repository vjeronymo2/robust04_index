			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (6) Several commenters stated that the rule was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complex and difficult to understand. They stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional guidance should be provided, particularly for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small businesses. The EPA agrees that guidance would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> helpful and has developed a brochure summarizing the rule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and will be developing a guidance manual that is scheduled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for publication in January 1995. This guidance manual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes a detailed summary of the rule, example forms that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be used for reporting and recordkeeping, and additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance for evaluating alternative cleaning technologies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Several commenters recommended that the EPA reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the monitoring frequency of the emission control equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA evaluated the monitoring frequencies and has added a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision to the final rule that allows the hoist monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequency to decrease from monthly to quarterly if, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner or operator has operated the hoist for one year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without an exceedance in the hoist speed. The EPA has also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changed the reduced room draft (RRD) monitoring frequency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from weekly to quarterly with weekly monitoring of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameters used to obtain the RRD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Several comments were received on the batch cold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleaning machine equipment requirement provisions. A number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of commenters reported the use of TCA, MC, and TCE in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncarburetor batch cold cleaning machine operations. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters stated that the proposed water layer control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option was not always possible for these cleaning machines,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly when TCA or TCE solvents are used. In order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address this issue, alternative control equipment options  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were added to the final rule to allow for the use of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased freeboard ratio and cover, or remote-reservoir and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cover, in lieu of a water layer and cover. An owner or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator complying with these alternative options must also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply with work practice requirements. The final rule also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allows an owner or operator of a batch cold cleaning machine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to use alternative control equipment, if demonstrated to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent to the equipment requirements cited in the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule and approved by the Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Administrative Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Docket  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The docket is an organized and complete file of all the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information considered by the EPA in the development of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking. The docket is a dynamic file, since material is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> added throughout the rulemaking development. The docketing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system is intended to allow members of the public and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industries involved to readily identify and locate documents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> so that they can effectively participate in the rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process. Along with the statement of basis and purpose of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed and promulgated standards and the EPA responses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to significant comments, the contents of the docket will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serve as the record in case of judicial review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (section 307(d)(7)(A)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Information collection requirements associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this regulation (those included in 40 CFR Part 63, Subpart A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Subpart T) have been approved by the Office of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been assigned OMB control number (2060&hyph;0273). An  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information Collection Request (ICR) document has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepared by the EPA (ICR No. 1652.02) to reflect the changed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information requirements of the final rule and has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted to OMB for review. A copy may be obtained from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch, EPA 2136,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 401 M St., SW, Washington, DC 20460, or by calling (202)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 260&hyph;2740.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The annual respondent burden and costs averaged over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the first 3 years for batch vapor and in-line cleaning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> machine subcategories are 359,000 hours and $12.0 million.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the reporting burden for some of the required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities will be incurred only once, the average annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burden for batch vapor and in-line cleaning machine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subcategories will decrease after the first two years of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation. For the batch cold cleaning machine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subcategory, the annual respondent burden and costs averaged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over the first 3 years are 33,000 hours and $1.1 million.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The batch cold cleaning machine subcategory is not expected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to incur costs after the initial activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This collection of information is estimated to have an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual public reporting and recordkeeping burden averaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 42 hours per facility over the first 3 years. These burden  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates include time for reviewing instructions, searching  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

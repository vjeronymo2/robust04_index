			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Taxman set to drive a hard bargain: The Inland Revenue's proposals for company cars THE Inland Revenue says some 1.2m drivers would benefit under its proposals to restructure company car taxation - but the 700,000 losers would face higher tax demands running to thousands of pounds a year in some cases. The Revenue emphasised yesterday that the proposals were only the start of a 3 1/2 -month consultative process. It can expect to be inundated, for the issue is important for manufacturers, which make nearly a third of sales to business users, and for the government, which receives Pounds 1.4bn annually in income tax from the company car benefit scale charges, as well as for the nearly 2m company car users. The proposals aim to make fairer what is essentially a crude banding system, unchanged in all essentials since it was introduced 16 years ago. But they are also intended to take account of criticisms, including some by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, that the combined price and engine capacity thresholds of the company car taxation system distort the market, obliging manufacturers to produce 'tax break specials' causing market bunching and potentially putting specialist manufacturers such as Jaguar at a disadvantage. There are about 1,200 car models available in the UK, but the present scale system divides them into only five categories, using both price and engine size. That means, to use the Revenue's own example, that the driver of a sub-Pounds 9,000 Ford Fiesta diesel pays the same as the driver of a Pounds 19,000 BMW 520i if their business mileages are similar. The Revenue says its proposals to base the tax charge mainly on price is fairer and more easily understood than the present system. The Revenue has resisted pressure to abandon banding in favour of basing the scale charge on a percentage of the list price of the car. The Revenue wished to avoid the need for individual tax calculations and PAYE recodings each time a car is changed. The Revenue is proposing 12 price bands, each higher band covering a successively wider range of car prices. The advantage seen in such a structure is that it would be sensitive in the Pounds 10,000-Pounds 19,500 region where company cars are concentrated. Business car buyers will have to wait until the final scheme is set out in next year's Budget for the exact detail. But to generate the same revenue yield as the present system, the document indicates a scale representing two ninths of a car's value for drivers covering 2,500-18,000 business miles a year; one third for low-mileage (below 2,500 miles) users and only one ninth for those covering more than 18,000 business miles a year. The document proposes no changes to the business mileage bands. The effects of the change are likely to be uneven. The Revenue says more than half of the 750,000 company car drivers in the existing 1.4 litre to 2 litre engine band would gain modestly, most with a tax charge cut by about 10 per cent, and about 70,000 drivers of most basic cars by up to 25 per cent. But even the Revenue acknowledges that better-equipped saloons in the Pounds 12,500-Pounds 16,000 range would attract increases of more than 10 per cent, affecting an estimated 360,000 drivers. The typical middle-ranking executive, driving a high-specification car of just under 2 litres and just under the present Pounds 19,250 threshold, would be among those worst affected, facing a typical increase in tax of about 40 per cent. Cars now costing between Pounds 19,250 and Pounds 29,000 would be split into two bands. The 60,000 cars in the lower half of the current band would have the tax charge cut by 15 per cent on average; those costing more than Pounds 24,500 - involving about 20,000 cars - would be modest losers. For the most expensive cars, priced now at more than Pounds 29,000, those at the bottom of the range - up to Pounds 39,000 - would have a tax charge reduced by more than 30 per cent, a benefit to companies such as Jaguar. Above Pounds 39,000, the tax charge would rise, by 35 per cent for cars costing between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 60,000. Mr Brian Friedman, managing director of Stoy Benefit Consulting, said the system 'will inevitably hit senior executives driving the most expensive cars'. He suggested that, since many of these drivers were user-choosers, 'the logical result will be a general downsizing of company cars'. The scheme also aims to minimise incentives to drive thirsty cars. And while there are no specific provisions to encourage economical diesel cars, they will be encouraged indirectly by the proposals. Diesel cars need larger engines than petrol equivalents in order to have acceptable power and are therefore often put into a higher band under the present scale structure. A price-only band would end such discrimination, as well as tending in general to favour cheaper - and generally more fuel-efficient - cars. There is a strong administrative argument for the Revenue's proposals: whereas the whole business car sector usually waits on tenterhooks each Budget to see what changes in scale charges are announced, a multi-band price system would be broadly self-correcting and require no Budgetary attention. Cars would simply drift up through the price bands, depending on inflation.</p>

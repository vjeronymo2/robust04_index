			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Bonn (DPA) -- German Economic Affairs Minister  Guenter Rexrodt believes the economic recession in Germany is  over. He said today when presenting the 1994 annual economic  report, which had been approved beforehand at a cabinet meeting  chaired by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, that there would be no boom,  but modest growth. The government is expecting the German  economy to grow this year by 1-1.5 percent. It shrank by 1.3  percent in 1993.    The major economic associations are skeptical as to whether  the economic growth expected by the government can be achieved.  The Federal Association of German Industry said there was no  discernible sign yet of the rapid climb out of the economic  trough which this would require. The German Association of  Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHT) said the report  featured a degree of confidence that was not yet reflected in  corporate investment.    The German Salaried Employee Union (DAG) said the  government's savings policy was snuffing out the beginnings of  economic recovery. The German Trade Union Federation (DGB)  accused the government of inactivity in the face of high  unemployment. [passage omitted]</p>

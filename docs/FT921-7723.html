			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Three gunmen killed in town of Senaki Three gunmen were killed after they opened fire on a lorry full of Commonwealth airmen from an air force base at the town of Senaki in western Georgia, Reuter reports from Moscow yesterday. Itar-Tass news agency said the gunmen blocked the lorry's path with Zhiguli passenger cars and began shooting. One of them tried to throw a grenade at the soldiers. 'The bandits were killed by the return fire of the aviators,' Tass said. Crime and terror attacks have increased in western Georgia since nationalist President Zviad Gamsakhurdia was overthrown in early January. Mr Gamsakhurdia, charged by opponents with trying to set up a dictatorship, fled to Armenia but later resurfaced briefly in western Georgia to rally support for a return to power. He demanded the immediate withdrawl of all former Soviet armed forces.</p>

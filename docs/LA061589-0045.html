			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A House Ways and Means subcommittee voted to increase the amount that Social  Security recipients may earn without losing part of their benefits. The  proposal was added to a package of amendments that includes a provision  removing the Social Security Administration from the Department of Health and  Human Services. The administration would be directed by a three-member board  appointed by the President and run by an executive director named by the board.  Currently, a person age 65 through 69 may earn up to $8,880 without losing a  part of the Social Security pension. Under the subcommittee's bill, the  limitation for those between 65 and 69 would increase next year to about $9,720  and the following year to about $10,440.  </P></p>

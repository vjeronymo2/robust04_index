			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ihar Sinyakevich: "Election Campaign Will Begin </F> on 15 April"]    [Text] "The election of the first Belarusian president  will be held on the summary basis," said Central Electoral  Commission Chairman Alyaksandr Abramovich at a press conference  on 6 April. In his words, the Law on Presidential Elections  provides for accelerated procedures when the presidential seat  becomes vacant before the scheduled time. It says nothing about  electing the first president. This is why the commission  adopted a resolution setting specific dates for the beginning  and end of the various stages of the election campaign.    The campaign will begin on 15 April, with the registration  stage for initiating groups -- which will end on 24 April -- to  put forward their presidential candidates. Within this period  of time, the commission has to complete registration of those  groups, distribute lists of the established form for collecting  signatures of citizens or parliamentary deputies, and provide  identification cards to members of initiating groups. A.  Abramovich emphasized that only initiating group members can  collect signatures, which should be done exclusively with lists  of the established form. "This is necessary to prevent certain  people from beginning to collect signatures ahead of time," the  commission chairman said. "We have unconfirmed evidence that  some of the candidates have already gathered the required number  of signatures, which will not count. This is nothing more than  practice."    Citizens' signatures will be collected between 25 April and  14 May. According to the law, every citizen has the right to  support several candidates, but can only sign once for each of  them. As the commission members noted, in addition to personal  signatures, the lists must include the following information:  full name, home address, number of passport or other  identification document. The lists should then be passed on to  polling electoral commissions no later than 15 May. "The  experience we acquired during the referendum shows that  signatures should be verified at the polling station level," A.  Abramovich said.    Presidential candidates will be registered from 27 May to 2  June. In the words of A. Abramovich, the collection of  signatures from parliamentary deputies may drag on until the  beginning of the registration drive.    After the registration, all candidates will receive 20  million rubles [R] for campaigning and an additional R10 million  for aides' salaries. The commission representatives stressed  that according to the Electoral Law, the state is responsible  for financing the election; the use of any additional funds is  prohibited.    In the words of A. Abramovich, the registered parties and  movements can propose their candidates for electoral  commissions. However, those commissions will be set up by the  executive committees at their discretion.    The presidential elections will be held on 23 June.</p>

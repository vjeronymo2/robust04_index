			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / International Company News: TWA hopes to meet deadline TRANS World Airlines, the bankrupt and heavily-indebted US carrier, hopes to be able to produce a reorganisation plan before February 17 - the extension date for a reorganisation plan filing requested from the bankruptcy court. This will be the next step in the carrier's attempted revival, following the departure on Friday of Mr Carl Icahn, the one-time corporate raider who gained control of TWA in 1986. Mr Icahn agreed to relinquish all interest and control in the airline last year, as part of a complex pact between TWA's unions, creditors and the federal agency which ultimately underpins the airline's underfunded pension plans. On Friday, he formally resigned as chairman, placing his stock in escrow. Remaining members of TWA's board - four people, including Mr Icahn - also resigned. Under the envisaged reorganisation plan, creditors will hold 55 per cent of the restructured airline's shares and labour representatives, the remaining 45 per cent. Until that plan is approved by the bankruptcy court, ultimate responsibility for running the airline rests with a two-man mangement committee, appointed by unions and creditors, but a new board will be formed after reorganisation. Although Mr Icahn took large share stakes in many companies during the 1980s, TWA is one of the few that he ended up owning. He more than recouped the cost of his TWA share stake purchase when he conducted a leveraged buy-out of the airline, with financing from Drexel Burnham Lambert. However, the heavy debt burden assumed by the carrier, coupled with the tough airline industry climate, has caused TWA to make large losses throughout the 1990s.</p>

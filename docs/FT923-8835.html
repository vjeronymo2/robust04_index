			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Russia agrees to talks on troops in Moldova Russia agreed yesterday to discuss the future of former Soviet troops in Moldova, another step toward securing peace in the tiny republic's breakaway Trans Dnestr region, Reuter reports from Moscow. Moldova has repeatedly accused troops under Russian command of taking the side of Slav insurgents in fighting against Romanian-speaking Moldovan forces. A joint Moldovan-Russian peace-keeping force moved into the region last month, part of growing efforts by former Soviet republics to quell ethnic unrest, and the area has since been reported quiet.</p>

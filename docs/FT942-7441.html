			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Suzuki sales suffer at home and abroad Weak export markets, particularly in Europe, and low demand for motorcycles in Japan were behind a 10 per cent drop in pre-tax profits in the year to end-March to Y18.4bn (Dollars 176.24m) from Y20.5bn last time at Suzuki, the car and motorcycle manufacturer. Suzuki, which specialises in smaller cars, reported a 4 per cent decline in sales to Y1,009bn from Y1,053bn. Net profits declined 12 per cent to Y7bn from Y8bn. The yen's appreciation was a large factor behind the deterioration in overseas revenues which fell by Y12.5bn, Suzuki said. Suzuki took an appraisal loss of Y2.3bn for its stake in Santana Motor, its ailing Spanish subsidiary which stopped production in March. The company is still in negotiations with the Spanish government over Santana's fate, Suzuki said. Motorcycle sales were depressed particularly in Japan while demand in Latin America and China was firm. In contrast, passenger car sales held up well in the domestic market while exports, particularly to Europe, were weak. The company expects sales in the current year to remain flat at about Y1,000bn and pre-tax profits to fall to Y18bn amid continuing pressures from the high yen. It also foresees motorcycle and car sales declining further in unit terms and warns that its financial balance sheet is likely to deteriorate as a result of its need to refinance outstanding debt issues. Hino Motors, the Japanese truck and bus manufacturer, yesterday reported a sharp fall in parent company profits due to the continuing slump in the Japanese economy and the impact of the strong yen. Sales in the year to the end of March fell 15 per cent to Y535.5bn from Y632.3bn while pre-tax profits declined 33 per cent to Y4bn from a previous Y6bn. Domestic sales of trucks were particularly hard hit, falling 15 per cent, while exports were down 3 per cent largely due to the yen's rise. Hino expects its performance in the current year to improve with pre-tax profits rising to Y4.5bn.</p>

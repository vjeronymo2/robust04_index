			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / UN prepares for transfer of Serb aircraft PREPARATIONS were under way yesterday for the rapid transfer of all Bosnian-Serb combat aircraft to United Nations-monitored airfields in the rump Yugoslavia, after Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian-Serb leader, agreed to the measure in Geneva on Tuesday night. A senior representative of the UN protection force (Unprofor) in the former Yugoslavia is due in Banja Luka, military headquarters of the Bosnian Serbs, later this week to arrange the transfer, which has also been agreed by Mr Milan Panic, the Yugoslav prime minister. The UN representative will be accompanied by a Yugoslav air force officer. Mr Karadzic made the offer after being warned by Lord Owen, the EC mediator on ex-Yugoslavia, that the UN Security Council would move swiftly to enforce its ban on military flights over Bosnia imposed October 9. According to intelligence reports available to the UN, Bosnian-Serb aircraft bombed the Moslem-held city of Gradacac on October 10, flying more than 20 sorties, but have since been grounded. Bosnian-Serb leaders have denied the Gradacac bombing raids. Under the terms of the new accord, all military fixed-wing and helicopter aircraft intended for use in combat and stationed on Bosnian territory will be transferred to airfields in Serbia and Montenegro, where they will be monitored by Unprofor observers. UN officials said yesterday they hoped the aircraft would be moved within the next few days. Banja Luka is the main airbase for Bosnian-Serb forces, but neither the UN nor the Bosnian Serbs have revealed the number of aircraft stationed there or elsewhere in Bosnia-Hercegovina. UN officials acknowledge that the deal will be a crucial test of whether Mr Karadzic has, as he claims, full control over Bosnian-Serb commanders in the field. A spokesman for Lord Owen said yesterday that Mr Karadzic's offer had been taken up on the understanding that he was 'fully capable to deliver'. However, the Bosnian-Serb air force commander said on Tuesday night that he had not been consulted on the proposal to hand over the aircraft. Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN mediator, hope Bosnian-Serb compliance with the UN 'no-fly zone' will help pave the way for broader agreement with all three factions in the Bosnian conflict on a cessation of hostilities and the demilitarisation of the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. As fighting continued in Bosnia yesterday, Belgrade Radio said Croat forces were massing north of Brcko, in the north-east, in an attempt to cut the Serb-held supply line linking Serbia and Serb-controlled territories. Croatian radio said Serb forces had launched an offensive on Maglaj, south of the land corridor.</p>

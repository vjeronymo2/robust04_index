			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Management Education &amp; Training (15): High-flyers are the target - Chicago In an ambitious attempt to export American management education to Europe which will be watched keenly by its rivals, the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business will launch an executive MBA programme in Barcelona in July. The course will consist of ten sessions held over 18 months, adding up to 14 weeks of intensive work. Taught in English by members of the regular faculty of the Chicago business school, it will be aimed at high fliers with about 10 years of business experience. The Chicago school claims this is the first time an executive level programme, leading to an MBA degree, has been offered in Europe by a leading American institution. However, the precedent of Harvard - which once considered offering a shortened version of its Advance Management Programme in Switzerland - is seen by some as salutary. Chicago appears to have spent a lot of time and effort wooing European companies, but it is bound to be a hard sell in the current economic climate and at a time when European schools are becoming more international. Robin Hogarth, Chicago's deputy dean, said recruitment is 'going well', though he was reluctant to talk numbers. 'I doubt if we'll be up to 80 (the maximum) this time'. He rejects the Harvard parallel, stressing that Chicago 'is in this for the long term' and 'invented the executive MBA concept in the US 50 years ago'. Chicago courses in Barcelona will be taught in a newly renovated building with state-of-the-art facilities provided with the aid of Argentaria, a large Spanish financial services company. European participants will travel to Chicago in the second year to take courses with their American counterparts. Similarly, Americans following the executive MBA in Chicago will travel to Spain.</p>

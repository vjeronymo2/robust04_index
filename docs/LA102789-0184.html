			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CONSUMER SPENDING UP A SKIMPY 0.2%;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: AMERICANS' INCOME GREW A LACKLUSTER 0.3% LAST MONTH. REPORT BLAMES  EFFECT OF HURRICANE HUGO.  </P> <P> Consumer spending in September posted its weakest advance in a year, while  Americans' personal income grew a lackluster 0.3%, the government said today in  a report raising new concern about the health of the economy.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said consumer spending rose 0.2% last month. It was the  most sluggish figure since September, 1988, when it fell 0.1%, and followed  more robust increases of 0.9% in August and 0.8% in July.  </P> <P> The income growth of 0.3% followed an identical advance in August and a 0.6%  gain in July.  </P> <P> The statistics on Americans' income growth and spending habits provided fresh  evidence that the economy is continuing to slow. As measured by the gross  national product, the economy grew at a moderate 2.5% in the July-September  quarter, but few economists expect it to match that pace in the last three  months of the year, with a handful saying the nation could slip into a  recession.  </P> <P> However, the government noted that Hurricane Hugo, which struck North and South  Carolina in September, reduced personal income, with most of the decline coming  in rental income. Without the storm, incomes would have risen twice as much,  0.6%.  </P> <P> Overall, personal income in September totaled $4.47 trillion after a revised  rate of $4.46 trillion a month earlier.  </P> <P> Spending came in at an annual rate of $3.53 trillion after a revised $3.52  trillion in August.  </P> <P> The September report showed that Americans' income after taxes rose only 0.2%,  down from the 0.3% gain in August.  </P> <P> With income growing at the same rate as after-tax income, Americans' savings  rate held steady at 4.9%, the same as in August but significantly less than the  5.6% rate in July.  </P> <P> The key component of the income category, wages and salaries, increased $14.4  billion, compared with a rise of $5.7 billion in August. Hurricane Hugo reduced  wages and salaries by about $2 billion.  </P> <P> The storm reduced rental income by $9 billion because uninsured losses are  deducted as an expense when figuring rental income.  </P></p>

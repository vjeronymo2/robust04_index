			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Lebanese leaders of rival Christian and Muslim Cabinets have agreed to  cooperate with the Arab League in a bid to prevent the formal partition of the  nation, officials said. Acting Premier Salim Hoss, head of the Muslim Cabinet,  said he will leave for Tunisia later this month for talks with a new committee  of the 22-member league on ways of resolving the four-month political crisis  that threatens to cement Lebanon's partition along sectarian lines. A political  source in Christian East Beirut said that the army commander, Maj. Gen. Michel  Aoun, who heads the Christian Cabinet, also "welcomed the Arab League's  interest in the Lebanese situation and expressed readiness to cooperate with  the committee."  </P></p>

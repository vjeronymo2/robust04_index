			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Germany plans sharp cuts in defence GERMANY is to make steep cuts in arms spending and is urgently reviewing alternatives to the costly European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) joint venture. At the same time, the country will build up a rapid reaction force for international emergencies, Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg, defence minister, said at the weekend. The cuts, expected to reduce planned spending by almost DM44bn (Pounds 15.55bn) over the next 13 years, represented the biggest economies in the history of the German armed forces, the minister said. This year's defence budget is DM52bn. The overhaul of budgets and strategy, forced by shortages of federal funds and encouraged by the ending of the cold war, spells the end of the Leopard III battle tank and the Panther 'tank-killer' projects, delays in construction of the U-212 submarine and reduced deployment of other land, sea and air weapons systems. A decision on whether Germany will buy 250 EFA aircraft, known in Germany as the Jager 90, will be based on a report, due in the summer, on possible substitutes. These are believed to include France's Rafale and the Soviet-built MiG-29. Whatever was decided, Mr Stoltenberg said, the air force needed a new fighter by 2000, and the DM12bn earmarked for the EFA was still in the medium-term military budget. The planned rapid reaction force would be ready by 1995, and would comprise seven army brigades, reinforced by several air force squadrons and vessels and men from the navy. The German constitution at present limits deployment of forces to Nato territory, although an amendment is expected soon to allow them to take part in international actions under the aegis of the United Nations. Mr Stoltenberg said the end of the cold war had reduced the likelihood of an attack from the east on Germany, formerly the west's front-line state. But there were new tensions, such as the war in Yugoslavia, which could endanger national security. The minister's announcement drew fire from the military, which said morale in the 21 army brigades not involved in the rapid reaction force would be undermined by the lack of modern equipment and what was, in effect, an order to 'stand down'. Morale has already been hit by cuts which were announced after unification 15 months ago. Bundesbank chief turns on industry critics, Page 3</p>

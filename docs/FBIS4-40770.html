			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 12, RIA -- "The creation of the party  Russia's Democratic Choice has three positive elements," said  Mikhail Mityukov, deputy chairman of the State Duma, at the  first constituent congress of the party. To begin with, we  witness the creation of a powerful democratic party, which could  put an end to organisational quarrels in the democratic  movement. Second, it has clear-cut domestic and foreign policy  programmes, which boldly pinpoint the painful moments of the  current situation. And third, the party will have a chance to  work in regions, where political life had been dominated by such  better organised forces as the Agrarian, Communist and other  groups, formed on the basis of bureaucratic principles, Mityukov  said.</p>

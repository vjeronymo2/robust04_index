			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SANTA ROSA;  </P> <P> SALCIDO PLEADS INNOCENT TO MURDER  </P> <P> Winery worker Ramon Salcido pleaded innocent to murdering his wife, two  daughters and four others. In a brief appearance before Sonoma County Superior  Court Judge J. Brian Jamar in Santa Rosa, Salcido's trial was tentatively set  to begin Jan. 30. He could be sentenced to death if convicted. Salcido, 28, was  arrested in his native Mexico several days after the April 14 killings. Public  Defender Marteen Miller said he needed more time to prepare and will probably  ask for a delay in the trial. Among other things, Miller said, he is preparing  motions to move the trial to another county because of news coverage; to  challenge the voluntariness of Salcido's reported confession in Mexico, and to  argue that the U.S.-Mexico extradition treaty forbids a death sentence. Salcido  is charged with murdering his wife, Angela; two of their three daughters; his  wife's mother; two of his wife's sisters, and a winery co-worker. A third  daughter, Carmina, 3, had her throat slashed but survived.  </P></p>

			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Observer: Bi-partisan The advertising agency BMP DDB Needham is clearly a Janus-like creature capable of presenting two faces at once. One is responsible for the government's Pounds 500,000 advertising campaign for the citizen's charter to improve the public services. The other is behind the Pounds 2m campaign launched by the public sector union NALGO attacking cuts in public services. According to the current issue of Campaign, the advertising industry's house journal, BMP's double life is coming to an end. The Central Office of Information, which buys government advertising, is to fire BMP as its standby agency. While the apparent conflict of interest would certainly offer a justification, the reason for the sacking is more prosaic. Some ministers apparently consider the citizen's charter ads too bland. But there must be a suspicion that the government cannot stomach putting business the way of an agency whose chief executive, Chris Powell, is a co-ordinator of the shadow communications agency which advises the Labour Party on its campaigning. He is also, incidentally, the brother of Sir Charles Powell, former foreign policy guru to the former prime minister.</p>

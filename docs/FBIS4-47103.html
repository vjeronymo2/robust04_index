			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yegor Gaydar, State Duma deputy and chairman </F> of Russia's Choice, by unidentified ARGUMENTY I FAKTY  correspondents; place and date not given: "Ye. Gaydar: `Our  Trouble Is That Wit Works Woe'"]    [Text] We continue our regular meetings with  political leaders. Today "on stage" is Yegor Gaydar--economist,  former journalist, former prime minister, and currently a State  Duma deputy and chairman of the new Russia's Choice party.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] There is a stratum of people who have an  income of R20,000, with the average price of bread being R500.  According to our data, this group comprises approximately 25  million people. You have to agree that these people have been  thrown "under the wheels of history" not without your  participation.    [Gaydar] Let us look at how the bottom 20 percent of the  population in Ukraine live. Let us compare them with our bottom  20 percent. And ask ourselves: Why are they running to us from  their "communist paradise"? This is not statistics--this is the  truth. Over there, the policy was the motto: "Do not hurt the  poor!" That is, take care of everyone the communist way. But the  poor there think about the standard of living of our poor more  or less the same way we thought during the times of stagnation  about American unemployed with their benefits.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] That is, you are offering a choice  between bad and very bad?    [Gaydar] Of course, a poor man in America does not give a  damn about life here. The realistic choice is between the poor  in Ukraine and the poor in Russia, not between the poor in  Russia and the flourishing middle class in Switzerland.  Otherwise, what can we compare it with?    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Something of our own.    [Gaydar] With our "shining" past? All right! Who has  accumulated $80 billion in debts? The entire country lived on  imported grain, do you not know this? Where are we going to get  this kind of money now?    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Russia has a huge number of Mercedes-600  and it looks as if these people do not pay a kopek in taxes. At  the same time, if we compare the old average salary of R135 and  the 25 kopek price of bread with current prices and wages, it  comes out that the elderly today get an old-money equivalent of  R10.    [Gaydar] This is not so. In reality even by your calculation  the floor comes out at R20. We have to make a comparison,  however, not with the unreal conditions of 1990, when the stores  were completely empty, but with 1980, when one could more or  less buy something. If you compare the average wages of today's  Russia with 1980 wages, you will see that they have stayed at  the same level, except that there are three more zeros on the  end now. It is true, though, that income differentiation  increased sharply, and the poverty stratum expanded.    In order to deal with the problem of the poor seriously, we  need one minor trifle--money. We will find it only when we come  to understand that we should help weak people instead of  inefficient enterprises. Because helping such an enterprise is  helping its stupid director. If you continue helping him, the  klutz, you will never have enough money to help the poor old  lady. She is weaker than the director--she will not go and bang  her fist in the Duma, break through to the president, or  intimidate the prime minister.    It is also cheaper to help the poor individually than to  help  inefficient enterprises. Wages comprise 10-15 percent of the  product cost. It is cheaper to pay wages even when no work is  done, because this way you save valuable resources instead of  squandering them on producing output nobody needs.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] What would you do now if you were prime  minister or president?    [Gaydar] There are several most urgent things. What are we  doing in the area of defense? We are trying to  maintain the military we inherited from the Soviet Union. I  personally cut expenditures on arms procurement by 70 percent. I  am constantly berated for this. Our country cannot carry the  burden of maintaining a military of this size. Instead of one  combat-capable division we have six that are not combat-capable.  And when we use them, it turns out that not a single platoon can  move because all of them are busy doing one thing--guarding  warehouses. If we continue to bring the number of soldiers to  match the number of generals instead of the reverse, we will  always have a destitute, underfed, underfinanced, poorly armed  military.    The next point of our program is agriculture. Our  agrarian lobby constantly accuses us of not subsidizing  agriculture, although it is allegedly subsidized in the entire  world. In reality, this is the privilege of rich countries.  Agriculture in rich technological countries is a small "trivial  item" they can afford to subsidize. This happens as a rule in a  situation where there is surplus of foodstuffs, and it is  subsidized there on a scale incommensurate with ours.    Russia is a poor country, but it actively continues to help  inefficient kolkhozes and sovkhozes, so that they will not, God  forbid, die out. The real agrarian reform ground to a halt in  the beginning of 1993. Financial infusions began  again. This is the third item that needs to be immediately done  away with.    We can and need to help the countryside build a system of  peasant banks, mortgage loans, strengthen land property that can  be used in commercial operations. Where do loans come from in  the entire world? Mostly, through mortgages. But how can one  mortgage the land in our country if he is unable to exercise his  right of private ownership of the land?    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Right now you have not found anything  better for yourself than to jump into politics. Why?    [Gaydar] I intended to do academic research. Then the  government made several such "moves" that set off a panic; a  price freeze loomed. Although it has been a year and a half  since I left the job of the prime minister, one still hears:  "those infamous Gaydar reforms." It is clear to me that I bear  historical responsibility for all the stupid things that are  being done now and will be done in the future, for everything  that will go wrong. So now I will have to spend some part of my  life reducing the scope of these stupid things.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] This is a noble goal, if we are speaking  of the stupidity of ministers, but are you not worried about  communists coming to power? There are examples: Lithuania,  Poland, Hungary.    [Gaydar] A communist wave is inevitable. Reforms start at a  time when everything is completely ruined. And there are many  who welcomed the first anticommunist wave because they pinned  great hopes on it.    Remember, I was saying that soon we will have no lines or  shortages, and the ruble will become convertible? Many were  sarcastic: "Oh, yes, we, too, read fairy tales in childhood."  But now they unfortunately do not remember what I said next:  "Yes, all this is realistic. But this will only be the first  step, not a solution to all our problems."    As one may expect, stores filled with goods no longer  surprise anyone. Neither does the convertible ruble. New  problems, on the other hand--increased social inequality,  serious losses for a number of social groups--manifested  themselves in full force. And this creates a pretext for the  mobilization of communist forces. Plus nostalgic recollections  of the past. This is an objective base for a new communist wave.  In Poland, Hungary, and Lithuania this wave is quite safe.  Because in reality members of those parties were not communists  even at the beginning of the reforms.    Russia is another matter. Our communist party is quite  terrorist, nationalist, and totalitarian. And if, God forbid, it  gets another chance, it may happen that it will not fade into  the shadows again for at least another 70 years. This is an  immense, and serious, danger for Russia.    Strange as it may sound, however, we are lucky that the  communists got large representation in the parliament. The main  problem for them and for the nationalists is this: They do not  know what to do with power. The first part is clear: take away  from the current ones the dachas, cars, and salaries. What next?  They will not risk making public and beginning to implement  their real program: nationalization, price controls,  shortage-driven distribution, and so on. Nobody wants this  anymore. And the people do not want it, either. They want a lot  of money and a lot of goods.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] There are many who do not share this  opinion. It is probably not accidental that you lost the  elections to the Duma.    [Gaydar] We made a great mistake in the course of the  election campaign. Because we listened too much to Western  experts and tried to fashion the campaign by Western standards.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Whose idea was this?    [Gaydar] Nobody's. It was not a conscious decision. Our  trouble is that we have a lot of smart people who know too many  foreign languages. In this case what we got was wit working woe.  We knew how election campaigns were conducted in the West. And  decided to use somebody's else rich experience. This was a  strategic mistake.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] It happened that our opposition came up  with figures who one way or another claimed leadership. One gets  the impression that there are no leaders among the democrats.  How do you explain this?    [Gaydar] Our luck is that the opposition also ran into a  clear crisis with respect to leadership. The first one was  Zhirinovskiy. But he has a problem with crowds of  women running after him on the street and asking: "Where is that  husband you promised us on 13 December?" Second.  Rutskoy. He seriously undermined his reputation by  his "heroics" on 3-4 October 1993. I knew even before then that  he is a very cautious, to put it mildly, man. Now it has become  public knowledge, and the opposition is aware of it, too.  Zyuganov. It is hard to get people to rally behind  him, he is too much of a communist. So, fortunately for us, they  are dealing today with the same problems as we are.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] And what about Solzhenitsyn, who has now  moved here?    [Gaydar] I would not at this point discuss his figure as an  opposition leader.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] And what about you?    [Gaydar] I am a man who has a very mixed reputation in  society. I have a large audience that enthusiastically supports  me. There is also a large audience that will not support me.  Therefore, I am a normal leader of one of the political parties.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] And Luzhkov?    [Gaydar] Also a very mixed bag when it comes to reputation.  In Moscow the attitude toward him is varied; "Muscovites" are  not liked on the periphery. Hence, it is hard for him to be a  leader.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Chernomyrdin?    [Gaydar] A big "democrat" for whom, much as I would wish to,  I would find it very difficult to vote. And frankly, I would not  wish to. I think well of him, but not to the point of wanting to  see him as my president.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Yavlinskiy?    [Gaydar] Undoubtedly attractive, mostly not mixed up in  anything, potentially not bad. But on any serious issue he  carries a very limited real weight in society and so far has not  shown himself in any special way. One of the potential  candidates. It is hard to rally democrats around him, though.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Shakhray?    [Gaydar] No chance whatsoever.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Why?    [Gaydar] Too short, just like me. No charisma.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Shumeyko?    [Gaydar] He has a very low rating right now. He is not  popular in society. Physically attractive. Of course, it is  possible to try to "inflate" him, but the chance for success is  very limited.    So this is a game of puzzles. Because of this, difficult as  it is, at this point I see only one democratic candidate for  president--the president himself.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Do you not think that a man has a right  to a rest?    [Gaydar] Do you want something else?...</p>

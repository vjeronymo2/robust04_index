			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: SIA to take 10% stake in Chinese repair plant SINGAPORE Airlines is to take a 10 per cent stake in a new aircraft maintenance and repair facility being built in the city of Xiamen, on the coast of China. Other partners in the project are Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Co, the Hong Kong carrier Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines and two Chinese state controlled corporations. SIA's stake is believed to be worth just over Dollars 6m. SIA has developed its own aircraft maintenance and repair facilities in recent years but now the carrier, like the other airlines involved in the Xiamen project, is faced with spiralling land costs and acute labour shortages. Construction work at the Xiamen site has already begun and the facility is due to be completed by 1996. Haeco, ultimately controlled by the Swire Group of Hong Kong, will have a 41 per cent shareholding in the Xiamen project. Airline industry analysts expect the Xiamen project to succeed, given the rapid expansion of the airline business in the Asia Pacific, particularly in China.</p>

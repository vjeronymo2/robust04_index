			<p>BFN     [Text] Donetsk oblast [no date as received] -- A regular  meeting of directors of Ukraine's metallurgical, coking  by-product, and coal enterprises took place in Yenakiyevo  yesterday, attended by Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk,  Finance Minister Hryhoriy Pyatachenko, National Bank Chairman  Viktor Yushchenko, and Mykola Surhay, chairman of the state  committee for the coal industry. Participants in the meeting  discussed the main problems which caused the basic sectors to  end up on the verge of stoppage or bankruptcy. Speakers opined  that crediting enterprises without indexing circulating assets  has not achieved anything and removed social tension only in the  period of the election campaign.    The directors of enterprises appealed to the government and  president to place the payments made on the basis of  special-purpose credits, issued in February, March, and April,  beyond the bounds of 1994, and to adopt a decision to turn them  into interest-free payments. Their argument was the "entirely  interlinked nonpayments between enterprises", the nonpayment of  wages for February, March, and April at mining enterprises, and  so on. "It is precisely nonpayments which oblige one to take  credits, but as a result of inflation the interest to be paid  becomes several times higher than the total credit, which we  were obliged to take because of the nonpayments," said Valentyn  Illyushenko, general director of "Donetskvuhillya".    Participants in the meeting sharply disputed information  from  Mykola Surhay, chairman of Ukraine's State Committee for the  Coal Industry, that the plan for deliveries of coal to the  metallurgists has been almost fulfilled (by 93 percent), and  that "Ukraine would have enough of its own coal, and that it  would be shameful to buy it from Poland." Participants observed  that the plan of deliveries has been considerably understated,  and that there will only be sufficient coal extracted in the  Donbass for energy but not for coke and metallurgical production.    National Bank Chairman Viktor Yushchenko, replying to the  demands of enterprise directors to liberalize the currency  market as soon as possible, maintained that the National Bank's  point of view is the same as theirs.    In his speech, which lasted almost one and a half hours,  Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk maintained that he has a  program of economic reforms "in all aspects", and that "the time  has come when one can begin a new radical stage in the economy."  In the president's opinion, two lines of approach are  noticeable. The first is the regulation of mutual settlements.  According to him, restraining the fixed exchange rate is  explained by misgivings about a possible social explosion as a  result of price increases.    Maintaining that he has an appropriate decree, which  envisions a floating currency exchange rate and the free sale of  currency by enterprises (which was also proposed in the draft  decree proposed by the organizers of the meeting), Leonid  Kravchuk expressed himself in favor of "currency regulation by  the practice of: increasing the exchange rate of the dollar by  1,000 karbovantsi every five days." "If we do not have any sharp  changes in pricing, a final decision will be made without fail,"  the president said.    Leonid Kravchuk said the next step is to decrease the  quantity of goods subject to licenses and quotas.    Speaking about regional policy, the president expressed  himself in favor of the broadest regional independence.  According to him, however, in order to implement the decree on  the legal and economic experiment on four oblasts it is  necessary for the Supreme Council to make approximately 20  amendments to the legislation. Speaking about the Donbass,  Leonid Kravchuk expressed his conviction that "it will survive  in market conditions only in Ukraine, because coal is a lot  cheaper in Russia and the stores are swamped with it."    Leonid Kravchuk dwelled in detail on his stand regarding the  needlessness of holding presidential elections on 26 June. His  arguments were supported by all the participants in the meeting.  A consequence of the discussion was the appeal to Ukraine's  Supreme Council on behalf of the employees of the metallurgical,  coal, and coke by-product industries on the need to postpone  these elections. The decision was not adopted by voting, but no  one expressed any objections.    The proposals and draft decree on overcoming the economy  crisis, which were proposed to the president and government  representatives at the meeting (UNIAN reported them in its first  bulletin on 16 May) did not on the whole evoke any objections.  Ukraine's highly placed officials assured the participants that  these documents will be analysed in order to hold another  meeting in the near future (around 23 May) to adopt them.</p>

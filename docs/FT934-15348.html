			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Canadian waste group expands PHILIP Environmental of Canada is buying two US hazardous waste companies for almost USDollars 100m. The acquisition of Seattle-based Burlington Environmental for USDollars 75m and Nortru for USDollars 23m will add hazardous waste, recycling and environmental engineering revenues of USDollars 120m to Philip's annual volume. This will increase Philip's total sales to about USDollars 325m. Philip, based in Hamilton, Ontario, is financing the deal by selling USDollars 120m of special warrants to underwriters, allowing investors to buy convertible debentures. St Lawrence Cement, eastern Canada's biggest cement maker which is controlled by the Swiss Holderbank group, bought 11 per cent of Philip in 1991 and has the right to maintain an interest up to 22 per cent. Philip is an industrial recycler, which also collects waste and operates landfill sites across Canada and in key US markets. It had dropped plans for an equity issue because of poor first-quarter results. Its latest acquisition was a Hamilton-based metals recycler. Philip recorded first-half net profit of CDollars 4.8m (USDollars 3.6m), or 15 cents a share, down from CDollars 7m or 24 cents, a year earlier. It blamed the first-quarter problems on severe weather and said the shortfall would be made up by year-end. Mr Allen Fracassi, president, said Philip would apply the Dollars 22m remaining from the warrant issue to reduce debt. Belgium's Tractabel has formed a joint venture with the Montreal property and construction group Desourdy to introduce new European waste treatment technology to the Canadian market. Projects worth CDollars 50m are planned in Ontario and Quebec.</p>

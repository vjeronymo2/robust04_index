			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NEW HOLLYWOOD HOT PROPERTY;  </P> <P> THE COMPETITION FOR MOVIE RIGHTS IS SO FIERCE THAT MANUSCRIPTS ARE BOUGHT BY  PRODUCERS EVEN BEFORE THEY CROSS THE PUBLISHER'S DESK  </P> <P> One Thursday morning in January of this year, the manuscript of a new novel by  Warren Adler, "Private Lies," was sent out by messenger from the Triad Artists  agency in Century City to 15 Hollywood studios and producers so that the movie  companies could bid for the rights to turn the novel into a film. The  manuscript had not yet been delivered (or even sold) to a publisher, but that  mattered not a whit in Hollywood, where a bounty was already being offered by  eager producers for purloined copies.  </P> <P> Interest in "Private Lies," a story about marital infidelity and betrayal  involving two couples, set in Africa and promising four starring roles, was  perhaps particularly keen because Adler was also the author of the book "War of  the Roses," which was made into a movie at 20th Century Fox in 1989 that  grossed $84 million in the U.S.  </P> <P> A little more than 24 hours later, Tri-Star Pictures outbid Warner Bros.,  Columbia and Carolco and purchased the film rights to "Private Lies" for $1.2  million. It was one of the highest amounts yet paid in Hollywood for an  unpublished manuscript (the book will be published next February), but it was  only the latest bonanza for a novelist in the frantic futures market of the  film business where the first drafts of what are thought to be hot books are  circulated among producers and auctioned for movie sales before they even see  the ink of galley proofs.  </P> <P> Irene Webb, who runs the literary department at the William Morris Agency in  Beverly Hills, recalls having to sell Dominick Dunne's book "People Like Us"  before the author had even finished it because a production company, with an  early draft in hand, called to make an offer. "I had to call New York right  away and say, 'Get me the manuscript,' " says Webb.  </P> <P> Webb sold the rights to Dunne's new book, "An Inconvenient Woman," to ABC  Productions for $500,000. "People were begging to bid on it," she says. "That's  the way people are when it comes to books. When producers get wind that a  network wants to do a book, they've got to have it, they'll do anything."  </P> <P> Writer-director David Lynch's new movie, "Wild at Heart," which just won the  top prize at the Cannes Film Festival, was adapted from a novel by Barry  Gifford that has not yet been published. Michael Crichton's new novel,  "Jurassic Park," to be published in October, was purchased by Universal for  $1.5 million.  </P> <P> Last year, producer Richard Zanuck paid $1 million cash for the rights to  "Rush," an autobiographical first novel by Kim Wozencraft (published by Random  House in April) about a Texas narcotics cop gone bad and back again. "I don't  grill our people on their methods," says Zanuck, who, like many producers,  keeps two full-time scouts on his payroll in New York, "but we, like others, do  get a very early look at material."  </P> <P> This race to acquire new books is part of the current competition in Hollywood  that has broken records for spending levels and brought writers --  screenwriters, as well as novelists -- closer to the big money long enjoyed by  stars and directors. The latest sales figures signal a rebound from the  comparative literary doldrums of the early 1980s, when even the rights to  bestsellers commanded $250,000 and less. Although no writers are approaching  the earning power of Tom Cruise or Sylvester Stallone, "Writers are finally  coming into their own," says Todd Harris, the 30-year-old agent who conducted  the "Private Lies" sale and has sold roughly 150 books to the movies in the  last three years.  </P> <P> Hollywood has looked to books for stories at least since the arrival of sound  in the mid-1920s, as is evident from any list of its most memorable films, from  "Gone With the Wind" to "The Graduate," from "The Maltese Falcon" to "Born on  the Fourth of July." Yet, its willingness to pay large sums for these literary  sources has waxed and waned, fluctuating with the film industry's jittery  pulse, interest rates and slavish pursuit of the next big thing.  </P> <P> No one in the film or publishing businesses can say for sure why Hollywood has  plunged into a new bull market for books, but speculation rests on such factors  as the renewed search for adult stories fitted to the aging moviegoing  audience, the inflation of costs (and profits) throughout filmmaking, the  number of high-profile books bought by trend-setting producers Peter Guber and  Jon Peters while still at Warner Bros. ("The Color Purple," "Witches of  Eastwick," "Bonfire of the Vanities") and what some in the industry see as a  glut of formulaic "original" screenplays, that is, scripts not based on other  literary or dramatic material but often written in imitation of other movies.  </P> <P> In addition, many of the studios are now in the hands of "the new old players,"  as one agent puts it, executives who, like Guber and Peters, have switched from  one company to another and are willing to splurge to get their first movies  made at their new addresses.  </P> <P> That "there are so many powerful producers now is the main reason," says Esther  Newberg, co-director of the huge ICM agency's literary department in New York,  which recently made sales of close to $1 million for the rights to Robert  Daley's not-yet-published "A Faint, Cold Fear," a romantic thriller about a cop  and a reporter, and an untitled novel by Zev Chafets about organized crime.  </P> <P> "Everything seems to be stepped up and books are included," says William  Morris' Webb, who sold the rights to Susan Isaacs' 1988 novel "Shining  Through," about a female American Jewish spy during World War II, to 20th  Century Fox for $500,000.  </P> <P> "If something has a buzz on it, they buy it and then worry about what to do  with it," says Huntington Beach writer Kem Nunn, whose highly regarded 1984  surfing novel "Tapping the Source" was purchased by producer Martin Bregman and  Universal Pictures for a six-figure sum but has never been made.  </P> <P> Judy Clain, who targets books for movie sales in New York for Triad, says, "In  the past, the attitude (in publishing) toward people in the movie business was  a little leery, because movie people are known for a lot of talk and no action.  But now agents are more willing to talk film rights because Hollywood seems to  be spending so much money. It's a very good time to be selling film rights to  books."  </P> <P> If there is a pattern to the kind of books Hollywood is buying, that too is  hard to detect. Crime and punishment ("Rush," "Presumed Innocent") are big, but  so is social satire ("Bonfire of the Vanities") and the celebrity bio  ("Postcards From the Edge"). Sex is for sale, as always: Just last week, agent  Irving "Swifty" Lazar resold "Lolita," the late Vladimir Nabokov's 1958 novel  about an aging professor's obsession with a 12-year-old girl, to Carolco for $1  million.  </P> <P> The rising sales figures for books are long overdue, say authors and their  agents, who point to the importance of a good story in the equation of a  successful movie. "You put talent like Sean Connery and Dustin Hoffman in a  movie and you've got a hit, right?" one writer says rhetorically. "No, what you  have is 'Family Business,' " one of last Christmas season's box office flops.  </P> <P> Nor are the higher figures for books necessarily the result of new sales  techniques or high pressure tactics on the part of agents.  </P> <P> The sale of "Rush" last summer was said by some insiders to have been a  manipulative achievement on the part of an agent, Amanda "Binky" Urban at ICM,  who supposedly coaxed Richard Zanuck into the belief that the book had more  heat on it than was in fact true. But Zanuck and other competing producers have  denied this.  </P> <P> "You can't blame the agents," says longtime producer and former MGM/UA chairman  Lee Rich, who currently owns or controls the rights to 12 books, including five  by best-selling horrormeister Dean R. Koontz. "If you don't want to pay it,  don't pay it."  </P> <P> "The studios make the marketplace," says Todd Harris, who has also pulled down  six-figure sums for the first novels "Recruiting Violations" "A Time for  Wedding Cake" and "Hype."  </P> <P> "A good story will always sell. It doesn't matter whether it's by a  best-selling author or not. If 'War of the Roses' didn't exist, ('Private  Lies') would have sold for the same amount of money. It was a star-driven story  that was very commercial."  </P> <P> Harris claims not to utilize any special strategy or impose deadlines on  potential buyers (a practice not uncommon in auctions of screenplays) but says  most of his sales nevertheless come within 48 hours of submission. "I let the  marketplace establish the time frame," he says.  </P> <P> Yet, there are cases where the pace of the marketplace makes it hard even for  the agents to keep up. It's not uncommon for eager producers not only to get  hold of a book unofficially in advance of publication, but to try to represent  the book to studios without having paid for the rights.  </P> <P> "It's a real swamp from where I sit," says Al Zuckerman, the New York agent for  novelist Ken Follet who recalls how an established producer "ran all over  town," meaning Los Angeles, with Follet's "Key to Rebecca" some years ago  "pretending that he owned it when he didn't." Such tactics are made possible,  Zuckerman adds, because "there's this whole system for stealing manuscripts  from the minute they arrive at the publisher."  </P> <P> The system is called "sneaking," and it involves secretaries, editorial  assistants, copy store employees, book club personnel, trade publications that  get books for early review, editors and even the writers themselves.  </P> <P> Explains Richard Curtiss, a New York literary agent: "There are people placed  around the (publishing) business who, in exchange of quid pro quo -- in other  words, favors -- will direct a copy of a manuscript that should be exclusive  and confidential into the hands of a scout, and then that manuscript ends up on  the desk of a producer. A mass market editor, for example, might trade a copy  of a manuscript in exchange for first opportunity to acquire novelization  rights to a hot film."  </P> <P> What often happens next is that "readers" working for producers or studio story  departments "cover" or synopsize the manuscript, evaluating its movie  potential, a controversial practice generally resisted by agents.  </P> <P> "People (in Hollywood) knew about this book of Zev's by the time I sold it to  Random House," agent Esther Newberg says of the still untitled Chafets novel,  which was bought by "Top Gun" producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer.  "What happens is that you have a very small window in which to try to sell the  book before some 22-year-old kid reads it, doesn't like it and gives it bad  coverage."  </P> <P> Sneaking has even changed the way some agents do business. "If I have a hot  literary property now," says Zuckerman, who is not atypical, "I don't deliver  it to a publisher until I show it to movie people first."  </P> <P> While Hollywood has ruined more than its share of novels ("In Country," "Bright  Lights, Big City"), it has redeemed others ("Midnight Cowboy," "The Godfather")  and made many novelists rich and others famous. Writers as diverse as Larry  McMurtry ("The Last Picture Show," "Terms of Endearment") and Margaret Atwood  ("A Handmaid's Tale") became much better known as novelists because Hollywood  bought their books. A movie might misfire commercially -- statistically, most  do -- yet still generate considerable publicity among the more modest-sized  book-buying audience.  </P> <P> Al Zuckerman estimates that the 1981 movie based on Ken Follet's thriller "Eye  of the Needle," though not a success, sold an additional 1.5 million copies of  the novel.  </P> <P> The movie deal for Margaret Atwood's dark fable "A Handmaid's Tale" prompted a  1 million-copy reissue of the book in paperback, according to her publishing  agent, Phoebe Larmore, and made it a bestseller all over again.  </P> <P> Warren Adler, who spent 20 years as a Washington businessman, had written 15  books in relative obscurity until James L. Brooks bought the rights to his 1981  novel "War of the Roses" and turned it over to screenwriter Michael Leeson and  director Danny DeVito.  </P> <P> A cautionary tale about a contemporary marriage twisted by greed, "War of the  Roses" was optioned prior to publication, as it happens, by Richard Zanuck and  his then partner David Brown, for $35,000. They paid Adler to write a  screenplay, but the project languished, and by the time 20th Century Fox bought  the book for Brooks six years later, the price had gone up to $400,000.  </P> <P> "The kinds of books I write apparently are the kinds of things these fellows  like out here," says Adler, 61, who has had five other books sold or optioned  for films (though none produced).  </P> <P> Adler has been critical of producers and studios in the past, but he is the  first to acknowledge that Hollywood has made him a literary star. " 'War of the  Roses' has been published in every country in the world now. That's what  happens once a book is set to be a movie. A worldwide movie is the best  promotion for a book imaginable because movie people are the best promoters of  anything. They really know how to do it."  </P> <P> Kem Nunn has lived for six years largely on the movie sale of "Tapping the  Source" -- considerably more than he has made from book royalties. While it's  been "frustrating," he says, that no movie has been made, the money allowed him  to write another novel, "Unassigned Territory."  </P> <P> Hardly anyone has heard of Tulsa, Okla., novelist Jay Cronley, but six of his  books, including "Funny Farm," "Quick Change" and "False Labor," have been sold  or optioned to marquee talent such as Chevy Chase, Bill Murray and Barry  Levinson. Cronley's novels sell on average only 5,000 to 10,000 copies -- not  much in publishing terms -- but his agent estimates he has made "10 times more"  money from movie sales.  </P> <P> The fact that many publishing houses and movie studios are now owned by the  same conglomerates -- Paramount and Simon &amp; Schuster are jointly owned by  Paramount Communications, for example; Warner Bros. and Little-Brown by  Time-Warner Inc. -- apparently has not been a factor in the accelerated  book-to-movie process. The story departments for the studios want the best  movie books they can get, regardless of the publisher, and authors' agents have  no reason to favor one studio over another except the one offering the most  money.  </P> <P> Richard Zanuck, who was head of production at 20th Century Fox from 1962-70 and  later bought "Jaws" (for $175,000) from Peter Benchley, says the market for  film rights is "very cyclical. I remember when books were really in for a long  while. In the '60s books were selling (to Hollywood) like hot cakes. Now, it's  heated up again. Maybe it's because there are less original quality  screenplays. You don't find 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' very often."  </P> <P> Zanuck and Brown paid $400,000 in 1967 for William Goldman's "Butch Cassidy and  the Sundance Kid," then a record for an original screenplay. The new record was  set when the Geffen Co. in April purchased a script, "The Last Boy Scout," by  Shane Black, the author of "Lethal Weapon," for $1.75 million -- which is still  less than was paid in 1979 by United Artists for the film rights to Gay  Talese's nonfiction book about sex in America, "Thy Neighbor's Wife." That  figure, $2.5 million, is believed to be the largest amount ever paid for a book  of any kind. And, since none of three movies UA executives Steven Bach and  David Fields said they hoped to get from "Thy Neighbor's Wife" ever  materialized, the sum is thought to represent a high folly mark that led to a  cooling off of the literary marketplace during the first half of the 1980s, a  period also marked by soaring interest rates and industry labor troubles.  </P> <P> The market took an upturn in 1986 when MGM/UA paid $1 million to buy Scott  Turow's courtroom thriller "Presumed Innocent" for producer-director Sydney  Pollack (who later took it with him to Universal), and Warner Bros. paid $1.3  million for a first novel by Harry Saint, "Memoirs of an Invisible Man,"  intended as a vehicle for Chevy Chase though yet to be made. The escalation has  continued up through "Rush" and "Private Lies," but some writers and publishers  point out that these and other million-dollar sales are still the high-end  exception, and have not turned all eyes in the book business toward the West  Coast.  </P> <P> Unlike the titles mentioned above, most books that draw interest from  Hollywood, like most original scripts, begin with the much smaller sums of  option money -- that is, a down payment made by a producer or studio toward a  larger purchase price that is only paid if the movie is ever made. Agents claim  that option money is rising in the current market, but in the not so distant  past the average novel that was not a bestseller could often be had by a  producer for as little as $2,500 against a purchase price of $25,000-$40,000.  At those levels, a screenwriter might easily make more for adapting a book than  the novelist got for either writing it or selling the rights.  </P> <P> Since movie companies option maybe 2,000 books a year, of which only a few  dozen, or roughly 5%, are ever made into feature films, the hubbub of Hollywood  sounds not nearly so loud in Midtown Manhattan as it does in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> "Movie people are notorious for wasting a lot of your time and then it ends up  only being an option," says Phyllis Fleiss, director of media rights for Crown  Publishers in New York.  </P> <P> Furthermore, publishers don't have quite the incentive in these negotiations as  do writers since in most contracts writers retain a lion's share of any film  sale.  </P> <P> "On the other hand," Fleiss says, "It helps to be able to say (to book clubs  and paperback houses), 'We've got a movie. It never hurts. It's just another  form of publicity."  </P> <P> These days, film producers sometimes even kick in money for a book's  advertising budget in the hope of helping to make it a bestseller, as Carolco  has promised to do for whatever publisher buys D. Keith Mano's new novel,  "Topless," which Carolco bought recently for $550,000.  </P> <P> Movie companies also sometimes agree to what are known as "bestseller bumpers,"  meaning they agree to pay an author extra money for each week that a book they  purchase remains on the New York Times bestseller list.  </P> <P> According to Lee Rich and others, the days of the 10% option are over. "Options  are going for big money," says Rich. "It's more like $100,000 against $500,000.  Options are where the big increase has come. So many books never found their  way to the screen, I guess the writers and their agents figured, 'Let's get the  money up front.' "  </P> <P> A recent example of the newer kind of deal was the Pleshette-Green Agency's  sale of Neal Stephenson's novel "Zodiac," about a New Age Sam Spade hunting  down criminal polluters of Boston Harbor, to Warner Bros. for $370,000 cash,  with an additional $370,000 to be paid if the movie ever goes into production.  </P> <P> Joel Gotler, a leading book rights agent, recently sold "The Plummer," a  nonfiction book about the man who destroyed the Philadelphia Mafia, by Joseph  Salerno and Stephen J. Rivele, to Universal for a $400,000 option, plus  $450,000 more if the movie is made.  </P> <P> Lynn Pleshette, the agent who made the "Zodiac" sale, is one of those who  believe books are benefitting from the sludge pile of screenplays that has  accumulated over the last decade -- a pile raised high by an excess of studio  "development" deals and a new generation of screenwriters nourished on a  restricted diet of television and movies.  </P> <P> "There's a real problem with original screenplays now," says Pleshette, who has  made movie and miniseries deals for novelists William Kennedy, Sue Miller and  Valerie Martin, among others. "The young people (screenwriters) coming up are  so derivative. When I read original screenplays, they're almost always like  something that's been done. Or they're a cross between two other movies --  'Lethal Weapon' meets 'Wuthering Heights.' "  </P> <P> That so many original screenplays are written in the vicinity of Los Angeles  and its sometimes all-consuming movie business atmosphere, the agent suggests,  only contributes to the dearth of originality. "Producers are looking for a  point of view that's not between Encino and Pacific Palisades," she says. "Most  of the books we get, there is a vision, there is a voice."  </P> <P> Novelists, who work in a less restrictive medium, are not so closely aligned  with Southern California as a rule and are less prone to the Hollywood disease  of trying to anticipate trends -- the sort of creative thinking that propels  screenwriters to pound out the next body-switching comedy or space Western or  whatever their agents think is selling this year.  </P> <P> "Books are the area where unusual stories come from," says ICM's Newberg. "So  many novelists I know are better writers than screenwriters."  </P> <P> While a book is of no use to a movie producer until a screenwriter has been  paid to adapt it to the different demands of film, the raw material of fiction  is often more alluring to moneyed movie people than any but the best original  scripts.  </P> <P> "Books are a known quantity and have already been tested by an audience," says  Triad's Judy Clain. "You attract strong talent and directors with good  material. Books are classy. And a book could become anything -- as opposed to a  bad script."  </P> <P> And so it is that in Hollywood, where the screenplay is the primary literary  form, the novel retains its mystique and market value. To all but publishing's  biggest cash register stars like Stephen King, Tom Clancy and Danielle Steele  (for whom even a $1 million movie sale might qualify as supplementary income),  movie money and attention is harder than ever to ignore. Because of  videocassettes, cable and growing foreign sales, the stakes have never been  higher in Hollywood, which one way or another must keep discovering new sources  of fuel to keep its high-octane engines running and can well afford to pay  higher prices at the pump.  </P> <P> The prices have reached such a level that it's increasingly difficult for  producers without access to big studio money (and spies in New York) to secure  options to desirable material. Hall Bartlett, who directed and produced the  adaptation of "Jonathan Livingston Seagull" in 1973 and "Children of Sanchez"  in 1979, became so frustrated in his attempts to get the rights to another  best-selling book, he decided to write his own novel specifically for the  purpose of selling it as a miniseries. So far his plan has only been  half-successful: Random House published the book, "The Rest of Our Lives," but  it failed to become a bestseller and no miniseries resulted.  </P> <P> "It's an exciting business," observes Warren Adler. "It's like wildcatting in  the oil fields. There's no sure thing. How do you hook into the public mind?"  </P> <P> Despite getting rich and famous from "War of the Roses" and "Private Lies,"  Adler makes clear that to his way of thinking, movies remain secondary. He sees  them mainly as an extension of his books.  </P> <P> "I don't write my books for the movies. The money is great but more important  than the money is people taking my books seriously. I'm shooting for my books  to last. Otherwise I couldn't spend all those days alone in a room doing this.  But it's what I love. I love novels. It's a one-on-one communication system.  The novel is still to me the greatest art form in the world."  </P> <P> * Prelude to Big Money: How two plays hit the Hollywood jackpot. Tuesday in  Calendar.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GAGE QUITS AS TOP BRADLEY AIDE IN MAJOR SHAKE-UP  </P> <P> In a major City Hall shake-up, Deputy Mayor Mike Gage is leaving his position  as Tom Bradley's chief of staff and top political aide for a job with a  developer, The Times has learned.  </P> <P> Gage's departure, effective Dec. 1, will end a roller-coaster stint in the  mayor's office that spanned the best to the worst days of Bradley's political  career. He helped engineer Bradley's political revitalization two years ago,  only to be plunged into the center of an ongoing conflict-of-interest scandal.  </P> <P> The sudden move will trigger a significant retooling of Bradley's staff at a  time when the mayor is under continuing federal investigation and his political  standing is at an all-time low.  </P> <P> City Hall sources said Gage, 44, will be replaced by Mark D. Fabiani, the  mayor's 32-year-old staff lawyer and speech writer, who only recently was  looking to leave the troubled Bradley Administration for a private sector job  himself.  </P> <P> Bradley is scheduled to announce Gage's departure and Fabiani's appointment at  a press conference today, the sources said.  </P> <P> The mayor is also expected to disclose the retirement of Deputy Mayor Grace  Davis, a longtime Bradley liaison to the Latino community who has been at odds  with Gage. Davis will be replaced by Diane M. Pasillas, executive director of  the Latin Business Assn. and a recent Bradley appointee to the Board of Airport  Commissioners, sources said.  </P> <P> Gage said his departure after 2 1/2 years in the mayor's office was both  voluntary and friendly. He said he believes that he was leaving behind a "a  staff that is stronger than the one that was here when I arrived."  </P> <P> Gage said he chose to speak in advance of today's announcement in the hope that  his departure would not be portrayed as detrimental to the mayor.  </P> <P> "I love Tom Bradley," Gage said in an interview. "I watched him at a time that  would have sunk smaller men -- and he held his head high."  </P> <P> A former assemblyman from Napa and an outdoor adventurer, Gage will become  president and chief executive officer of the San Fernando Valley home-building  company of Theodore Stein, one of the most aggressive pro-development members  of the Los Angeles Planning Commission.  </P> <P> By leaving now, Gage may avoid pending ethics reforms submitted Monday that  seek to bar ex-city officials from appearing before local agencies for a period  of one year.  </P> <P> But Gage said the proposed ethics limits would not be an issue because Stein,  as a member of the Planning Commission, already falls under the city's  conflict-of-interest code. Any project involving Stein's company automatically  is sent to a group of council members acting as the Board of Referred Powers,  Gage said.  </P> <P> "He is the only guy in the city I can work for and not create a conflict of  interest," Gage added. "I am not going to be lobbying for him either, not in my  life. . . . I can live under the ethics code for the rest of my life, and it  will not affect me."  </P> <P> Stein, who has served for 15 months on the Planning Commission and is its vice  president, said he hired Gage to manage his firm's day-to-day operations.  </P> <P> "He was not hired in any way, shape or form because of any contacts he has with  the city of Los Angeles," Stein said.  </P> <P> Too Tempting Offer  </P> <P> In recent weeks, Gage has repeatedly denied to his staff and reporters that he  was job-hunting or had any intention of leaving. But, he said in the interview,  one published report of his denials brought an offer from Stein earlier this  month that was too tempting to pass up.  </P> <P> Fabiani will move up in the mayor's office at a time when associates report  that he had expressed reservations about the lingering investigation of the  mayor and how it could possibly hurt his own career. But one source in the  mayor's office said that whatever doubts may have existed did not prevent  Fabiani from taking an even more visible and challenging position.  </P> <P> Recently, Gage has had a stormy relationship with some members of the mayor's  staff and the media as he tried to keep together an office that suffered from  the fallout of investigations of Bradley's personal finances and his conduct in  office.  </P> <P> A large, rough-hewn man, Gage has had a reputation over the years as easy-going  and garrulous. But as scandal enveloped the Bradley Administration, he grew  bitter and combative. Gage even took the extreme step of withholding news  releases from the now-defunct Herald Examiner for what he perceived as the  newspaper's unfair coverage of the mayor, sources said.  </P> <P> Bradley is under investigation by a federal grand jury for his business ties  with eight banks, savings and loan associations and brokerage firms. Among the  areas under scrutiny in the wide-ranging probe are possible insider stock  trading and violations of federal law specifically aimed at political  corruption.  </P> <P> The federal probe is broader than the recently concluded investigation by the  city attorney's office, which found insufficient evidence to prosecute Bradley  on conflict-of-interest charges. In his report, City Atty. James K. Hahn  sharply criticized Bradley's indifference to ethical concerns and filed a civil  lawsuit against the mayor over errors and omissions in his financial disclosure  forms.  </P> <P> In the past, Gage has frequently skipped from job to job but without the  controversy that surrounded his tenure at City Hall. In addition to his two  terms as a member of the Legislature, Gage was a top strategist in the 1980  presidential campaign of former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. and managed the 1982  campaign of Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy and Bradley's 1985 reelection.  </P> <P> After a stint with Beverly Hills investor Albert Gersten, Gage joined Bradley  at City Hall in 1987. He is credited with almost immediately injecting new  energy into the mayor's office and with helping scare off major Bradley  opponents in April's mayoral election.  </P> <P> Gage's new boss, Stein, has an estimated $30 million in annual sales of luxury  homes and commercial buildings. Stein said he considers himself a centrist on  the Planning Commission.  </P> <P> But homeowner activists contend quite the opposite.  </P> <P> "A lot of people are complaining about him," said Mary Ann Geyer, president of  the La Tuna Community Awareness Assn. "I am hearing it constantly. They say  that Ted Stein is taking a very pro-development stand on their cases."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Nancy Hill-Holtzman and Dean Murphy contributed to this  story.  </P></p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Observer: Unfair competition While Neil Kinnock struggles to carve out a new career as a disc jockey-cum-game show celebrity, his former lieutenant Charles Clarke has found a lucrative niche advising companies on how to dispense with the costly services of professional lobbyists. Most Westminster exiles end up as political lobbyists themselves, wining and dining their former colleagues to promote clients' interests. Clarke, for nearly 10 years Kinnock's chief of staff and leading 'fixer', has refused to jump on that particular gravy train. His consultancy Quality Public Affairs tells organisations how they can do their own lobbying more effectively for a fraction of the cost. It's such a novel idea that it is probably only a matter of time before Clarke gets an offer he can't refuse to sell out.</p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Agreement hopes lift aluminium Aluminium prices climbed to 6 1/2 -month highs at the London Metal Exchange this week as scepticism about producing countries' plans for co-ordinated output cuts began to be overcome. Gains were trimmed somewhat yesterday but the three months delivery position still ended Dollars 48 up on the week at Dollars 1,237.50 a tonne. Delegates from Russia and leading western producers of the metal met last week to seek a formula for reducing the current world supply glut, which most analysts blame on the flood of Russian material to the west that has ensued from the collapse of the Soviet Union. The failure of the meeting, which was conducted in extreme secrecy, to result in a clear statement of intent disappointed the market initially. However, as it became clear that this resulted from the need to avoid contravention of anti-trust laws in the US and elsewhere market confidence in the plan appeared to revive. A memorandum of understanding based on last week's discussions was dispatched to participants on Monday. They were asked to respond by 11pm GMT last night and a statement the European Commission, which hosted the meeting, is expected soon. Some traders suggested, however, that this was unlikely to be such as to drive prices much higher as cuts amounting to 1.5m to 2m tonnes a year (about 10 per cent of world output) were already factored into current prices. But if the agreed cuts fell short of that level there was scope for a sharp market setback. Sentiment was also dented yesterday by a Russian aluminium industry official's warning that output cuts resulting from the 'understanding' would not necessarily results in reduced exports from Russia. The aluminium market's buoyant mood spilled over into the LME copper contract, where the three months position gained Dollars 6.25 on the week to Dollars 1,871.50 a tonne, despite falling Dollars 12 yesterday. The gold market tested the limits of its recent trading range this week before ending at the lower end. A sharp fall on Monday took the London price to Dollars 378.40 a troy ounce, down Dollars 6.85 from the previous Friday, before support was found. A modest but sustained recovery lifted it to Dollars 384.80 an ounce on Thursday morning, before the rot set in again, encouraged by rumours that Venezuela's troubled Banco Latino might have ten to 15 tonnes of the metal to sell. The renewed slide continued yesterday, when the price closed at Dollars 378.40 an ounce, down Dollars 3.80 on the day and Dollars 6.85 on the week. The bulls remained undaunted, however, and dealers told the Reuter news agency that the overall uptrend was still intact. 'It has to go below Dollars 374 before that is broken,' one said, adding that gold's problem was its apparent inability to break through upside resistance. At the London Commodity Exchange a rally encouraged by news that Central American producers had set a minimum export price of 80 cents a pound, fob, pushed March coffee futures to Dollars 1,204 a tonne at one stage. But profit-taking soon had the price back into the Dollars 1,180s and it ended the week down Dollars 5 at Dollars 1,175 a tonne. May cocoa futures ended just Pounds 5 higher at Pounds 915 a tonne, after another abortive attempt in mid-week to break down overhead resistance around Pounds 920 a tonne.  --------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  --------------------------------------- Aluminium        -3,500+ to 2,502,325 Aluminium alloy    -220  to    47,180 Copper           -5,650  to   600,775 Lead             +7,850  to   321,150 Nickel             +714  to   128,826 Zinc            +14,600  to   998,325 Tin                 -75  to    20,625  ---------------------------------------</p>

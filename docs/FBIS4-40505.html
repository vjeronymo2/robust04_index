			<p>BFN     [Text] Poltava [no date as received] -- Ivan Plyushch,  Ukrainian people's deputy, former speaker, and presidential  candidate, replied to UNIAN's question at a news conference on  16 June about his reaction to Vitaliy Masol's appointment as  prime minister: "I spoke to Masol about a month ago or before,  and he had a different attitude then. I do not know what  pressure made Masol change his mind. I also do not know who  needed to elect a prime minister 10 days before the presidential  election, but I am not about to make a tragedy of this  appointment. I know Masol as an experienced economist and  statesman, and if I were to work with him, I think we would  agree on a mutually complementary decision on this or that  issue."    Asked by UNIAN to explain his differences with Leonid  Kravchuk, recently coming to light in an ongoing indirect  debate, Ivan Plyushch said: "I think Leonid Makarovych is the  kind of politician who is very adept at adapting to public  opinion. I believe a politician is a person who forms public  opinion and leads it forward."</p>

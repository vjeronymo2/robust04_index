			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Truce agreed in lecturers' dispute The Natfhe lecturers' union and the further education colleges have agreed a truce in the long-running dispute over the introduction of new contracts and conditions of service, John Authers and Richard Donkin write. The union has been in dispute with the Colleges' Employers' Forum over the contracts since colleges were removed from local authority control in April. Local union branches in up to 120 colleges were due to hold strikes this month over the contracts, which would involve halving lecturers' annual holiday allowance. College principals feared that strikes during this period would inflict serious damage, as most course enrolments are handled in September. Natfhe abandoned national negotiations in March after the appeal court ruled that its ballot over national action was unlawful. But in a joint statement Natfhe and the forum said they had agreed a formal schedule of negotiations to last until the end of this month. This aims to reach 'a national framework collective agreement that will embrace flexibility, productivity and necessary contractual safeguards'. While negotiations continue, the forum has recommended its members not to introduce any new contracts, and the union has asked its branches to suspend all industrial action. Mr John Akker, Natfhe general secretary, said the statement followed 'intensive talks between the two sides'. The joint statement added that 'substantial progress' had been made on the length of the working week, the length of the working year, and workload protection. Mr Roger Ward, the forum's chief executive, said that about 40 per cent of lecturers and about 90 per cent of college middle-managers had signed new contracts.</p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER NEWS  </P> <P> Microwave Oven Settlement Proposed: Thousands of people who bought Magic Chef  microwave ovens, thinking they were new, would collect $35 each under a  proposed settlement of three lawsuits against the manufacturer.  </P> <P> Since January, 1987, Maytag Corp.'s Anniston plant repackaged or reconditioned  ovens that customers had returned and sold the ovens as new for $80 to $160.  Maytag denied any liability in the settlement proposal but agreed to halt the  practice and offer refunds to the 45,000 to 50,000 customers nationwide who  bought the ovens. Maytag also agreed to pay up to $300,000 total to the parties  filing the suits: the Alabama Attorney General's Office and a Birmingham law  firm.  </P></p>

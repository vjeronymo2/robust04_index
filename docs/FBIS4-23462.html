			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, June 6 (AFP) -- Nigerian police have arrested  a fourth member of the country's dissolved Senate, which threw  down a gauntlet to the junta last week by declaring itself in  session, a senator told AFP on Monday [6 June].    The security forces on Sunday detained Abu Ibrahim of the  northern Katsina State, said ex-Senator Bola Tinubu, who was  himself still being sought by police after the Senate declared  the military regime illegal.    Speaking by cellular telephone from his hideaway after the  arrests began at the weekend, Tinubu said that police officers  had visited his Lagos home several times, demanding that he  report to police headquarters.    Two other former senators, Polycarp Nwite and Okoroafor,  were  arrested and detained Saturday, respectively in Lagos and  Abeokuta.    Tinubu is a founder member of the National Democratic  Coalition (NADECO), a broad-based nationwide grouping of  pro-democracy activists and rights movements which has called on  General Sani Abacha's regime to stand down.    Another leading NADECO member, former Ogun State governor  Segun Obosa, was arrested on Friday.    Several members of the National Assembly, which was also  dissolved by Abacha after he seized power last November, pledged  Sunday to show "solidarity" for the detained former speaker of  the Senate, Ameh Ebute, whenever he is brought to court for  trial.    "He is our leader and he deserves our moral support in his  moment of travail," four of the ex-legislators told AFP in a  telephone interview. They did not disclose what form the  support would take but said it would be demonstrated around the  court premises.    Detained ex-Senator Nwite, who spoke to AFP Sunday from his  detention room on his cellular phone, alleged that the  conditions under which he was being held were harsh. He  complained that he had not been given food, water or a bed to  sleep on.    Like the Senate, the National Assembly has called on Abacha  to quit to pave the way for the installation of Moshood Abiola,  the winner on unofficial results of last June's presidential  election, which was annulled by the military junta of the time.    The government has described their action as "illegal,  criminal and very dangerous." The Senate, in a meeting in  defiance of a ban on political activity, has for its part  labelled the junta "illegal."    The military regime plans to stage a constitutional  conference over four months from June 27, which it describes as  a key aspect of its own plans to restore power to elected  civilians.    Pro-democracy activists have called for a boycott of the  conference.</p>

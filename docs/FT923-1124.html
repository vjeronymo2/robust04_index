			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Cash rates firmer CASH RATES in the sterling money market firmed yesterday after the Bank of England forecast a very large shortage of Pounds 1.95bn at the start of its operations. Rates had softened markedly the day before, after the Bank announced a reduction in base rates to 9 per cent, with three-month money closing on Wednesday night at around 9 1/16 per cent. However, the three-month rate ended firmer yesterday at 9 3/16 per cent on the offered side, and the one-month offered rate remained high, at 9 1/2 per cent. A clearing bank dealer said that the shortage reflected the huge amount of sterling that was bought on the foreign exchanges last week, which is estimated at about Pounds 15bn. But the Bank also announced that it would be offering a roll-over of facilities that have been offered to the largest banks, building societies and the gilt edged market to relieve the unprecedented shortage pressures. The interest rate on these facilities will be at the market rate. Sterling futures rose early in the day after the Bundesbank and the German government showed strong support for the French franc, which came under intense selling pressure on the foreign exchanges. Dealers assumed that the Bundesbank might be prepared to cut interest rates to support the franc, and that this would facilitate another reduction in UK base rates without undermining sterling's position any further. However, some dealers believe that another UK base rate cut will undermine sterling, pushing up inflation in the longer term. 'The 12 per cent devaluation that we have seen so far puts about 3 per cent on UK inflation,' said one dealer yesterday. The December short sterling contract opened at 91.90, but later fell back to finish at 91.80. Strictly speaking this assumes that three-month money at the end of the year will be at 8.1 per cent. In early operations the Bank purchased Pounds 70m in a repur-chase agreement at the new rate of 8 15/16 per cent. In further operations, the Bank bought Pounds 88m of Band 1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent, Pounds 48m of Band 2 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent, and Pounds 558m in a repurchase agreement. The Bank bought Pounds 556m of Band 1 Treasury bills and Pounds 535m of Band 1 bank bills. Late assistance was Pounds 640m.</p>

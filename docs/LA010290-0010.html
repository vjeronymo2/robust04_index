			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEARING FUR  </P> <P> I wear fur and I wear it proudly. As an American, I have the right whether to  wear fur, or leather shoes, or eat chicken.  </P> <P> I'm tired of the shock-wave media and propaganda of animal activists. And I'm  horrified that they will destroy property ("Animal Activists Blamed in Wide  Ranch Sabotage," Nov. 19) to get their message across.  </P> <P> Yes, I found out exactly how the fur industry operates, its role in the  conservation of our natural habitats and species, and no difference in the  raising of fur or chicken, and the trapping of animals to prevent  overpopulation and spread of disease. I am educated, I care about ecology, I  care about the survival of our planet, and in having a choice, I'm wearing my  decision.  </P> <P> RACHEL WALKER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

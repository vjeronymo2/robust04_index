			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Survey of Four Cities Partnership (8): Relatively resilient  -Karlsruhe KARLSRUHE can legitimately claim to be Germany's dream city. According to legend, the town came into being after the Margrave Karl-Wilhelm von Baden-Durlach fell asleep under a tree after a day's hunting. He dreamt of a splendid palace, with pathways leading up to the building like a fan. On waking he determined to move his court from Durlach and build the palace on the spot where he slept. Thus in 1715 Carol's-Ruhe - 'Charles' Peace' - was founded. It is no exaggeration to say that modern Karlsruhe retains the charm identified by its founder more than two and a half centuries ago. With 273,000 inhabitants it is the 20th largest city in Germany, bright and open. At its centre is the palace built by the margrave, and the expanse of the Marktplatz, surrounded by the 18th century facades built by the architect Friedrich Weinbrenner. Following the contours of the dream, the rest of the city spreads out, fan-like, from the centre, its suburbs interspersed with parkland. The local food is more refined than the average German fare, reflecting the influence of France, barely 20km away. The scenic delights of Alsace and the Black Forest are likewise not far away. Karlruhe is a pleasant place to live, work and study, with none of the abrasive qualities of many of Germany's bigger cities. 'It retains many of the qualities of a small town but lacks nothing that a large city can offer,' claims Mr Horst Zajonc, head of the city's business promotion office. The third largest city in the south-western state of Baden-Wurttemberg, after Stuttgart and Mannheim, Karlsruhe came late to industrialisation. In time of European warfare its geographical position close to the French border discouraged investment in manufacturing industry. Until 1952 it was the capital of the state of Baden, giving the city a reputation as 'civil-servant' city. Germany's federal constitutional court ensures that Karlsruhe still plays a role as an administrative centre, but the city's regional importance diminished after Baden merged with the state of Wurttemberg to form what developed into the most prosperous of western Germany's Lander, and the city of Stuttgart became the state capital. For years Karlsruhe trailed behind Stuttgart, as the former state of Baden failed to develop as successfully as Wurttemberg - or Swabia, as the eastern half of the state is called. Swabia is an almost mythical land, its inhabitants fabled for their love of independence and hard work; technically minded entrepreneurs who built up corporate giants such as Daimler-Benz - Germany's biggest industrial company - or Robert Bosch, the car components group, not to mention dozens of medium-sized or Mittelstand companies which acted as the motor of Germany's post-war economic miracle. The charms of Baden, its scenery and its vineyards, did not appear to compensate for the success of Swabia; Karlsruhe had to work hard to fashion for itself an identity. The city has built itself up as a technology centre (a term reflecting the presence of more scientists as a percentage of the population than anywhere in Germany), an abundance of research centres, and the Fridericiana Technical University, founded in 1825 and the oldest of its kind in Germany, together with many other technically-orientated higher education establishments. Research institutes in the city include the federal nuclear research centre (Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe); three Fraunhofer institutes (one for system technology and innovation research, one for chemical technology, another for information technology and data processing, which is a special strength of the local university); a research centre for informatics; federal institutes for mathematics and data-processing, for nutrition, for hydraulic engineering; the state institute for environmental protection. Some 10,000 people are employed in the city's research institutes. There are also numerous other institutes which specialise in converting research results into commercially viable products and processes. Karlsruhe has linked up with seven municipalities and two rural districts in Baden to form the so-called TechnologieRegion Karlsruhe, proudly sold as a mixture of 'high-life and high-tech'. For decades, the 'ideas factories' of Karlsruhe and neighbouring towns were not enough to give Baden the edge against the real factories of Wurttemberg. Now, amid Germany's worst recession since the second world war, the tables have been somewhat turned. The Stuttgart region's dependence on the car-making industry and on machine-tool manufacturing means that Wurttemberg has become a German crisis region. Unemployment is higher than it has ever been. GDP for the state of Baden-Wurttemberg fell more sharply in the first six months of the year than for western Germany - by 4 per cent compared to 2.6 per cent. It is easy to exaggerate the problems of the Stuttgart region - after all, its decline is from a very high base - but there is no doubting that it is suffering badly amid a crisis in the European car making industry and the collapse in world demand for capital goods which has hit the state's machine-tool industry particularly badly. By contrast, Karlsruhe's economy, while hardly immune from Germany's recession, is looking more resilient. 'For the first time in 10 years our unemployment figures are better than the average for the state as a whole,' Zajonc of the business promotion office says gleefully. In July last year unemployment in the city was 4.9 per cent compared to 4.6 per cent for Baden-Wurttemberg. In July this year unemployment had risen to 6.5 per cent for Karlsruhe - and to 6.7 per cent for the entire Land. This relative resilience reflects the structure of Karlsruhe's economy: less dependent on manufacturing and on big companies than Baden-Wurttemberg as a whole. Manufacturing accounts for about a third of the city's jobs. The average number of employees at the region's 10,000 companies is 180. The service sector is well-represented: big local employers include the Karlsruhe Lebensversicherung life insurance company; the Badenia Bausparkassen investment company; the Landeskreditbank Baden-Wurttemberg, a regional bank; and the Heinrich Heine mail-order firm. The region's heavy reliance on research institutes is not good for Karlsruhe's employment outlook: they are mainly public-sector bodies feeling the impact of the German government's need to cut expenditure. At the Kernforschungszentrum, for example, where 90 per cent of its DM700m budget comes from government grants, the workforce is set to shrink by 480 people - about 15 per cent - by the end of 1995. Despite the clouds of unemployment, one fact ensures that Karlsruhe maintains some of the dream-like qualities of its origins. It gets more sunshine than any other city in Germany.</p>

			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> International track and field's full doping commission will study drug tests of  shotput world record-holder Randy Barnes in what an official described as "an  added step" in the testing process.  </P> <P> Barnes was tested last summer after a meet at Malmo, Sweden. His urine specimen  was divided into two samples. A French sports newspaper reported that the first  part of the sample had shown positive results for an undisclosed banned  substance. Under IAAF rules, an athlete is not considered to have tested  positive unless both parts of the sample fail.  </P></p>

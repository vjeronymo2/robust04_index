			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUG IN MY COMPUTER WASN'T A ROACH  </P> <P> My friend Jane is worried that she may have a cockroach in her computer. She  thinks she might have seen one crawl in through the slot where you put the  floppy disks. Jane's got a problem on her hands.  </P> <P> I won't mention Jane's last name, because she finds it a little embarrassing to  have a cockroach in her computer. For one thing, it sounds sort of  inappropriate -- like taking your Honda in and telling the service manager that  you have reason to believe that it may have a guppy in the crankcase.  </P> <P> Also, it is well known that the cockroach is not a solitary creature, and Jane  doesn't want her mother to know that her apartment might be crawling with  cockroaches.  </P> <P> She hadn't even been telling her friends. I wouldn't have known about this at  all if my own computer hadn't developed Disk Error 31. Here are the symptoms of  Disk Error 31: Occasionally, when you try to save what you've written, you  erase what you've written instead, and the screen suddenly says "Disk Error  31."  </P> <P> I tried to find out what Disk Error 31 was. I figured that if someone took the  trouble to number an error, the number must refer to something, and if you knew  what it referred to you might be able to figure out what to do about it. I  figured there was a list somewhere explaining which error was which. One line  would say, maybe, "Disk Error 29: Loose wiring" and the next line would say  "Disk Error 30: A little joke from the manufacturer in Seoul, Korea." The line  after that would identify Disk Error 31.  </P> <P> It turns out that there isn't any list -- or if there is, it's highly  classified. It turns out that Disk Error 31 is like most computer problems: The  software people tell you that it's your hardware and the hardware people tell  you that it's your software. A third party may tell you that it's your software  telling you something about your hardware, or vice-versa. Nobody would admit  knowing why this particular disk error was called Disk Error 31.  </P> <P> After a while, I quit trying to find out about it. Instead, I just said it over  and over again, the way some spacey people on the subway chant things, or I  wrote poems about it. Sometimes, I imagined a scene in which one of the  hardware people or software people is strapped in a chair, and I am leaning  against a desk in front of him. A twitchy-looking man with a scar is sitting in  the corner. I am speaking in the correct tones sometimes used by a German  officer talking to a downed American pilot in a World War II movie. "I do hope  you will agree to tell me what Disk Error 31 is," I say. "If not, Herr Mueller  has his methods."  </P> <P> Finally, my friend James fixed my computer. James knows everything about  computers -- except, of course, what Disk Error 31 is. I often call him for  computer advice, even though he spends most of his time in New Iberia, La., and  I spend most of my time in New York. In this case, he made a house call. He  fixed my computer by replacing everything inside of it. One of the things he  replaced contained Disk Error 31. We don't know which one.  </P> <P> Jane, who happened to be visiting at the same time, was so impressed that she  asked James if he could answer "a rather embarrassing computer question." The  question was what you do if you think you might have a cockroach in your  system.  </P> <P> "Well," James said, "they've got these programs that are supposed to get all  the bugs out, but I don't suppose they mean it that way." Then he didn't say  anything.  </P> <P> Something suddenly occurred to me. I got everything James had taken out of my  computer and put it all in the kitchen in the dark. Then, after a while, I  turned the lights on to see if anything scurried out across the kitchen floor.  It had occurred to me that the secret list might say "Disk Error 31: cockroach  in the system." But nothing scurried. Now we'll never know.  </P></p>

Today is marked as the day  of solidarity with Azerbaijani people around the world. On this  symbolic day, I congratulate all the Azerbaijanis in the world  and wish stronger solidarity among them in the future.    The year 1993 was painful and problematic for Azerbaijan and  its people. [words indistinct], a part of our republic's  territory was occupied as a result of Armenia's aggression, and  our fellow countrymen and kinsmen were forced to leave their  places of birth and become refugees in 1993. Azerbaijan  experienced a serious economic and social crisis. Our republic  has successfully emerged from all those difficulties and  problems and has confidently entered 1994.    The confrontation among individual forces, the harm done to  Azerbaijan by the separatist forces, and the [word indistinct]  disrupted social and political stability in our republic and  brought Azerbaijan to the verge of civil war in mid-1993. The  threat of civil war has been averted, but bloodshed occurred and  that state of affairs created a very tense situation in the  republic.    Thanks to our people's awareness, bloodshed was prevented  [as  heard], the threat of civil war was averted, the confrontation  was eliminated, and the separatist forces that tried to fragment  our republic were rendered ineffective. Consequently, our  republic has been able to resolve its problems in an atmosphere  of peace and stability.    Azerbaijan tried to obstruct Armenia's aggression and the  armed attacks by Armenians in 1993. Regrettably, we have  suffered several defeats and lost part of our territory. Many  of our citizens were forced to become refugees in their homeland  as a result of the occupation of our territory by the Armenian  military forces. More than a million refugees have been  resettled in the other parts of Azerbaijan. That has had a very  serious effect on the general situation in the Republic,  particularly the internal situation. However, it must be noted  that the situation has changed.    Changes have taken place as a result of the establishment  and  organization of the Republic's Armed Forces and the work carried  out to successfully defend Azerbaijan's territory. Our military  forces and our struggling young men are heroically defending our  territory and successfully retaliating against the enemy  attacks. They are dealing blows to the enemy. It can be  pointed out that all the attacks launched by the Armenian Armed  Forces over the last few months have been rebuffed. Our  republic's military forces have defended the positions they  hold. In fact, they have shown how strong Azerbaijan's defenses  have become.    Bloody fighting is taking place on all battlefronts, and the  Armenian Armed Forces are to blame for the clashes.    We wish to reiterate that Azerbaijan wants a peaceful end to  the war, which has caused a calamity for our republic. In fact,  our republic has taken several steps in that direction, and we  want to reiterate our position at the present time.  Regrettably, our republic's initiatives have failed to yield a  result.    Nevertheless, Azerbaijan is now able to strengthen its  military will. I wish to assure our people that our armed  forces will take the necessary measures to successfully defend  our republic and retrieve our occupied territory.    A war is being fought. Casualties are being inflicted on our  people. The heroic sons of the Republic's people have been  martyred in the battlefronts while defending our territory. I  want to take this opportunity to extend condolences to the  families and parents of all our martyrs. I bow my head in  acknowledgment of their heroic effort. God bless the souls of  the martyrs. May their graves be filled with bliss and may God  give patience to their families.    I am convinced that our people are now able to successfully  resolve the serious problems that exist now.    I want to convey my greetings to our officers and men who  are  bravely fighting at the battlefronts and to all our people on  this festive day. I congratulate them on the occasion of the  New Year and wish them good health and success in performing  their sacred duties.    The war is continuing. The number of refugees has  increased as a result of the Armenian military attacks. I  sincerely congratulate the refugees and all the people on the  occasion of the New Year. Yes, it is a tradition in our  republic that our citizens mark the New Year in their homes.  Regrettably, many of our citizens have lost their homes and  their parents. They have sought shelter in various places. The  people and the state respect them, wherever they are. I pray  that they maintain high spirits and morale.    A serious crisis exists in Azerbaijan. The economic and  social crisis has been caused by nearly six years of fighting  and certain objective and subjective reasons. This state of  affairs has reduced the standard of living. Our people are  living in a difficult situation, but we are aware that our  people are [word indistinct] and will resolve the existing  problems. They will leave the painful and problematic year  behind. Changes will occur in our economy in 1994, and the  standard of living will improve day by day.    Today is the day of solidarity for the Azerbaijanis. I wish  for strong solidarity to exist among all the Azerbaijanis.  Solidarity must be established among all the Azerbaijani people  in the world, particularly those who live in independent  Azerbaijan.    Two years have passed since Azerbaijan declared its  independence. We are now moving into the third year. We have  significant tasks to perform. A state of strong solidarity  among Azerbaijan's people is necessary for the realization of  these tasks. We can contribute toward solidarity among the  Azerbaijanis in the world if we establish real solidarity among  the Azerbaijani people in our republic. In view of that, I urge  our people to unite and establish solidarity. I also wish to  assure our people that 1994 will [words indistinct].    I want to reiterate that we are defending our homeland's  territory. We are working to end the war in Azerbaijan. We are  working to improve the current situation. We have taken several  steps in that direction, and we shall continue to do so. On  behalf of Azerbaijan's people, I signed the Paris Charter in  France on 20 December. This reaffirmed to the world that  Azerbaijan is committed to peace, tranquillity, and security.  However, we shall continue to strengthen our defense forces and  make an effort to retake our occupied territory. Our people can  rest assured that all the necessary measures will be taken to  maintain our republic's territorial integrity and prevent the  violation of our borders.    I want to assure our esteemed countrymen that our territory  will be liberated, regardless of what may happen in 1994. The  refugees will return to their homes, and Azerbaijan's  territorial integrity and state structure will be maintained.    I congratulate you again on the occasion of the New Year,  and  I wish all the Republic's citizens peace, security, happiness,  and success. Happy New Year.</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: German retailer advances by 7% Kaufhof Holding, the German retailer, yesterday reported 1993 profits of DM240m (Dollars 145.5m), up 7 per cent from DM222m the year before. The company also forecast steady earnings for the current year. Kaufhof is set to take a stake of between 50 and 70 per cent in Horten, a smaller department store chain. This would increase group turnover to around DM28bn, comparable to that of Karstadt, Germany's biggest retailer. Final details of the deal will be announced in about three weeks. Turnover in the first four months of this year rose 8 per cent, to DM7.6bn. Mr Jens Odewald, chief executive, predicted retail sales would pick up throughout the year as Germany pulled out of its worst recession. The dividend will be raised by DM1.5 to DM13.50 for ordinary shares, and by the same amount, to DM14.50, for preferential shares.</p>

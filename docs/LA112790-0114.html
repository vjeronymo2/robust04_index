			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> COX CAN'T SHAKE HAMSTRING PROBLEM  </P> <P> Coach John Robinson said that the team is very concerned about receiver Aaron  Cox's recurring hamstring problems and is trying to figure out why the problem  persists. Cox, in the starting lineup Sunday for injured Henry Ellard, strained  the same right hamstring that has bothered him his whole pro career and missed  most of the game.  </P> <P> "We're convinced now that there's some kind of chemical imbalance in his system  that is causing it," Robinson said. "He's almost been inactive on this team  since he's come here. Even when he's here, three weeks prior he's missed. So  he's never been able to establish himself. We've done a lot of testing since  this training camp. . . . I do know it's just not normal."  </P> <P> Ellard is also having recurring hamstring problems, and Robinson hinted that  the team could add another wide receiver to fill the roster spot that will be  created by moving linebacker Greg Clark to the injured-reserve list. Clark  broke his right leg Sunday and is out for the season.  </P> <P> Robinson praised the performances of linebacker Mike Wilcher, who was a key  member of the Rams' six-defensive back defense Sunday and had 11 tackles, and  fullback Buford McGee, who threw for a touchdown and ran for another. . . .  Although it was in a winning cause, Ram quarterback Jim Everett went without a  touchdown pass Sunday for the third consecutive game and has thrown only one in  his last five games.

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Wily Mitterrand finds way out of summit clash over farm subsidies ISOLATION at an EC summit is not a position to which President Francois Mitterrand, longest serving of Community leaders, is accustomed. At one stage, it looked as though France might be placed in the dock at Edinburgh for its rooted opposition to the EC-US agreement on farm trade in the Gatt negotia tions. So, it is with considerable relief that Mr Mitterrand now feels that he has the active connivance of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and the passive acquiescence of Prime Minister John Major, to ensure that the issue will not figure too high on the Edinburgh agenda. The odds are that Mr Mitterrand will be satisfied if his fellow leaders follow their foreign and farm ministers earlier this week in insisting that the agreement be balanced by progress in areas like services and tariffs. As the president made clear in an interview with the FT this week, his bottom line is that no amount of progress in the non-farm aspects of the Gatt negotiations can compensate for what France feels is an unfair agricultural bargain with Washington. But he will not feel forced to make a stand unless Mr Major insists on hailing the farm agreement in the Edinburgh communique. Paris is fairly confident that Bonn, in its intensive pre-summit contacts with London, will have persuaded Mr Major not to push the matter. But Mr Mitterrand cannot be totally certain of that until this evening, when he dines with Mr Major in the Scottish capital. Partly in its bid to win southern European support for its Gatt position, France is now readier to agree demands by Spain and other poorer EC states for extra structural economic aid from an enlarged EC budget. France is the third largest net contributor to the budget, after Germany and Britain. 'We cannot agree to all that is demanded of us,' said Mr Mitterrand, 'but we are ready to accept a lot.' However, there is one French position of principle that could prove awkward for the UK presidency. Mr Mitterrand will stress that the richer countries promised more money for the poorer ones at the Maastricht summit a year ago, and that all the Maastricht commitments, including, of course, ratification of the treaty, must be respected. On this, Mr Mitterrand says he is quite inflexible. He will take a hard line both against giving any general opt-out from the treaty for Denmark, and against any appearance by the UK government that it is trying to hide behind Denmark by delaying the final House of Commons ratification decision until after a second Danish referendum. With barely disguised contempt, he said this week: 'I don't see how Great Britain can submit its decision to another country.' He added: 'Europe is not stalled. Ten countries out of 12 have ratified. One country said no. . . Britain is lagging behind and the delay should not be too lengthy but I have not given up hope of seeing Britain adhere to the treaty.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nancy Pazos: "An Agitated Government Cabinet </F> Meeting"]    [Text] During a lively cabinet meeting Domingo Cavallo  complained about the lack of solidarity shown by the Executive  and Legislative branches in defending the economic model.  President Menem interrupted to tell him that he himself had  supported it. Saul Bouer, who was seated directly opposite  Cavallo, ended his rift with the economy minister.    Domingo Cavallo waited for the right moment. When Armando  Caro Figueroa finished his weekly defense of more flexible labor  laws, the economy minister asked for the floor: "I am going to  raise a point of privilege," he said, unexpectedly recalling his  brief time in the legislature. Everyone realized that this  marked the beginning of what they were all waiting for: the last  round in the fight between Cavallo and Buenos Aires Mayor Saul  Bouer.    The justification for his solemn introduction, which was  unlike the language typical of cabinet meetings, was not long in  coming. Cavallo complained officially about the "lack of  solidarity of the Executive and Legislative" branches with him  and his efforts in light of developments over the past few days  (read: his defense of the automotive industry against the  onslaught of the DGI [General Directorate of Taxation]), the  battle with Saul Bouer and Miguel Angel Broda, and the incident  with federal Judge Roberto Marquevich, among others.    This was actually the conclusion that Cavallo drew after a  detailed rundown of the attacks that he said he had suffered for  the past two weeks. To show that he was not talking about  rumors, the minister had done his homework and brought a folder  containing clippings of all the newspaper articles about him  during this time into the Situation Room of the Government  Palace.  <H5>  Menem Speaks Out </H5>   "Except for the president, who clearly backed me, no one  here  spoke up to defend me. The Executive and Legislative branches  showed a lack of solidarity with me," Cavallo said, reducing the  room to an uncommon silence. A reply came from the only person  around the table who was not holding his breath.    "Mr. Minister, do you know what the Executive Branch is?"  asked Carlos Menem, as the other cabinet ministers looked on as  mere spectators.    "Because in case you do not, Mr. Minister, I am the  Executive  Branch. And I defended you not only this morning but also since  I was on my trip through Colombia. So, the only thing that ought  to concern you is what I say; the others are just incidental  colleagues. Moreover, what I say I say on my behalf and on  behalf of my ministers...."    Hugo Anzorreguy's departure to answer an urgent call  succeeded in tempering the chill that had descended on the room.  By then the president's outburst had given Jorge Matzkin the  courage to defend the other branch that Cavallo had attacked,  the Legislature.    "There is a confusion of terms here," began the head of the  Justicialist bloc in the Chamber of Deputies. "The minister has  repeatedly gotten our political solidarity; but we Peronists owe  Bouer our friendship as well, and here we are talking about a  different kind of solidarity...."    Matzkin avoided direct reference to the heart of the matter:  Peronism stands behind Cavallo's efforts but defends the  Justicialists whom the minister is attacking. It was a way of  excluding Cavallo from the Justicialist "space" by seeking to  confirm a political identity.    Menem then resorted to an almost paternal tone to illustrate  his remarks and put an end to the issue: "Don't forget," he  said, looking at all times into Cavallo's blue eyes, "that you  have to be on good terms with God; the angels are always  around..." according to the account of someone at the meeting.    The president was thus trying to put an end to the episode  that began last week when the former untouchables broke into the  Sevel agencies.    The minister gave an extremely personal analysis of the  situation yesterday: "The fact is that if I do not come out and  defend the model, I do not know who will..." he complained from  his chair, directly opposite Bouer's, in justifying his verbal  excesses.    The mayor interrupted the minister's monologue only to tell  his colleagues that the incident that had set them at odds  (Cavallo accused him of having leaked the news that led to the  run on the peso in 1991) was now "completely behind them."    "We have already spoken in private, and there is nothing  else  to clarify," Bouer said 48 hours after his last attempt to  resign. Several cabinet members remarked afterwards that  yesterday Cavallo had made every possible "gesture" towards the  mayor. He even apologized over the phone to Bouer's wife and  daughter, who were the ones most interested in seeing the mayor  return to private life.  <H5>  Cavallo Attacks </H5>   Cavallo had begun his outburst by reading the main remarks  that Judge Roberto Marquevich had made about him (calling him  "raving" and authoritarian, among other things) in the newspaper  interview that appeared on Wednesday.    Newspaper clipping in hand, Cavallo received his first show  of solidarity. Maria Julia Alsogaray, the secretary of the  environment, recalled other "inappropriate" remarks by the San  Isidro federal judge. Marquevich, who is now investigating  Francisco Macri for tax evasion, was the one who sent another  prominent businessmen, Roberto Constantini, to jail for an  environmental crime. Again according to Maria Julia, the judge  had also attempted to implicate her in the case.    But Cavallo was not satisfied with talking just about  Marquevich. He also complained about Alberto Piotti, the former  judge who became a pro-Menem deputy and is now the brand-new  Buenos Aires security secretary. Piotti, a member of the "Rating  Group" (the band of deputies who wander around the mass media  defending Menem's policies), had criticized Cavallo.    Menem did not miss his chance to show, at little cost, how  far his solidarity with his minister goes. He looked around him  and saw Munir Menem, his brother, chief of presidential advisers  and the virtual "owner" of the seats at "Tango 01." The  president immediately ordered him to exclude Piotti from the  presidential party that will be traveling to Spain.    An hour after the meeting ended, the rumors about the  short-circuit between Cavallo and the Executive Branch reached  the financial district. But the sharp fall in the stock market  lasted only 45 minutes. Calm then returned to nervous offices in  the financial district and the government.</p>

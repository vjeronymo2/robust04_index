			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Vendome shares dip despite 13% advance Shares in Vendome Luxury Group fell 17p to 483p yesterday, as the holding company for brands such as Cartier and Dunhill reported a 13 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from SFr194.2m to SFr218.9m (Pounds 105.7m) for the six months to September 30. In sterling terms, the rise was greater at 21 per cent. The comparative figures have been adjusted to remove the distorting effects of last year's non-recurring SFr48.6m reconstruction costs, following the group's its creation from the luxury businesses of Richemont, Rothmans and Dunhill. Turnover climbed 8 per cent to SFr1.25bn (SFr1.16bn). Operating profits were SFr203.3m (SFr181.4m). Sales in the Far East rose the sharpest - at 13 per cent to SFr469.1m (SFr416.7m), though Europe remains Vendome's main market. Here sales grew 8 per cent to SFr524.6m (SFr484.6m). Behind the Far Eastern performance lay stronger growth than previously from Japan - a result of a rise in tourism and a strong yen. Mr Joseph Kanoui, chairman, said: 'I'm proud Europe is our main market, but I would be as proud in five years to say the Far East had overtaken it.' The group is making inroads into China, where it already has four Dunhill stores and three Cartier. Lord Douro, deputy chairman, said there were more to come. Sales in the Americas slipped almost 2 per cent to SFr230.2m, though they rose by 5 per cent in dollar terms. The greatest fall was from the rest of the world, which includes the Middle East. Here sales declined 16 per cent to SFr28.5m. He was unworried by downturns in certain markets, however, saying the group's geographical spread was its protection. Mr Kanoui said the group continued to suffer counterfeiting at the hands of organised crime and imitation from other companies, though he was reluctant to give figures. He hoped the situation would improve with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which requires signatories to help protect intellectual property. Leather goods showed the strongest growth with sales up 22 per cent to SFR138.1m, while perfumes was the only sector down - by 13 per cent to SFr45.4m. Earnings rose 12 per cent to SFr0.248 and the maiden interim dividend is a gross SFr0.075, which shareholders can receive as a net UK pay-out of 2.9p, excluding any associated tax credit.</p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / International Company News: GAN may sell FFr1bn of bank shares Groupe des Assurances Nationales (GAN), the state-controlled French insurance company, might put on the market next year shares in Credit Industriel et Commercial worth around FFr1bn, writes David Buchan in Paris. The capital injection is to take the form of a transfer to GAN of the state's 7.1 per cent stake in the bank, in which GAN already holds 85.5 per cent. GAN said it needed the extra capital following its FFr846m loss in the first half of this year because of heavy damage insurance claims, poor returns on property investments and lower bond values. The move will raise GAN's stake in CIC to 92.6 per cent, giving it also all the voting rights in the bank.</p>

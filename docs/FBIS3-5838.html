			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Thai and Cambodian governments have agreed to  maintain their existing aviation pact until October -- giving  another breathing space to the three partly Thai-owned airlines  operating between the countries, before Cambodia's national  carrier takes off later this year.    The Thai government is trying hard to convince Cambodia to  support the three airlines, including Kampuchea Airlines,  Cambodia International Airlines, and SK Air in addition to Thai  Airways International [THAI] and Bangkok Airways.    Cambodia however has already established a solid  relationship  with Singapore for its aviation future.    Aviation Department Director-General Sisuk Chantharangsu met  Keo Saphal, the Director-General of Cambodia's Aviation  Department last month. Both agreed to extend the current  aviation agreement with some changes. They plan to meet again  after October.    The amended agreement calls for each country to be allowed  to  increase its weekly capacity from currently 1,800 to 2,000  seats. Thailand plans to give this additional quota to THAI and  Bangkok Airways, while Cambodia will give it to Cambodia  International Airlines, an industry source said.    Currently, Kampuchea and Cambodia International Airlines  have  seven flights a week while SK Airlines has four.    Thai businessmen are involved in ventures with all three of  Cambodia's airlines, a result of the country's political  instability. In November last year, the Cambodian government,  together with Singapore Airlines (which holds 40 per cent) set  up Royal Air Cambodge (RAC) as Cambodia's official national  airline to replace Kampuchea.    The emergence of RAC will affect the three pioneering  airlines. RAC was due to start flying by the middle of this  year, linking Phnom Penh, Bangkok, Singapore and Hong Kong.  Flights to Japan Taiwan and Vietnam will commence later.  Initially the new airline will use 130-180 seat Boeing 737s.    The industry source said Thailand's Aviation Department had  expected the February meeting to result in the cancellation of  the flights of the other three airlines. This was not the case.    "At first they (officials at the Thai aviation agency)  thought Cambodia would have RAC benefit from aviation rights.  It is likely that RAC is still poised for (taking over these)  operations after October; therefore they (the Cambodian  government) prolonged the present agreement," the source said.    He added that Thai investors failed to satisfy the Cambodian  government, having yet to begin improving the airports, as they  had earlier promised to do.    Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak had helped  negotiate with the Cambodian government for the three airlines'  continued operation.    Singapore Airlines now has the potential to control  aviation-related businesses in Cambodia in the future, including  catering, cargo, ticketing and reservation systems, the source  said.    Meanwhile, the source said, Thailand approved Vietnam's  first-ever request for transit rights in Bangkok for  France-bound flights, starting next season. Vietnam's move is  expected to threaten THAI's operations on that route.    "We have yet to estimate the damage from Vietnam's approach  to the market. Vietnam's economy is rapidly growing, but we are  going to lose chances. THAI will be affected," the source said.</p>

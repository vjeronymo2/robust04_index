			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bold deal soothes anxious onlookers - Why RTZ's Pounds 800m disposal solves MB-Caradon's predicament / Building a new MB-Caradon THE enthusiastic response by the stock market to MB-Caradon's purchase of RTZ's industrial activities was as much relief at the deals not done as a welcome for the acquisition. MB-Caradon was in a tricky situation. In April it raised Pounds 467.5m net of costs from selling its quarter stake in CarnaudMetalbox, the packaging group, and the money was burning a hole in its pocket. With a market capitalisation yesterday morning of Pounds 1.43bn, the CMB money represented almost a third of MB-Caradon's worth. With interest rates low, the return on the cash was negligible compared to what it could be earning if invested in a business. That was bound to depress the group's current year earnings. So MB-Caradon needed to put that money back to work as quickly as possible, and wanted to invest in the area of building products which it regards as its core. At the same time, the stock market was pushing up the prices of likely target companies as it anticipated the effect of recovery on such cyclical stocks. The market feared that MB-Caradon's urgent need to invest would draw it into a hostile bid for a quoted company, and force it to pay well over the odds. Said one analyst yesterday: 'The RTZ deal is the answer to a maiden's prayer. As far as buying a quoted company goes, MB-Caradon was left for dead. The market had pushed up prices, leaving no room for a takeover premium.' Another concern was MB-Caradon's earlier intention to expand in European building materials. With recession still deepening in continental Europe, but asset prices not yet reflecting that, it would have been just the wrong time to buy. The Pounds 800m deal announced yesterday to buy most of RTZ's Pillar group of industrial businesses is by far the better solution. It takes MB-Caradon into the North American building products market, and adds leading brands in the UK, such as MK Electric, Friedland, Catnic and Duraflex. The European business is relatively small at 8 per cent of turnover. The acquisition price might look high at first - the exit p/e on stated pre-tax profits of Pounds 51.3m is about 24. But that is after Pounds 16.5m of head office costs - which MB-Caradon might halve - and Pounds 8.6m of reorganisation costs. Adjusting for those and the pension contribution MB-Caradon will have to pay, the exit p/e for 1992 might be nearer 19, somewhat below the building materials sector rating. Even so, the deal is a bold step. It will double the size of MB-Caradon's building products operations, and brings in a few businesses about which the group knows nothing. But in spite of its short history, MB-Caradon is no stranger to the big deal. And Mr Peter Jansen, chief executive, and his team have built a faithful following in the City. The original business of Caradon was formed in 1985 through a Pounds 61m management buy-out of the building activities of Reed International, which was beginning to concentrate on its publishing interests. Mr Jansen came in as chief executive and Mr Antony Hichens as chairman, positions they still hold. They had worked together at Redland, the building materials group. In 1987 Caradon floated at a market value of Pounds 134.4m and the following year it acquired Everest double glazing plus its consumer finance business, also from RTZ, for Pounds 80m. The next big deal came in 1989 when Caradon reversed into MB Group, which had just merged its packaging subsidiary into CarnaudMetalbox. MB paid Pounds 338m for Caradon, but it was soon clear that the Caradon management would run the show. The CMB stake always looked out of place, but it was not till this year that it could be sold for a good price. Mr Jansen said MB-Caradon first approached RTZ about the Pillar businesses 18 months ago, beginning detailed negotiations once the CMB stake had gone. The talks must have involved some hard bargaining. RTZ was keen to sell the whole of the Pillar business, but MB-Caradon only wanted the building products activities. In the eventual compromise, MB-Caradon has ended up with businesses making 72 per cent of sales from building products, another 12 per cent from automotive components, which will fit with MB-Caradon's existing automotive businesses, and the rest in areas the buyer knows little about but believes has some value. The success of the deal depends on MB-Caradon pushing Pillar's margins up to its own levels. In 1992, the Pillar businesses being acquired made an operating profit of Pounds 75.4m on sales of Pounds 981m, a margin of 7.7 per cent. MB-Caradon's own building products activities had turnover of Pounds 500.8m and operating profits of Pounds 54.1m, a 10.8 per cent margin. The particular area of concern must be North America, where turnover of Pounds 333m from building products in 1992 produced profits of only Pounds 9.5m, a margin of 2.9 per cent. The hope must be that MB-Caradon can inject its sales and marketing flair into the RTZ activities. It aims to bring its ideas of branding and differentiation to the Pillar businesses. Mr Jansen gave a clue as to what might happen yesterday when he said that Peachtree, which makes wooden doors and windows in the US, was an upmarket product with a downmarket sales approach, suggesting that prices could be pushed higher while quality was emphasised. With about 13 per cent of the US market for windows and doors, MB-Caradon reckons that it has a good position to build on. While Mr Jansen, a Dutchman, still hopes to expand in Europe in the longer term, in the next couple of years at least, the group will be riding the UK and US economic cycles and pushing through margin enhancement. Yesterday analysts were pencilling in a strongly advancing profit and earnings per share path. The deal, due to be completed at the end of October, will make little difference to current year profits, which were already forecast at about Pounds 125m before exceptionals and tax. But for 1994, analysts are looking at numbers of about Pounds 200m and perhaps between Pounds 240m and Pounds 250m for 1995. That suggests a p/e reducing sharply from the prospective multiple for 1993 of about 22. From a Pounds 61m mbo to profits of Pounds 250m in 10 years would be an impressive record, justifying the City's faith in the MB-Caradon team.</p>

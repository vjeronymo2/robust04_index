			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 10 (XINHUA) -- China is resolved to  have unions established by the end of 1994 in all foreign-funded  enterprises already operational in major development zones and  open cities along the east coast, a union leader told XINHUA  today.    According to Yang Xingfu, vice-chairman of the All-China  Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), unions are found in less  than ten percent of the 47,000 foreign-funded enterprises  already operational, which employ about six million Chinese.    "ACFTU is accelerating its work to get them organized in  unions in view of the growing number of labor disputes in  foreign-funded enterprises; for now we are concentrating on the  places where foreign-funded enterprises are concentrated," Yang  said.    In about one year or two, Yang explained, unions should have  been established in foreign-funded enterprises all over China.    "From now on," he continued, "talks on union affairs must  proceed hand-in-hand with negotiations on any project involving  foreign investors, and the union should be in operation not  later than one year after a project starts operating."    Yang specified the union task in a foreign-funded  enterprises  as one of protecting the legitimate rights and interests of the  employees while co-operating with the investor in the  development of the enterprise.    "There are good examples of investors respecting staff  rights  and interests and supporting unions in their work," he said.  "This invariably results in higher staff morale and better  profits for the investors."    What Yang called "good examples" are mostly furnished by  large- or medium-sized enterprises which follow international  standards in management and respect China's labor laws.    But problems are "serious" in many others, especially in  smaller, labor-intensive enterprises.    "Foreign employers often force workers to work overtime, pay  no heed to labor safety regulations and deliberately find fault  with the workers as an excuse to cut their wages or fine them,  in violation of China's laws and regulations," he said.    "This only does harm to China's efforts to attract foreign  investment, and eventually to the interests of investors," he  added.    Under China's Constitution and laws on foreign investment,  he  said, "Chinese employees have the right to protect their own  legitimate rights and interests and seek help from ACFTU in  establishing unions."    ACFTU and its local organizations, for their part, "have the  right to help Chinese workers get organized."    ACTFU is now busy working on a set of regulations concerning  union work in foreign-funded enterprises.    In June it will call a meeting to boost the work of  organizing unions in such enterprises.    Meanwhile, ACFTU is "doing its best" to promote the  publication, as early as possible, of a labor law, a law on  social security and a law on labor protection.    Before that, he said, governments should publish regulations  on minimum wages, social security and other matters vital to  workers' rights and interests.    "Improved legislation is important to all parties:  Governments should abide by the law in exercising control over  foreign-funded enterprises, foreign investors in handling their  day-to-day management and employees in protecting their own  rights and interests," the union leader conceded.</p>

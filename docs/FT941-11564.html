			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Petrofina forecasts rise to BFr7.1bn Petrofina, the oil company and Belgium's largest industrial group, yesterday forecast consolidated profits for last year of BFr7.1bn (Dollars 198.9m), against BFr4.6bn in 1992. Turnover figures are not yet available. The preliminary result amounts to a bounce back from a poor first half, and Mr Francois Cornelis, chief executive, expected Petrofina would pay out roughly the same amount in dividends as last year, when it paid a total of BFr6.7bn. Petrofina cut its dividend in 1992 for the first time since 1959, after a 72 per cent collapse in earnings. Mr Cornelis said cash-flow had strengthened slightly to BFr34bn, against BFr32bn in 1992. The group has refocused on core activities, and expects 5 per cent annual productivity gains through investment and the shedding of more than 2,000 jobs since 1991. Its BFr26bn upgrading of its Antwerp refinery should be completed by September, while overall investment this year should be maintained at recent levels, roughly BFr33bn. The results reflect a rising dollar and improved refining margins, up from Dollars 2.33 a barrel in 1992 to Dollars 2.90 last year, but were offset by a decline of more than Dollars 2 in crude oil prices to an average Dollars 17 per barrel in 1993. Petrofina expects to increase production of oil and gas by 15 per cent this year, through its share in four fields coming on stream.</p>

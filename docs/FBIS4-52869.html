			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Foolish Moves Inviting Disaster" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 16 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  comments on the secret nuclear agreement signed by Nixon and  Sato on November 21, 1969.    With the agreement disclosed recently, the false and  deceptive nature of Japan's "three non-nuclear principles" has  been dragged into the light of day, the analyst says, and  continues:    One year after Japan adopted "the three non-nuclear  principles" it allowed the introduction into and passage through  Japan of U.S. nuclear weapons.    It is to convert Japan into a nuclear power with the  connivance and cooperation of the United States that the  Japanese ruling circles have left Japan as a nuclear base of the  United States.    Today Japan is accelerating nuclear armament behind the  curtain of "the three non-nuclear principles." This is not  merely suspicion. It has reached a danger line in actuality.    As the recently exposed concealment of plutonium at the  Tokai  nuclear fuel factory shows, Japan has stepped up nuclear  armament, keeping a large quantity of plutonium in concealment.    Japan can turn into a nuclear power any moment.    Japan, however, is now charging the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea with "the nuclear issue." This reminds us of a  thief afraid of his own shadow and shows Japan's shamelessness.    It is a mockery of the Japanese people and the international  community for the Japanese reactionaries to advertise the "three  non-nuclear principles."    The Japanese reactionaries had better act with discretion,  clearly mindful that such acts of theirs as leaving the Japanese  territory as a nuclear base of the United States and pushing  ahead with the nuclear armament are foolish acts which will  result in bringing a nuclear disaster to Japan again.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / State milk monopoly challenged NORTHERN FOODS, Britain's largest private sector dairy group, yesterday threw down a direct challenge to the Milk Marketing Board by announcing plans to buy milk directly from farmers once the MMB's statutory monopoly over supply is abolished next year. The group is setting up a co-operative venture, the Northern Milk Partnership, to which it hopes to recruit more than 5,000 dairy farmers in England and Wales in the next few months. Northern Foods has promised to buy all its milk needs from members of the partnership and to pay them more than the price paid by Milk Marque, the voluntary co-operative into which the MMB plans to transform itself after the market is opened to competition. Legislation to end the MMB's 60-year-old monopoly is before parliament and is expected to take effect by the summer of next year. The MMB will also be required to dispose of Dairy Crest, its dairy-processing arm. Northern Foods buys 2bn litres of milk, worth Pounds 500m, a year. 'We have had good service from the MMB over the years, but now that it is to go, we want to ensure security, quality and efficiency in our milk supply by dealing direct with our producers,' said Mr Christopher Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods. The planned partnership will be a non-profit joint venture, owned and financed equally by Northern Foods and by the producers joining it. As well as offering producers contracts for long-term supplies, Northern Foods would transport their milk and advise them on matching their output to market needs.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, June 8 (AFP) -- Following is the full text  of the proposal drafted by UN special envoy to the former  Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi and signed at talks here on Wednesday  by both sides to the Bosnian conflict, the Bosnian Serbs and the  Moslem-Croat federation.    1. As a first step towards a comprehensive cessation of  hostilities throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, both sides in the  conflict agree not to engage in any offensive military  operations or other provocative actions of any kind for a period  of one month starting from June 10, 1994 at 1200 hours local  time.    2. This period of military stabilization is required in  order to give time for reflection leading to a resumption,  within the next several days, under UNPROFOR [United Nations  Protection Forces] auspices, of negotiations on a comprehensive  cessation of hostilities. Meanwhile, the immediate and complete  release of all persons including prisoners of war, and of all  information already available on persons whose whereabouts are  unknown, as soon as possible under the supervision and in  accordance with the plan of action of the ICRC, will be  implemented.    3. UNPROFOR will continue to monitor and report all military  activity along the present line of conflict.    Signing the agreement for the Serbs was Vice President  Nikola  Koljevic. For the Moslems it was Vice President Ejup Ganic and  for the Croats Mile Akmadzic. Akashi also signed the accord.</p>

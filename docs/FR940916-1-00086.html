			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Performance of Brake Inspections <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To determine whether regulations should be developed specifying how certain brake inspections should be performed and whether certain currently required inspections are necessary, FRA requested comments from interested parties regarding the current methods of performing the various required brake inspections and sought comments on how current inspections could be improved or eliminated. See 57 FR 62556.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AAR and a number of railroads recommended that the specific method of performing the various required inspections should be left to the discretion of each railroad since the type of inspection required depends on the equipment involved and the operating conditions existing at various locations. Many of these commenters stated that experience has shown that vehicle inspections do not detract from inspections and that such inspections are adequate depending on the location performed. These parties also stated that their employees are instructed to get off their vehicle if they are unable to see the brake equipment from the vehicle. Several commenters also endorsed the use of roll-by inspections at least to determine release of the brakes. Most of the commenters also recommended that inspection of five-pack equipment (articulated cars) needs to be looked at since this equipment utilizes several different types of braking systems, many of which cannot be viewed from one side of the car. Several railroads stated that they were in the process of developing specific training for the inspection of five-pack equipment. One commenter suggested that if the brakes fail to apply on one of the sets of brake equipment contained on multi-platform cars with multiple brake systems, the car should be considered operable and permitted to continue to the first terminal where repairs could be made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amtrak commented that the use of package, or unit, brake actuators on most modern passenger trains requires an inspection of both sides of the train. This commenter also stated that the enshrouding of brake actuators, the existence of high-level platforms, and the presence of wayside electric power systems make inspection of brake systems on passenger trains dangerous. Amtrak recommended an alternative to the initial terminal inspection that would allow passenger trains making multiple turns in a 24-hour interval to perform a set and release after a leakage test is performed at all subsequent departures after a complete initial terminal brake inspection if the train remains charged and the consist is not broken. The AAR and one railroad stated that the use of carside indicators is a reliable method for determining the condition of brakes when brake equipment is enshrouded or mounted in-board or when a train is next to a high-level platform or other obstruction. Two other passenger railroads suggested that FRA develop a list of parameters that each initial terminal test must address and then allow each passenger railroad to submit its test procedures, based on its individual operations, to FRA for approval. A number of passenger and commuter railroads also commented that many of the current inspection requirements contained in the regulations are not applicable to multiple unit (MU) cars, specifically noting the leakage test requirement, the piston travel regulations, and the requirement to keep equipment charged when adding cars. These parties recommended that provisions regarding MU cars be separated from provisions on freight locomotives and cars.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AAR and a number of railroads provided comments on specific inspections currently required and on specific elements of various inspections. Several of these commenters suggested that the inbound brake equipment inspection contained at &sect;232.14 be eliminated. These commenters stated that this inspection requires the ``bottling of air'' (the angle cock to be closed following a 20-psi reduction), which is contrary to most railroads' operating rule requiring the brake pipe to be left open on standing cars. The parties felt that the current requirement could result in the train being put in emergency, which wastes time because then the train must be recharged, and is potentially dangerous because it could cause a train to roll away due to a brake release.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

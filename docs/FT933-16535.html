			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Romanian ships deal blocked PETROMIN, Romania's largest shipping company, is expected to remain in Romanian hands after local courts began proceedings to cancel a contract which would have ceded control to Forum Maritime, a little-known Greek company. But the controversy surrounding the proposed deal, and the Romanian government's failure to come clean about its involvement in the affair, have done little to enhance the reputation of a country battling to improve its image with investors. The deal has revealed the damage caused by the failure to get the country's privatisation scheme off the ground. Fewer than 100 of the 6,300 state companies have been transferred into private hands and only four have been purchased by foreign investors. It has also emerged that of Petromin's 92 vessels, 14 are already involved in joint ventures with foreign partners; 18 are under management contracts with foreign operators; 29 are leased to Romanian companies; while most of the remainder are broken or still under construction.</p>

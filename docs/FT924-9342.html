			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Asarco expects 2.9% copper demand rise next year THE CHAIRMAN of North America's third-largest integrated copper producer told analysts this week that he expects world copper consumption to increase to 10.3m tonnes in 1993, a 2.9 per cent advance over this year. That rise in consumption, and a slower advance in 1993 worldwide production, should put copper demand about 100,000 tons above output, reversing the stock build-up that occured in 1992. Mr Richard Osborne, Chairman of Asarco, based the rosy projections on assumptions that the economies of Japan and Europe would rebound sharply in the second half of 1993. He put the rate of consumption growth in the US at about 1.5 per cent, in Europe at 1 per cent, in Japan at 4.5 per cent and in the rest of Asia at 7.5 per cent. He forecast China's 1993 imports at 190,000 tonnes, compared with estimates of 165,000 for this year. Mine expansion in the US, Chile, and Indonesia will boost copper supplies by 2.2 per cent to 9.7m tonnes in 1992, he said, and by 2.6 per cent to 9.9m tonnes in 1993. Reporting the company's third quarter results at a meeting in Phoenix, Arizona, Mr Osborne said Asarco would be delivering an average of 175m lb of copper to the market in each quarter of 1993. That reflected full production at the company's Mission and Ray copper mines. Asarco spent Dollars 350m on expansions and improvements at those facilities, which were completed between September 1991 and March 1992. These transformed the company from a metals processor to a fully-integrated copper producer.</p>

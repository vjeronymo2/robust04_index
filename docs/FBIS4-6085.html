			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 18 KYODO -- The House of  Representatives Steering Committee decided Monday to postpone to  1 P.M. [0400 GMT] Tuesday a decision on the timing of a Diet  plenary session to choose Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's  successor.    Committee members decided on the postponement in order to  monitor the views of the coalition parties and the leading  opposition Liberal Democratic Party.    The postponement means a vote on a successor to Hosokawa  will  not take place until on or after Wednesday, parliamentary  sources said. Hosokawa announced on April 8 that he would  resign as prime minister.</p>

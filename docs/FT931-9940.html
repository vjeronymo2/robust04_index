			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Delors seeks to elevate EC concerns EUROPEAN Commission president Jacques Delors yesterday launched his most stinging attack to date on the 'renationalisation' of economic policy in the EC, which, through competitive devaluations, was jeopardising plans for economic and monetary union and 'the very idea of a united Europe'. He warned that Brussels 'will take up the cudgels again' to get controversial items of the EC's social charter, chief among them the European works councils directive, into Community law. Mr Delors was presenting the Commission programme for 1993-94 to the European parliament, after socialist MEPs had led threats of a vote of no confidence in the EC executive, complaining of its 'minimalist' policy ambitions and democratic shortcomings. In a combative speech, pleading for a renewal of faith in Europe, Mr Delors called on the EC and its member states to 'stop contemplating their navels. 'The people of Europe are asking: Are you capable of coming up with an economic and social programme that will stem the tide of unemployment and give us confidence in the future?' Mr Delors has shown signs in the past 10 days of returning to the offensive after the political near-hibernation enforced on the Commission in the wake of Danish voters' rejection of the Maastricht treaty. The Edinburgh summit in December restored optimism that Denmark and the UK will now ratify the treaty but colleagues acknowledge that Mr Delors  - who wrote yesterday's 'state of the union' address himself - is treading a fine line. 'We've been told to keep our heads down on anything affecting ratification. . . . or which could be seen as power-grabbing,' says one senior Commission official. 'But we have agreed to take a firm line on principle.' Although he named no member state, Mr Delors seemed yesterday to aim his sharpest barbs at the UK, as he urged co-ordination in macroeconomic and monetary policy against 'the siren voices tempting us to go it alone', and vowed to make the EC's social charter - rejected by the UK - a reality. 'Competitive devaluations are not the solution to the problems facing us today; history teaches us otherwise,' Mr Delors insisted, echoing French premier Pierre Beregovoy's attack on the UK for pushing sterling down at the expense of other EC currencies. He also implicated Germany in his critique, referring to the 'glimmer of hope' brought by last week's German interest rate cuts, after 'months of expensive pussy-footing'. MEPs voted by 271:95 to approve the new Commission.</p>

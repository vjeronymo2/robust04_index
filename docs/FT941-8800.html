			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / IG Metall ballot looms Three regions of Germany's IG Metall engineering workers' union yesterday decided their annual wage negotiations have formally failed, clearing the way for the union leadership to call a strike ballot. The move coincided with a renewed outbreak of token strikes in support of the union's claim for a pay rise of 5.5 to 6 per cent and guarantees of job security. In spite of a renewed plea by Chancellor Helmut Kohl for both employers and the trade union in the vital engineering industry to 'exhaust every possible opportunity to reach an agreement, right up to the last minute,' the rest of IG Metall's 14 regional wage commissions are expected to declare their negoti - ations deadlocked today. The union leadership is expected to decide next Monday on the region where a strike ballot will be held, probably between March 1 and 3, with a view to calling a localised strike from March 7. A move from the employers' side to restrict the talks just to questions of pay and holiday bonuses, and avoid the contentious area of working hours, was rejected by the union, leaving the two sides still apparently deadlocked. Gesamtmetall, the engineering employers' federation, says the next move is now up to the trade union. Mr Dieter Kirchner, the chief executive of the organisation, warned in an interview to be published today that a strike decision would lead to lock-outs. They would be used as a last resort, in order to shorten any strike. The union must get 75 per cent support in any ballot to call a strike, and it is clear public opinion is hostile to any such action. An opinion poll in Stern magazine today says 67 per cent of the west German population would oppose it. Yesterday's protest actions included a stoppage by 20,000 workers who attended a rally outside the Mercedes works at Sindelfingen, near Stuttgart. Token strikes have been organised across the country, since the legal requirement to observe industrial peace expired on January 28. The first round of pay talks for the construction industry was held in Frankfurt yesterday, without any outcome. The construction union, IG Bau, is looking for a 6 per cent pay increase.</p>

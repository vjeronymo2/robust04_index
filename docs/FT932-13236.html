			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / British recovery worries Delors: Commission president sees threat to Emu plans if other states leave ERM MR JACQUES DELORS, president of the European Commission, is becoming worried that the UK recovery based on a floating exchange rate could undermine the EC's plans for economic and monetary union, senior EC officials said yesterday. Mr Delors has expressed private fears that other EC member states may be tempted to follow the British example of pursuing economic growth outside the constraints of the European exchange rate mechanism, the Brussels officials said. In a speech at the Hanover trade fair last Tuesday, Mr Delors warned that the credibility of the EC's monetary plans was 'under attack'. Admitting that the Maastricht treaty's plans for Emu remained in doubt, he declared: 'If Europe were hit by further competitive devaluations the Single Market would not survive.' The European Commission was stunned this week when UK unemployment fell for the second month running in March. The gathering UK recovery is all the more galling to Brussels, which blames recent currency instability inside the ERM partly on the delay in ratification of Maastricht in Denmark and the UK. Mr John Major's pro-European speech in London on Thursday night has mollified some of the critics, but one Commission official expressed reservations yesterday about the note of triumphalism in his claim that Britain was winning all the arguments in Europe, from promotion of the Single Market to common agricultural policy reform and enlargement. This week, Mr Norman Lamont, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, predicted that the UK would grow faster than its main European competitors this year and next. EC officials believe that in the medium term, the UK will pay a price for its floating exchange rate in higher interest rates, higher inflation, and a substantial balance of payments deficit. 'It is not a sustainable policy in the medium term,' said one official. But with unemployment in the EC expected to rise to more than 17m this year and growth likely to be lower than 0.75 per cent, the officials acknowledge the UK boomlet may enjoy short-term appeal elsewhere in Europe. Consequently, the Bundesbank's decision to lower its discount rate by a quarter point to 7.25 per cent and its emergency Lombard rate from 9 to 8.5 per cent was greeted with relief in Brussels, a sign that the German central bank is sensitive not only to the deepening recession but also to the economic squeeze on its neighbours, particularly France.</p>

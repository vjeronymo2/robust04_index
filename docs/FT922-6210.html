			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Survey of Korea (11): The All-Korean car is still some way off - The motor industry is striving to reduce dependence on foreign suppliers SOUTH KOREA'S car manufacturers offer a case study of the challenges which face the country's industry as a whole. All need to upgrade technology, lessen dependence on foreign suppliers, diversify markets and establish new relationships with their labour unions. And they need to overcome a period of economic uncertainty, both at home and in their main export markets. The myriad alliances, technical co-operation agreements and joint ventures that bind Korea's carmakers to the world's leading manufacturers will remain a hallmark of the industry for years to come. The advent of an 'all-Korean' car created from a 'clean sheet of paper will have to await the next century', says one western expert. But the need to reduce dependence on foreign, and particularly Japanese partners or suppliers for everything from basic designs to key components is a priority for all manufacturers. So, too, is the need to move away from a manufacturing bias, towards greater emphasis on higher value activities such as design and product development. Such a task will be neither easy nor cheap. 'Unlike Japan, Korea has only pockets of automotive expertise', says Mr John Lyle of the UK's Hawtal Whiting Group of consulting engineers. 'When we started (in Korea) we noticed our clients' engineers did not gain much by studying the design process because priority was given to developing products quickly.' However, companies such as Hyundai, the industry leader, have invested heavily in research and development facilities, where 'massive teams are using state-of-the-art technology to develop new vehicles,' according to Mr Lyle. He predicts that the effort will result in 'a new range of Korean products in the next five years', including light commercial vehicles and heavy trucks. 'They will all be new designs or vehicles based on better platforms than exist now,' he says. The emphasis on independent projects stems in part from Korean dissatisfaction with the high cost of royalties paid to foreign suppliers and the limitations of technology transfer through the main international alliances in the industry - Hyundai with Japan's Mitsubishi, Kia with Ford and Mazda and Daewoo's now-defunct link-up with GM. But few observers expect that Korean companies will be able to catch up in all areas. 'Great advancements have been made,' says Mr Dong Wha Lee, director of the Korea Autombile Manufacturers Association, who cites the introduction last year of a Hyundai-developed engine, and similar programmes in place at Kia and Daewoo. But he concedes that the industry 'still lags behind' its international competitors in many areas. These include systems such as air bags, anti-lock braking systems and four-wheel drive. Perhaps more worrying for Korea's technology effort, however, is the international trend towards less environmentally damaging cars, the development of which is beyond Korea's technical capabilities. The quantum leap in the technical quality of Korean cars in recent years has been matched by moves to upgrade their image in key export markets, though that effort suffered badly when labour disputes affected the build quality of Hyundai cars sold in the US. Mr NM Kim, Hyundai's managing director for export marketing, acknowledges that 'we have a perception problem in the US', where export sales dropped from 260,000 units in 1986 to a current rate of just over 120,000 a year. But he argues that the launch of the Elantra, which some experts describe as 'Korea's first good car', will improve Hyundai's US image. Mr Kim also believes that Korean manufacturers must move away from the 'price-value market strategy', which has focused on undercutting the price of rival products.</p>

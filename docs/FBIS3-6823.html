After hearing a government representative deliver a  report and representatives of relevant National Assembly  committees express their views on various bills, including those  dealing with the labor code, the revised law on the organization  of people's councils and people's committees, the revised law on  the election of people's councillors, the tax law on the right  to land use, and the law promoting domestic investments, the  National Assembly Standing Committee gave its views on these  bills and tasked various agencies with drafting these laws and  relevant National Assembly committees with continuing to study  to rectify them. Depending on the requirements of each project,  they must solicit the views of the people and of various sectors  and echelons, as well as of certain target people. On this  basis, if these bills are found to be viable, they will be  submitted to the National Assembly for consideration.    2. The National Assembly Standing Committee passed a  regulation on procedures for resolving various economic court  cases, regulations on supplementary taxes for those households  using agricultural land exceeding the allocated quota, and a  resolution on revising the tax rates of some groups of goods in  the import tax chart.    The promulgation of a regulation on procedures for resolving  economic court cases will create a legal basis for economic  courts to resolve promptly various economic court cases in order  to protect the state's interest and the legitimate interest of  juristic persons.    The regulation on supplementary taxes for those households  using agricultural land exceeding the allocated quota is  designed to implement the agricultural tax policy promptly and  uniformly to ensure the fair and reasonable character between  the rights and the tax debt of those households using  agricultural land.    The resolution on revising the tax rates of certain groups  of  goods in the import tax chart is designed to overcome gradually  those irrationalities which have arisen in the process of  economic management in order to protect and develop local  production, protect consumer interest, increase the sources of  revenue for the state, and suit the export-import situation in  our country.    3. After giving its views on the draft of a regulation on  providing favorable treatment to those having meritorious deeds  with the nation and on the draft of a regulation revising  certain articles of the regulation on home and land tax, the  National Assembly Standing Committee asked relevant drafting  organs to cooperate with the National Assembly's Social Affairs  Committee and Economic and Budget Committee in studying ways to  refine these two draft regulations in order to submit them to  the National Assembly Standing Committee for approval in a later  meeting.    4. The National Assembly commented on plans to ensure  compliance with the statute governing the enactment of laws and  regulations that was promulgated by the Council of State and the  Eighth National Assembly in August 1988. This plan is designed  to condense past experience and renovate the legislative work.  On this basis, there have been necessary supplementary  corrections on procedures and sequences in this work.    5. The National Assembly Standing Committee discussed and  passed a resolution to promulgate a statute governing the  cooperation between state organs in providing leadership for and  organizing the implementation of a National Assembly resolution  on practicing thrift and fighting wasteful spending, corruption,  and smuggling in order to carry out effectively the National  Assembly resolution on this matter.    6. The National Assembly Standing Committee decided to send  out various teams of the National Assembly Standing Committee to  review the situation regarding law enforcement, state budget  distribution and spending, and the resolution of letters of  complaints and denunciation in a number of sectors and  localities.    7. The National Assembly Standing Committee heard a report  on the results of the 21 February-1 March 1994 official  friendship visit to the People's Republic of China by a  Vietnamese National Assembly delegation led by National Assembly  Chairman Nong Duc Manh. The National Assembly Standing Committee  warmly welcomed and highly valued the fine results of this  visit, saying that this marked a new development in the  friendly, neighborly, and cooperative relations between the  people and National Assemblies of Vietnam and China, thus  contributing to the cause of socialist consolidation and  construction in each country for the sake of peace, stability,  cooperation, and development in the region and the rest of the  world.    Also at this meeting, the National Assembly Standing  Committee heard a report on the results of the 3-5 February 1994  visit to Vietnam of a parliamentary delegation from the Kingdom  of Thailand led by His Excellency Marut Bunag, chairman of the  Thai Lower House, and the 2-5 March 1994 visit to Vietnam of a  National Assembly delegation of the Kingdom of Cambodia led by  Samdech Chea Sim, chairman of the National Assembly and acting  head of state of Cambodia. The National Assembly Standing  Committee warmly welcomed the results of these two significant  visits, noting that they helped consolidate and strengthen the  friendly, neighborly and cooperative relations between the  people and the National Assembly of Vietnam on one side, and the  peoples and National Assemblies of the Kingdoms of Thailand and  Cambodia on the other for the sake of peace, stability,  cooperation, and development in Southeast Asia and the rest of  the world.    8. The National Assembly Standing Committee heard a report  on the situation regarding the activities of various National  Assembly delegations in deploying various resolutions of the  recent Ninth National Assembly's Fourth Session. It also gave  its views on a planned agenda and timing for the Ninth National  Assembly's Fifth Session.    9. The National Assembly Standing Committee ratified a  decision of the Chief Justice of Supreme People's Organ of  Control on the establishment of a control body for  implementation of court verdicts under the Supreme People's  Organ of Control.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Record price made for Japanese sword: Saleroom CHRISTIE'S sold in New York on Tuesday part of the superb collection of Japanese swords and sword fittings assembled by the late Walter A. Compton. The 399 lots fetched Dollars 7.99m (Pounds 4.6m), a record for an auction of Japanese work. Swords were revered as religious symbols by the Japanese, and a samurai regarded his blade as far more valuable than land or gold. The top price was Dollars 418,000, a record for a sword. It was paid by a private European collector for a Fukuoka Ichimonji tachi, or long sword for mounted warriors. It was forged in the 13th century and signed Ichi. A Japanese dealer acquired a Soshu Ichimonji tachi, signed Sukezane, and made in about 1250, for Dollars 374,000. A Japanese private buyer paid Dollars 341,000 for an Osaka Inoue katana, a short blade used in fighting on foot, signed Inoue Shinkai and dated 1677. All three prices were comfortably above forecast. A Shinshinto Musashi tachi of about 1850, which was estimated at Dollars 25,000, sold for Dollars 242,000. Compton started building one of the finest sword collections in 1963. Christie's plans two more sales of the swords and should exceed its Dollars 20m estimate for the 1,000 lots. Sotheby's in London sold second-division Old Master paintings with some success. The morning session raised Pounds 1.5m with less than 13 per cent unsold. A portrait of two children attributed to Moroni sold to a Swiss collector for Pounds 187,000, against an estimate of Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 40,000.</p>

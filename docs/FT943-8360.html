			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Sotfware company retreats Software component supplier Micro Focus saw its shares plummet 190 to 873p as it produced interim figures well below market expectations and issued a profits warning. The drop came as a further blow to the group, whose shares stood at Pounds 30 just 18 months ago. Analysts said the problems at Micro Focus would direct attention to the company's Pounds 56m cash pile, with speculation that the company may sweeten investor unease with a share buy-back scheme or a special dividend payment. The company's performance and dramatic share price retreat also prompted talk of predatory interest. One disillusioned analyst was not holding out bid hopes and was advising clients to sell the shares down to 650p - the value being put on the cash pile and revenue stream. Micro Focus profits fell 40 per cent to Pounds 7m, against analysts' forecasts of up to Pounds 12m. They pinpointed the blame on delays in products coming to the problematic software market, together with an escalation in costs. Profit predictions for the full year were being scaled back from the Pounds 25m level to just above half that amount.</p>

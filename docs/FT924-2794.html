			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (1): Importance of software quality - Comment / Users have a right to some kind of independent guarantee of quality and competence from software suppliers UNLIKE, say, a Faberge egg, software quality can be neither seen nor felt. Where it is lacking, however, the consequences can range from simple irritation to fatalities. As an increasing proportion of the mechanisms which underpin our daily lives  -from information systems to manufacturing robots - is passed over to the computer, software quality issues are assuming a new and pressing importance. Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, made it clear the government is taking the issue seriously when last month he helped launch a new award scheme for quality software. He said: 'Software quality is crucial for the success of business and public services. The consequences of lack of quality are being reported almost daily.' Software failures make news when they involve massive disruption; banks which are prevented from settling their liabilities, for example, or control systems which permit accidents in nuclear power plants. But the less obvious effects of lack of software quality are making themselves felt every day. Stratus, the US manufacturer of fault tolerant computer systems recently, attempted to estimate the effect of unplanned system downtime in UK industry. It calculated that the largest 1,100 organisations are losing approximately Pounds 700m a year in revenues and productivity through computer downtime. While hardware problems were responsible for 51 per cent of downtime, faults in applications software, operating software and networking software could be held to account for almost as large a proportion. The question of software liability and economic loss is a legal grey area, but Mr John Hull, specialist in intellectual property with the law firm Wilde Sapte, provides persuasive reasons to suppose that 'it would be ill-advised to assume there can never be liability for economic loss arising out of defective software.' Is, for example, a software error equivalent to a negligent mis-statement, for which there is legal precedent for the award of damages? In engineering terms, certainly, software is very strange stuff indeed. Beyond a certain level of complexity it becomes very difficult to prove not only that it will do what it is intended to do but that it will not do something unexpected and untoward. There have been a number of powerful improvements in the way the software industry develops its products. These include mathematically-based formal methods, software test harnesses and and computer aided engineering systems. But these are essentially tools to take some of the risk out of the developers' efforts. Users have a right to some kind of independent guarantee of quality and competence from software suppliers. What kinds of stamp of approval exist already? The starting point is BS 5750, the British Standard for Quality Systems, a generalised model for a quality system. It is also the basis for international set of quality standards ISO 9000. BS 5750 is industry independent; it has nothing specific to say about software development, but it does indicate that a customer should be able to expect consistent delivery of high quality products and services on time and within budget from a holder of the standard. Neither has it anything to say about commercial practice. It is no substitute for a legally binding contract in cases where a software supplier fails to fulfill business obligations. MR HESELTINE'S comments on software quality were made at the introduction to an extension to the existing TickIT certification scheme, which is jointly sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry and the computer industry. The scheme conforms to ISO 9001 and involves inspection by quality auditors every three years. Introduced in 1991, it provides quality management certification specifically tailored for the information technology industry. The extension, the TickIT award for excellence, is sponsored by International Business Machines. It is, however, a competitive scheme and only four awards will be given each year - one each to small, medium and large businesses and one to an in-house developer. The British Standards organisation, however, is pressing beyond BS 5750 with a new scheme, announced late last month, which will make possible 'kitemark' awards for software packages - in the accounting area to begin with, but with the intention of spreading the scheme to other sectors. Payroll is likely to be next. The British Standards Institute, which has itself no expertise in qualifying software, is working with the consultancy KPMG which has been operating a software quality centre in Boston, Massachusetts, for over a decade. The test, which will cost company's between Pounds 15,000 for a pc product and Pounds 50,000 for a mainframe system, will be in two parts. The BSI will test for compliance with BS 5750, while KPMG will evalute the product to ensure that it complies with a statrement of minimum functionality and that it conforms to the description given by its suppliers. 'We are looking first to find software defects,' KPMG says. 'Then we seek to determine the expected risk of software failure when tested is completed. Finally, we categorise and summarise the defects uncovered during the testing.' KPMG points out it will be unable to guarantee there are no bugs in the product, but once a package has been awarded the Kitemark, it will be retested on an annual basis. One reason, according to KPMG, is that one in three bug-fixes creates another bug. There are other, less formal, indicators of quality. The Queen's Award for Technology or Export should indicate a better than average product as should a Design Council Award. There are a number of research studies, some of them funded by the European Commission, into ways of ensuring that software is provably correct. To date, there has been substantial progress although no real breakthroughs. Perhaps there cannot be. But customers should demand that software products meet at least a minimum level of functionality and should insist on an authorised indication that that standard has been met.</p>

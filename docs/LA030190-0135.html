			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FENDER-BENDER HIT UKRAINE COMMUNISTS LIKE A QUAKE;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: THE ROUTINE ACCIDENT SPARKED A CITIZENS' EXPLOSION OVER PERKS FOR  PARTY OFFICIALS.  </P> <P> It was a prosaic auto accident on the outskirts of the city, the kind of thing  that just a few months ago would have been hushed up and gone generally  unnoticed. But the "incident at Chernigov" on the eve of Orthodox Christmas hit  the Communist Party like an earthquake, and aftershocks are still reverberating  through the region.  </P> <P> The accident and its aftermath sparked an explosion of public outrage against  the special privileges enjoyed by the Communist Party leadership, leading to  the ouster of six top officials in Chernigov and setting the pattern for  similar party shake-ups elsewhere.  </P> <P> Even today, exactly what happened is a matter of dispute. All that seems clear  is that a chauffeur-driven black Volga sedan, a symbol of the perquisites  extended to the elite party functionaries known collectively as the  nomen-klatura, collided with a small private car driven by an off-duty army  officer near Chernigov, about 80 miles north of Kiev, the Ukrainian capital.  </P> <P> The Volga belonged to a local party official, Valery Zaika, who was returning  from his mother's house in Nezhin. One report said he was alone except for his  driver, another that he was accompanied by his son and a third that he was with  a mystery woman.  </P> <P> No one was hurt. The chauffeur was apparently drunk at the time and tried to  run away, as one report had it, after removing the car's license plate. A mob  gathered and began pounding on the Volga. Suddenly the trunk snapped open.  </P> <P> Inside was a pile of Christmas gifts that made eyes pop in the crowd: sausages  and other smoked meats, bottles of expensive liquor -- all "deficit goods," a  Soviet euphemism meaning they are always out of stock in state shops.  </P> <P> Enraged, the crowd dragged the Volga 3 miles to the center of Chernigov. A huge  demonstration followed in front of the imposing marble building on Lenin  Prospekt where the Communist Party has its regional offices.  </P> <P> It was Jan. 6, the eve of Orthodox Christmas, and many of the demonstrators had  been drinking. Still, for the Soviet Union, it was a rare moment. Anger built  up over generations of deprivation boiled up into a public display.  </P> <P> "It was like a spark," said Vladimir Borisenko, who since the incident has  become editor of the local party newspaper, Desnyanskaya Pravda. "The time was  ripe. Shops were empty, there were no goods and no housing. People saw no  changes taking place."  </P> <P> Demonstrations against the party continued for several days and began receiving  press attention throughout the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The Ukrainian opposition group Rukh, formed last October, had been unable to  generate much interest in Chernigov, a city of 280,000 not far from where the  Ukraine meets the Russian republic and Byelorussia. But within two days of the  incident, Rukh's membership in Chernigov increased tenfold to more than 1,500.  </P> <P> "It just fell from the sky on our heads, and we benefited," said the local Rukh  representative, Maya Voguslavskaya. "People were demanding not only more meat,  but also more freedom. It grew from an economic complaint to a demonstration of  political force."  </P> <P> Staggering from the shock of the demonstrations, the regional party leadership  held a plenum to consider personnel changes. Worker groups demanded that the  entire 13-man leadership be replaced.  </P> <P> In the end, the party replaced the regional first secretary, the official  responsible for ideology and the head of the party organizing committee, whose  Volga had caused the scandal. In addition, three local officials were replaced,  including the editor of Desnyanskaya Pravda.  </P> <P> "The people were not satisfied with the changes because only three party  leaders resigned," Voguslavskaya, the Rukh representative, said. "We demanded  that they all go."  </P> <P> The action taken in Chernigov was widely felt; party leaders began falling  elsewhere in the Ukraine and the Russian Republic, under attack on charges of  mismanagement and flaunting their special privileges.  </P> <P> Ivan I. Leonov, the new ideology official in Chernigov, said in an interview  that the special privileges were more fantasy than reality. He said that before  he accepted the post, he and his wife grew their own vegetables on a family  plot and had a hard time getting by.  </P> <P> Leonov said the crowds on Jan. 6 were angered by the chauffeur's illegal  actions after the accident, not the gifts in the trunk, which he insisted were  given to the official by his mother and did not come from special shops for the  party elite.  </P> <P> But editor Borisenko described the demonstrations as "a mass attack on the  party . . . strong and powerful," and he said the party "has done things which  it can be criticized for."  </P> <P> Among other things, party officials were said to have had access to special  health care while the rest of the people had to put up with a creaking medical  system and that the party officials took expense-paid holidays in comfortable  hotels, ostensibly attending advanced courses in communism.  </P> <P> Borisenko said there is still a question about the first secretary's house, a  mansion paid for out of party funds at a time when housing is desperately short  in Chernigov.  </P> <P> Nearly all the ousted officials are said to be hospitalized at this time,  recovering from heart attacks and other ailments stemming from the upheaval in  Chernigov. Others are in isolated retirement. None could be reached for  comment.  </P> <P> The scandal is expected to have a powerful impact on Sunday's elections for the  Ukrainian Parliament and the local council.  </P> <P> Chernigov has two parliamentary seats at issue, and in one contest the  Communist Party is running 13 candidates against the Rukh candidate. In the  other, the opposition candidate faces seven Communists.  </P> <P> "Personally, I think these events shook the people," said Leonid I.  Gerasimenko, a party member and head of a local election commission. "I was  ashamed at our leader's behavior. The party should cleanse itself."  </P></p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Observer: The cult of Ross Goobey Is Alastair Ross Goobey, 46, finally about to outshine his famous dad, George, now 81, and former investment boss of the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund? It sounds like Alistair has landed the plum job of chief executive of Postel, the fund management operation that looks after some Pounds 20bn of investments for the British Telecom and Post Office pension schemes, and is probably the UK's second-largest manager of pension fund assets. The job was vacated when Andrew Threadgold decided to go off and seek his fortune in Australia. Although Alastair is currently on what the City calls the sell side, as chief investment strategist of brokers James Capel, he has had extensive experience on the buy (or fund management) side at Courtaulds Pension Fund and at the independent fund management boutique Geoffrey Morley and Partners. He has also had two spells on attachment to the Treasury, most recently as special adviser to Norman Lamont in the run-up to the last election. This could leave him with some divided loyalties. Lamont, after all, will need to sell something like Pounds 50bn of government bonds to balance the books in the next financial year. On the other hand, Alastair Ross Goobey told a James Capel investment seminar yesterday that equities were a better prospect than bonds. 'Buying bonds today is a very bad bet but I am sure we will all do it,' he mused.</p>

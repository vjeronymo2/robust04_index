			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Magill to stay on Westminster probe Mr John Magill, the district auditor investigating the alleged 'homes for votes' scandal at Westminster City Council, announced yesterday that he will not disqualify himself from further involvement in the case. Public hearings into the affair, over which Mr Magill will preside, will start today. Dame Shirley Porter, the former leader of the council, who with eight others faces paying a surcharge of Pounds 21.25m if the auditor does not change his provisional findings on the case, had called for him to disqualify himself. Dame Shirley will be appealing against the auditor's decision 'at the appropriate time', but will take part in the hearings. Mr Neale Coleman, one of the objectors to the council's alleged policy, said the application for Mr Magill to disqualify himself had been 'a waste of everyone's time and money'.</p>

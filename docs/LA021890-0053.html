			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TENTATIVE DEAL STRUCK ON HOTEL, OFFICE CENTER;  </P> <P> THOUSAND OAKS: THE 'JUNGLELAND' JOINT VENTURE AWAITS A CONTRACT BETWEEN THE  CITY AND DEVELOPER. OPPONENTS INSIST THAT TAXPAYERS ARE AT RISK.  </P> <P> A tentative agreement has been reached between the city of Thousand Oaks and a  private developer on plans to build a hotel-office complex next to a new City  Hall and performing arts center.  </P> <P> The agreement could come before the City Council as soon as lawyers draft a  contract, spokesmen for the city and the Lowe Development Corp. of Los Angeles  said last week.  </P> <P> The project managers declined to elaborate on the proposal until it is  submitted to the City Council.  </P> <P> But they acknowledged that, in general, it involves the city's redevelopment  agency leasing land to the Lowe company to build the hotel-office complex.  </P> <P> The proposed development is known as the "Jungleland" project because it is  planned for a vacant 20-acre site at Thousand Oaks Boulevard and Conejo School  Road that was once the home of the wild-animal theme park.  </P> <P> The joint-venture agreement will be submitted to the City Council in about two  months, culminating more than two years of negotiations with Lowe, said Ed  Johnduff, the city administrator overseeing the project.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, three activists who are longtime critics of the project threatened a  lawsuit last week unless the city discloses details of its negotiations with  Lowe and how much public funding the project would require.  </P> <P> The citizens, whose attempt to place the issue before voters two years ago was  rejected by the city, reasserted during a news conference last week that the  project was financially doomed and would require substantial taxpayers'  subsidies.  </P> <P> Previous efforts to obtain detailed financial information have been rebuffed,  said the group's leader, Heinrich (Corky) Charles, who has retained a Riverside  attorney and acknowledged that he hopes to renew a referendum drive.  </P> <P> "The citizens of Thousand Oaks are entitled to a full and free public debate of  the project on its merits," said Charles' attorney, John Brown. "It is not  acceptable for the city to negotiate in secret for two years and then give the  public only a couple of weeks review."  </P> <P> Estimated costs for the Jungleland project have changed over the years, and  Johnduff said nothing is certain at this point.  </P> <P> But he said last week that the city's portion is expected to cost $60 million  for a new City Hall, an 1,800-seat performance center, a parking deck,  landscaping and street and sewer additions.  </P> <P> The privately developed hotel and office complex is expected to cost about $40  million, for a total project cost of $100 million.  </P> <P> Johnduff acknowledged that a proposed endowment fund for the performing arts  center, the interest of which would support the facility's operating costs, had  not yet received any donations.  </P> <P> The final cost of the project's land also remains uncertain because a lawsuit  concerning its value is still pending in Ventura Superior Court.  </P> <P> The suit, filed by the site's former owner against the city, is scheduled for  trial April 9.  </P> <P> The city has already paid $12.75 million for the land, which it condemned in  1987.  </P> <P> But former owner Assadollah Morovati has claimed that he is entitled to $26  million, representing both the land and its potential value had he been allowed  to develop it.  </P> <P> "Ultimately, when the figures come in, we will prevail," said project critic  Joan Gorner, who joined Heinrich and Richard Booker at the news conference last  week.  </P> <P> Heinrich is a former Thousand Oaks planning commissioner.  </P> <P> Gorner, Charles and Booker said they recently learned through requests for  public information that a written agreement between the city and Lowe to  negotiate exclusively with each other had expired more than a year ago and was  not renewed.  </P> <P> In addition, they said, city officials had refused to disclose details of the  negotiations, leading them to believe that talks had either reached an impasse  after two years or that Lowe was no longer interested in the project.  </P> <P> Johnduff acknowledged that the city's written negotiation agreement had been  allowed to lapse.  </P> <P> But he said neither side felt renewal was necessary since negotiations were  under way and both sides appeared to trust each other.  </P> <P> Ted McGonagle, an assistant vice president for Lowe in charge of the Jungleland  proposal, said last week that his company was still committed to the project  and felt that it was financially feasible.  </P></p>

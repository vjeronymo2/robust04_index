			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Personal View: Myth of America's decline The notion that the American economy is in a long-run structural decline has been advanced over the last decade by academic and media pundits. These pundits clamour for expanded government spending programmes, protectionist trade policies and government subsidies for special commercial technologies. In Europe and Japan pundits gleefully proclaim that the US has been eclipsed, and that the next century 'belongs' to Asia or to Europe. The declinists insist that America is lagging behind its economic competitors (especially Japan and Germany), is de-industrialising, and that economic collapse is just around the corner. In a revisionist history, the declinists - some now occupy high positions in the Clinton administration - blame the 'decline' on the 'failed policies of the 1980s'. The declinists' allegations form the premise for President Clinton's economic programme. The American economy does, indeed, face serious challenges, most importantly raising productivity growth, but even with a healthy discount for political hyperbole, these allegations are nonsense. The US remains the world's largest, richest and most productive economy. With less than 5 per cent of the world's population, it produces about a quarter of the world's total output of goods and services. The average standard of living - measured by the total value of output per person - exceeds that of any other leading industrialised country, being 20-30 per cent higher than in Germany and Japan. Productivity is also higher, as is average private sector pay, than in these other nations. The fortunes of particular industries have ebbed and flowed, but America is not de-industrialising. Neither is it losing its overall competitive edge. The US is the world's leading exporter and, although many US manufacturers face stiff competition in markets with high volume and low profit margins, America has maintained or enhanced its technological edge in areas such as microprocessors, advanced telecommunications, biotechnology, aerospace, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The American economy is currently faring far better than those of the other leading industrialised countries. The US is producing about 3 per cent more industrial output than a year ago, while Germany, France and Italy are producing 4 per cent less, and Japan 8 per cent less. What happened in the 1980s? The longest peacetime economic expansion in the nation's history, from late 1982 to mid-1990, followed a successful, but costly, taming of the 1970s double-digit inflation, as 20m new jobs and millions of new businesses were created. Real GDP grew 30 per cent. Productivity rebounded slightly, real wages continued to grow slowly, and the wage premium for educated workers increased, but less-educated young workers faced bleaker prospects. Persistently large budget deficits developed, as federal spending grew relative to GDP, while revenues were stabilised by cutting tax rates and indexing for inflation. The national debt rose by Dollars 2 trillion, but private wealth increased five times as much. In short, it was a decade of generally successful economic performance, although serious problems remained and new ones emerged. I agree with the pundits of decline on one point: America will not remain the world's strongest economy unless productivity growth improves substantially. America saves and invests too little. Its federal government spends and borrows too much. Its education system is woefully in need of reform. Its tax system has become less conducive to entrepreneurship, saving and investment. The government regulates too much private activity. The legal system imposes unnecessary costs on consumers and companies, and stifles innovation. Too many Americans depend on a welfare system that penalises work, saving and intact families. An aggressive reform agenda focused on these issues, as well as a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the Gatt, is America's best bet for achieving sufficiently rising standards of living to provide a better legacy of prosperity to its children, and opportunity to the disadvantaged. The new administration seems intent on addressing these problems with new government programmes, higher tax rates, increased and less flexible regulation, and trade protection - rather than through reforms that empower individuals and families, and strengthen the market system. If implemented, such a programme, inspired by the declinists, eventually might become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

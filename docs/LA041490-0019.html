			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A LITTLE TOO MUCH ON HANK GATHERS  </P> <P> Four pages on Hank Gathers? Come on.  </P> <P> It's too bad that a young man died, but try to look at it objectively: Gathers  knew he had a bad heart, and he knew his medication was necessary to keep him  alive, but he wanted to play in the NBA and earn the big money.  </P> <P> He could have settled for the million-dollar insurance policy and a normal  life.  </P> <P> His family wants to sue Loyola to get the money that Hank might have earned.  Let's face it. Hank Gathers died of greed and his family has caught the  disease.  </P> <P> JON K. EVANS, Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

Song Yong-tae, the South's chief delegate to the  just-suspended inter-Korean working-level talks, said in a  statement that Seoul remains committed to resolving the North  Korean nuclear dispute peacefully.    "The door to dialogue remains open. We strongly urge the  North to return to a sincere and rightful posture and respond  favorably to efforts to resume South-North dialogue, aware of  the internal and external conditions that exist," Song said.    He said North Korea was amply demonstrating its bellicosity  by resorting to Cold-War-type actions that fan confusion in the  South, trying to subvert the South's system by slandering its  top leader and agitating South Koreans to struggle against their  government.    Song said that if Pyongyang is truly interested in holding  talks with the United States, it should be more sincere in  respecting international order and realizing the proposed  exchange of special envoys.    He noted that the South had time and again shown its  willingness to help the North improve relations with Seoul's  allies if Pyongyang worked to resolve the nuclear issue.    North Korea is trying to blame the South for the recent  breakdown of working-level talks in an attempt to escape  international suspicions about its nuclear program, Song said.</p>

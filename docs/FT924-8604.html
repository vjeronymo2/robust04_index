			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Malaysian bank's profits fall 57% BANK Bumiputra Malaysia (BBMB), the state-owned institution, yesterday reported a 57 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to MDollars 42.44m (USDollars 16.97m) for the year to March 31, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur. Total income rose to MDollars 656.77m from MDollars 625.86m while net profits fell to MDollars 22.74m from MDollars 83.77m. The bank gave no reasons for the sharp fall in profits but said that in May 1991 a court ordered it to pay MDollars 18.7m in damages for breach of agreement in terminating a client's credit facility. The government has twice rescued BBMB, Malaysia's second largest bank in terms of assets, from collapse. BBMB still faces a lawsuit in the US over the Hong Kong debacle involving the collapse of Carrian Group to which the bank had been a leading lender. BBMB's performance compared with record profits by other local banks is a big blow to the government, analysts said. On Saturday, Mr Anwar Ibrahim, finance minister, announced that Mr Hanafiah Hussein, BBMB chairman, and Mr Jaafar Ahmad, executive director, were retiring.</p>

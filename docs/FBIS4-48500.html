			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Aford Secretary General Dr. (Musi </F> Mtewa) by Dan Issacs on 18 May, place not given; from the  "Network Africa" program--recorded]    [Text] As predicted, the other main opposition grouping,  Aford [Alliance for Democracy], headed by Chakufwa Chihana, has  gained solid support in the north of the country, but that is  seemingly not enough to seriously challenge the current front  runner, the UDF [United Democratic Front]. On the line to  Malawi, I asked Aford Secretary General Dr. (Musi Mtewa) whether  he was disappointed with the results so far.    [(Mtewa)] No, we are satisfied with the results, as expected  in the north. We did expect on the basis of our strategy to  make sure that the north was an absolute Aford stronghold. We  did expect a favorable comfortable seat in the center region.  Now, there was, as a result of the pick-ups we have made, that  you can says does fall short of our expectations in the center.  We had a high estimation of seats in the south, in those places  where we did do quite a successful campaign, but our margins of  gain in those were comfortable, but not strong enough to cause  an upset of the UDF [words indistinct].    [Isaacs] Do you regret the fact that the opposition in  Malawi  is divided along these regional lines, where obviously you could  have presented a more of a united front and come out ahead very  more on top than you have done?    [(Mtewa)] It is pure coincidental that the parties do follow  the original homes of the current leaders. My president,  Chakufwa Chihana, from [word indistinct] and therefore the  north, Bakili Muluzi is birth place Machinga in the South, and  Kamuzu Banda's location in the Center, Kasungu. Pure  coincidental.    [Isaacs] Now, having actually broken away from the UDF to  fight the election, would you now, in light of what has happened  in the results, would you consider joining up forces again, in  some kind of a coalition, if you were asked?    [(Mtewa)] First, the assumption probably would be that at  least we were united at one time. Historically, we were united  in the fight, of course, for the multiparty referendum. You are  correct, but since the referendum last year, June, of course,  the need was for the singular parties to have a separate  identity and to fight the elections and [words indistinct] as a  party plurality of the organizations quite independent of each  other. That has happened and the result of this election is to  maintain that plurality and we have advanced the view that, of  course, cooperation in other means and other measures of  national policy are all right.    Now, in the interest of forming a government of national  unity as the result of the elections probably do foretell, that  is something that we, as Aford, would be interested in  considering and sitting down, of course, with any one of the  parties to define [words indistinct] and to be able to say that  whatever is the outcome [words indistinct] advance the agenda  for democracy, as people in this country did fight for.</p>

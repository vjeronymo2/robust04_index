			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAKING PEACE IS POLITICAL;  </P> <P> REJECTING WAR, NICARAGUA NOW RELIES ON DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT  </P> <P> As the Central American presidents move their itinerant summit from one meeting  place to another, they seem to get closer to their goal of peace in the region.  At the Honduran port of Tela on Aug. 7, they finally established a timetable  and means to implement their peace plan.  </P> <P> Significantly, the presidents not only continue to make strides in conflict  resolution in Nicaragua, but also have started to place more emphasis on the  other focus of civil war -- El Salvador.  </P> <P> This progress is the result of a combination of changes in the terms of the  original equation in the quest for peace. The first was the replacement of the  Contadora Group as peace broker by the Central American governments themselves.  The second, and by far the most determinant, was a bipartisan consensus in the  United States to sever ties with the Contras. The third has been the entente  cordiale of Washington and Moscow, incipient that it may be. In addition, there  are a number of other factors that constitute stimuli to compromise, such as  the lack of clear winners in the protracted guerrilla war, the insurmountable  economic disaster of Nicaragua and its refugee problem, which is seriously  affecting Honduras, Costa Rica and the United States.  </P> <P> However, there is not a uniform opinion. Persons who regard the Arias peace  plan as a panacea for a beleaguered Central America assert that we are  witnessing the gradual unfolding of a peacemaking process activated by the  natural impulse in man to use reason when force has failed. Others rebuff this  proposition as naive. Drawing conclusions from the duplicity evidenced by the  Central American radical left during an entire decade, they dismiss both the  ruling Sandinistas of Nicaragua and the Salvadoran guerrillas as miscreants who  will never accept democracy.  </P> <P> There is a third, more pragmatic, school of thought. Its adherents, including  Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez, are as distrustful of the professed  sincerity of the Sandinistas and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front  as any pro-war hard-liner. However, they rely on the diplomatic summit accords  to halt a futile and devastating conflict. Aware that we all need a respite,  they have attempted a truce as a stepping stone to effective peace.  </P> <P> Still, some indignant anti-Sandinistas decry the Tela accords, labeling the  demobilization of the Nicaraguan Resistance forces as a "sellout." These  critics fail to realize that this action was necessary in order to deprive the  Sandinistas of excuses. Furthermore, it is an explicit request made by the  opposition political parties in a public agreement with the Sandinista  government signed at Managua on Aug. 4. The Nicaraguan Resistance now lacks a  legal reason to continue waging war. Similarly, the United States government  cannot ignore the wishes of the Nicaraguan democratic opposition. In fact, the  latter's leadership has asked "the foreign governments with interests in the  Central American region to abstain from carrying out any concealed activities  in the Nicaraguan electoral process." Interested in peace, the Bush  Administration supports the Central American initiative. But in order to  appease its most conservative constituency, it still speaks to the Sandinistas  with a harsh rhetoric.  </P> <P> The United States, though, has a legitimate concern to see the Sandinistas  fulfill their pledge guaranteeing the safe return of the rebels and their  families to Nicaragua from Honduras. Many of them are small farmers and other  campesinos who raised arms against Sandinista injustice. President Bush could  go a long way toward restoring peace in Nicaragua, and U.S.-Nicaraguan  relations, if he proposed to use his influence and support -- together with  other heads of state, the World Bank and various other international agencies  -- to help launch a resettlement program, in Nicaragua, of both the Contras and  other refugees. With a multilateral guarantee for the pursuit of life with  work, social services and the enjoyment of freedoms, those Nicaraguans who have  sought asylum abroad would be enticed to return home. However, such a project  to restore our dignity as Nicaraguans can be possible only if the Sandinista  regime takes a sincere decision to adopt democracy.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the way things stand today in Nicaragua, everything hinges on  the forthcoming elections. In spite of their bravado, the Sandinistas must fear  the elections since they are fully aware of the tremendous erosion of their  popular support base. They also know that there will be so many international  observers that it would be rather difficult for them to conceal fraud. In  typical fashion, some of their spokesmen have declared that if they lose the  elections, they are disposed to surrender the government but not power. More  recently, they have gone further, hinting that they might consider giving up  power, as well. That is senseless talk. In either scenario, the Sandinistas,  once deprived of the national budget, would see their capacity to reward and  punish (the foundation to authoritarian power) greatly diminished. It is hard  to imagine the Ortega brothers, Tomas Borge and the rest of the comandantes  stepping down from power to watch passively as the Sandinistas become an  insignificant political party.  </P> <P> It is more realistic for the international community to foster pluralism and  common goals in Nicaragua. By the same token, the Central American presidents  must demand that Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega immediately meet his  obligations under the Tela accords and display genuine efforts to persuade the  Salvadoran guerrillas to make peace with President Alfredo Cristiani.  </P> <P> The United Nations will soon be sending a peacekeeping force to Nicaragua. That  is a positive step. God willing, the Central American presidents will meet  again some time later in the year at Managua. One important step that should  come out of that meeting would be a request for a U.N. peacekeeping force in El  Salvador, too.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the United States should contemplate a policy of continuing and  vigorous support to the Central American presidents' peace initiatives. When  the presidents succeed in their task, the nightmare of civil wars and refugees  will fade away.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CAL STATE SAN MARCOS SETS ITS SIGHTS ON THE WORLD;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: FACULTY MEMBERS AT THE NEW STATE UNIVERSITY ADOPT A MISSION  STATEMENT THAT EMPHASIZES LIBERAL ARTS AND A GLOBAL OUTLOOK.  </P> <P> The new state university in San Marcos will make its mark with an international  focus while steeping its students in liberal arts, according to a statement  adopted Thursday that outlines the founding faculty's vision for the  institution.  </P> <P> The statement avoids specifics and was adopted after some consternation among  the faculty over how clear-cut the university's science agenda should be.  </P> <P> One feature was the aim for a global outlook.  </P> <P> The university "endorses an international perspective that addresses the global  community in social, political and economic terms," the document reads. "This  multicultural outlook is reflected in our curriculum, extracurricular  activities, international exchanges and special programs that focus on world  issues and problems. We prepare students to take leadership roles in areas of  work and society in the international community of the 21st Century."  </P> <P> Although the statement doesn't get more specific, faculty members note that,  already, two international research centers are being established on the  campus. One, headed by Prof. William Liu, will study gerontology among Asians.  The other, headed by Prof. Isabel Schon, will study Spanish-language literature  for children.  </P> <P> "Consistent with its global orientation, the university exposes students to the  study of languages, to world literature and the fine arts, and to issues and  traditions of the United States and other countries," the statement continues.  To that end, faculty members say, students in a variety of majors will probably  be required to take a year's study in a foreign language for graduation.  </P> <P> But the faculty also was in strong agreement that Cal State San Marcos should  evolve as a "user-friendly" campus more like a small college than the  sprawling, commuter campus it will one day become.  </P> <P> The mission statement will now be forwarded to university President Bill Stacy,  who indicated Thursday that he may strengthen the science emphasis but who  otherwise said he was delighted by the faculty's philosophy.  </P> <P> "The people who will first look to it for guidance will be me and the faculty,  because it will be the foundation on which we'll build, and the measurer for  the kinds of programs that will be considered here," Stacy said. "We'll use  this mission statement in recruiting new faculty, by showing it to them and  asking them if this is the kind of place where they can be comfortable."  </P> <P> The 20th Cal State university, operating out of leased offices in San Marcos,  will hold its first classes next fall for juniors and graduate students, and  will expand to accept seniors in the fall of 1991. Freshmen will be admitted in  fall of 1995. The first permanent campus buildings are scheduled to open in the  fall of 1992.  </P> <P> Only the founding 12 faculty members are on board at Cal State San Marcos; 20  more will be hired before next fall. Majors have not yet been adopted, but  tentative choices include biology, business accounting, business management,  history, liberal studies, mathematics, psychology and sociology.  </P> <P> Adopting the mission statement is part of the protocol of establishing a  university, intended to offer students and the community a sense of the  institution's philosophy and broad-brush objectives.  </P> <P> The 12 faculty members deliberated over the statement two months and pored over  nine revisions before adopting the final draft Thursday, which concluded:  </P> <P> "The goal of California State University, San Marcos, is to instill in its  students the enthusiasm and curiosity, the creativity and originality, the  healthy skepticism and the habit of continuing inquiry that are central to all  truly educated men and women."  </P> <P> According to the statement, the university "expects a high level of academic  scholarship in research and teaching, and protects academic freedom requisite  to such scholarly pursuits."  </P> <P> Outside the classroom, the university will offer "cultural enrichment in an  intellectually stimulating environment" and serve "as a focus for community  social activities, art, music and sporting events."  </P> <P> The two-page document calls for the university to be responsive to its students  and the North County community as a whole, but says the institution will look  beyond Southern California in preparing students.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most ticklish issue in developing the statement was defining to  what degree the university will pursue the sciences -- a favorite subject among  North County business and industrial leaders who say they hope the new campus  will generate young, new scientists.  </P> <P> Much debate on Thursday, for instance, focused on the proposed statement: "The  university stimulates scientific research and development in collaboration with  public and private organizations in the area, and serves as a resource for  books, ideas, computing and other technology."  </P> <P> Around a conference table, some professors suggested that the word "scientific"  be dropped because it was suggested that the university would not pursue  research and development in non-scientific areas.  </P> <P> Larry Cohen, a molecular geneticist, cringed. "Doesn't it diminish the  significance of science if we leave it out?" he asked. It was, however, dropped  from the sentence, and the only one siding with Cohen was K. Brooks Reid, a  mathematician.  </P></p>

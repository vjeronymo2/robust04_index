			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Letter: Interest rates that move with building society rankings Sir, The Skipton Building Society increased its mortgage rate and the media immediately takes the opportunity to milk the gloomy aspects of the news. Your own Lex column (August 12) is no exception. 'Mere talk of possible higher rates . . . depress further market confidence', and 'Nor does the foreign exchange market relish reminders . . .' The truth of the situation may be more to do with market position, financial strength and the need for competition. The Skipton recently fell from 2nd to 17th in the UBS Phillips &amp; Drew review of the top 20 building societies. It may just be that investors will require a slightly higher rate of interest to compensate for the perceived greater risk. Ten days ago Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, which was rated number one in the same survey, reduced its interest rate on its popular London Share Account from 10.4 per cent to 10 per cent.

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The Polish media have recently described  the transformation of the Food Industry Bank (BGZ), which  primarily serves the agricultural sector (which employs  approximately 38 percent of the population) and is jointly owned  by the State Treasury and approximately 1,200 cooperative  (co-op) banks. Like other banks, the BGZ, which is one of  Poland's largest financial institutions, is affected by the  country's current financial crisis and requires a substantial  overhaul. The U.S. auditing firm of Arthur Andersen estimated  that the BGZ needs 16.2 trillion zlotys [Z] for capitalization,  but, at the end of 1993, the Finance Ministry allocated to the  BGZ only Z4.27 trillion out of the Z21 trillion of bonds  available for the transformation of banks. The remaining Z12  trillion the BGZ needs will be granted in the form of government  bonds after it converts to a joint-stock company. Current BGZ  losses "are being covered from the state budget, but the  reccurrence of losses is due to the continued granting of  preferential loans" and to unprofitable investments such as  sugar mills and fruit and vegetable plants. The NIK (Supreme  Chamber of Audit) reports that at least Z21 trillion was lost  because of unrecoverable loans. (GAZETA BANKOWA 12 Feb 94) The  losses due to these bad loans make the BGZ "unable to achieve  its potential for making reserve provisions from internal  funds." Making provisions for reserves in the required amounts  may result in the bank's "generation of losses on the balance  sheet, which cannot be covered by the bank's internal capital."  In such case, additional "capital support from the State  Treasury would be necessary." A condition for recapitalization  of the BGZ is its conversion to a joint-stock company (rendering  it BGZ SA). Once the BGZ SA is formed, the bank will be  capitalized by restructuring bonds. (RZECZPOSPOLITA 26-27 Feb 94)    At a 9 March conference devoted to the BGZ conversion, in  which 49 BGZ branch directors participated, Prime Minister  Waldemar Pawlak assured those present that the work on  converting the BGZ into a cooperative structure is continuing.  Pawlak added, however, that "unfortunately, the Finance Ministry  backed out of formerly agreed-upon decisions and put a stop to  the entire process"--referring to the conflict between former  Finance Minister Marek Borowski and him over the dismissal of  Deputy Finance Minister Stefan Kawalec. Despite such  difficulties, Pawlak is convinced that the conversion process  will be completed this year "and will employ such tested methods  as those used by the French Credit Agricole."    Three variants for restructuring the Food Industry Bank--as  well as other cooperative banks--into a corporation bank in June  of this year were presented by BGZ Deputy Director Ryszard  Turpin for discussion.    The first model calls for a three-tier structure and assumes  that a National (Domestic) Co-op Bank will be created, and about  nine to 12 regional banks with legal entity status will be  formed. Turpin stated "in such a structure, the BGZ could become  a national bank coordinating the activities of the entire co-op  banking sector." This conversion model has the support of the  National Bank of Poland (NBP), the Finance Ministry, and the  Union of Polish Banks (ZBP).    The second model makes the BGZ the clearing and financial  center specifically and only for co-op banks. The BGZ would  retain a two-tier structure as a central bank and would serve  its branches, which would be the regional banks functioning  without the status of legal entities. In Turpin's opinion, this  model "lacks strong support because it is not sufficiently  refined and does not take into account the already existing  regional banks, which include co-op banks such as BUG SA, GPB-Z  SA, GBW SA."    The third model provides for the BGZ conversion into a  specialized state agricultural bank able to issue long-term  loans. Alongside this proposed state bank, a national holding  bank would be formed, maintaining a three-tier structure of a  national holding bank, regional banks, and local-level  cooperative banks.    Turpin emphasized the importance of a prompt Sejm debate on  the drafts of the cooperative banking system "to foster the  development of co-op banking." He also said that such a draft,  with a two- or three-tier structure, has already been prepared  and should be submitted to the Sejm as a government or a Sejm  deputy initiative." In Turpin's opinion, the first model has the  best chance of passing in the Sejm. "If passed, the competences  of both national and regional banks should be clearly defined,  and all cooperative banks should be obligated to merge with  regional branches." (RZECZPOSPOLITA 10 Mar 94)    After the Sejm accepted the first model, BGZ Director  Kazimierz Olesiak, nominated by Pawlak in February, expressed  hope that the Sejm would employ the "accelerated legislative  process" in recommending the bank's transformation strategy to  complete the BGZ's conversion to a joint-stock company. Olesiak  maintained that "only then will the government allocate over Z10  trillion in restructuring bonds," without which the BGZ and  1,200 other co-op banks "will not be able to serve about 30,000  organizations and people" in the agrarian economy. In Olesiak's  opinion, implementation of this model could "save about 250  co-op banks from bankruptcy" and could make the BGZ the  country's second-largest bank, after the Main Commerce Bank  ("Panorama" newscast, TV Polonia Network 25 Mar 94).</p>

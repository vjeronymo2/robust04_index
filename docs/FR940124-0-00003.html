			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, are the Secretary's findings concerning the proposed amendments submitted by Wyoming on August 18, 1982, and March 9, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Award of Costs and Expenses: General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 525(e) of SMCRA provides that:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Whenever an order is issued under this section, or as a result of any administrative proceeding under this Act, at the request of any person, a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorney fees) as determined by the Secretary to have been reasonably incurred by such person for or in connection with his participation in such proceedings, including any judicial review of agency actions, may be assessed against either party as the court, resulting from judicial review, or the Secretary, resulting from administrative proceedings, deems proper. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although section 525(e) is not directly applicable to State programs, section 102(i) of SMCRA specifies that one of the purposes of the Act is to ``assure that appropriate procedures are provided for the public participation in the development, revision, and enforcement of regulations, standards, reclamation plans, or programs established by the Secretary or any State under this Act.'' To implement this provision, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15(b)(10) require that State programs ``[p]rovide for public participation in the development, revision and enforcement of State regulations and the State program, consistent with public participation requirements of the Act and this chapter.'' Furthermore, 30 CFR 732.15(b)(14) requires that State programs ``[p]rovide for administrative review of State program actions, in accordance with section 525 of the Act and subchapter L of this chapter,'' and 30 CFR 840.15 specifies that ``[e]ach State program shall provide for public participation in enforcement of the State program consistent with that provided by 30 CFR parts 842, 843 and 845 and 43 CFR part 4.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The preambles to both 30 CFR 732.15(b)(10) and 840.15 explain that these rules mean that the State program must authorize the award of costs and expenses incurred in connection with administrative and judicial proceedings as provided under sections 520 (d) and (f) and 525(e) of SMCRA and 43 CFR part 4 (44 FR 14965, 15297, March 13, 1979). In 1981 and 1982, OSM considered revising these two rules to modify this interpretation, but, ultimately, no changes were adopted (47 FR 26359&hyph;60, June 17, 1982; 47 FR 35625, August 16, 1982). Therefore, the 1979 preamble is still an authoritative explanation of the Federal regulations currently in effect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;902(e) and 35&hyph;11&hyph;901(p), the Wyoming program counterparts to paragraphs (d) and (f), respectively, of section 520 of SMCRA, are unaffected by the amendments under consideration in this rulemaking. These provisions, which authorize the award of costs and expenses incurred in connection with citizen suits to compel compliance with regulatory requirements or to recover damages for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of a violation, are substantively identical to and consistent with their Federal counterparts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 60, as submitted on March 9, 1993, extensively revises W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f), the Wyoming counterpart to section 525(e) of SMCRA, which authorizes the award of costs and expenses incurred in connection with administrative proceedings and judicial review of agency actions. Enrolled Act No. 60 also adds W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(g), which further restricts awards of costs and expenses under subsection (f). As discussed below in this finding and in findings 3, 5, 6, and 7, the Secretary has determined that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437 (f) and (g) are not fully consistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA and the Federal regulations implementing that provision of SMCRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chapter V of the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure is the Wyoming counterpart to the Federal rules at 43 CFR 4.1290 through 4.1296, which implement section 525(e) of SMCRA with respect to awards of costs and expenses incurred in connection with administrative review proceedings. Except as discussed below in this finding, these State rules, as submitted on August 18, 1982, and revised by submittal dated March 9, 1993, are substantively identical to the Federal rules. Finding 2 explains why Wyoming's use of the term ``contested case'' is not a substantive difference. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Wyoming rules do not include a counterpart to either 43 CFR 4.1296, which provides that an administrative law judge's decision on a petition for an award of costs and expenses may be appealed to the Interior Board of Land Appeals, or that portion of 43 CFR 4.1291 that specifies where a petition for an award of costs and expenses must be filed. However, unlike the two-tiered Federal administrative review system, Wyoming has only one administrative review entity, the Environmental quality Council (EQC or the Council). Therefore, neither of these provisions is needed since (1) there is no question as to the entity with which the petition must be filed, and (2) no administrative review of an EQC decision is possible because no higher-level administrative review entity exists. Furthermore, both Sections 2 and 3.a.(2) of Chapter V clearly identify the Council as the entity responsible for the processing of petitions for the award of costs and expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

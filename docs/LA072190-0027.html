			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POMONA MAN GUILTY IN BOTCHED ROBBERY  </P> <P> A federal jury found a Pomona man guilty of attempted bank robbery and  kidnaping Friday for holding a bank manager and her husband in their Palmdale  home for 36 hours, then trying unsuccessfully to rob the bank.  </P> <P> Tyrone McCraw, 29, also was convicted of using a firearm during the February  crime and faces from 15 years to life in prison as a result of the verdict in  U.S. District Court, said Assistant U.S. Atty.  </P> <P> David Tennant. McCraw will be sentenced Oct. 1.  </P> <P> McCraw's accomplice, 29-year-old Brian Simms, pleaded guilty to the same  charges and testified against McCraw. Simms will be sentenced on Aug. 27; he  faces 12 years in prison as the result of a plea-bargain agreement, Tennant  said.  </P> <P> The two men, described by Tennant as "inept and not very bright" would-be  robbers, hatched the plot to kidnap the Newhall savings branch manager after  working as carpet layers at the branch office. After holding the couple at  gunpoint in the Palmdale house for more than a day, they left the husband bound  and gagged and took the manager to the branch office, where she set off a  silent alarm that summoned authorities.  </P></p>

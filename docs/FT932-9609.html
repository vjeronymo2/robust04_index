			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Formula for council funding attacked CAMBRIDGE is more deprived than Hartlepool, if the government's assessment of councils' spending needs is to be believed. As a result the government pays Cambridge council more funds per head. This is one of the most striking anomalies highlighted by the Audit Commission in a report on standard spending assessments (SSAs) published today. One of the effects, the commission says, is that 'neither central nor local government accepts responsibility for decisions on particular services'. Local authorities will have different SSAs according to their level of deprivation. This is decided by a formula derived from the All Ages Social Index, which takes into account how much various social factors (illustrated in the graph) differ from the national average. This is done in the interests of fairness. However, 'the complexity of the formula hides underlying key political choices, obscuring decisions and who makes them'. The formula does not include economic factors such as the level of unemployment in an area, because these factors do not impose direct spending obligations on local authorities. The formula does, however, include social and demographic factors that could increase spending because of deprivation. These factors include the proportion of single-parent families and people sharing accommodation, and the proportion of people with household heads born in the New Commonwealth and Pakistan - this is, controversially, held to be a sign of deprivation. Cambridge's large number of students sharing accommodation and the low proportion of immigrants in Hartlepool combine to produce the surprising result that the north-eastern town is deemed to be less deprived. The commission suggests that SSAs will need to be reformed but does not support any particular alternative. It says the pressures on SSAs have increased since they were introduced, because of four factors: The 'gearing' effect of SSAs has increased because the proportion of local authority expenditure coming from central government has increased from about half to the current level of more than 80 per cent. This means that small proportionate changes in SSAs have a bigger effect on local government spending than they did before. SSAs are now used by the government for 'capping' local authority budgets, or limiting their expenditure, which increases their impact on a council's spending decisions. Pressure is growing for councils to set spending on each service according to the SSA for that service. The government projects how much will be earmarked for different services, but at present no restrictions are placed on how councils apportion the total amount of money paid to them. The Citizen's Charter intends using SSAs to compare the performance of different councils. Passing the Bucks: The Impact of SSAs on Economy, Efficiency, Effectiveness. HMSO. Pounds 8.50.</p>

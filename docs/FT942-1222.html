			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Deadline for labour in Italy The new Italian government yesterday set unions a deadline to agree on labour market reforms which would make it easier to hire and fire people, Reuter reports from Rome. Mr Pietro Larizza, head of the UIL, one of the country's three national union confederations said Mr Clemente Mastella, labour minister, told them that the government would put legislation to parliament by the end of next month, with or without their consent. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, who promised on taking office last month to create 1m jobs in the next two years, wants to make it easier for employers to take on temporary and part-time workers. Companies would also be able to offer rates of pay below union minimums to young employees and the long-term unemployed. However, unions fear that the new rules could let unscrupulous companies replace existing workers with lower-paid labour. Unemployment is running at about 11.5 per cent of Italy's 22m workforce, and union power has been diminished since the 1980s.</p>

Noting that "10-point programme of the great unity of the  whole nation for the reunification of the country" put forward  by the great leader President Kim Il-song reflects the noble  desire of the Korean people to achieve national reunification  and prosperity by winning the unity of the whole nation,  irrespective of the difference in ideology, idea and system, the  statement said all the Koreans in the North, South and overseas  who love the country and the nation set 1995 as the first year  of Korean reunification.    It said the South Korean authorities are seeking dependence  on outside forces and North-South confrontation, ignoring the  desire of the whole nation for reunification.    Pointing out that the "nuclear problem" of Korea over which  the United States and its lackeys are raising outcries is an  offspring of the U.S. moves against socialist Korea, the  statement said:    "It is the United States that raised the `suspicion of the  North's nuclear arms development' and it is also the United  States that iishthreatening the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea.    "The United States must know that pressure or threat have no  effect on the Korean people and such a method cannot solve the  problem but may bring the situation to a hopeless phase.    "It must look sqaurely at all the facts and act with  discretion.    "We fully support the proposal advanced by the Workers'  Party  of Korea to reunify the country through confederacy based on one  nation, one state, two systems and two governments in accordance  with the three principles of independence, peaceful  reunification and great national unity, considering it to be the  most fair one.    "We also strongly demand that the nuclear issue on the  Korean  peninsula must be solved through DPRK-U.S. talks because it was  caused by the deployment of nuclear weapons in South Korea by  the United States."</p>

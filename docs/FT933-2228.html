			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Growing pains It is sometimes difficult to believe that Europe's leaders are interested in growth at all. Not only are ERM countries deeply reluctant to cut interest rates, France is trying to persuade its partners to put the world trading system at risk by reopening the Blair House agreement on farm trade while EC support is apparently growing for the reimposition of capital controls. This seems curious when there is also so much concern about unemployment - at least to those who hold that free trade, and by extension free movement of capital, is the best way to secure long-term growth and sustainable jobs. Europe seems to be drifting towards a dirigiste approach in which the need to maximise growth is subordinate to other priorities. The Gatt may matter less to those who assume that social and political problems are best dealt with by trade protection. In a world of trading blocs, the US and Pacific Rim would flourish: Europe, with the additional burden of refloating former communist countries, would see less growth and more inflation. That is bad news for European equities which have risen on expectations of lower interest rates, economic revival and a robust recovery in earnings. At current levels, markets cannot afford much of a shock, least of all with so much privatisation business in the wings. They would look unkindly on the threat to recovery from trade sanctions which would surely follow any breakdown of the Gatt.</p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Failed glazing group left Pounds 3m debts SURESTYLE, the company started with assets of the failed Stormseal double-glazing group, closed yesterday with total liabilities of Pounds 2.8m and a trading loss of Pounds 800,000, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. Cork Gully, the receiver, decided Surestyle had no chance of being sold as a going concern. Mr Mark Palios, senior partner in Cork Gully's Manchester office, said: 'Having failed twice in 18 months, it is more appropriate to talk of the business having badwill rather than goodwill.' The company's debts are smaller than expected. About 150 directly employed staff were dismissed yesterday.</p>

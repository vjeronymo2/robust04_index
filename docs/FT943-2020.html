			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: CS Holding in Swiss regional bank rescue CS Holding, the international financial services group built around Credit Suisse, has launched a SFr905.6m (Dollars 686m) rescue package and agreed takeover bid for Neue Aargauer Bank (NAB), Switzerland's largest regional bank. The move follows a review of NAB's credit standing which revealed a need for extraordinary writedowns of about SFr200m. This is the latest and largest development in the consolidation among Switzerland's smaller banks. Many of the these banks, which specialise in mortgage lending and credits for small and medium-sized businesses, were badly hurt in the recession and property price slump of the early 1990s, and have been unable to get back on their feet. The Spar und Leihkasse Thun, near Bern, collapsed in 1991, leaving deposit holders with large losses. The country's leading banks, seeking to protect Swiss banking's image, put in place a rescue procedure which has prevented any subsequent failures. The process of mergers and acquisitions by the bigger banks has caused the number of regional banks to tumble to 155 at the end of last year from 238 in 1988. The pace appears to be accelerating following a tightening of bank auditing standards. NAB, established in 1989 by the merger of two regional banks in the canton of Argovie, claimed total assets of SFr9.2bn at the end of 1993 supported by equity of SFr457.4m. In an initial step, Credit Suisse is advancing a SFr200m convertible loan to NAB. Conversion of the loan at SFr2,000 per share and other options on NAB shares held by Credit Suisse would give it 34 per cent of the bank's capital. Meanwhile, CS Holding is offering three of its bearer shares and three of its registered shares for each of the remaining NAB shares, equivalent to SFr2,016 a share at Monday's closing prices. This values NAB at SFr705.6m.</p>

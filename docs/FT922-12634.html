			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Gold mines face closure threat GENGOLD and Anglovaal managed to lift available profit from their gold operations during the March quarter, but both are faced with the prospect of soon having to close a mine. In Gengold's case, West Rand Cons seems unlikely to last beyond the next quarter, while Anglovaal's Loraine is also teetering on the brink. Mr Jim Cockburn, Gengold consulting engineer, said bluntly: 'We've got a disaster at WRC. Unless there's a substantial increase in the gold price we're not going to be able to carry on.' The mine made a R2.6m loss during the quarter. It lacks the ore reserves, and flexibility of grade, to turn this position around, at the current gold price. Anglovaal management said that they had been unable to secure 'adequate forward prices beyond July 1992', a condition of Loraine staying open. After-tax profit in the Anglovaal group was 2 per cent up at R42.3m (Dollars 14.7m) for the quarter, with R34.7m of this coming from Hartebeestfontein whose performance was unchanged from the previous quarter. Gengold lifted available profit after tax and capital expenditure by 45.6 per cent to R32.6m, compared to the December quarter. Total gold production dropped by 0.4 per cent to 18,037kg. Working costs were well held, rising by 0.2 per cent to R27,626 per kg, while the average gold price received was 0.1 per cent lower at R32,534 per kg. Mr Gary Maude, managing director of Gengold, said the two highlights of the quarter were the return to profitability of Winkelhaak - which made an available profit of R0.6m compared to a R10.1m loss in the previous quarter  -and the ongoing increase in production at Unisel which had a difficult 1991. Bracken, Buffelsfontein, Grootvlei and Leslie all had improved quarters.</p>

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Magistrates want 102 to face charges of corruption Prosecutors yesterday recommended that 102 people, including Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Italian prime minister, should stand trial on corruption charges in connection with the building of Milan's underground railway, Reuter reports from Milan. A preliminary hearing to determine if there is sufficient evidence to put the suspects on trial was set for April 19. Defendants include three former executives of industrial group Fiat and construction tycoon Salvatore Ligresti, who has testified that he paid about Dollars 1m in bribes to politicians for building contracts on the underground between 1987 and 1990. Almost all of the 102 are accused of corruption and illicit party funding in connection with the project, which added a third line to the transport system in the late 1980s. Mr Craxi, prime minister from 1983 to 1987, dominated the Socialist party until he was forced to step down as its leader last year because of corruption investigations. He is already set to stand trial in a different case involving alleged bribes from an insurance group for contracts with state energy giant ENI. Prosecutors said two former Socialist mayors of Milan, Mr Paolo Pillitteri and Mr Carlo Tognoli, had been dropped from the list of suspects in the railway investigation.</p>

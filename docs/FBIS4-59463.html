			<p>BFN     [Text] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has evacuated all  its installations in the city of Rafah in the Gaza Strip, but  the transfer of powers in the place has still not taken place.  This is reported by our military affairs correspondent Karmela  Menashe.    Commander Yitzhaq Aharonovich, chief of the Border Police,  visited the Gaza Strip today to supervise the evacuation of his  forces from the area. Aharonovich said the Border Police is  currently preparing to undertake the task of ensuring the safe  passage of Israelis in the autonomy areas. It is also preparing  for the joint patrols with the Palestinians, slated to start in  the next few days.</p>

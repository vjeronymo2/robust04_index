			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Clinton's cling-ons: Calls for an end to the closed world of the White House press corps It was only a single-sentence paragraph, about the presidential trip to Europe in June, but, to the dyspeptic eye, it leapt out of the page. The pen was wielded by Maureen Dowd, as elegant a writer as any on the New York Times. Her target was the cellular phone-carrying yuppies on the White House staff supposed to look after the travelling media. 'Another day, the White House marooned 24 reporters and staffers in the misty British countryside for 12 hours, unable to figure out a way to get our group 100 miles from Cambridge to Portsmouth, the next stop on the president's schedule.' It is the presumption - that it was the White House's fault - that gets the goat. For it means the English-speaking White House press corps no longer has the capacity or responsibility to move itself, using public or private transport, a short distance across a country which uses much the same language and credit cards. Ms Dowd added, with self-deprecation, that even using the phone was a problem as 'the instructions . . . were in British'. Michael Lewis commented on the same trip for the New Republic as someone who is not a regular pack member. He wrote: 'To strike out on one's own, it turns out, is in violation of the code of White House correspondents. No matter how hard I try, a senior White House journalist explains to me, I will never escape 'the womb'.' This is seriously worrying, or ought to be. Pack journalism is bad enough, but surely cosseted pack journalism, divorced from the realities of life, is worse. The womb, also known as the steel cocoon, can only provide a warped view. The White House press corps may be the most egregiously privileged and insular, but its attitudes are hardly unique. The gaggle of British soccer hacks covering the World Cup finals declined to take advice on a simple way to enter the Rose Bowl - namely via a public gate - insisting instead on the long lines of the media entrance because Fifa officials required it and could thus be blamed for the delay. It had to be somebody else's fault. The Westminster lobby, the Japanese press clubs, even, presumably, the cliques (or is it claques?) of ballet critics take pride in their exclusivity and privileges. The only differences are the Americans do it on a grander, if not more efficient, scale and do not exclude those not from US news organisations from holding a White House press card (on the basis of this column, the FT may soon be issued a job lot). The tendency to bite the hand that feeds (and carries the luggage, and books the hotel rooms and provides the transport and, oh, also briefs) is perhaps most pronounced in the White House bear garden. A colleague on the president's most recent trip reports how a famous network correspondent went ballistic in Bonn when a bus driver had problems negotiating a tight turn, so risking losing the convoy. In her tantrum, she seemed not to have realised the improbability of a German bus driver not knowing his way to the only local airport (Cologne) big enough to handle Air Force One and the 747 'zoo' plane carrying the press (first class reserved for the networks, naturally; business class for the US writing hacks, most foreigners; and staff in the back). Now, being a White House (or Westminster) correspondent is not the easiest beat. The compensations of ample air time and front-page space do not necessarily offset the long hours, cramped working conditions and the frustration of not being able to roam freely throughout government. It sounds glamorous but often is not. The simple solution is to let the sun shine in. It may be impossible to abolish the White House press corps or its international counterparts, and it would be counterproductive not to arrange adequate facilities for them to file their stories. But let them travel on their own, eat on their own and book their own hotels. For one thing, it would be cheaper. The White House gets good discounts on hotels but charges roughly 1 1/2 times the first-class air fare, and bills for luggage handling, too. It would also free the White House staff to do something sensible. But, most to the point, it would reintroduce the media to those who watch TV and read newspapers. In the Washington Post recently Henry Allen suggested modern journalists, now so much part of the establishment, were losing touch with their roots. Were the newspaper industry to face the Titanic's fate, he wrote, 'maybe if they started having more fun and less respectability right now, if they had more product and less by-product, more output and less input, more craft and less profession, they might not go down at all'.</p>

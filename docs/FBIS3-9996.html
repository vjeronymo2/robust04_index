			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Herold Jean-Francois] </F>   [Text] Port-au-Prince, 28 Feb (EFE) -- The Justice and  Peace Commission of Haiti, assigned to the Catholic Church in  Gonaives Municipality, accused the Dominican Republic of  violating the oil embargo decreed by the UN Security Council. In  a report published in the Haitian capital today, the commission  assigned to the diocese of Gonaives said Dominican and Haitian  soldiers cooperate in transporting gasoline across the border  that divides both countries.    On 24 February, an investigative committee of the Justice  and  Peace Commission saw movement of fuel contraband at the  northeast border, at the Haitian city of Quanaminthe, near the  Dominican city of Dajabon. A large number of uniformed Dominican  soldiers were seen participating in the operation, the religious  organization reported.    The commission said the soldiers, in front of the civilians,  direct the transfer of an impressive motorcade of freight and  personnel, who transport the fuel down the local river.  According to the organization, nearly 250 carts, each one  carrying three barrels of gasoline, are transported each day in  15 trips across the border.    The organization added that the Haitian military takes  charge  of the fuel once it enters Haitian territory. The Justice and  Peace Commission said an area has been set up near the border to  store the fuel.    The commission regrets that the UN Security Council has not  denounced this situation. "The United Nations has not adopted  any measures to supervise and enforce the oil embargo at the  Dominican-Haitian border, which, as a consequence, is prolonging  the crisis and at the same time strengthening the coupists'  economic and political power," the commission said. The United  Nations, after the 1993 efforts to restore Jean-Bertrand  Aristide to power as the constitutional president of Haiti  failed, decreed an oil embargo against Haiti.    Meanwhile, today, the U.S. Coast Guard repatriated 141  Haitian refugees, who tried to abandon the country in a boat,  which was located near the Windward Passage between Cuba and  Haiti. Since 1 January, U.S. Coast Guard ships have repatriated  302 Haitian refugees.</p>

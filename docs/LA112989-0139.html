			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> STUDENTS 'ADOPT' ENDANGERED PLANTS  </P> <P> At Pegasus Elementary School, 10-year-old Chris Rakunas said he worries about  where food will come from if certain animals cease to exist. Nine-year-old  Nathania Chen worries about the vanishing ozone layer.  </P> <P> As a part of their lessons on endangered species and science, the fourth- and  fifth-grade students took nature into their own hands by adopting endangered  plants.  </P> <P> "I really have a new respect for the plant since we've begun learning about  them," Rakunas said. "It is so important that we work hard to keep all the  things around us alive."  </P> <P> The school, which is designed for gifted children in kindergarten through fifth  grades, is working with the Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden. Through its Adopt  an Endangered Plant Program, the center is fervently trying to save endangered  plants found only in California.  </P> <P> "At this point, we are concentrating particularly on types of plants that are  common to this area," said Rebecca Caughman, spokeswoman for the garden. "There  are various plants around that there are no more than a handful remaining."  </P> <P> The garden introduced the adoption program last month at its annual native  plant sale. Buyers of native plants each received a personalized certificate of  adoption along with a plant care guide.  </P> <P> Pegasus science teacher Adrianne White, who heard about the sale, was certain  it would be perfect for her class.  </P> <P> "Since we've concentrated a great deal on endangered species, I knew this  adoption program would work very well with what they were learning,  particularly since this is a life form that gets very little attention," White  said.  </P> <P> The children planted three species in the back of the schoolyard and will take  turns monitoring them.  </P> <P> "What we try to do here is incorporate science as part of their lives, said  Laura Katz Hathaway, school director. "These children really do worry about  what they see and read and are sometimes afraid for their surroundings and  what's happening to them." ALLISON SAMUELS  </P></p>

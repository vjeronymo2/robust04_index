			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 5 WHO HELPED BRING CRIMINALS TO JUSTICE CITED;  </P> <P> CRIME: DISTRICT ATTORNEY HONORS TWO WHO CAUGHT A CRIMINAL AND THREE WHO HELPED  CONVICT CRIMINALS.  </P> <P> During the early morning one day last December, two construction workers were  in hot pursuit of a hit-and-run driver who had just killed a 78-year-old woman  as she and her husband crossed an Oceanside street.  </P> <P> Francisco Parada y Maldonado and Charles Long were on their way to work in a  truck when Maldonado saw the woman hurled into the air by the hit-and-run  driver's car.  </P> <P> Maldonado did the only thing he could do -- he turned his truck around and  chased the car, while Long called the police on a the truck's telephone.  </P> <P> They chased the man, Richard Santillan, to a cul-de-sac about 2 miles away.  When they finally reached him, they saw him toss several beer bottles from his  car.  </P> <P> Maldonado said they both told Santillan to go back to the scene. To their  relief, Santillan agreed to return.  </P> <P> "I was scared," Maldonado said Friday. "I was shaking, and I didn't realize it  until we went back to where the accident happened."  </P> <P> Santillan, 23, an illegal alien who had lost his license as the result of an  earlier hit-and-run accident, was later sentenced to four years in prison.  </P> <P> Maldonado and Long have been named Good Samaritans by the San Diego County  district attorney and were among those honored Friday at the third annual  District Attorney's Crime Victims Luncheon.  </P> <P> Some of the others who received words of praise from Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller  were ordinary people who became victims of crimes. The crimes pushed them to  the limits of emotional endurance.  </P> <P> Lisa Clark was a rape victim who had to endure the threats and taunts of  classmates at Monte Vista High School in Spring Valley when she testified  against two very popular boys who raped her on an April night two years ago.  </P> <P> Her attackers, Tim Clay, now 20, and Courtney Hallman, now 21, were sentenced,  respectively, to six and three years in jail. They were 1987 Monte Vista  graduates.  </P> <P> Jodie Robertson was abducted in 1984 by serial killer David Allen Lucas. He  slit her throat and left her to die.  </P> <P> "It's a miracle that she is alive," Miller said. He praised her tremendous  spirit for "simply living" after her throat was cut. And he lauded Robertson's  endurance -- because she had to relive the attack seven times on the witness  stand during Lucas' trial. In September, Lucas was convicted of three murders  and sentenced to death.  </P> <P> Robertson thanked Miller and added that she could not have endured the ordeal  without the support of her family and the prosecuting attorneys.  </P> <P> Kathy Minnifield had similar praise for Miller and his staff. Minnifield's  2-year-old daughter was beaten to death and stuffed into a trash bin in El  Cajon in 1988 by Matthew LeSure.  </P> <P> Minnifield and LeSure had been living together.  </P> <P> LeSure was convicted last year, and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison,  after Minnifield and her 7-year-old son, Derwin Anderson, testified against  him.  </P> <P> In a tearful voice, Minnifield thanked Miller's staff and her family "for  helping me to stay strong."  </P> <P> Miller also singled out two organizations that work within the criminal justice  system to ease the pain of crime victims and to help them wend their way  through the criminal justice system .  </P> <P> One is the Crisis Intervention Program, whose volunteers counsel victims of  crime, most often violent ones, in those first moments of trauma. The other is  the Domestic Violence Prevention Project, which since February, 1989, has  helped more than 6,000 victims of domestic violence obtain temporary  restraining orders against their abusers.  </P> <P> Miller said he hoped that the recognition of the people and the organizations  would enable the public to understand the problems of victims -- the trauma of  crime and the frustration brought about by delays in the courthouse.  </P> <P> "Anything that we can do to ease the pain. . . . It's very emotional for me.  I'd like the public to know the problems they encounter," Miller said.  </P></p>

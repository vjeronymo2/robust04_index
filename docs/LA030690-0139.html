			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> MATER DEI TAKES IT GAME AT A TIME  </P> <P> The Mater Dei High School boys' basketball team enters Southern California  Division I regional play at 7:30 tonight with one eye on first-round opponent  North Hollywood and another on longtime rival Long Beach Poly.  </P> <P> Second-seeded Mater Dei (30-1) plays host to North Hollywood (23-3) at Ocean  View High. North Hollywood upset Fremont, 76-71, in the Los Angeles City  section's 3-A championship game with forward Dana Jones scoring 29 points and  pulling down 29 rebounds.  </P> <P> Guard Harry Marks played a key role in North Hollywood's title run, improving  his scoring average from 14 points in the regular season to 26 points in the  playoffs.

"Our goal this year  was to win every game and the state title.  </P> <P> "Since we lost that game to Poly, our goal has continued to be to win the state  title. We know we have to beat two good teams if we hope to get another shot at  Poly."  </P> <P> Long Beach Poly (26-2) is the top-seeded team in the division and opens against  Loyola at Long Beach College. Mater Dei defeated Loyola, 83-57, Saturday night  to win the Southern Section 5-A title.  </P> <P> Mater Dei and Long Beach Poly were the most dominant programs in the Southern  Section in the 1980s.

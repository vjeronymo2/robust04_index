Any negative adjustment carryforward for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxable year in which the debt instrument is retired is taken  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into account by the issuer as income from the discharge of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indebtedness under section 61(a)(12).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cross references.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a holder has a basis in a debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument that is different than the debt instrument's adjusted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue price, the holder may have additional positive or negative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustments under paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section. If the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of a contingent payment is fixed more than 6 months before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the date it is due, the amount and timing of the adjustment are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined under paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section. If all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the remaining contingent payments on a debt instrument become  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fixed substantially contemporaneously, the timing of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment is determined under paragraph (b)(9)(v) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Examples.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following examples illustrate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of paragraph (b)(6) of this section. In each example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assume that the debt instrument described is a debt instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for federal income tax purposes. No inference is intended,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, as to whether the debt instrument constitutes a debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument for federal income tax purposes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1. Net negative adjustment_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Facts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On June 13,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1996, Z, a calendar year taxpayer, purchases a debt instrument at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original issue for $1,044. Assume that the debt instrument is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to paragraph (b) of this section. The projected payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule provides for projected payments of $100 on December 31,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1996, and $1,100 on December 31, 1997. Based on the projected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment schedule, Z's total daily portions of interest would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $56 for 1996 and $100 for 1997.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Adjustment in 1996.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Assume that the payment actually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made on December 31, 1996, is $25, rather than the projected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $100. Under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, Z has a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative adjustment of $75 on December 31, 1996, attributable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the difference between the amount of the actual payment and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of the projected payment. Because Z has no positive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustments for 1996, Z has a net negative adjustment of $75 on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the debt instrument for 1996. This net negative adjustment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduces to zero the $56 total daily portions of interest Z would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise include in income in 1996. Accordingly, Z has no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest income on the debt instrument for 1996. Because Z has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no interest inclusions on the debt instrument for prior taxable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years, the remaining $19 of the net negative adjustment is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative adjustment carryforward for 1996 that results in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative adjustment of $19 on January 1, 1997.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Adjustments in 1997.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Assume that the payment actually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made on December 31, 1997, is $1,150, rather than the projected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $1,100. Under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, Z has a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> positive adjustment of $50 on December 31, 1997, attributable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the difference between the amount of the actual payment and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of the projected payment. Because Z also has a negative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment of $19 on January 1, 1997, Z has a net positive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment of $31 on the debt instrument for 1997 (the excess of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the $50 positive adjustment over the $19 negative adjustment).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, Z has $131 of interest income on the debt instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for 1997 (the net positive adjustment plus the $100 total daily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portions of interest that are taken into account by Z in that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2. Net negative adjustment at maturity_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Facts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Assume the same facts as in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> of this paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(6)(v), except that the payment actually made on December 31,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1997, is $1,010, rather than the projected $1,100.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Adjustments in 1997.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section, Z has a negative adjustment of $90 on December 31, 1997,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attributable to the difference between the amount of the actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment and the amount of the projected payment. In addition, Z  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has a negative adjustment of $19 on January 1, 1997. Because Z  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has no positive adjustments in 1997, Z has a net negative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment of $109 for 1997. This net negative adjustment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduces to zero the $100 total daily portions of interest Z would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise include in income for 1997. Therefore, Z has no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest income on the debt instrument for 1997. Because Z has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no interest inclusions on the debt instrument for prior taxable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years, the remaining $9 of the net negative adjustment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitutes a negative adjustment carryforward for 1997 that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduces the amount realized by Z on retirement of the debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (7)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Adjusted issue price, adjusted basis, and retirement_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (b)(7) of this section provides rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the noncontingent bond method to determine the adjusted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue price of a debt instrument, the holder's basis in a debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument, and the amount of any contingent payment made on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheduled retirement. Paragraph (b)(7) of this section also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides rules for an unscheduled retirement. In general,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because any difference between the actual amount of a contingent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment and the projected amount of the payment is taken into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account as an adjustment to income or deduction, the projected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments are treated as the actual payments for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making adjustments to issue price and basis and determining the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of any contingent payment made on a scheduled retirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(7)(iv) of this section,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> positive and negative adjustments are not taken into account for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of paragraph (b)(7) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definition of adjusted issue price.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The adjusted issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price of a debt instrument is equal to the debt instrument's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue price, increased by the interest previously accrued on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (determined without regard to any adjustments taken into account  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section), and decreased by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of any noncontingent payment and the projected amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any contingent payment previously made on the debt instrument.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> See paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section for special rules that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply when a contingent payment is fixed more than 6 months  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before it is due. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Adjustments to basis.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A holder's basis in a debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument is increased by the interest previously accrued by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> holder on the debt instrument under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section (determined without regard to any adjustments taken into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decreased by the amount of any noncontingent payment and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projected amount of any contingent payment previously made on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument to the holder.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Defense Agency [DA], which has studied ways to  improve its capability of collecting military information, has  begun to examine specific ways to purchase sophisticated photos  taken by highly efficient satellites developed by American firms  for military reconnaissance through commercial deals to use them  to analyze the military situation in Japan's neighboring  nations. In the United States, government organizations were  provided access to the photos taken by the military  reconnaissance satellites in the past, but the Clinton  administration recently decided to allow civilian corporations  to launch them for commercial purposes. In response to the U.S.  administration's decision, the DA has begun to examine specific  ways to purchase the sophisticated satellite photos. It plans to  use those sophisticated satellite photos to "enhance its  capability of collecting military information" as its priority  task when it shapes a new guideline for the buildup of Japan's  defense capabilities. Other Asian nations are also interested in  using the sophisticated photos taken by those satellites to  collect military information, and the use of those sophisticated  photos will be noted as a new proliferation of military  technology.    In addition to photos obtained from the U.S. Government, the  DA has been purchasing those taken by such commercial  observatory satellites as "Landsat" of the United States and  "Spot" of France, and using them to analyze the military  situation in areas neighboring Japan. While U.S. military  reconnaissance satellites are said to be capable of  distinguishing an object of a radius of at least 30 centimeters  on the earth, the remote-sensing satellites are only capable of  distinguishing an object measuring about 10 meters. Photos taken  by the remote-sensing satellites are said to help in analyzing  the movements of ground troops and the deployment of airplanes.    For this reason, the Defense Agency has studied how to  resolve technical and legal problems involving the purchase of  sophisticated satellite photos while studying the possibility of  launching its own military reconnaissance satellites.    In the past, the United States has kept the technology of  military satellites classified. In response to Russia moving to  sell satellite photos to other nations following the end of the  Cold War, the U.S. Government recently changed its conventional  policy and decided to allow private corporations to launch  highly efficient satellites to capture the market. It is said  that the U.S. Government will allow private corporations to sell  only satellite photos that can distinguish an object measuring  one meter. A DA official says if the DA uses those satellite  photos, it can distinguish the type of aircraft on the ground.    According to an official concerned, Lockheed and other  American firms are informally sounding out the DA and some Asian  nations about purchasing their satellite photos. There are  various ways to purchase those photos, including the simple  purchase of individual satellite photos and the establishment of  ground receiving stations. It is said that the monopolistic use  of satellite photos on specific areas and the right to ask for  an orbit change of satellite are negotiable.    There is a possibility that the DA's use of the  sophisticated  photos taken by the military reconnaissance satellites runs  counter to a Diet resolution calling for a ban on using the  space for military purposes. For this reason, the government  has been cautious about using the photos taken by military  reconnaissance satellites. The use of photos taken by  multipurpose commercial satellites, however, has been  interpreted as not violating the Diet resolution. The DA  maintains that the photos taken by the multipurpose commercial  satellites are the same as the sophisticated photos taken by the  military reconnaissance satellites. The use of sophisticated  photos taken by the military reconnaissance satellites may run  counter to the Diet resolution depending on contract terms  including the monopolistic use. The DA's use of sophisticated  photos taken by military reconnaissance satellites is expected  to have a subtle impact on the present military balance in  Japan's neighboring nations.    The DA plans to speed up the study of contract terms offered  by the American firms and appropriate survey expenses in the  fiscal 1995 budget, at the earliest.</p>

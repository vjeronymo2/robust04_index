			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Crisis meeting called as Russian aluminium costs soar RUSSIAN ALUMINIUM producers, shocked by rapidly rising costs, have called a crisis meeting with government officials. Their energy costs jumped by 183 per cent on October 1 and last week transport costs went up by 150 per cent. Mr Youri Shlaifshtein, deputy director responsible for foreign economic relations at Bratsk, the world's biggest aluminium smelter, said those increases had raised the cost of producing aluminium in Russia to western levels. Bratsk and another big Siberian smelter, Krasnoyarsk, have been resisting the electricity price increase imposed by Moscow because Russia is under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to lift energy prices to international levels. Mr Shlaifshtein said the Siberian smelters accounted for 86 per cent of the local power suppliers' business. 'We appreciate they have to make a profit but we have to convince the power suppliers there is a line they must not cross if smelters are not to close.' He said that, until three years ago, Bratsk, which has the capacity to produce about 840,000 tonnes of metal a year, had 'minimal' transport costs. After de-regulation of the transport sector these costs were now a great burden. Representatives of all Russia's smelters will meet senior government officials at Bratsk in mid-November. The Anthony Bird Associates consultancy group estimated that in mid-1992 the Commonwealth of Independent States' smelters were producing aluminium for about USDollars 550 a tonne because of 'astonishingly low input prices'. Mr Horst Peters, general manager, technology marketing at VAW, the German aluminium group, estimated recently that the energy cost increase would push Russian smelter costs up to Dollars 1,200 a tonne, well above recent London Metal Exchange prices. Meanwhile, Russia's foreign economic relations ministry is this week having two series of meetings about the surge in CIS aluminium exports - widely blamed for causing real prices to drop to their lowest-ever level. A European Commission delegation, headed by Mr Jorn Keck, director of bilateral trade negotiations, is seeking a voluntary restraint deal limiting exports and an industrial co-operation accord to help restructure the CIS industry. And yesterday the Russians started two-day talks with government representatives from other aluminium producing countries, including Australia, Canada, Norway and the US, as well as the EC. Some US companies want their government to seek cuts of at least 500,000 tonnes in CIS annual production and say they are ready to make dumping charges if no satisfactory solution to the CIS export problem is quickly found.</p>

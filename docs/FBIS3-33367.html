			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The passage of the Executive Branch's partial  veto of the law on the Council for Magistrates by the Chamber of  Deputies on 18 February did not come as a surprise to anybody.  Following the acceptance of the veto, Congress enacted the law  without Articles 42 and 47, which had been vetoed by the  executive branch.    Even though according to standard procedure, the partial  veto  -- which already had been approved in the Senate -- had to be  discussed in committee, Colorado Party Deputy Bernardino Cano  Radil moved that the matter be discussed in a plenary session  and his motion was adopted.    In light of the arguments made during the debate, deputies  agreed to accept the president's decision to veto two articles  of the law and the latter was carried with unanimous approval.    As of the moment it is notified of the enactment of the law  by Congress, the Executive branch has 20 days to promulgate and  publish the law, but, according to what congressmen pointed out,  the Executive branch is expected to deal with the issue in an  urgent manner so as to establish the Council for Magistrates as  soon as possible.

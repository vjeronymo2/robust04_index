			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Captain Vladimir Mokhov: "Airborne Landing in </F> Volga Region: New Service Addresses"]    [Text] Until recently the residents of this rayon center in  Saratov Oblast never saw a group of troops larger than five  officers from the local military commissariat. Now an entire  airborne regiment has entered the city.    It is basically made up of officers and warrant officers of  an airborne training center transferred to the Lvov area.  Following the breakup of the armed forces of the USSR, they  decided they wanted to serve in Russia. The Airborne Troops  arrived in the Volga region practically with only their  suitcases. And a desire to establish the same kind of training  center there. They wrote a letter to that effect to the minister  of defense and the commander of the Airborne Troops. Their  voices were heard. The date 16 October 1992 can be considered to  be the birth date of a new training center for Russia's Airborne  Troops.    They did not have to begin from scratch. In the first place,  the backbone of the regiment--the battalion and company  commanders and administrative personnel--remained the same. In  the second place, the city, rayon and oblast leadership  immediately established business contacts. The matters of  deploying the regiment, allocating land plots, the construction  of the materials and equipment base, and so forth, were resolved  without a hitch.    The military post is gradually acquiring its regular shape.  It is still necessary, however, to build and equip a training  ground 40 kilometers from the post and to restore the former  basis for the reclamation battalion, which has become  practically unusable. According to the most modest estimates,  this will require more than a billion rubles.    There is the same kind of problem with housing. For now the  officers' families are scattered throughout the city. It is not  such a problem to rent an apartment at acceptable rent in the  rayon center, to be sure. At the end of last year many of them  celebrated housewarmings in the first, 100-apartment building  built for the Airborne Troops. And construction rates should not  decrease this year. According to Colonel Valeriy Shevchuk, the  unit commander, the command element of the Volga Military  District is providing considerable assistance along with the  city authorities.    And what about the regiment's main purpose, the training of  specialists for the Airborne Troops? Right now only the  permanent staff is engaging in planned combat training. The  proper equipment and materials base is lacking for training  cadets. The most immediate prospect is for the end of 1994. The  Airborne Troops plan by that time to establish the essential  conditions for deploying one of the training battalions,  conducting the first recruitment and setting about the planned  training of specialists. If there are no problems with the  financing, this mission should be fulfilled.    The regiment is trying not lose its professional skills. The  officers, warrant officers and contract specialists (most of  whom are local residents) have completed the annual program of  parachute drops. And so, the light-blue Airborne beret has  apparently been firmly established in the interior of this small  city near the Volga.</p>

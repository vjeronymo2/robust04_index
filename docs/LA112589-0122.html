			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WANT TO RILE LIMBAUGH? COMPARE HIM TO DOWNEY OR GEORGE  </P> <P> Rush Limbaugh tries to distinguish himself from radio's new breed of "shock  jocks."  </P> <P> "I think talk radio has a rotten image these days because of that kind of  stuff," he said. "It can hurt (the success of) people like me. . . . If you  look at people who have endured in this business, they're not racist or  vulgar."  </P> <P> These days when a caller tells him, "I feel like you're more like the Morton  Downey of radio," Limbaugh does not hang up on the man nor does he berate him.  </P> <P> He counters with this logic: "Downey was known for being rude to people. Downey  was profane. Downey was not a substantive conservative. If you think Morton  Downey Jr. was a substantive conservative, then you don't know what one is!"  </P> <P> A man waving a small American flag in each hand and calling himself Bobby Bible  said he came to the Irvine show to "support a man that stands for decency and  goodness, like Wally George."  </P> <P> Limbaugh is not at all pleased with that comparison either.  </P> <P> "Wally George is the last kind of person I want to be associated with. I want  to be respected and taken seriously. I don't want the ultra far right, the John  Birchers."  </P> <P> Yet, for all his ideology, Limbaugh mostly just wants to be loved -- and become  an even richer Republican.  </P> <P> "I'm not out to save the country," he says. "I'm out to get a large audience.  I'm an entertainer first and a conservative second." CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Alvis expands with Unipower buy Alvis, the defence contractor, has bought Unipower, the Watford-based manufacturer of specialist vehicles for the military and commercial markets. Alvis, which makes armoured vehicles, is paying an initial Pounds 2m for the lossmaking business, which it said had a complementary product range with opportunities for growth in both military and civil markets. Alvis shares advanced by 9p to 67p. Under the deal Alvis will also assume Unipower's overdraft of Pounds 6m. A further deferred consideration of up to Pounds 2m in cash may be payable, depending on orders received. Mr Nick Prest, chief executive of Alvis, said: 'Since the sale of our European electro-optics business in July 1993, we have been looking to expand our specialist engineering interests in the UK.' Unipower bought some of the assets of the former Scammell division of Leyland trucks in 1988 from the Rover Group, and its main products are in the Scammell tradition. In November, the company won a Pounds 22.5m contract from a subsidiary of Rolls-Royce to supply the vehicle for the new BR-90 bridging system for the Ministry of Defence. Alvis said yesterday the UK had historically been a world leader in military bridging, and the BR-90 system had good export prospects. Unipower made an operating profit of Pounds 689,789 on sales of Pounds 15.2m in the 13 months to April 1992. Since then overheads had been maintained in anticipation of the BR-90 contract, which was continually delayed. This caused substantial losses and by November 30 the deficit on shareholders' funds was estimated at Pounds 2.4m. Unipower, which employs 95 people, also has a 70 per cent-owned subsidiary, Automotive Export Supplies, which principally distributes Land Rovers to Africa, paid for by aid agencies. AES has an order book of Pounds 2.8m and is trading profitably. Alvis said Unipower was expected to return to profitability soon, with the benefit of the BR-90 contract. The acquisition was expected to have a neutral impact on earnings in the current year to September, but would enhance earnings in the following year.</p>

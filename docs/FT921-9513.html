			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Reynolds makes big changes in Irish cabinet IRELAND'S new prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, yesterday replaced eight of Mr Charles Haughey's 14-strong cabinet, and moved three others. The most significant change is at the Foreign Ministry, where Mr Gerry Collins has been replaced by Mr David Andrews. Mr Collins has been a central figure in Anglo-Irish talks on Northern Ireland and had a good working relationship with Mr Peter Brooke, the UK Northern Ireland secretary. The failure to make any political breakthrough, though, had left his cabinet post in doubt, and Mr Andrews' appointment clears the way for possible new initiatives. Mr Andrews has held front-bench posts since the 1970s, and was a junior foreign minister from 1977 to 1979. Mr Bertie Ahern stays at finance, reflecting Mr Reynold's concern to assure the markets of continuity in economic policy. The two posts held by the Progressive Democrats, the coalition partners, are also unchanged - Mr Des O'Malley at industry and Mr Bobby Molloy at energy. Senior ministerial posts have been given to former environment minister Mr Padraig Flynn, and Ms Maire Geoghegan Quinn and Mr Michael Smith, both junior ministers sacked with Mr Reynolds by Mr Haughey last November. Mr Flynn takes over the justice portfolio from Mr Ray Burke, and will be a key figure in talks on Northern Ireland. Mrs Quinn has been given transport and telecommunications, Mr Smith environment. Also dropped from the cabinet are Mrs Mary O'Rourke (health), Mr Michael O'Kennedy (agriculture), Mr Brendan Daly (social welfare), Mr Rory O'Hanlon (environment), Mr Noel Davern (education), Mr Vincent Brady (defence). Other new faces in the cabinet are Mr Brian Cowan at labour, Mr John O'Connell at health, Mr Joe Walsh at agriculture, and Mr Charlie McCreevy at social welfare. A cheer went up in parliament at the announcement of Mr McCreevy's name. He is a long-standing opponent of Mr Haughey and led efforts to oust him in the early 1980s. Mr Noel Dempsey, a young backbencher at the forefront of the most recent rebellion against Mr Haughey, has been appointed Fianna Fail chief whip. Mr Reynolds was sworn in yesterday as prime minister after having been elected 84-78 in parliament. In a final statement as premier Mr Haughey said: 'If I were to seek any accolade. . . . it would simply be: He served the people, all the people, to the best of his abilities'.</p>

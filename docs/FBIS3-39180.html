Haavisto described the EU's position as a disappointment and  regretted the fact that the EU negotiators do not have greater  knowledge of Finland's circumstances.    "We are disappointed with the way in which the EU is  negotiating. There is no united and effective leadership in the  negotiations. Too many different EU bodies are involved, and  the Greek presidency is colored by the fact that Greece only  took over the position at the beginning of the year," Heikki  Haavisto said in an interview with FINSKA NOTISBYRAN's  correspondent in Copenhagen.    According to Haavisto, the EU negotiators do not know enough  about conditions in Finland. It is difficult therefore to  convince them that Finland needs special agricultural and  regional support.    He regretted the tough line that the EU countries adopted on  Tuesday [8 February] on agricultural and regional policy.  According to Haavisto, Finland cannot accept the EU's no to  special and permanent support for Finnish agriculture.    However, Haavisto pointed out that the negotiations are  still  being conducted chiefly at civil servant level, and that the 12  EU countries' leaders, who are expected to involve themselves in  the final phase of negotiations, have all expressed great  interest that the EU should admit the other current applicant  nations as members.    Yesterday Haavisto was on a one-day visit to Copenhagen to  discuss the Finnish position in the EU negotiations with Danish  Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen and Danish Agriculture  Minister Bjorn Westh. Haavisto described the meetings as  "extremely positive."    The two foreign ministers also discussed relations with  Russia, the Baltic region, and NATO's so-called Partnership for  Peace. According to Haavisto, Finland and Denmark have largely  concordant views on these questions.    Yesterday, Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen was much  more restrained in his comments on the situation in the EU  negotiations than was Foreign Minister Haavisto. Salolainen  stressed that the real negotiations are only just beginning --  so far it has chiefly been a case of an exchange of positions.  Decisions will not be arrived at before the decisive political  negotiations at the end of this month.    The negotiations will be conducted at ministerial level on  21-22 February and again on 25-28 February. On 25 February the  Swedish, Norwegian, and Finnish prime ministers will meet in  Helsinki to ponder the situation prior to the decisive bout of  arm wrestling.    However, Salolainen also regretted the fact that the  political goodwill that the Finnish side has been able to note  in recent high-level political contacts has still failed to find  an expression in the positions the EU has adopted in the  negotiations proper. He expects that both sides will be forced  to display "wise flexibility" in the decisive phase of the  negotiations. It will be impossible to have the Finnish demands  accepted 100 percent, but there have to be better offers from  the EU if there is to be an acceptable result from the  negotiations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In a statement to AL-SHIRA', National Defense  Minister Muhsin Dallul reiterated his rejection of a  Washington-backed Israeli request that Lebanon assimilate the  so-called South Lebanese Army [SLA] and integrate its elements  in the Lebanese Army as a condition of the Israeli withdrawal  from Lebanese territories.    The issue is an internal Lebanese affair and no country can  tell us what we should do, the minister said. Those who dealt  with Israel cannot be equated with other Lebanese militias that  were disbanded and assimilated. The former are traitors and  must stand trial in Lebanese courts, Dallul stated.</p>

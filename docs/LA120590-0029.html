			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ST. JOHN TO FACE TRIAL IN THEFT OF FUNDS;  </P> <P> HEARING: SHE IS CHARGED WITH TAKING $178,000. JUDGE SAYS THE CASE AGAINST MAYOR  BRADLEY'S EX-BUSINESS ASSOCIATE APPEARS WEAK.  </P> <P> A Municipal Court judge Tuesday ordered a longtime associate of Mayor Tom  Bradley to stand trial on charges that she bilked a city-funded Los  Angeles-Africa trade task force out of $180,000, but warned prosecutors that  "it would be very difficult at trial to prove this case beyond a reasonable  doubt."  </P> <P> Juanita St. John is charged with felony theft of $178,000 from the UCLA-based  Task Force for Africa/Los Angeles Relations, which St. John headed. The city,  largely at Bradley's behest, gave the task force nearly $400,000 between 1985  and 1989.  </P> <P> St. John, a San Marino resident, also will be tried on charges that she stole  $5,000 as treasurer of an anti-genocide group and filed false state tax returns  from 1985 through 1987. St. John has denied wrongdoing and charged that her  prosecution is politically motivated.  </P> <P> Municipal Court Judge David Doi ordered the trail after a lengthy preliminary  hearing, but added that he believes the high-profile case appeared weak.  </P> <P> "My only determination is that the (prosecution) is entitled to a trial," Doi  told Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen S. Licker. "I would suggest it would be very  difficult at trial to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt." Doi, who  heard extensive testimony and reviewed voluminous records during the  much-delayed hearing spanning three months, did not elaborate.  </P> <P> Outside the courtroom, St. John's lawyer, Victor Sherman, said Doi's comments  show that the case should be dropped. "I think he said, based on the evidence,  there's no possible way you can win in front of a jury. . . . Don't waste  (taxpayer) funds" on a trial," Sherman said.  </P> <P> But Licker said "all of the evidence isn't necessarily presented" at a  preliminary hearing. The case "wouldn't have been filed if we didn't think we  could get a conviction," he said.  </P> <P> The task force scandal has figured prominently in the ethics controversy  surrounding Bradley. The mayor and St. John were partners in a real estate  venture at the same time that Bradley was lobbying to fund the program. Bradley  sold his interests earlier this year. Also, St. John hired Bradley's daughter  at the task force and Bradley hired St. John's daughter at City Hall.  </P> <P> Outlining his case, prosecutor Licker on Tuesday said St. John, who has a  history of personal financial problems, stole task force money "to fund her  private debts (and) daily activities." He cited large, irregular withdrawals  from task force accounts immediately after annual city grants would arrive each  year.  </P> <P> Licker argued that St. John at times "laundered" her use of task force monies.  In August, 1985, St. John wrote a $21,000 task force check to "cash," Licker  said in court papers. She used the check to purchase a $21,000 cashier's check  at one bank and then went to a second bank to purchase another $21,000  cashier's check made payable to her mortgage lender, Licker said.  </P> <P> Such actions were "rationally inconsistent" with St. John's claim that she  merely took salary and reimbursements due her, Licker said.  </P> <P> But Sherman insisted that most of the money St. John allegedly stole was part  of a $75,000-a-year salary she gave herself. Members of a Bradley-appointed  task force advisory board testified St. John did a good job and was given a  free hand in the group's financial affairs, he noted. "She earned her pay. They  trusted her and she set her salary," he said.  </P> <P> Sherman said St. John was at most guilty of sloppy bookkeeping. "So what?  Where's the fraud? There isn't any," Sherman said.  </P> <P> Licker said that a $75,000 salary was nearly twice what St. John was legally  authorized and that the claim to such a salary was "an attempted cover-up" of  improper activities.  </P> <P> St. John's arraignment was set for Dec. 12.  </P></p>

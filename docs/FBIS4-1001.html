			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the IEC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on </F> 15 Apr]    [Text] Counting of votes for both national and provincial  ballots is scheduled to begin at 06h00 on Friday 29 April at  between 800 and 1000 counting centres around the country, each  of which will serve a number of voting stations.    Counting centre officials will communicate the results from  their centre to the provincial or sub-provincial offices of the  IEC [Independent Electoral Commission]. They will also announce  the results--stressing that these are provisional--to the local  media and other interested parties outside the counting centre.    Batch tallies of results will then be forwarded by these  offices to the IEC's Johannesburg headquarters, and from there  to the IEC's media and communications centre at Gallagher  Estate, Midrand, and to the SABC [South African Broadcasting  Corporation] at Auckland Park.    Running totals for the national assembly--in total and by  province--and for the provincial legislatures--by province--will  be released by the IEC at Gallagher Estate every hour, but with  a disclaimer that these are unofficial and provisional. This is  because of possible data errors, recounts and adjustments  resulting from objections by registered parties or the IEC  monitoring directorate.    Results will be broken down into total votes counted, total  votes counted per party, total spoilt ballot papers, total  disputed but counted ballots, and total disputed not counted  ballots.    After the last of the results have been determined and  certified, the decision will be made by the IEC on whether or  not the election can be certified as having been substantially  free and fair.    If this is deemed so, the IEC will announce the final  results, firstly by province, and ending with the result of the  national assembly ballot.    Official tallies per party will be announced, as will the  number of seats per party. Parties will be announced in the  order in which they appear on the ballot paper, and, while the  names of individuals to fill the seats will not be announced,  these will be made available.</p>

Pavlov, Russian  Academy of Sciences, Saint Petersburg; UDC 612.825.54+612.822.1]    [Abstract] A study examined the effect of the antioxidant  oxymetacyl (6-methyl-5-oxyuracyl) in doses of 4-5 mg/kg  (injected intramuscularly) on the cognitive characteristics of  three rhesus monkeys that had been taught to perform the task of  delayed visual differentiation of stimuli of different colors.  Bundles of microelectrodes were used to simultaneously register  the activity of several single neurons (up to four) of the  monkeys' visual cortex. The pulse activity of each neuron was  registered over several hours. At each stage of the visual  recognition process, the average frequency of neuronal activity  and other statistical characteristics were calculated, and  graphs of auto- and cross-correlation functions of neuronal  activity were plotted. The number of correct decisions made by  the monkeys and their motor response times were recorded. During  the course of the study, 212 visual cortex neurons were  registered. The motor response times and skill of the three  monkeys in differentiating the colors of test rectangles varied  greatly. The response time of monkey 1 was 1.5 to 2 times faster  than those of monkeys 2 and 3, and before the oxymetacyl  injections, monkeys 1 and 2 were could not correctly  differentiate colors with a frequency greater than that of  random guessing after delays of 4 seconds, whereas the ability  of monkey 3 to successfully differentiate colors did not  deteriorate to the frequency of random guessing until the delay  was increased to 32 seconds. Despite these significant  differences between the individual monkeys' skill levels before  receiving injections of oxymetacyl, they all manifested  identical behavioral and neurophysiological responses to the  antioxidant. With rare exceptions, the likelihood of all of the  monkeys making a correct color decision increased at all the  delay times tested. In the case of monkeys 1 and 2, their  duration of short-term memory of information after the  oxymetacyl injections increased by a factor of 2 to 4. The time  required for a correct motor response after the oxymetacyl  injections also increased significantly in the case of all three  monkeys. A corresponding significant decrease in time required  for the monkey to make an incorrect decision was also noted. All  of these changes in behavioral characteristics after the  injection of oxymetacyl were accompanied by significant  rearrangements of the pulse activity of the neurons of the  visual cortex of all three monkeys in all four stages of the  color recognition process. The study results were interpreted as  an indication that oxymetacyl possesses nootropic properties.  The observed behavioral changes following the injection of  oxymetacyl were attributed to oxymetacyl's ability to increase  the efficiency of control processes such as selective attention  and motivation.

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Arts: London picks up the Verdi torch - William Weaver welcomes Covent Garden's plans to present all 28 Verdi operas THE confirmed Verdian, of course, especially if he has reached a certain age, already knows the entire canon: one way or another, the 28 operas have been recorded, either by big companies or by pirates. And, over recent decades, all have been performed: Alzira in Rome, Oberto in Bologna, the first version of Macbeth in Danville, Kentucky and other rarities at St. Pancras or in Parma. Many of these productions were pilgrimage events; and often they were, for opera-goers, genuine revelations. Some - like I due Foscari - proved, truly, to be neglected masterpieces; but even the most problematical, the admittedly uneven works came back to vivid life, illuminating some obscure corner of Verdi's career and - as always in the case of this composer - providing an evening of dramatic, musical excitement. Now, somewhat surprisingly, London will become the Verdi shrine, the Mecca for those operatic pilgrims. An idea, conceived a couple of years ago by the Royal Opera's associate music director Sir Edward Downes and the then opera director of the house Paul Findlay, has been developed into a grand-scale plan: a Verdi Festival, formally announced at a press conference last week by Jeremy Isaacs, General Director of the ROH and his opera director designate Nicholas Payne. Briefly, the idea is this: to present all 28 Verdi operas, never less than four a year, between the summer of 1995 and the summer of 2001, the year that marks the centenary of the composer's death. Not all the productions will be new, and not all will originate at Covent Garden. The first year's programme is typical: the festival will open with a revival of the Stiffelio production introduced this year; the second offering will be a co-production with Scottish Opera of I due Foscari, which will be given first in Scotland; then there will be La traviata in a new staging planned for November 1994, to be conducted (for the first time) by Sir George Solti; and - another revival, Simon Boccanegra, conducted by Bernard Haitink. But this is not the whole story, for the Festival will include a number of complementary events; and in this inaugural season the directors have scheduled, at the South Bank Centre, two concert performances of Aroldo (Verdi's later reworking of Stiffelio) and two also of the first, 1857 version of Boccanegra, affording an exciting confrontation with the familiar 1881 version that will be given in the opera house. An international committee of more than a dozen Verdi experts, including Julian Budden, Andrew Porter, Charles Osborne and myself, meeting in London last week for the third time, discussed other supporting projects: publications, study days, exhibits, staged readings of some of the works that inspired the operas (like Byron's closet drama The Two Foscari), performances of significant non-operatic works, notably the composite Requiem for Rossini which Verdi proposed and to which he contributed (it has never been heard live in Britain). Verdi's three Parisian operas - Jerusalem (a drastic 1847 reworking of the earlier I lombardi of 1843) - will be given in successive years, in French, mounted by the Theatre Chatelet, Paris; in each case, the festival hopes to include the rarely-performed ballet music. Other Verdi ballet music (for the French version of Il trovatore, for example) will probably be heard in concert performance. Nicholas Kenyon and Clive Bennett of the BBC have assured support. Nicholas Payne confessed relief at the favourable reactions to last week announcement, having feared that critics of the Royal Opera House might seize this opportunity to accuse the management of delusions of grandeur and, worse, delusions of wealth. Actually, along with the artistic planning, the theatre's staff has been thoroughly exploring matters of sponsorship and marketing. Verdi, of course, sells well; and even the less familiar operas will be presented with star singers (Jose Carreras and Placido Domingo will alternate in Stiffelio; the much-praised young tenor Roberto Alagna will repeat here the Alfredo that won him cheers in La Scala's Traviata, Catherine Malfitano, June Anderson, and Carol Vaness are already signed up for the first year. For years Verdians have lamented the fact that in all the world there is no festival uniquely devoted to their composer; in Italy, the authorities of Parma, capital of Verdi's native region, have long been discussing - and quarreling about - the establishment of a 'Verdi Bayreuth' in their city. Projects have been announced, initiated, aborted, abandoned. And, though Parma is one of Italy's richest and most cultivated cities, funds and imagination have always been lacking. Now London has boldly picked up the torch and is running with it. In two years' time, the capital can expect, no doubt, an unusually large influx of Italian summer visitors; many of them will speak with a Parma accent. As Verdi did.</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Unigroup declines to Pounds 304,000 Pre-tax profits at Unigroup, the building products and garment manufacturer, fell from Pounds 708,000 to Pounds 304,000 in the six months to end-December. Mr Tunku Imran, chairman, said that although the timber division continued to perform satisfactorily the building products division had been severely affected by the economic situation in Europe and the UK in particular. The clothing division continued to suffer from low high street demand and reduced margins and the company is evaluating its future. Turnover rose to Pounds 11.6m (Pounds 11.1m) but operating profits fell to Pounds 562,000 (Pounds 854,000) and there were increased interest and other charges of Pounds 258,000 (Pounds 146,000). Earnings per share dropped from 1.9p to 0.58p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [PAP report by "Ziel": "Fiasco Averted: Mazowiecki Says He </F> Changed His Mind"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Mazowiecki expressed the hope  that the new party [created by merging the Democratic Union (UD)  and the Liberal Democratic Congress (KLD)] would be "marked by  organizational efficiency" and "free from the crisis and  paralysis that has been crippling the UD for months.". The new  group is conceived as an alternative to the political  configuration currently in force.  <H5>  Kuron's Dilemmas </H5>   Jacek Kuron revealed that he would join the new party,  designed to emerge from the UD and KLD fusion, only if it  declared itself firmly in favor of economic effectiveness.  However, that goal should be realized on the basis of general  public support. Kuron insisted that the conflict between public  expectations and the requirements of rational economics was the  main reason for the collapse of political authorities.  <H5>  There Are Some With Whom We Cannot Share the Same Path </H5>   The principles of the new party's statute do not provide for  the existence of separate factions within the group. The  Congress received this clause with many reservations. Ecological  Faction chairman Radoslaw Gawlik even went so far as to call it  "antidemocratic, politically stupid, and potentially explosive  for the Union."    Social-Liberal Faction chairman Zofia Kuratowska was more  circumspect in her opinions. Yet even she warned against the  danger that the party might now lose many members who had  originally joined the UD because they identified themselves with  a particular UD faction. Kuratowska was even more concerned  about possible membership losses that may be incurred by the  fusion with the KLD. "In some regions," she stressed, "there are  particular KLD members with whom we would not sit at the same  table." Factional divisions and their associated difficulties  manifested themselves early enough, making it impossible for  Congress delegates assembled in the hall to sing "Happy  Birthday" to Bronislaw Geremek: Each table sang in a different  key and to a different tempo.</p>

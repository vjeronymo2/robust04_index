Colonel-General Mikhail Kolesnikov, Chief of the  Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff, Answers KRASNAYA  ZVEZDA Correspondents' Questions"]    [Text] [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Mikhail Petrovich, we will soon  be celebrating the second anniversary of the creation of the  Russian Federation Armed Forces. What, in your view, is  remarkable about these two years?    [Kolesnikov] The most remarkable point has been that we have  indeed set up Russian Armed Forces. And those are not just  words. Despite the fact that the bulk of former USSR Armed  Forces groupings were part of the Russian Army, they did not  represent an integrated military organization. That was the  first problem which we had to deal with.    The results of our work were assessed by the Russian  Federation president in his address to the Federal Assembly. He  noted that the Armed Forces are combat-ready and capable of  carrying out the tasks facing them. This assessment from the  supreme commander in chief places a great responsibility on us  and, at the same time, attests to the correctness of the  approaches chosen by the Defense Ministry toward the  safeguarding of security.    As for specific measures, I believe that KRASNAYA ZVEZDA  readers know about them. These include the cutbacks in Armed  Forces manpower, the troop withdrawal from other states, and  structural changes in administrative organs.    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Just how substantive have been the changes  to the initial reform concept? After all, two years ago we were  all hoping that the country's economic position now would not be  so difficult. But the situation regarding Army funding has not  improved and there are still big problems, so it seems to some  of our readers that under these conditions any break with the  existing specific structure of the Armed Forces will inevitably  lead to breakdowns in command and control....    [Kolesnikov] I would like to note that the main measures  regarding the organizational development of the Russian Armed  Forces were drawn up and reflected in the concept and plan for  the organizational development of the Russian Federation Armed  Forces. And although, owing to funding difficulties, we are  indeed changing the timetable for the introduction of certain  military infrastructure projects and the pace of the technical  equipping of the troops has been slowed, the questions of their  military and technical provision are being very actively  resolved and, on the whole, the main thrust of the creation and  reform of the Army and Navy is being maintained. This includes  improving the structure and composition of the Armed Forces,  reforming the Defense Ministry's military-technical policy and  the principle for manpower acquisition, enhancing combat and  mobilization readiness....    As regards the second half of your question, I would like to  reassure readers -- we are being very cautious about changing  the structure and combat makeup of the Armed Forces. And  decisions are made only after painstaking theoretical analysis  and practical checks, and, of course, not to the detriment of  the troops' combat readiness.    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] It is well known that the first strategic  echelon of the former USSR's defense ceased to exist with the  troop withdrawal from East Europe. The second echelon troops  remain behind in our nearest neighbors, and our former internal  districts -- like Moscow and the North Caucasus -- have become  border districts. What are the prospects for their development?    [Kolesnikov] The demise of the USSR resulted in a  fundamental break in the disposition of forces. We lost  territories and, correspondingly, a strategic echelon, and  reserve troops formed the basis of the first operational  echelon. It was necessary to create force groupings in all the  western and southwestern sectors virtually from scratch. The  problem was that large strategic formations and combined units  were being organized from scratch, and this required the  preparation of the relevant infrastructure. This has happened  during a period of Armed Forces organizational development and  reform, with an acute shortage of material resources and  funding. As a result, the tasks and role of the Leningrad,  Moscow, and North Caucasus Military Districts have changed  substantially....    The Russian Federation border in the west now runs through  the western borders of Leningrad, Pskov, Smolensk, Bryansk,  Kursk, Belgorod, Voronezh, and Rostov Oblasts and, in the  southwest, through Krasnodar and Stavropol Krays,  Kabardino-Balkaria, North Ossetia, Chechnya, Ingushetia, and  Dagestan -- as a result of which the Moscow and North Caucasus  Military Districts have acquired the status of border districts.  Their staffing has been increased somewhat. But I consider it  necessary to draw attention to the fact that the increase is  taking place in connection with the Russian troop withdrawal  from other states. We are proceeding primarily on the basis of  the convenience of stationing and providing for those troops on  national territory. Several additional combined and other units  have been set up in the southwest -- in the North Caucasus  Military District -- primarily with light weapons.    As far as prospects are concerned, these are to conclude the  reception of the troops withdrawn from the FRG and the Baltic in  these districts, to billet them, make provision for them, and  organize planned combat training in them. On the whole, border  military districts as newly constituted will have to resolve the  tasks of safeguarding Russia's military security in accordance  with the changed conditions of the current situation.    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] The transition which began last year to  the mixed method of Army and Navy staffing has shown that  contract service is not all plain sailing. In particular, it  has not proved possible to substantially use contract servicemen  to fill positions which primarily determine the combat  capability of units and ships, or positions in troops carrying  out peacekeeping missions. This year another 150,000 contract  servicemen should join the forces. Will they again find  themselves at bases, dumps, and other "hot" spots? What needs  to be done to prevent this happening?    [Kolesnikov] The Russian Federation president in his edict  No. 166 of 18 January 1994 instructed the Defense Ministry to  recruit 150,000 volunteers to fill primarily combat positions.  In execution of these instructions the defense minister,  defining the tasks for 1994, called for candidates to be taken  on for military service under contract as soldiers and sailors  with the kind of skills in particularly short supply which  determine the combat capability of the Russian Federation Armed  Forces. He ratified a list of these positions, and for each of  them the qualification requirements which the candidates taken  on under contract would have to meet were drawn up. Moreover,  in order to create a material incentive, pay scales for the main  posts -- including gunnery commanders, pontoon bridge  commanders, self-propelled artillery commanders, mine  specialists, reconnaissance troops, divers, crane operators, and  so forth -- have been increased.    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Let's talk about alternative service....    [Kolesnikov] There is currently no law on alternative  (nonmilitary) service in the Russian Federation, although this  kind of service is laid down by the Russian Federation  Constitution.    Obviously, in drafting such a law -- whose speedy adoption  is  increasingly being advocated by the public and by spiritual or  religious organizations -- the provisions of the relevant  international acts, and world practice in the organization and  implementation of alternative service will be taken into  account. At the same time, it must also take account of national  interests and, above all, of the need to reliably safeguard the  state's defense capability. We have made progress in this area.    I think that it will be necessary to refrain at least until  1997 from adopting or even introducing a Russian Federation law  on alternative service. There is a whole host of reasons for  this, chief among which is the exceptionally difficult situation  with regard to the manpower acquisition of soldiers, sailors,  warrant officers, and petty officers in the Russian Federation  Armed Forces and other troops owing to the severe shortage of  draft resources and the still very undeveloped system of  contract service, whose formation should have been completed  only by 1997-1999.    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] It is understandable that the problem of  military-technical policy should have a special place in the  organizational development of the Russian Armed Forces. Under  today's conditions of tight financial appropriations for  defense, what priorities can be highlighted in the development  and purchase of arms and military hardware?    [Kolesnikov] On the basis of the main provisions of military  doctrine, military-technical policy is aimed at concentrating  limited financial resources in order to develop weapons with  flexible [mezhvidovoy] applications ensuring the resolution of  tasks primarily in local wars and conflicts. The main  priorities in developing and purchasing armaments and military  hardware are integrated reconnaissance, communications, and  battle management systems and weapons.    When buying armaments at the minimum level necessary to  preserve a core military-industrial potential, stress is laid on  developing the scientific and technical contribution and to  working on key elements which will make it possible, when the  economic situation improves, to move to full-scale work and to  provide timely supplies of the requisite numbers of modern  weapons for the Army and Navy.    Currently, as a result of meager Defense Ministry funding,  the number of weapons types that are under development or have  been modernized has been severely cut back, along with the total  volume of purchases. Any further funding cuts could lead to the  collapse of the defense industry, the loss of core scientific  and defense potential, and an inability to independently develop  [sozdavat] and produce basic competitive high-tech prototypes of  weapons and military hardware.    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] At the start of the reforms there were a  lot of complaints about the inadequacy of the relevant  legislative base. How do you now assess the legal backup for  Armed Forces organizational development and the provision of  social guarantees for servicemen? What new progress has been  made in this direction?    [Kolesnikov] The legal foundations for the organizational  development and activity of the Russian Federation Armed Forces  have basically already been created. Eleven laws and more than  100 other normative legal acts have been adopted and are in  force in the defense sphere. The main provisions of Russian  Federation military doctrine have been ratified for the first  time at the level of a normative legal act.    We will now have to bring the legal basis for the  organizational development and activity of the Armed Forces into  line with the Constitution and the main provisions of the  Russian Federation's military doctrine, and to create a  clear-cut system of military legislation. We have prepared  proposals on clarifying current laws and elaborating new ones in  the defense sphere. Above all, these would be laws making  amendments and additions to the Russian Federation laws "On  Defense," "On the Draft and Military Service," "On the Status of  Servicemen," "On Pension Provision for Servicemen".... We will  have to draw up and adopt new laws: "On Martial Law," "On the  Military Militia (Police)," "On Military Courts," and others --  more than 20 draft laws in all.    Moreover, we need a package of normative legal acts to  define  the procedure for implementing military organizational  development as a whole.    As for social guarantees for servicemen, these have been  laid  down by Russian Federation laws and other normative acts issued  by the Russian Federation president and Government.  Unfortunately, a number of provisions of the Russian Federation  law "On the Status of Servicemen" are not in operation owing to  the fact that a mechanism for implementing them has not been  defined and there is no funding available. We will have to  fully develop a mechanism for implementing the privileges,  guarantees, and compensation laid down by law for servicemen,  persons discharged from military service, and their family  members.    Moreover, on the basis of constitutional principles, we are  planning to step up legal protection for servicemen and Armed  Forces' civilian personnel in military administrative organs and  military units, to charge the military-legal service with the  defense of their legitimate interests, and to set up a military  advocate's service. These and other changes in the  military-legal sphere will be implemented within the framework  of military-legal reform in the Russian Federation Armed Forces.  This is something that the Russian Federation president in his  address to the Russian Federation Federal Assembly made one of  the main avenues of Armed Forces organizational development.    The Defense Ministry is currently drawing up a concept for  military-legal reform whose measures will be implemented in  coordination with other military reform measures in 1994-1995  and in the subsequent period.    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] One last question, Mikhail Petrovich,  regarding the press. Or, rather, relations between the General  Staff and the press. After all, a lot of people in the writing  fraternity have recently been making loud statements on the  subject of negative aspects of the Army. And everything in this  area is, as the saying goes, grist to the mill -- from the  publication of unverified facts to out-and-out lying. How do  you personally react when you encounter these sorts of articles?  On the other hand, to what extent has a link been established  between the General Staff and the press?    [Kolesnikov] I would call the relationship between the  General Staff and most of the Russian media entirely normal.  With the help of the Defense Ministry's Information and Press  Directorate, we have organized regular business contacts. We  are striving to ensure that all the most important events in the  life of the Armed Forces with a direct impact on the General  Staff's sphere of activity are covered by media representatives.  We systematically invite them to briefings and press  conferences, answer their questions, give interviews, consult  with them on the most difficult problems, and prepare articles  at editorial collectives' request. Field trips by journalists  to military units, visits to various Army and Navy  installations, military-training establishments, training  centers, and so forth are organized with the direct  participation of General Staff personnel. This kind of  relationship between the press and the General Staff has already  become an established system and allows us to make our military  policy more open to society. Our fellow countrymen get an  entirely objective idea about everything taking place in the  Army.    At the same time, certain journalists have clearly failed to  cement a relationship with the General Staff. And we are by no  means to blame. Certain journalists are trying to make a name  for themselves with pseudosensationalistic stories, unconfirmed  facts, rumors, conjecture, and sometimes even barefaced lies.  Take, for instance, the "report from entirely reliable sources"  that there is allegedly already some kind of plan in place for  dividing up the General Staff and the Defense Ministry. Totally  false! And I could quote dozens of examples like that. How do  I personally react to all this? In different ways. Sometimes I  just swear, but most often I give instructions for a  corresponding explanation or refutation to be prepared if the  lies are, as they say, totally off the wall and could have major  negative consequences not only for Russian public opinion but  also for international relations.    Of course, you cannot muzzle everyone. Freedom of speech has  brought to journalism not only greater glasnost, but also  irresponsibility when it comes to dealing with information. We  at the General Staff are increasingly arriving at the conclusion  that the relevant articles of the law on the mass media are not  working. If liars and spreaders of disinformation and calumny  were taken to court more often, then many of them would probably  lose their "appetite" for making a name for themselves through  lying. We probably need to stop being always on the defensive.  We will combat those who besmirch us in the appropriate manner  -- following the letter and spirit of the law. But it is better  to build civilized relations in the way that is generally  accepted worldwide -- using the language of truth and mutual  respect.</p>

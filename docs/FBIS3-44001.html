The head of state, General  Sani Abacha, approved this in Abuja today following a request  for an extension by the Gambian external affairs minister,  Alhaji Omar Sey.    Gen. Abacha told the visiting Gambian envoy that Nigeria  would do its best to ensure the security of the West African  subregion and Africa in general. He advised countries in the  subregion to exploit the training facilities which Nigerian  military institutions offer.    Alhaji Sey, who is in Nigeria with a message from the  Gambian  president, Sir Dawda Jawara, said Gambia supports Nigeria's  ongoing democratization process. He expressed his country's  appreciation for Nigeria's continued assistance in the areas of  health, the judiciary, police, and prison services.</p>

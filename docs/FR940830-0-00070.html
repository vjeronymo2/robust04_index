HUD strongly recommends open and full communication between the residents and the HA throughout the planning and funding process and believes that it is essential to achieve and sustain viable public and Indian housing. As requested by the comments, the timing of meetings with the residents should be at the discretion of the HA. HUD has decided not to impose thresholds on resident consultation for changes within the Five-Year Action Plan. Although resident council involvement is not required whenever work items are shifted within the Five-Year Action Plan, HUD believes that consultation is generally in the best interest of good relations between the HA and the residents. The degree of consultation should be consistent with the degree of change and that determination is at the discretion of the HA. HAs are encouraged to inform residents of significant changes. Except for emergencies, items which are not in the Five-Year Action Plan require resident consultation and HUD approval before being undertaken.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Public Hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HUD proposed that HAs hold annually at least one public hearing and any appropriate number of additional hearings to ensure ample opportunity for residents, local government officials and other interested parties to express their priorities and concerns. HAs were to give full consideration to the comments and concerns of residents, local government officials, and other interested parties. NYCHA indicated that each year there are too many changes in their plans to detail at the public hearing. NYCHA urged PHAs to provide detailed resident notification, and the best vehicle for large PHAs to provide this notification is through Modernization and Maintenance Committee meetings at the development level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, it was commented that presenting a draft P&amp;E Report for all active funding years would increase instead of decrease the HA administrative burden. The final report would need to prepared again in just a few months. Adding the P&amp;E Reports to the agenda would compound the confusion in absorbing all this information during meetings. A simple summary of active modernization projects and management improvements would suffice for this stage of the process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the final rule, HUD has left the level of detail up to the HA. However, the HA is required to present information on the Comprehensive Plan/Annual Submission and progress of previously funded modernization programs. Development level meetings are acceptable, but not required. By statute, HAs must hold at least one public hearing. The number of additional meetings necessary is left to HA discretion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Summaries <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As part of its Comprehensive Plan, a HA is required to prepare various summaries. Some commenters questioned the level of detail required. Rather than require less detail that would require more explanation after the fact, one HA suggested that the required level of detail should be such that HUD will be able to make its eligibility and environmental needs determination at the time of submission. PHADA suggested that the provision of work categories, quantity, and overall costs, as opposed to work items and individual costs, is a workable compromise. It was requested that the rule more clearly define the level of detail at this point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another issue related to the level of detail was that because HUD proposes that the level of detail in the Annual Statement and Five-Year Action Plan be consistent, this would result in increased detail in the balance of the Five-Year Plan. It was found to be beneficial to use a consistent level of detail for all work, however a HA noted that the level of detail should be in sufficient detail to relay the scope of work and cost for all reports, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the new Five-Year Plan and the P&amp;E Report. A further breakdown of work items in the P&amp;E Report would be an extraordinary administrative burden for HAs and contractors and would be of questionable value and accuracy. Detailed cost documentation exists in HA's files to support any work items that HUD would like to examine more closely.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HUD has adopted the recommendation that the level of detail be consistent in the Annual Statement, the Five-Year Action Plan and the P&amp;E Report. The level of detail for physical work includes a description of major work categories, quantity and cost. The level of detail for administrative and management improvement costs must be sufficient enough for HUD to make a determination of eligibility. For example, the HA must describe training activities and how they relate to identified physical or management improvement needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The combination of annual statements and five-year plans at &sect;968.330 presented a statutory issue according to ACORN. ACORN argued that this contradicts section 14(e)(3)(A) of the Act, which sets forth the requirement of PHAs to produce an Annual Statement. Further, it was stated that this requirement is clearly distinct from the comprehensive needs assessment and action plan described in subsections (e)(l)(A) and (e)(l)(D). ACORN stated that the combination of the Annual Statement with the larger document will make interpretation of the single year's policymaking very difficult. Site-specific data for residents will become confusing. Since the Five-Year Action Plan and Annual Statement serve two distinct purposes, and since their merger will entail significant disadvantages in citizen participation, they argued that the two should remain separate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Alfred Artamonov] </F>   [Text] Izhevsk June 6 TASS -- The idea of setting up a  federal military-industrial centre in Izhevsk was approved by  Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Aleksandr Volkov,  head of the Udmurtia Government, said at a meeting today with  the directors of the republic's largest industrial enterprises.  The centre's main aim is to preserve scientific, technical,  personnel and production potential.    Udmurtia has a good base for the creation of the centre, it  was said at the meeting. Factories producing arms and means of  communications can take the functions of this prestigious body  upon themselves. The Izhevsk Technical Univerity and the  Technological Scientific Research Institute "Progress" are  successfully training personell for the centre.    According to the idea's authors, besides defence production  factories, the federal centre should include structures selling  military supplies. Enterprise directors emphasised that, in  order to make the whole complex work on a stable basis, it must  receive stable military orders with guaranteed payment,  concessional customs duties on the sale of arms abroad, and a  temporary exemption from paying exorbitant taxes. The  enterprises' board of directors also submitted to the government  a draft, envisaging an investment tax credit to Udmurtia's  converted enterprises. The credit would be made to the federal  budget, and would have to be paid back by the enterprises.</p>

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Appointments: Insurance moves WINDSOR Insurance Brokers, which has been expanding apace since a management shake-up last May, has recruited a team of professional indemnity brokers. John Knott, Chris Wright, Simon Lakey, Andy Errit and Paul Ciprini are joining Windsor from Alfred Blackmore, also a leader in this area. Windsor, which derives about 25 per cent of its revenues from broking insurance in the sports industry, has been seeking to diversify under the leadership of Mike Eagles, the chief executive who joined from Citicorp last year. The group has reduced staff numbers sharply - down to around 160 compared with 250 last year - but has increased its presence in both reinsurance and life and pensions. ***** John Grant is appointed general representative of the UK branch of ASSICURAZIONI GENERALI; Terence Linnegar becomes secretary/chief accountant. ***** Norval Bryson is appointed joint deputy chief executive and joins the board of SCOTTISH PROVIDENT. BAIN CLARKSON has appointed Terry Clark and Robert Dean as directors of the special risks division and Paul Crook and Stephen Adams directors of the marine and energy division. ***** Charles Thompson is a director and deputy chief executive of SCOTTISH MUTUAL ASSURANCE. ***** John Hodges is deputy chairman and Bryan Ferguson md of CAMOMILE Underwriting Agencies.</p>

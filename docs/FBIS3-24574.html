Osipov; UDC 535.8:535.514:535.317.61] </F>   [Abstract] Experimental realization of a laser beam  diffraction on micro-transparancies of synthesized interference  pattern with a 1.5 mm diameter indicates that in the Frauenhofer  diffraction region, the wave field has a pseudo-caustic  character exhibiting a characteristic flare and cell structure.  This constitutes an experimental proof of the fact, that for the  focusing systems with a meridional aberration of the third order  coma, the caustic diffraction fields, produced in the focal  plane, and complex interference fields, formed in the Twyman-  Green interferometer and describing the deviation of the  converging wave front from the reference sphere, are  qualitatively related by the Fourier transform.

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: M&amp;G takes a leaf out of its own book M&amp;G, the fund management group that stresses the importance of companies paying high dividends, is increasing its own interim dividend by 30 per cent to 13p as profits continue to surge. The move partly reflects the intention to reduce the disparity with the final payment but the company expects total dividends to rise by at least 12 per cent to 28p. Pre-tax profits in the six months to March 31 rose by 37 per cent to Pounds 31.2m (Pounds 22.8m). Funds under management increased by 13 per cent to Pounds 14.1bn. Unit trust sales more than doubled to Pounds 574m (Pounds 232m) and net of redemptions jumped from just Pounds 4m to Pounds 308m. That represented 12.8 per cent of the industry total. Unit trust Pep sales almost trebled to Pounds 304m, boosted by the removal of the initial charge on the Managed Income Fund Pep in January. Mr Paddy Linaker, who retires as group managing director in July, said he was pleased with the improvement in marketing following personnel changes. 'Last year we were pleased with the investment performance, but a bit disappointed with sales.' Life and pension policies also showed strong growth, with sales of single premium life policies almost trebling to Pounds 120m and single premium pension policies up 88 per cent to Pounds 49m. Revenue from institutional clients rose 19 per cent to Pounds 2.99m, although higher costs reduced profits to Pounds 784,000 (Pounds 1.1m). Mr Linaker said the investment performance had held up well until the end of March and that the group was well positioned with a UK equities portfolio relatively light of highly-rated large companies. 'The relative outperformance of income, recovery and smaller company stocks has at least another year to go,' he declared. Earnings rose to 29.1p (21.5p).</p>

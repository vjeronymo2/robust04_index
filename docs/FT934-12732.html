			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (21): How the state withered away - The rapid progress of history's biggest auction WHEN the history of the Treuhand, the agency charged with restructuring and privatising eastern German industry, is written, it will be recorded that never before had an organisation been charged with privatising an entire economy in such a short space of time. It is one of the largest privatisations ever undertaken. No doubt, other large sell-offs will follow - probably in Russia. The economic historian will also show how the agency, hastily created in the ebbing days of communist rule in eastern Germany, provoked ferocious criticism from eastern Germans - even more criticism than the former communist state received. Mrs Birgit Breuel, head of the Treuhand, explains the intensity of that criticism. 'Our bad reputation in eastern Germany results from our job to reduce their jobs.' In pursuing its mandate, the agency in one sweep effectively replaced a state-run economy with an institution committed to the market economy. It believed there was no alternative: no half-way house between a centralised and market economy. In the early days, the Treuhand made terrible mistakes. When it started its operations on Leipziger Strasse in Berlin in July 1990, west German companies rushed in to make quick killings. These took two forms. They bought the cream of eastern German companies to keep out foreign competition. Also, they bought companies to secure the real estate, and then closed them down. Mrs Breuel does not deny any of these charges. However, the Treuhand had no instruments for privatisating the 13,000 enterprises placed in its charge. 'We had nothing but the law at that time,' said Mrs Breuel. 'We had no tools, no rules, not even a list of the companies for which we were responsible. We had to do everything at the same time. Find out the companies and all the other things for which we were responsible. Build up a team and the manpower, and develop our own rules,' she adds. The rules quickly evolved. Even if any investor bought an enterprise for a token D-Mark, he or she had to guarantee a certain number of jobs and a level of investments spread over several years. Through this system, the agency has saved 1.5m jobs and secure investments totalling DM180bn after privatising nearly 13,000 companies. But 2.5m people were made redundant. For its part, the Treuhand agreed to pick up the enterprises' losses, and environmental liabilities. The Treuhand debt stands at DM280bn - eastern Germany's total GDP for this year is estimated to be DM220bn. The debt consists of bank liabilities of DM90bn that have been, or are still due to be taken over from eastern German state enterprises targeted for privatisation; bonds already, or in the future, to be issued by the Treuhand to finance its current activities, including the restructuring and operation of unsold enterprises and debt servicing (by 1995, these will amount to DM145bn); contingent liabilities, including the costs of environmental clean-up, which will exceed DM45bn. The agency's job is nearly complete. What remains of the Treuhand's work includes a contracts department which will monitor the implementation of the investment and job guarantee commitments; the real estate arm of the agency; the sale, or renting and selling of agricultural and forest land; and the remaining 1,390 enterprises still on its books. The latter employ a total of 259,833 people. But some of these enterprises will not be easy to privatise, let alone restructure. They include the uncompetitive chemical, heavy machinery, and engineering sector. The Treuhand has set up five management companies under which several enterprises will be placed to be restructured by western German managers with the aim of eventually privatising them. But, along with Buna, the giant chemicals plant, and Deutsche Waggonbau, the railway coach manufacturers, the agency now finds that it is being pulled between the politicians, economists and bankers about the fate of these companies. For social reasons, the Treuhand cannot afford to close down these plants. Neither the politicians in Bonn or in the eastern states would support such a move; federal and state elections take place next year. On the other side, economists and bankers are loath to see the west German taxpayer subsidise enterprises which have no hope of ever becoming competitive. It is no wonder Mrs Breuel believes the agency has become a scapegoat, or a shield for the politicians. 'For quite some time (the agency was a scapegoat). This was the idea of our job, actually: to have distance between the politicians and the Treuhand's enterprises. No politicians in the world could have taken our decision. I myself am convinced that it was a very clever idea ..' A debate about the fate of these 'core' companies which once formed the backbone of eastern Germany's manufacturing and industrial base is now in full swing. Furthermore, economists are asking about the impact the newly-privatised sector will have in helping to create a basis for a new competitive industry. Perhaps it is too early to answer this question particularly since the Treuhand's work has taken place against the backdrop of three factors: the collapse of the markets in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union; the recession in western Germany, which has affected investments and orders in eastern Germany; and the insistence of former east German managers, west German employers, and IG Metall, the engineering trade union, to bring eastern German wage levels up to west German levels by 1996. This is despite the fact that productivity in the east is about 65 per cent below its western counterparts. However, some general observations can be made. First, the common complaint made by investors is that the job guarantees and investment commitments are too inflexible. Mr Heiner Flassbeck, chief economist at the Berlin-based German Institute for Economic Research, argues that managers cannot rationalise further to generate higher productivity - and eventually profits  -because of the contracts. Mrs Breuel says contracts can be made more flexible - for example, investments can be spread over a longer time span. So far, about 10 per cent of the privatised companies are seeking the renegotiating of the contracts. It is unclear how many will be unable to survive even if the contracts are made more flexible. But Mrs Breuel is adamant the Treuhand will not buy back companies. 'Our mandate is to privatise,' she said. A key indication of the success of the privatised companies will emerge over the next few years when the contracts expire. If they have weathered the recession and the high wage levels, will they retain or indeed expand their labour force; or, if they shed jobs, will there be sufficient growth in the eastern German economy to absorb those who are made redundant? The Treuhand would relish a Yes to both questions. It would confirm that it has laid the basis for a new competitive industry. It would also answer the critics.</p>

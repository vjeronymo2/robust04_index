			<p>BFN     [Text] Panama City, 18 Apr (ACAN) -- Civil Aeronautics  Director Zosimo Guardia revealed today that Panamanian  authorities have penalized the U.S. company United Airlines by  suspending its operations for violating Panamanian regulations  on airfares.    Guardia said during a news conference that the conflict  arose  when United Airlines began offering a special promotion which  was valid until 30 June. According to the advertisement,  travelers would get a free ticket if they purchased their ticket  through American Express.    Guardia clarified that this promotion violates the stability  of airfares. After the airline failed to cancel the promotion  following numerous complaints, it was decided on 29 March to  impose a $2,000 fine.    According to Guardia, the U.S. company failed to make a down  payment on the $2,000 fine, so its operating permit was  suspended on 15 April.    Since that time, a United Airlines plane has been parked at  Tocumen International Airport unable to take off.    Travel agencies told ACAN that United Airlines canceled the  travel promotion on 18 April, but the company has not made an  official announcement on the matter.</p>

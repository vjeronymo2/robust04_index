			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Bronfman units cut quarterly dividends in half EDPER Enterprises and Pagurian, two leading holding companies in the business empire controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, yesterday cut their quarterly common share dividends in half. The cuts reflect a thinning stream of dividend income and shrinking cash resources in the upper layers of the Bronfman group. Several operating companies, most notably in the real estate and financial services sectors, have reduced their common dividends in the past year. Bramalea, a property developer, has halted preferred dividends. Edper, which is Mr Peter Bronfman's top public company, is reducing its dividend to 20 cents a share from 40 cents. Pagurian, the main vehicle for the Bronfmans' senior managers to participate as shareholders in the group, has cut its dividend to 7.5 cents from 15 cents. Mr Edward Bronfman, brother of Mr Peter Bronfman, has a minority interest of 19 per cent in Edper. The top Bronfman companies have also lost an important source of dividend income with last week's sale of the group's 38 per cent stake in John Labatt, the brewer. Labatt has recently contributed about CDollars 32m (Dollars 25.3m) a year to Brascan, its immediate holding company. The Bronfman empire last week raised almost CDollars 2bn from the disposal of the controlling block in Labatt and in MacMillan Bloedel, the Vancouver-based forest products company.</p>

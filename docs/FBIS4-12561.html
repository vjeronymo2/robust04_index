			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] Today's newspapers devote their commentaries to the  military siege imposed by the Israeli occupation authorities on  the occupied Arab territories, thus turning the occupied West  Bank and Gaza into a closed detention camp.    Commenting on the Israeli acts of suppression against Arab  citizens in the occupied Arab territories, TISHRIN says: The  Israeli Cabinet has extended indefinitely the military siege  imposed on the occupied Arab territories, amid circumstances  asserting that the situation in the occupied territories is  unbearable and that our people there are experiencing hell  because of Israel's iron-fist policy and the scheme of  collective punishment.    Some Israeli officials have acknowledged that the increase  in  the Israeli military and economic pressure on the occupied  territories will definitely generate more violence and  resistance. This will also starve the sons of our people in the  occupied West Bank and Gaza. The policy of complete closure  betrays total Israeli inability to face a growing, stepped-up  Palestinian resistance.    TISHRIN adds: There is no doubt that the failure of the  occupation to provide security to its settlers and forces is yet  further evidence that Israel is incapable, whatever its methods  and brutal, suppressive practices, of undermining the  steadfastness of our people in the face of the Israeli war,  aggression, and terrorism machine.    Israel has repeatedly resorted to such methods. This is not  the first time the occupation authorities seal off the West Bank  and Gaza and tighten the siege on them. What is strange,  however, while observing the serious, explosive developments in  the occupied territories, is the silence toward this situation  and the indifference of some international capitals and  political circles toward what is happening, despite its severity  and seriousness. This is as if the fate of the Palestinian  people does not deserve a word of justice against the Israeli  occupier and as if threatening the very existence of this people  no longer requires assuming urgent missions to save the life of  the defenseless sons of Palestine, after the occupation has  turned their life into unbearable hell because of the Israeli  suppressive practices.    TISHRIN asserts that Israel takes lightly all human values  and international laws and charters. The paper urges people  with a living conscience who care about the stability and  security of the West Bank and Gaza to come to the rescue of  justice and humanity, lift the injustice and oppression against  the Palestinian people, and protect its sons who are  experiencing real massacres and a serious war of starvation.    AL-BA'TH comments on Israel's crimes in the occupied Arab  territories that threaten peace opportunities. Israel has  turned both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip into closed  detention camps. It has imposed collective punishment on the  people of Palestine, thus violating all international norms and  charters and the Geneva Convention on the protection of human  rights.    The paper asserts that the measures adopted by the  occupation  against our people in the occupied territories are not new. The  record of the occupation is rife with the ugliest kinds of  crimes. The enemy generals have acknowledged that they are  fighting a true war in the West Bank and Gaza.    AL-BA'TH notes that Israel sheds tears over peace and tries  to appear before the world as an advocate of peace. This  approach toward world public opinion is no longer useful to the  Rabin government, having unmasked its bloody face through a  series of crimes carried out in the occupied territories in  broad daylight and under the very gaze of the whole world.    Concluding, the paper calls on those who are making serious  efforts for a just and comprehensive peace to put an end, once  and for all, to Israel's crimes because spilling Arab blood does  not serve the peace process, nor make it possible to achieve any  step forward.</p>

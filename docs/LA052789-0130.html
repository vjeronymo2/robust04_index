			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SPOTLIGHT: UPPER NEWPORT BAY ECOLOGICAL RESERVE  </P> <P> Location: West of Back Bay Drive, Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Information: (714) 640-6746.  </P> <P> Description: Most of the shallow bay is exposed at low tide and consists of  intertidal mudflats and an extensive salt marsh community of cordgrass,  pickleweed, saltgrass, jaumea and the endangered salt marsh bird's beak. More  than half the nation's breeding pairs of the endangered light-footed clapper  rail make their home here. Stands of rush, cattail, tule and willow occur where  freshwater runoff enters the bay and along portions of the channelized San  Diego Creek. The reserve is used extensively by migrating shorebirds and  waterfowl.  </P> <P> Recreation: Biking and walking are allowed in the reserve on Back Bay Drive and  along a bikeway. Birdwatching is a popular activity, especially in spring and  fall. This month, the reserve became part of the new California Wildlands  Program, and guided nature walks and other activities are now offered on a  regular basis. Plans are under consideration to expand the reserve and  construct a new nature center.  </P> <P> Fees: No admission charge for the reserve. There is a $2 fee to take part in  scheduled programs; annual passes are $10, which includes unlimited programs  and admission to eight other California wild land areas.  </P> <P> History: The naturally-protected lower bay has been used as a harbor since the  late 1800s. Established in 1975 and managed by the state Department of Fish and  Game, the ecological preserve protects 752 acres of productive wetland habitat  in the upper bay.  </P> <P> Mass transit: No direct bus access.  </P></p>

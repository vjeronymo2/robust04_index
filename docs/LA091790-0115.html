			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> REAGAN HAILS RAPID GAINS BY SOVIETS  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan, who once dubbed the Soviet Union an "evil  empire," told a Soviet Parliament committee today that he was amazed at the  rapid changes in the country since he was last in Moscow for a summit meeting  with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in May, 1988.  </P> <P> "Nowadays, if Rip Van Winkle were to fall asleep in the Soviet Union, he would  only have time for a very short nap before finding that everything has  changed," Reagan told the Supreme Soviet's international affairs committee  after explaining the folk tale of the man who slept for 20 years and awoke to  find a different world.  </P> <P> "There have been so many changes in those two years and four months (since my  last visit) that I am beginning to understand how Rip Van Winkle must have  felt."  </P> <P> During Reagan's two terms in office, he oversaw a major U.S. military buildup  he said was necessary to counter the threat from the Soviet Union, which in  1983 he called an "evil empire." He then watched as Gorbachev's glasnost and  perestroika reforms led to the warmest Soviet-American relations in decades and  allowed the disintegration of the East Bloc.  </P> <P> After the meeting with the Supreme Soviet committee, Reagan had separate  private meetings with Gorbachev and Supreme Soviet Chairman Anatoly Lukyanov.  </P> <P> Gorbachev and Reagan greeted each other warmly, embracing and repeatedly  grasping each others forearms before reporters and photographers were ushered  out of the room.  </P> <P> "I'm sure you must have sensed by now during your stay here in this country  that we and people in Soviet society hold you in tremendous esteem and  respect," Gorbachev said.  </P> <P> In his address to the Soviet lawmakers, Reagan said he realizes reforms like  the move to a market economy being debated in the Supreme Soviet are causing an  uproar in the Soviet Union, and he advised patience during the transition  period.  </P> <P> Reagan praised the changes that have suddenly put the United States and the  Soviet Union on the same side in international issues, particularly the  international condemnation of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.  </P> <P> "I have said before that we did not mistrust each other because we were armed.  Rather we were armed because we mistrusted each other," Reagan said. "Well, our  mistrust has given way to what might be called cautious friendship."  </P></p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: Fokus pre-tax losses reduced FOKUS BANK, Norway's third biggest commercial bank, announced yesterday that 1992 pre-tax losses, before extraordinary items, had been sharply reduced to NKr426m (Dollars 60m) from NKr2.1bn in 1991. The substantial improvement was due to an increase in operating income, a reduction in operating costs and a significant cut in credit losses. Fokus said that, according to its strategic plan, it is set to return to profit within two years. It charged 1992 accounts with NKr480m for restructuring, against NKr40m in 1991, which took net losses for the year down to NKr907m, from NKr1.884bn in 1991. It said state cash transfers had enabled it to undertake the far-reaching restructuring. Fokus wrote down the value of its property portfolio by NKr168m to NKr2.6bn last year, against a write-off of NKr425m a year earlier to NKr3.3bn. Net interest income fell by NKr174m to NKr1.1bn as operating income increased to NKr571m from NKr543m. Fokus said that interest income was lower than had been earlier anticipated, due to unrest last year in foreign currency markets. Operating costs fell by NKr304m to NKr1.332bn last year. Group operating profit, before credit losses and write-offs, rose sharply last year to NKr323m from NKr165m in 1991.</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IMMIGRATION LAW CITED FOR EMPLOYERS' BIAS IN HIRING  </P> <P> A 4-year-old law designed to curb illegal immigration has led to hiring  discrimination based on national origins, the General Accounting Office  reported today.  </P> <P> As many as 10% of the 4.6 million employers considered under the GAO survey may  be practicing job bias based on national origins because of confusion over the  1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, the report said.  </P> <P> Discrimination related to the law "is serious but not pervasive," the  congressional investigative agency said in its 162-page report.  </P> <P> Employers discriminate "because the law's verification system does not provide  a simple or reliable method to verify job applicants' eligibility to work," the  report said.  </P> <P> Bias might be reduced, it said, if employers were given more information about  the law's requirements and a simpler and more reliable system.  </P> <P> The law requires employers to complete an eligibility form for each newly hired  worker and allows the employees to establish their eligibility by presenting  any one of 17 different documents, such as a U.S. passport or birth certificate  or an alien registration card.  </P> <P> The Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Labor Department may inspect  the forms. Employers who knowingly hire unauthorized workers are subject to  civil and criminal penalties.  </P> <P> The provisions were part of an overall bill designed to reduce the number of  illegal aliens flooding over the nation's southern border in search of jobs.  Concerns were raised in Congress during debate on the bill that employers would  discriminate against individuals who were "foreign-looking."  </P> <P> The GAO found that the law "has apparently reduced illegal immigration and is  not an unnecessary burden on employers."  </P> <P> "GAO also found that there was widespread discrimination," the report said.  "But was there discrimination as a result of (the law)? That is the key  question Congress directed GAO to answer. GAO's answer is yes."  </P></p>

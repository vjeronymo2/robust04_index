			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Bhutto defies Islamic protests Ms Benazir Bhutto, the Pakistani prime minister, left for Cairo yesterday to attend the UN population conference, defying intense lobbying by Moslem activists wanting her to stay at home. The Pakistani government said Ms Bhutto would play an important role in presenting Islamic countries' views: 'She will make a very strong statement in which she will reject proposals that are against Islam and will present the point of view of the Moslem countries.' For the past week, Pakistan's well organised Islamic activists have been worried that international efforts such as the UN conference would impose an 'un-Islamic' agenda around the world. Last week, legislators belonging to Islamic parties rose in protest during a session of parliament and demanded that the government boycott the conference. The protesters believe such issues as sex education, homosexuality, abortion on demand and pre-marital sex will gain global legitimacy through recognition in a final conference document. Some government officials were worried that Islamic groups - many of whom also oppose Ms Bhutto in the belief that a woman cannot lead an Islamic country - may try to use the issue to stir opposition against her government. Last week, a prominent religious scholar was quoted as saying that if Ms Bhutto went to Cairo, religious parties may support an anti-government campaign by opposition groups next week. The debate over Ms Bhutto's Cairo visit has drawn attention to one of the country's most controversial problems. Many officials believe the 3 per cent a year population growth has hampered economic growth. High population growth is also blamed for the government's poor performance in improving literacy, health and welfare.</p>

			<p>920605 FT  05 JUN 92 / Letter: Possibly a coincidence Sir, Could the present talk about a government bail out of Lloyd's Names have anything to do with the fact that bankrupts cannot serve as MPs? At least 30 Tory MPs are likely to become bankrupt and, as far as I recall, the government's majority is only 21. Gerald Mars, 53 Nassington Road, London NW3 2TY</p>

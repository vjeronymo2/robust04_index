			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg, June 9 (XINHUA)-- Greg Mills, director  of studies at the South African Institute of International  Affairs, said in an article published in `THE STAR' here today  that South Africa should sever ties with Taiwan and establish  diplomatic relations with China.    After the first democratic elections in South Africa, it is  not a matter of if, but when and how South Africa will sever  ties with its trading partner Taiwan and establish diplomatic  relations with China, Greg Mills said.    The article said South Africa's ties with Taiwan began in  1977 when Pretoria sought new allies and trading partners in the  wake of the Soweto uprisings and the United Nations arms embargo.    The article said: `In the throes of its own deepening  isolation, Taiwan, on the other hand, saw the opportunity as  providing a further anti-communist ally as well as an expansion  of trade.'    `South Africa's trade with China grew by 170 percent between  1992-93, and it is expected to double again this year. Also the  People's Republic of China is alleged to have been one of the  major gold buyers in recent times with about 25 percent of the  world's total (population),' the article added.    `Simply put, given the political and economic realities of  the situation, South Africa does not have any options.'    The article further stated dual recognition was a  non-starter.    `The need to make alternative arrangements with Taiwan  should  not delay a decision on the central political issue. Any  unnecessary delays or crude attempts to devise unique solutions  will only temporarily avoid the inevitable and anger Beijing,'  Greg Mills said.</p>

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Forte fails to sell catering division FORTE, the hotels and restaurants group, last night called off the proposed sale of its Gardner Merchant contract catering subsidiary after the potential buyers, Compass Group of the UK and ARA Services of the US, refused to pay the asking price of more than Pounds 550m. The proposed deal, which was first announced at the end of May, would have made Compass the biggest supplier of staff canteen meals in the UK. Compass was to have paid Pounds 450m for the Forte business, with the remainder coming from ARA. The companies reduced their offer, however, after questions arose as to whether Gardner Merchant clients might use the change of ownership to renegotiate their contracts. Mr Rocco Forte, Forte's chief executive, said the approach and the original price had come from the potential buyers. He said: 'It's rather irritating. People come along with a certain price and then drop that price.' He said he still wanted to sell Gardner Merchant and concentrate on the expansion of the group's hotel and restaurant businesses. But he said: 'It's a premium business and deserves a premium price'. There had been interest from other potential purchasers in the UK and elsewhere, he said. A sale to one of these would have the advantage of not splitting the business. The split between Compass and ARA had been designed to avoid UK monopoly problems. Mr Forte said the proposed breaking up of the business had caused some unhappiness among Gardner Merchant staff and management. Forte has suspended Mr Bob Cotton, Gardner Merchant's research director, for writing to a trade publication criticising the proposed sale. It is understood that in the course of negotiations Compass and ARA reduced their offer to Pounds 520m. Although UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, Forte's advisers, said that the hotels group could accept such a price without embarrassment, there were too many conditions attached to the offer. These are understood to have included a further renegotiation if Gardner Merchant contracts were lost. The two companies are then thought to have increased their offer to Pounds 530m but this too was rejected by Forte. Compass and ARA expressed disappointment and said the price they had offered had been fair. Lex, Page 24</p>

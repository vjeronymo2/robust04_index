			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / TV politicians vie with sumo and starlets: The sprouting of new parties has meant a bonanza for Japan's producers IN between reports of a cocaine smuggling scandal and the latest gossip on a starlet's divorce, Japanese television's Morning Eye now covers policy speeches by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the country's new prime minister. 'You can't leave out politics these days,' says Mr Katsuyuki Ishimori of Tokyo Broadcasting System, the network that airs the programme. Political coverage in Japan has traditionally been dominated by the daily newspapers, which kept important disclosures and information to themselves, to maintain cozy relationships with politicians. Instead, TV stories focused on squabbles between factions within the LDP. But the downfall of the LDP and the sprouting of new parties have created an extravaganza for TV producers and their viewers. 'Politics is easier to understand these days. In a way, it has become a show,' says Asahi Television, one of the nationwide networks. It is not just that television has discovered politicians, the politicians have discovered television. Members of the coalition government are putting it to full use in their efforts to present a different image from their predecessors in the Liberal Democratic Party, which held power for 38 years. In an unprecedented move, Mr Hosokawa gave his press conference with Mr John Major, UK prime minister, in the lush green garden of his residence in central Tokyo last month. Instead of sitting in front of a desk, the two premiers stood in front of podiums, while Mr Hosokawa pointed to reporters with his pen in the 'Bill Clinton' way. Television also played a leading part in politicking, following dissolution of the parliament in July. Camera crews eagerly followed the members of the new groups splintering from the LDP. Mr Susmu Yanase, of the New Harbinger Party, was nicknamed 'Crybaby Yanase' after he was filmed leaving the LDP headquarters in tears. Politicians of all camps aired their views and sometimes argued with each other, in public, a stark change from traditional political negotiations held behind the scenes in expensive Japanese tatami-mat restaurants or smoke-filled hotel rooms. But the excessive campaign coverage ahead of the lower-house elections in July has been blamed for low voter turnout on election day. 'People closely watching politics on television already felt they had participated,' one media analyst says. At the same time, the programmes decided the fate of some of the candidates. Ms Makiko Tanaka, the daughter of Mr Kakuei Tanaka, a former prime minister who fell from grace due to his involvement in a scandal in the 1970s, has been a fierce critic of the media. However, her recent election as an MP followed a campaign which was covered extensively on television, and she has since become an advocate of TV coverage of politics. Leading politicians have also begun to use television to float policies. Reporters now sit in front of their TV screens awaiting important comments, and it is quite common for provocative statements on political talk-shows to make the headlines in the daily newspapers. One of the more controversial television appearances was by Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, who recently expressed support for electoral reform plans during a talk show, which were opposed by the two leading coalition parties. His comments prompted strong criticism from within the coalition, forcing Mr Takemura to apologise to party leaders. The television networks are owned by leading national newspapers with a wide range of political views, from the vaguely leftist Asahi to the more conservative Yomiuri. But to appeal to a wide range of viewers, political bias, where it has appeared, has been limited to labelling the new reformist parties 'good' and the old LDP 'bad'. This, say some critics, is one of the dangers of political coverage by television. Mr Akira Aoki, professor of communications at the Tokyo University of Information Sciences, says that while television has made politics more digestible for the ordinary viewer, it has also tended to over-simplify issues. 'Things aren't that simple, but television isn't able to give in-depth explanation to its viewers.' he contends. Once the political scene becomes stable (and dull), it could lose its place in morning variety shows. However, with frictions within the coalition government starting to appear, and some younger members of the LDP threatening to quit the main party, politicians may go on holding their place in television along with the sumo wrestlers and the film stars.</p>

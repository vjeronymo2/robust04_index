			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By 'Ulayyan 'Ulayyan] </F>   [Excerpts] [passage omitted] NIDA' AL-WATAN has met with  the most two prominent leaders of the democratic Palestinian  current, comrade Dr. George Habash, secretary general of the  Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], and  comrade Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic  Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP]. They discussed  the Hebron massacre and its dimensions in light of the  [Israeli-PLO] Cairo agreement, analyzed the agreement, and  defined the tasks needed to confront the challenges of the  current phase.    While holding both the Zionist enemy leaders and the United  States directly responsible for the Hebron massacre, comrade Dr.  Habash did not exempt Oslo's Palestinian team from  responsibility. He said: We do not exempt 'Arafat and the  Palestinian Oslo-Cairo team from their clear responsibility for  the terrorism, killings, and repression being committed against  our people because they signed humiliating agreements in  Washington and Cairo. In essence, these agreements entrench and  protect both the occupation and the settlements and keep our  masses and territories subject to attacks by the occupation and  its settlers.    Dr. Habash linked the submissive agreements to the massacre,  and drew specific conclusions. He said: The Hebron mosque  massacre was the peak of the tragedy and a reply to the  defeatists. It also confirmed that there would be no  coexistence or security as long as both the occupation and its  settlements exist on our territory. The only solution is to end  the occupation, remove all settlements from our territory, and  implement the resolutions of international legitimacy. These  resolutions recognize our people's inalienable national rights;  namely, the rights to repatriation, self-determination, and an  independent state with holy Jerusalem as its capital. [passage  omitted]    Comrade Nayif Hawatimah discussed the most prominent  dimensions and implications of this massacre in light of the  Oslo agreement and in view of the insistence by the collapsing  bureaucratic leadership on continuing this humiliating course.  He said: This hideous massacre and the subsequent killings and  repression against our people have highlighted the vast distance  between 'Arafat and his team on the one hand and our people's  interests, rights, and daily concerns on the other. They have  also highlighted the vast distance between the bitter and hard  situation our people are experiencing under occupation and the  so-called Cairo agreement signed by 'Arafat and his team with  the Israeli side. The al-Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre and the  subsequent repression are simply the bitter and poisonous fruit  of both this agreement and the Oslo accord. A direct threat is  posed to our people by the daily attacks carried out by the  settlers and the occupation troops through a chain of bloody  massacres. The al-Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre will not be the  last link in this chain. [passage omitted]    Regarding the Cairo agreement and its dimensions and  implications, Dr. Habash said: A scrutiny of the Cairo  agreement and its details reveals the extent of the Oslo team's  collapse. The largest implication of this agreement is that it  exposed and foiled all the delusions and demagogy the collapsing  leadership tried to instill in our people's minds. This team  also suggested that the Oslo agreement addresses basic issues  and contains prospects for proceeding toward a Palestinian state  and laying the foundation stone for Palestinian national  sovereignty. Consequently, 'Arafat and his team have made many  statements stressing that this agreement is a phased one and  that we will ultimately obtain self-determination, a Palestinian  state, Jerusalem, the removal of settlements, the crossing  points, security, Jericho, and other issues.    Dr. Habash added: The Cairo agreement's value lies in the  fact that it verified the viewpoint rejecting the Oslo agreement  and it told the advocates of the Madrid approach that the final  phase would be determined in light of the final balance of  powers. The crossing points and the Jericho issue cannot be  relinquished. The recent agreement signed in Cairo was even  uglier and more humiliating than the Oslo agreement. [passage  omitted]    Comrade Nayif Hawatimah pointed out that the mosque massacre  highlighted the Palestinian national consensus on the fact that  the Cairo agreement signed by 'Arafat and Peres does not provide  the minimum of security and protection for our people under  occupation and that the Oslo-Cairo track has reached a deadlock.  It is a national imperative to halt negotiations until the  settlements are dismantled and the settlers are evacuated from  the occupied Palestinian territories, including Arab Jerusalem,  as well as to provide protection through UN troops, and to  reformulate the overall negotiations process based on the  resolutions of international legitimacy. These resolutions  provide for Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab  territories, including Jerusalem, and for the right to  self-determination, independence, and repatriation.    Comrade Hawatimah urged 'Arafat's leadership to resign in  order to allow our people to elect a reliable national  leadership that would be a symbol of national consensus. He  said: The past weeks have shown that the pro-'Arafat wing cares  more for the Oslo-Cairo agreement and for holding negotiations  according to the humiliating Madrid-Oslo terms than for our  people's interests and national rights.

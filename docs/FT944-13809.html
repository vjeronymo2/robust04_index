			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Business and the Environment: Mahogany controls loom One of Europe's biggest importers of hardwoods is backing a Dutch government initiative to control the trade in Brazilian mahogany under a United Nations convention. Timbmet, of Oxford, has surprised environmentalists by going against its trade association and supporting a proposal to declare officially that Brazilian mahogany is an endangered species. The UK is the second biggest consumer of the wood, importing about 35 per cent of Brazil's production. Forty per cent goes to the US. The Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) says the trees, which grow slowly, are on the verge of extinction. 'Brazilian mahogany will become a thing of the past if the trade continues extracting logs at present volumes in the way that it does,' says Francis Sullivan, forestry conservation officer at WWF UK. Daniel Kemp, chairman of Timbmet, says the proposed listing will not hamper trade. 'But we feel there will be more control and in the long term that will be good for business.' The Dutch government will propose the listing at next month's meeting of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) in Florida. Cites has a two-tier list of endangered species. Appendix I includes those which are virtually extinct and in which all trade is banned, such as ivory, some rare birds and Brazilian rosewood. Species listed on Appendix II can be traded but under restrictions. If the Dutch succeed and Brazilian mahogany joins this list, it would compel the Brazilian government to ensure that the trade does not harm the species. Importers would have to obtain export permits from Brazil. The UK Timber Trade Federation is against a listing. It says there is not enough scientific evidence to justify it and Brazil does not support the initiative. Timbmet remains a member of the federation.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: Kaufhof may lift payout after 33% profit increase KAUFHOF, the big German retail group whose activities range from department stores to catering and travel agencies, achieved a one-third rise in profits last year, helped by a sharp expansion of business in east Germany. Mr Jens Odewald, the chief executive, said that Kaufhof's performance in 1991 would justify a 'substantial dividend increase'. No actual profit figures are provided at this stage. In 1990, net profits rose by 12 per cent to DM120m (Dollars 72.7m), with the dividend raised by DM2 to DM10.50 on the ordinary shares and DM11.50 on preference stock. Turnover last year was 22 per cent higher at DM18bn, with the department stores showing growth of 18 per cent to DM6.8bn. Excluding the new east German premises, sales of the store division were 3 per cent higher. Kaufhalle, the group's stock market listed low-price store chain, achieved turnover growth of 15 per cent to DM2.7bn; excluding new outlets, the rise was 2 per cent. Rapid growth was shown by the specialist outlets in the areas of home electronics (Media Markt), computers (Vobis), mail order (Friedrich Wenz), and shoes (Reno). Because of the group's large-scale move into east Germany, its total labour force increased by 25 per cent to 58,200 people. Retail floor space was 15.5 per cent higher at 1.6m square metres. The group has 831 outlets, including 180 in east Germany and 73 in other countries in western Europe. Contrasting with the improved performance of the rest of the group, Oppermann Versand, a mail-order promotional gifts company, suffered a 9 per cent fall in sales to DM318m. This week, a Hamburg court ruled against Kaufhof in its claim for compensation based on alleged misrepresentation of Oppermann's accounts when it bought its majority stake from Mr Jurgen Oppermann late in 1989. Mr Odewald said Kaufhof would appeal against this ruling. The amount claimed in the Hamburg court was DM170m. Kaufhof began its legal action a year ago after the acquisition had fallen into the red.</p>

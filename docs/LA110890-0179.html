Rochelle Howe, a guild organizer, said an attorney for the Daily News, based in  Woodland Hills, told the union of the impending layoffs. Editorial employees,  who include reporters and photographers, elected the guild in April, 1989, to  represent them in contract negotiations with management, but the two sides have  yet to reach an agreement.  </P></p>

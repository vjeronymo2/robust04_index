More from our reporter  Frantisek Tvrz, who is in the affected area:    [Tvrz] At the moment, investigators and ecology inspectors  are investigating how many tonnes of the crude oil product  leaked from the fuel area of the Czech railways at Jablunkov  yesterday. According to this morning's statement by the  breakdown commission, the nonspecialist estimates suggest a  leakage of approximately six to seven tonnes.    The whole system of submersible walls was built immediately  below Jablunkov but also at the brook at Navsi and then lower  down, toward the confluence of the Olse border river to the Odra  River, via Trinec, Cesky Tesin up to Bohumin-Vernovice.

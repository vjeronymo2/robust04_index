Ambassador Trofimov handed over an answer  to the letter sent to Russian President Boris Yeltsin on January  5. Yeltsin discussed the problems the negotiations have failed  to solve so far and expressed his hope that a mutually  acceptable solution would be found.    The Estonian delegation is to leave for Moscow today for  another round of negotiations. Head of the delegation  Ambassador Vaino Reinart said that all four groups of issues --  military, border, humanitarian and economic -- will be  discussed. He hoped that the basic agreement on the troop  withdrawal may be initialled this time. But he admitted the  existence of disagreements on the compensation of the  environmental damage and the armament confiscated in 1940, as  well as the ownership of military establishments and the  jurisdiction of the Russian military units.    Head of the Russian delegation Vasili Svirin announced that  the Russian delegation will hand over the accurate troops  withdrawal timetable at the February 1-2 round of negotiations.  He added that the Estonian side is attempting to replace the  basic agreement with a brief protocol on the troops withdrawal.</p>

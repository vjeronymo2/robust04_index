			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in </F> Mexico by Me'ir Einstein -- live]    [Text] [Einstein] Good morning sir.    [Peres] Good morning.    [Einstein] Speaking at a news conference in Mexico, you said  Israel and Syria were getting closer to opening real  negotiations. Is there anything new we do not know about?    [Peres] I said that whoever wants to normalize relations  must normalize negotiations. I said that the way to begin  normalization is through normal negotiations between two  peoples. That is what I said.    [Einstein] Are there any signs that we may be approaching  such a normalization?    [Peres] In my visit in the United States I found an  atmosphere that still sees a chance to open negotiations, but I  did not discern any real signs or changes.    [Einstein] Sir, the question of Jerusalem is currently on  the agenda: The prime minister summoned special consultations  last night to discuss the PLO's demands; we have heard reports  that the draft Palestinian constitution Jerusalem is mentioned  as the capital of Palestine. Is Israel prepared to make any  concessions whatsoever on the question of Jerusalem?    [Peres] Not at all, certainly not in the political sphere.  We are prepared to meet all the needs of worshipers of all  faiths. Politically speaking, however, it is an absolute and  irrevocable fact that Jerusalem will remain Israel's united  capital under Israeli sovereignty. We will not Berlinize  Jerusalem, even if the PLO passes 1,000 resolutions.    [Einstein] But Israel has in fact agreed to discuss the  status of Jerusalem if the PLO brings it up at the negotiating  table, which it is expected to do.    [Pees] Discussions can be held on anything. What difference  does it make? It will not change our positions.    [Einstein] Is the PLO aware of our categorical position?    [Peres] Definitely yes, there is no doubt about it.    [Einstein] According to the current scenario, the question  of Jerusalem is expected to be the last item on the agenda in  the discussions on the permanent arrangement in the territories.    [Peres] We have yet quite a few years ahead of us, and there  is no need to press the issue.    [Einstein] Will our position then be as categorical as it is  today?    [Peres] It will remain unchanged, because there is no need  for any change. Jerusalem was never an Arab capital, while the  Jewish people never had any capital other than Jerusalem.    [Einstein] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, thank you very  much.    [Peres] You are welcome.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 27 May  adds:  "Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres hailed Britain's decision to  call off the arms embargo on Israel."]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Wang Sumei (3769 4790 2734): "Create a </F> Civilized, Beautiful, Orderly, and Efficient Overall  Environment"]    [Text] "We should adopt effective measures and mobilize  all forces in society to create a civilized, beautiful, orderly,  and efficient overall environment and to further promote the  opening up of the entire province in level, sphere, and  quality." This was set forth at the meeting on improving  investment environment held by the provincial government on 24  March.    As introduced, since the commencement of reform and opening  up, the province has made great progress in building investment  environment. The province has renovated and built Dalian and  Shenyang international airports, rebuilt Dandong, Jinzhou, and  Anshan airports, expanded Dalian port, and newly built Yingkou,  Dandong, and Jinzhou ports. Shenyang-Dalian Expressway has  closely combined the port city group with the central city  group, with Shenyang as the center. Over the past two years,  the province has again added a number of port berths and small  wharves, has developed the roll-on ship service, and has newly  opened the Shenyang-Irkutsk, Shenyang-Hong Kong, and  Dalian-Tokyo air routes, with the total number of air routes  reaching 68, and with the number of cities linked by these air  routes reaching 33. The province has also newly added 400,000  lines of telephone switchboards, with the total installed  capacity reaching 1 million lines. Most cities and counties in  the province have been furnished with international direct  dialing facilities.    A total of 21 development zones of various kinds have been  approved in the province, with a total planned acreage of 407  square kilometers. A total of 1,486 foreign-funded enterprises  have entered these development zones, and $5.27 billion in  foreign capital has been utilized. Last year, breakthroughs  were made in bonded areas, foreign-invested banks, and  large-scale land development.    It is revealed that compared to tangible investment  environment, the intangible investment environment has dropped  in quality over the past several years, thus provoking much  complaints among foreign traders. For instance, some of our  departments have handled the contradictions emerging in reform  only from the angle of their own departments instead of  considering the overall situation of reform, thus giving rise to  the phenomenon that too many checkpoints are set, too many  interferences are imposed, one project is approved by many  places, and a contract is transferred among many departments.    Lagging behind in management and service, tangible  environment has been unable to exploit its due role. Some  hotels and inns experiencing power and water failure have not  adopted remedy measures, thus making foreign traders unable to  have a bath at night and wash their face in the morning.    Although furnished with good installations, some of our  airports lack emergency measures and are poor at meeting  emergency under special cases. At the same time, our custom  situation and our board and lodging situation are unable to  satisfy foreign traders, and our urban public hygiene  environment has become worse and worse.    To further improve investment environment, the provincial  government has defined six construction targets, namely,  "efficient working functions, scientific management norm,  quality service, beautiful urban environment, fine social order,  and excellent moral practice." In addition, corresponding  measures have been adopted for this work in a bid to achieve  results within this year and to embark on a new stage in three  years.</p>

			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Business and the Environment: Life beyond the Earth Summit At next month's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, the world community has an historic opportunity to move forward in a spirit of global partnership to meet the challenges that will define our common future. Sadly, the agreements to be signed at this historic meeting are hollow shells of the original proposals, with little assurance that there will be any real change in policy or practice, and meagre hope that the environmental crises they are intended to confront will be slowed. Regrettably, it was the intransigence of the US negotiators that weakened the accords. For example, the climate change convention was to unite the world in efforts to stabilise emissions of carbon dioxide, the principal cause of global warming, at 1990 levels by the year 2000. Instead, principally because of President Bush's opposition to these targets and timetables, the treaty to be signed contains only vague language and no specific goals. This means that world leaders gathering in Rio must, even now, begin looking beyond the Earth Summit, to build a new global consensus that will create stronger agreements and real progress. We need to create a mechanism to ensure that the parties to the climate convention will meet regularly to strengthen their commitments in the light of scientific developments. We also need to support calls for increased energy efficiency and for increased reliance on renewable energy sources. We must establish a strong and effective mechanism to carry forward the agreements reached at the Earth Summit. I have suggested establishing a Stewardship Council to deal with matters relating to the global environment, just as the Security Council now deals with matters of war and peace. Or we could establish a tradition of annual environmental summit meetings. Heads of nations must commit themselves to improving overseas development practices to ensure that the projects are sustainable. One of the best ways of doing this is to increase the transparency of lending practices so that local communities and non-governmental groups have the opportunity to comment on proposals. Working voluntarily, we must use every treaty and alliance, every tactic and strategy, every plan and course of action to halt the destruction of the environment and to preserve and nurture our ecological system. What is needed is a plan - call it a Global Marshall Plan for the environment - that combines large-scale, long-term, carefully targeted financial aid to developing nations. Some strategic goals are obvious. For example, world population should be stabilised, with policies designed to create the conditions necessary for the so-called demographic transition - the historical change from a dynamic equilibrium of high birth rates and death rates to a stable equilibrium of low birth rates and death rates. This change has taken place in most of the industrial nations and in few of the developing nations. We also need to develop environmentally appropriate technologies - especially in energy, transportation, agriculture, construction and manufacturing. We must rethink the economic 'rules of the road' by which we measure the impact of our decisions on the environment. We need to establish a system of economic accounting that assigns appropriate values to the ecological consequences of routine choices made by individuals and companies, and macroeconomic choices by nations. Governments need a new generation of agreements that will embody the regulatory frameworks, enforcement mechanisms, incentives, and mutual obligations necessary to make the overall plan a success. These agreements must be sensitive to the vast differences of capability and need between developed and developing nations. Finally, what is needed is an ecological perspective that does not treat the Earth as something separate from human civilisation. Looking at the whole means looking at ourselves. If we do not see that we are a powerful natural force like the winds and tides, we cannot see how we threaten to push the Earth out of balance. The author is a US senator.

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Redundancy fear survives upturn ALMOST HALF the people in work remain concerned about the prospect of being made redundant or becoming unemployed during the next 12 months in spite of signs of an economic revival. This is the key finding in the latest monthly survey on redundancy commissioned for the Financial Times and Industrial Relations Services and conducted by MORI, the polling organisation. The findings suggest there remains widespread and continuing scepticism among the workforce about the strength of the economic upturn. This month 47 per cent of the sample said they were very or fairly concerned at losing their job. This figure has dropped from 51 per cent in July but is the second highest level of concern shown among people at work in the survey since it began in April. By contrast 49 per cent said they were not at all or not very concerned about losing their job and joining the unemployed, compared with 45 per cent in July. Over the past five months some distinctive trends can be seen. The proportion of workers under 24 who are concerned about redundancy and unemployment has risen from 40 per cent in April to 50 per cent last month. A sharp rise is also apparent among people at work from social classifications A and B. This has climbed from 28 per cent five months ago to 37 per cent in August. The proportion of unskilled and semi-skilled manual workers concerned about redundancy and unemployment has also gone up from 44 to 53 per cent over the same period. Scotland and northern England have suffered a sizeable growth in concern from 38 per cent to 48 per cent between April and August as has the Midlands  -up from 40 per cent to 48 per cent. Concern in southern England has remained stable. MORI interviewed 1,007 adults aged 18 and over.</p>

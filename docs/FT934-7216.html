			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Tiphook Hard though it is to credit, Tiphook appears to have achieved something positive. News of the proposed sale of its container division to Transamerica Corporation for Pounds 830m left market watchers boggle-eyed when it flashed up on trading screens. Transamerica seems willing to pay an astonishing premium to control strategic assets. Even if the sale is completed, however, Tiphook will remain miserably placed with a loss-making trailer business and some Pounds 400m of debt. The sale's premium to book value will be whittled away by trading losses leaving shareholders' funds of perhaps Pounds 200m by the year-end. By Tiphook's standards, the resultant 200 per cent gearing would appear almost normal. The company would have a fighting chance of evading a wholesale financial restructuring although it would need to squeeze cash with a rare ferocity. The chief worry would be Tiphook's remaining capital expenditure commitments, although it may be possible to reschedule payments. The lingering recession in mainland Europe, where Tiphook is heavily exposed, could also frustrate its hopes. Tiphook's secured creditors will be mightily relieved if the sale is secured. Equity holders, though, will want to comb the accompanying circular before deciding what to do. Theoretically, Tiphook could yet emerge as an attractively-geared recovery stock. Yet given bitter experience, retaining the shares would be a bold bet.</p>

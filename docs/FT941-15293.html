			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Markets: Everything in the garden is perfect, but . . . - Wall Street This may not necessarily be a good thing, but some Wall Street sages have been pointing out lately that conditions in the US stock market are currently as near to perfect as is possible. The economy is growing at a solid pace. Inflation, primarily because of the moderate rate of economic growth, is unthreatening. Interest rates, although edging higher, are still near historic lows. Company earnings continue to improve, thanks in part to vigorous cost containment measures and efficiency gains, and Corporate America's balance sheet is as healthy as it has been for a long time. Even the dollar is perking up, which may not be good for US exporters trying to sell their goods abroad, but it does at least attract capital to US financial markets. Moreover, the poor recent performance of some of last year's hottest foreign stock markets - notably Mexico and Hong Kong - is also working in the US market's favour, as it may cool investors' ardour for overseas equities and persuade them to keep more of their money at home. Also, there are few signs that the individual investor is losing interest in the stock market. Investment managers report that money continues to flood into mutual funds, money that the institutions have been quickly putting to use by investing in equities, particularly the stocks of companies whose earnings are closely tied to the economic cycle. The cash inflows from funds, coupled with the mood of optimism about the economy and corporate earnings, has been behind the stock market's impressive performance in the first two weeks of 1994. Apart from a few days of profit-taking, share prices have been appreciating steadily since the New Year. In the first six days of January alone the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 100 points, or almost 3 per cent, as the Dow broke through 3,800 for the first time. Several days of modest selling earlier this week did little to damp the market's fire, and yesterday the buying resumed. By late morning the Dow was up another 25 points, all but erasing the previous three day's losses. More and more analysts are now talking of the Dow reaching 4,000 within a few months, and some are even suggesting it will make 4,500 before the year is out. Yet, the skies above the stock market are not entirely cloud-free. The Dow may have started the year in grand style, but other indices have lagged behind. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500, the Nasdaq composite and the Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks have performed only half as well as the Dow. This suggests that investors' confidence in the market is not particularly broad-based. Then there is the matter of equity valuations. Stocks on the S&amp;P 500 are currently trading at about 23-times past earnings, and paying out a dividend yield of 2.6 per cent. Those figures are both well off historic averages, which are about 14-times earnings and a 4.4 per cent dividend yield. The bears in the market say it is only a matter of time before valuations start coming back toward historic averages, and that is more likely to happen as a result of a sharp decline in share prices, rather than a dramatic improvement in earnings performance. Finally, the threat of inflation still hovers in the distance. While the current inflation rate is low - figures released this week showed that consumer prices rose last year by 2.7 per cent, the best inflation performance since 1986 - investors in fixed-income assets such as government securities remain concerned that the steadily accelerating pace of economic growth will eventually feed through into higher prices, and start eroding the value of their investments. That concern pushed bond yields higher in the latter half of this week. After falling to as low as 6.18 per cent on Wednesday, the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond had moved back up to 6.3 per cent by midday yesterday, spooked by an unexpectedly strong December retail sales report. What is more, the stock market's own inflation warning bell - the Dow Jones Utilities Average - has been ringing recently. The average of 15 utilities stocks has fallen 3.7 per cent since the start of the year. Utility stocks are uniquely sensitive to inflationary trends, because when inflation rises, utility companies' earnings suffer because their ability to put up their rates to counter the impact of inflation is restricted by the government. This is not to suggest that a big correction in share prices is imminent, only to note that conditions in the stock market are rarely, if ever, perfect.  ------------------------------------------------- Monday         3865.51     +      44.74 Tuesday        3850.31     -      15.20 Wednesday      3848.63     -      01.68 Thursday       3842.43     -      06.20 Friday         3867.20     +      24.77  -------------------------------------------------</p>

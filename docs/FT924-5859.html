			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Finnair losses deepen to FM197m at six months FINNAIR, the Finnish state airline, said its loss after financial items deepened to FM197m (Dollars 38.54m) in the six months to September 30 from FM31.2m a year earlier. The airline blamed weak domestic demand and adverse exchange rate movements, following last year's markka devaluation, for the deterioration. Turnover rose 2.1 per cent to FM2.82bn, but costs climbed 5 per cent to FM2.64bn despite a cost-cutting drive, which has resulted in 524 job losses in the past year and 1,014 job losses in two years. Finnair was gloomy about the immediate outlook because of the continuing recession in the domestic economy. It also pointed to further exchange rate uncertainty after Finland's decision in September to float the markka, saying this had increased its costs more than its income.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Management: Dissent in the measurement ranks Peter Drucker believes the next big wave in management, after process re-engineering, will be measurement. For once the great prophet seems to be behind the times. Evidence that the boom has already arrived is everywhere: in the fashion for 'benchmarking' and other total-quality measures that have been growing for almost a decade; in the more recent take-off of activity-based costing (ABC); in the search for balanced score cards of physical as well as financial measures; and in the growing popularity of performance measurement - the translation of business objectives into detailed measures of departments, teams and individuals. The twin reasons for all this activity are self-evident. First, organisations of all kinds are under enormous pressure to improve performance and that of their constituent parts: businesses, processes, departments, teams and individuals. Second, the falling cost of information technology allows a range of measurements to be made relatively cheaply. This all creates a rich hunting ground for accountants and other consultants. But is it altogether healthy for their client organisations? What should organisations measure? How often, and in how much detail? Is Harvard's Robert Kaplan, the great evangelist for ABC and balanced score cards, right that 'what you measure is what you get'? Both sides of the argument have been put persuasively in the past few weeks. Peter Chadwick, a continuous improvement consultancy operating in Britain, France and Germany, published a study of 300 companies in those countries which concluded that 75 per cent have management systems that do not monitor and control productivity accurately. Only six out of 10 companies set performance targets for all or most of their departments, with a much lower rate (40 per cent) in France than in Britain and Germany (75 per cent). While 80 per cent of companies claimed to monitor customer satisfaction, barely 20 per cent made this information available below middle management. Moreover, the quality performance measures used by most respondents focused too late in the cycle: on customer complaints and returns, rather than on measures within the workplace, such as 'first-time yield' and product or service lead times. These would avoid such problems arising in the first place. The consultancy also complained that only 20 per cent of companies measured performance using 'short-interval (hourly) controls, which in many cases provide the frequency required to measure performance targets effectively'. The consultancy concluded that: 'If it matters, measure it.' A similar line of argument was expressed last month by one of Britain's most experienced senior personnel managers, Mike Haffenden, who has just left Hewlett-Packard. Speaking at a conference on change management, Haffenden said organisations should measure regularly the performance of all their key processes, from on-time delivery to change management itself. His only evident scepticism towards measurement - what HP and other American companies call 'metrics' - was in the appraisal of individuals' performance, where he claimed never to have seen a job evaluation or performance appraisal scheme that was really worth the effort. A much stronger dissenting voice was heard at the same conference from a surprising quarter: David Pascall, head of British Petroleum's 'culture change' review team in 1989-90 and until a year ago chairman of the National Curriculum Council, the predecessor body for the authority that is now responsible for testing schoolchildren in England and Wales. He is now finance director of part of MAI, a financial, media and information conglomerate. Organisations should be wary of joining the 'if it moves, measure it' bandwagon, Pascall warned. If, during a change process, people feel their behaviour is being measured at every opportunity, he said, 'they'll feel inhibited. You shouldn't evaluate every aspect of every team's performance in every process'. Instead, he advised organisations to follow BP's lead in removing all sorts of checks and balances, and then 'seeing if people deliver'. As chairman of the NCC, Pascall complained that the UK government, in its enthusiasm for schoolroom measures of all kinds, had made them too complicated. It was unnecessary to test every child in every subject in the same way at the same stage, he argued. His advocacy has helped simplify the methods, frequency and intensity with which schoolchildren will be tested from now on. A similar drive is needed in the business world if it is to avoid drowning in a sea of quantitative and qualitative measurements. This point was made eloquently last week by, of all people, a partner from a big accounting firm. Speaking at a Royal Society of Arts conference on 'Tomorrow's Company' - a campaign which advocates, among other things, the introduction of much broader business measures - Peter Ward of Coopers &amp; Lybrand warned against making the already complex subject of corporate measurement even more complicated by 'seeking spurious accuracy through too many measures'. What is needed, he suggested, is a much broader but more flexible range of indicators to measure the corporate equivalent of body temperature and blood pressure. Ward did not confront the thorny question of whether and how to amend the old accountancy maxim that all relevant measures should be compressed on to a single sheet of A4 paper. As in schools, every effort must be made to avoid measuring the performance of every limb and artery so often that the body hardly has the time or motivation to function.</p>

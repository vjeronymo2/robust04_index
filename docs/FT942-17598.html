			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: Taking a walk on the wild side - Pearson's purchase of The Software Toolworks Pearson's agreed offer of Dollars 462m (Pounds 310m) for The Software Toolworks, the interactive software publisher, looks a little like one of the California's company's most recent hit products - MegaRace. The CD game, which sold 100,000 copies in its first week, is described as 'a wild, on the edge, virtual driving experience through the landscape of a future Megalopolis'. The planned drive into the new world of multimedia by a company, which was starting to acquire a reputation for caution and being bridesmaid rather than the bride, will be seen by some as a little bit on the wild side. The price for Software Toolworks, which specialises in the production of 'entertainment, edutainment and infotainment' for personal computers and video game machines such as Nintendo and Sega, is no less than 120 times the company's pre-tax profits for the year to March 1993, although the multiple is something like 57 for the present year. 'Whenever you back an emerging market you are taking a risk,' said Mr Frank Barlow, managing director of Pearson, which has interests including the Financial Times, Penguin Books, Thames Television and a stake in Sky Television, the satellite venture. To counter suggestions that the price was high Mr Barlow added that conventional wisdom used to suggest that the price for Sky had been high. Pearson, which has taken a strategic decision to concentrate on information, education and entertainment, also announced formally that it was setting up a new division, Pearson New Entertainment Europe. It will be led by Mr Nick Alexander, who is joining Pearson from Sega Europe. Mr Barlow described New Entertainment Europe, which will be run separately from Software Toolworks, as 'taking an each way bet'. Lord Blakenham, chairman and chief executive of Pearson emphasised that the price was in line with other relevant transactions around the world. Earlier this year, for example, Electronic Arts, one of the largest computer game companies, bought Broderbund, another software company for Dollars 400m, although Broderbund then had profits of Dollars 20m a year. In the nine months to December 1993 Software Toolworks had pre-tax profits of Dollars 6m on sales of Dollars 107m. Pearson intends to launch a tender offer for all the 29.5m outstanding shares in Software Toolworks, a company quoted on Nasdaq. The offer will remain open for 20 business days and the deal is dependent on more than 50 per cent of the shares being tendered. The California company which has been through difficult lossmaking times is now expanding under new management and last year produced 105 titles with plans to produce another 155 this year. It has the rights to use the Nintendo Mario Brothers characters for educational purposes and the Star Wars characters as well as developing its own brands, which include Chessmaster and typing and piano teaching systems on CD-Rom. Its future profits growth is linked with the consumer market for CD-Roms where the cost of production is much lower than for video games cartridges. Sales of CD-Rom software in the US reached an estimated Dollars 2.6bn in 1992 up from Dollars 304m in 1988. To a considerable extent Pearson and Software Toolworks chose each other. While Pearson looked at a large number of possible acquisitions, the software company had talks with 20 possible partners. Mr Bob Lloyd, chief executive of Software Toolworks, said the company was impressed with Pearson's track record of working well with creative groups in the media business. Or, as Mr Barlow put it on Thursday with a smile, 'dealing with difficult people'. There are a lot of earrings and long hair at Software Toolworks, the Pearson managing director noted with satisfaction. However, in comparison to annual staff turnover rates of 50 per cent in some parts of the software industry Software Toolworks had a 5 per cent turnover rate over three years. The City decided the deal would be dilutive in the short term and marked Pearson shares down 26p to 641p on Thursday. If the deal is finalised it will be the largest so far of its type and one of the most significant moves so far by a conventional European publisher into multimedia. As the blurb of MegaRace says: 'Winning is all that counts'. It is too early to know how big the prize will be even for 'winners' in the wild multimedia race.</p>

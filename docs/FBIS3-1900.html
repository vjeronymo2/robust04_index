Fukuoka Prefecture Governor Hachiji Okuda gave a welcome  speech at the banquet. He said: Fukuoka is an important port  in the 2,000-year history of exchanges between Japan and China.  It has established friendly relations with China's Jiangsu  Province. In addition, four cities in the prefecture have  established friendship ties with Chinese cities. The Fukuoka  people are ready to take further steps to help develop  friendship and cooperation between Japan and China.    In his speech, Zhu Rongji praised Fukuoka Prefecture for its  relentless efforts to develop Sino-Japanese friendship not only  in the past but also at the present. Zhu Rongji said:  Sino-Japanese economic and trade relations have developed  rapidly in recent years. However, Fukuoka still has great  potential for developing economic relations with China. I hope  the two sides will work hard to continue to expand cooperation  between Fukuoka and China.    Before concluding their visit to Osaka, Zhu Rongji and his  party also visited Okayama Prefecture, where they visited the  Seto Ohashi Bridge. Zhu Rongji praised the ocean bridge for its  magnificent construction and attractive layout. He also  inquired about the economic benefits obtained from the bridge's  construction.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "What Is the Benefit of Loyally Observing the </F> Embargo?"]    [Text] It would be a good idea for the Bulgarian  politicians to explain to the people why they are so religiously  observing the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] embargo and  without giving it too much thought refuse to join even the four  European states that will ask the United Nations to lift the  sanctions.    We are playing a bad trick with our indecisiveness.    First, our neighbors the Serbs will always remember that we  were against them to the very end. Greece, Romania, Hungary,  and Ukraine will insist on lifting the embargo and will not be  thrilled by the fact that we did not support them.    Second, would the United Nations believe our cries regarding  the billions of dollars we are losing from the embargo? It is  logical for a state whose economy is being destroyed by the  sanctions to fight by all means for lifting them.    It appears that we can simultaneously be on bad terms with  our neighbors and not be compensated for our losses.    So, what is the benefit of our twisted internationalism?</p>

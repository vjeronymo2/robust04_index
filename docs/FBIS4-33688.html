			<p>BFN     [Text] The administrative council in Havana Province has  announced that the water supply has been stabilized in the  municipalities and that 96 percent of the population is  receiving this service. Havana Province, second only to Havana  City Province, has a network of 470 aqueducts.    The largest water supply problem is in Madruga Municipality  and conditions are slated to improve in Santa Cruz del Norte  Municipality. Despite increased efforts over the last year, and  the help which the agriculture sector has provided to the  schools, the main problems are found in boarding schools, where  54 pumps are in bad shape, with 29 of them no longer functioning  at all. In order to alleviate this problem, Havana's school  board established a program keyed towards installing water  systems in those schools.</p>

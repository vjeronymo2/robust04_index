			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Mexican financier released The kidnapped Mexican financier Mr Alfredo Harp Helu was released on Tuesday night, after his family had agreed to pay a ransom which his abductors said was less than Dollars 30m. Mr Harp, president of Banamex-Acival, Mexico's largest financial institution, and one of the country's wealthiest men, was kidnapped on March 14 near his house in the south of Mexico City. His abduction sent Mexico's stock market tumbling. He is pictured right, in an AP photo, during his captivity and holding a copy of a Mexican newspaper, dated June 19. Several hundred rich Mexican businessmen have been kidnapped in recent years, mostly in the provinces, but none was as prominent as Mr Harp. In April, Mr Angel Losada, a wealthy retailer whose family controls Grupo Gigante, was kidnapped in Mexico City, and it is believed that he is still being held captive. The families of kidnap victims generally do not co-operate with the police, whom many suspect of being involved with the kidnapping gangs. In an effort to combat organised crime, the Mexican government set up a new national security agency in April, the day after Mr Losada was seized.</p>

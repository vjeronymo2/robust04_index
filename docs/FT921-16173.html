			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Letter: Institutional shareholder takes issue with Fisons' investor relations Sir, Fisons' recent revelations about its difficulties in complying with the new US Food and Drug Administration manufacturing requirements seems to demonstrate once again the board's failure to manage effectively both its business and its investor relations. The City's reaction to the bombshells has been clearly reflected in the dramatic fall in share price. As an institutional shareholder in Fisons, my concern at the mishandling of the group's corporate relations is not just confined to the failures of the last few weeks. For some considerable time I have been anxious over Fison's attitude towards peat extraction from sites of scientific interest and have been involved in lengthy and protracted correspondence with the company over the issue. Despite leading retailers such as Do-It-All, Texas Homecare, B &amp; Q, and Sainsbury's Homebase agreeing not to sell products dug from environmentally sensitive sites, the company's director of corporate affairs stated that relations between Fisons and its big customers were an operational matter and not a matter for comment to shareholders. Earlier in the year, you will recall, Fisons had been represented on the Confederation of British Industry working party looking at communications with small shareholders. Presumably, the board of Fisons considers that its appalling track record over Opticrom and Imferon and the FDA is an operational matter as well and, therefore, not of importance to shareholders either. One leading stockbroker said recently that the company is clearly like a patient on a stretcher at the moment. I prefer to think of it as a board whose members are sinking slowly up to their necks in a deep peat bog. Whether they can dig themselves out of the mire in time for the annual general meeting is another matter and one that I would urge every single shareholder in Fisons to give very serious thought to.

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Bond funds The table below shows unit trusts investing in predominantly UK fixed-interest securities. Such funds can choose from a fairly wide range of securities, including government securities (gilts), corporate bonds, convertibles and preference shares. Gilts have performed extremely well recently as interest rates have dropped  -yet Abtrust Fixed Interest, the best-performing fund in the table, holds none. Its portfolio is mainly convertible stocks (about two-thirds), with the rest in preference shares and higher-yielding Eurobonds. Paul Reed, manager of the fund, says: 'We went for convertible stocks where we could get an equity kicker for virtually nothing. The stocks would yield more than gilts and there would be an equity option in there, too.' Convertibles are corporate bonds combined with an option to be switched into equities under certain circumstances. When equity markets are doing well, this can add considerably to the performance of convertibles. But as soon as Reed starts to worry about prospects for the equity market, he will reduce his holding of them. The higher yields available from corporate bonds make them attractive to fund managers despite their being regarded as more risky than gilts, the reasoning being that a company is more likely to go bust than the government. 'If I can get a spread of 1.5 to 2 per cent over gilts in something else, and I like the credit, I will hold that rather than gilts,' says Reed. The BG Bond fund, second in the table, is about 61 per cent invested in gilts, with the rest in corporate bonds. When it was launched in April 1992, the fund held some overseas bonds, but those holdings have been sold and it is now invested wholly in the UK. Mark Campbell, of Baillie Gifford, which manages BG Bond, says: 'It is by no means a straight gilt fund. It will always tend to have a weighting in gilts, but we are quite happy to use other corporate and local authority bonds to give it that slight edge.' After such a good year for gilts, are they due for a fall? 'Returns will be more modest in 1994 but there is scope for further gains,' predicts Campbell. Abtrust charges 5.25 per cent initially and 1 per cent annually, with a minimum investment of Pounds 500. BG Bond charges 5 per cent initially, 0.4 per cent annually, and is aimed at larger investors with a minimum of Pounds 5,000.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    10 HIGHEST PERFORMING UK BOND FUNDS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fund                                Size (Pounds m)   Yield (%)   Perf*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Abtrust Fixed Interest                   16.2           6.98      37.14 BG Bond                                  23.78          5.66      25.51 Exeter Balanced                           7.25          4.4       24.8 Framlington Gilt                         15.31          5.3       24.53 M&amp;G Gilt Income                          59.77          6.24      24.12 Edinburgh Pref Share                     20.20          5.56      23.02 Whittingdale Gilt Growth                 10.79          0.0       21.23 Guinness Flight Premium F Int            12.4           7.53      20.89 Legal &amp; Genl Fixed Int                    1.4           5.83      19.66 Hill Samuel Gilt &amp; F.

			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A., BURBANK JOIN SUIT OVER AERIAL SPRAYING;  </P> <P> MEDFLY: COUNCIL INSTRUCTS CITY ATTORNEY TO TRY TO STOP THE MALATHION PROGRAM.  SIMILAR LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN REJECTED BY THE COURTS.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council joined the battle against malathion spraying  Tuesday, instructing the city attorney to file a lawsuit intended to stop the  state's aerial eradication campaign against the Mediterranean fruit fly.  </P> <P> City Council members said that, despite assurances from state officials of  malathion's safety, they believe that far too many questions remain about the  pesticide's health effects.  </P> <P> "When the health of the public is at stake, government has the responsibility  to prove it's safe, not for the public to prove that it is unsafe," said  Councilman Joel Wachs. "The state has clearly failed to meet that burden of  proof."  </P> <P> The council vote was unanimous. Deputy City Atty. Keith Pritsker said the city  expects to file its suit in Los Angeles Superior Court on Thursday.  </P> <P> The Burbank City Council voted unanimously Tuesday night to join the suit. The  vote came after Acting City Atty. Juli Scott told the council that Glendale  officials had passed a similiar resolution.  </P> <P> "I'm glad to see we're joining hands with the city of Los Angeles," said  Burbank Councilman Michael Hastings. "It's the only direction we can go."  </P> <P> In another development Tuesday, the Pasadena Board of Directors took the novel  approach of voting to ban flights of low-flying helicopters over the city in an  effort to stop spraying. But state officials said the measure would have no  effect on the state's emergency Medfly program.  </P> <P> The cities of Huntington Beach, Garden Grove, Westminster and Pomona already  have filed suits aimed at stopping the applications of a sticky bait laced with  malathion, which is now being sprayed over more than 380 square miles of  Southern California. Efforts by these cities to obtain temporary injunctions  against the spraying have been denied by Superior Court judges.  </P> <P> The Legal Aid Society of Orange County filed suit last week in federal court,  claiming that the spraying was dangerous to the homeless. The society lost its  initial bid in court, but it is scheduled to argue its case again on Feb. 27.  </P> <P> Charles Getz, the deputy state attorney general who has handled the previous  suits against the state, said he believes that Los Angeles' attempt to block  the spraying will fare no better than the others.  </P> <P> "I never take these things lightly," he said, "but I am confident the project  is legally defensible. Two courts have already said it is."  </P> <P> Getz said he believes that the state has more than proved that aerial spraying  is safe for the public and is the only practical method to protect California's  multibillion-dollar fruit industry.  </P> <P> But Wachs, whose Arts, Health and Humanities Committee has sponsored public  hearings on the issue, said state officials have failed to prove their case.  </P> <P> The medical studies presented by the state have been "outdated, incomplete and  in several key issues, refuted," Wachs said.  </P> <P> "When you're dealing with the health of the people, you've got to be sure," he  said.  </P> <P> Wachs said he was particularly disturbed by the state's failure to pursue  alternative means of controlling the Medfly, such as the use of sterile flies  to breed the pest out of existence.  </P> <P> Early in the infestation, the state in fact did attempt to contain it with the  release of sterile flies, but as the outbreak spread the supply dwindled. Two  new breeding facilities in Hawaii are expected to be providing a large supply  of sterile flies by late spring.  </P> <P> Councilman Michael Woo attacked what he called the "arrogance" of state  officials who have stuck with the spraying campaign despite public complaints.  </P> <P> "This is a blatant example of the urban population being held hostage to the  agricultural interests of the state," Woo said.  </P> <P> Pritsker said the Los Angeles suit will focus on the state's failure to fulfill  certain legal requirements needed to begin an emergency eradication program.  </P> <P> He said that under state law, the state must prove that all methods of  eradication other than pesticide have been used to the maximum, that the  agriculture industry faces significant economic damage and that the public has  been properly notified of each spraying.  </P> <P> Getz said the state has violated no laws in its eradication program and has  done everything possible to protect both the public and the agriculture  industry.  </P> <P> Pritsker said the Los Angeles suit is broader than actions filed by other  cities and, unlike the other suits, will not seek an immediate halt to  spraying. Instead, the city's strategy will be to allow the court to make a  more complete examination of the evidence before ruling. He said he expects  that the case will be heard by the end of March.  </P> <P> In a related action, the Long Beach City Council also voted Tuesday to sue the  state if there is any expansion of the current spray zone in north and  northeastern Long Beach.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Bettina Boxall and Vicki Torres contributed to this story.  </P> <P> MALATHION FEARS  </P> <P> State officials attempt to allay malathion fears.

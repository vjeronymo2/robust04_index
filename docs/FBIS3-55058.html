			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Professor Vladimir Ivanovich Tarasov, deputy </F> director of the Institute of Economy at the Belarusian Academy  of Sciences, by Tamara Markina; place and date not given: "We  Should Introduce Our Own Currency To Be Able To Conquer the  Market's Everest"]    [Text] Market relations in Belarus are the cause of our  despair. Is this what we fought for? Why are our neighbors  reaping the fruits of market reforms while we are making no  headway? Moreover, we are sliding ever closer to economic  carnage. Why is Belarus -- whose standard of living was one of  the highest in the USSR -- lagging behind our Baltic neighbors  and Russia? Production is falling, hopes are expiring....    Professor Vladimir Ivanovich Tarasov, deputy director of the  Institute of Economy at the Belarusian Academy of Sciences, is  one of those few people who can see a real way out of this  predicament.    Today, Vladimir Ivanovich Tarasov visited our editorial  office. I hope that our interview with him will help some people  to differentiate between the "black" and "white" sides of our  economy. Some years ago, many residents of Minsk started making  "shopping-tours" of Poland and Turkey. Currently, most of them  have accumulated the initial capital. The second wave of  "shopping- tours" rolled into the Baltics, Moscow, Smolensk, St.  Petersburg.... They have literally stripped the Belarusian  foodstuffs market. Some of my acquaintances state that Belarus  has raised market reforms in Baltic states and Russia with its  dairy products... What is your opinion on the issue?    [Tarasov] I would support such commercial junkets if our  economy was healthy and sound. Why not? Exports which  stimulate production are growing.... Our Belarusian "merchants"  make profits of around 500,000 rubles [R] on every commercial  trip.    Nevertheless, given our deficit economy and falling  production, these exports will not bring us any good. I would  like our merchants to bring back to Belarus some Russian goods,  however, they do not do this. They bring Russian rubles and one  ruble is worth three or four Belarusian "hares." You see:  Money makes money. However, it is not provided with goods  produced in Belarus. Next, the twist in the price spiral  follows....    The next problem is the trade deficit. It turns out that we  import more goods than we export. Nobody has yet calculated  this deficit amount. If we could receive precise statistics  from our state customs checkpoints and the Belarusian National  Bank, we would be able to coordinate the prices for Belarusian  goods with the constantly changing prices for imported raw  materials and energy.    If we had these data, we could realize that constantly  increasing prices for energy resources leave our command economy  far behind and raise the prices of goods produced in Belarus.  The main reason for this is the expansionist economic policy of  Russia. Therefore, we should draw some conclusions. First of  all, our government should start watching the price policy  changes of our neighbors. Do you remember the increase in  prices for glassware in the Baltics when the price of one bottle  stood at R3 there and 20 kopeks in Belarus? Our neighbors  started with bottles and since then have achieved serious  economic reforms.    [Markina] Maybe our wages and salaries should also be  increased, along with prices?    [Tarasov] We need a Belarusian currency. Only then we will  be able to pursue our own policy in the sphere of price changes.  Currently, we do not have a rate for our Belarusian "hare"  currency.    [Markina] Vladimir Ivanovich, can we expect that everything  could be automatically resolved when we join the so-called ruble  zone, which had been promised by our government and the Supreme  Soviet?    [Tarasov] What will this ruble zone look like? That is the  question. Russia will hardly agree to the establishment of a  1:1 exchange rate giving the possibility of introducing single  prices. Everything could have been different if Belarus were a  subject of the Russian Federation. Meanwhile, Belarus is an  independent state. Therefore, in my opinion, it is unlikely that  Russia will introduce a 1:1 exchange rate. Hence, we should  speak not about a single ruble zone but about a currency union.  In addition, all the cataclysms of the Russian economy will  effect the exchange rate of Belarusian payment notes.    By the way, this currency union will not be a novelty in the  realm of international economic relations. For example, the  Austrian schilling is linked to the German mark. Thus, all  changes in the German mark affect the financial sector in  Austria.    Our government should demonstrate its political will  regarding the introduction of our national currency. We have  been using Belarusian payment notes for some two years.  However, have they become a solid monetary unit? Yes, they are  used in payment operations but they do not fulfill another  function -- the accumulation of capital. Who saves "hares" in  Belarus? People are saving dollars. Sometimes, they are saving  Russian rubles. Moreover, Belarusian "hares" are not used in  export-import financial operations. This means that "hares" do  not fulfill the function of international money.    It is evident that we should introduce our own national  money. We should not be scared that this will break our  relations with Russia. On the contrary, they will become  stronger. Pay attention to the fact that Russian Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin has already visited Lithuania, which introduced its  own currency, but he has never been to Belarus.    It is high time for Belarus to take analogous steps.    We should not rely on the "kind uncle." To my regret, many  people think the opposite. For example, Prime Minister Kebich  has visited Valday, where he spoke with Chernomyrdin on  increased deliveries of oil to Belarus. However, where is this  oil? Currently, the political situation in Russia is extremely  unstable. Belarus should conduct talks on all levels, including  contacts between government delegations, individual enterprises,  and commercial structures.    Russia has started creating joint stock companies. We could  do the same. Belarus can attract Russian partners. However, we  have no favorable conditions for foreign investments. Belarus  has hundreds of joint ventures with French, German, and English  partners, however, not a single one with Russia. At the same  time, our economic potential depends primarily -- 70-80 percent!  -- on Russia. We could have no problems with gas if we had  joint ventures with Russian oil structures. The Baltic states  do not experience any gas shortages due to the fact that Latvian  and Lithuanian businessmen have found a common language with  Russia. I want to emphasize: Progress is obtained by private  initiative. So, we should stimulate our own Belarusian private  initiative.</p>

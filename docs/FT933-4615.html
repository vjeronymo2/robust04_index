			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Fragile hopes light the horizon: The Israeli-PLO rapprochement could lead to a wider peace in the region Outsiders have long been bemused by the tendency of Israelis to liken their dour prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, to France's General de Gaulle. But as the Israeli populace awakens with a mixture of anxiety, cynicism and fragile hope to the possibility of Arab-Israeli peace, it is beginning to look as if the comparison is not far off the mark. As French president in the 1950s and early 1960s, De Gaulle fought a brutal war against Algerians seeking to shake off colonial rule, then sat down with the Front de Liberation National (FLN) to negotiate peace. Now the 71-year-old Mr Rabin, who is also minister of defence, is shuffling his way to a similarly historic deal with the Arabs with whom Israel has been in conflict since its foundation in 1948. The next few days should see the signing of an agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation - a movement consciously modelled on the FLN - that will permit Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, under Israeli occupation since the 1967 Middle East war, to take incremental control of their own affairs. As important, the two sides may exchange letters of mutual recognition in which PLO leaders will renounce violence and call a halt to the intifada, the six-year-old Palestinian uprising in the territories - thus setting out together down a road that could lead to an independent Palestinian state. In embarking on this course, Israel's Labour-led coalition government is out to crack the issue of the Palestinians, which is at the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict. If it succeeds, the Israeli government and the PLO will have broken the logjam obstructing progress towards a wider peace between Israel and the Arab states to its north and east. And the vision that some Israeli leaders have dreamed of for years - a Middle East devoted to economic co-operation rather than condemned to war - could start to become reality. Small wonder the Tel Aviv stock exchange has this week been hitting all-time highs. The enthusiasm is, of course, somewhat premature. A lot could still go wrong on all sides. For the time being Mr Rabin, a cautious and hard-headed man, is sensibly keeping the lowest of profiles, confining himself to terse public statements about the need for 'painful compromises' with hated enemies and leaving his foreign minister, Mr Shimon Peres, who negotiated the PLO deal in Norway a fortnight ago, to make all the running. Other Israeli leaders, from President Ezer Weizman down, are warning that the hard part - negotiation of detail on security arrangements in the occupied territories, and the separation of peoples whose lives have become horribly entwined in the past 25 years - still lies ahead. 'We've just broken through the barbed wire,' the head of state said this week, deploying a characteristically homespun military metaphor. 'It's the hardest part of the battle when you start to break through.' But the negotiating process has now established such momentum that it is difficult to see how Israel, the PLO or sceptical Arab states such as Syria could revert to business quite as usual even if the advance gets bogged down. In Israel, the prospect of peace agreements has burst forth so suddenly that the public is still dazed. Right-wing opponents of the deal with the Palestinians, such as Likud party leader Mr Binyamin Netanyahu, are mustering their forces, accusing Mr Rabin of negotiating a deal that will mortally endanger Israel's security. Jerusalem is festooned with banners proclaiming virulent opposition to Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a strategic slice of Syrian territory also seized in 1967. And last night, radical Jewish settler groups from the occupied territories were setting out to barricade Mr Rabin in his office for 24 hours in protest. But the opposition is divided, with Likud still smarting from a divisive leadership election. What is more, there are growing signs the right is out of touch with the Israeli mainstream. The settlers number only 4 per cent of Israeli Jews, and even some of them are resigned to giving up their homes. While the fears and uncertainties should not be underestimated, most polls show a clear, if narrow, majority of Israelis backing the current peace deal. In time, if Israelis and Palestinians show they can co-exist as equals, the majority could even become substantial enough to permit the territorial compromises that will be necessary to achieve a final settlement of the conflict. 'There is a general mood in the country that the present agreement in principle is something we should support because we are tired of wars,' said Professor Shlomo Ben-Ami of Tel Aviv university. 'People are worried, they want to know more about what is going on. But basically the majority of Israelis have turned against strong ideological positions.' This week's events are the product of a long and painful evolution of Israeli as well as Palestinian opinion, and of a remarkable political double-act between Mr Rabin and Mr Peres, two men who cordially detest one another and who respectively represent the hawkish and dovish faces of the coalition elected just over a year ago. A country that has lost 18,000 dead in Arab-Israeli wars cannot find it easy to contemplate peace. A people almost eliminated in the Holocaust still lives in fear - sometimes justified, sometimes irrational - for its existence. And the Palestinians, the people dispossessed of a country when the Jewish state was born, have long been the incarnation in Israeli eyes of the forces that threaten the country's survival. That Mr Rabin now seems prepared to concede them the beginnings of the state they denied themselves in rejecting the 1940s partition of Palestine reflects more than war-weariness. It constitutes an existential choice, born of the intifada and the realisation that 5m Israelis could not afford, financially or morally, to seek indefinitely to control the territories and their 1.9m Arab inhabitants. Maintaining a hated military occupation is a burden that a small state with a vigorous democracy and a desire for international acceptance could not bear for ever. And the uprising was a vivid expression of the Palestinians' desire for political rights of their own. As a senior government figure put it yesterday, Israel had to decide: it could grant them such rights as Israeli citizens, thus becoming a binational state; it could expel the Arabs from the West Bank and Gaza as urged by voices on the extreme right, and in the violent process destroy its moral legitimacy; or it could practise a form of apartheid by openly treating them as second-class citizens. 'Judaism and racism are in contradiction by their very essence,' said the official. 'Any such idea would mean we were not a Jewish state.' Or it could allow the Palestinians to rule their own lives as a separate people. 'No doubt they are an entirely different entity from us - religiously, politically, you could even say nationally,' the senior official added, in a sign of how far government thinking has moved. The road to that separation is complex and perilous. The proposed interim self-rule agreement is supposed to start with a redeployment of Israeli troops from Gaza and an area around Jericho and an early handover of powers in those areas to a Palestinian authority. Much detail, such as how Israeli forces still present to protect Israeli settlers will work with a proposed Palestinian police force, has still to be negotiated. Opposition to the deal among Palestinians is such that the result could be horrific intra-Arab violence, and nobody has come up with a plausible answer as to how Israel would respond. There is also a danger that the politics could turn sour - especially if Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman and self-styled president of Palestine, claims his state before the Israelis are ready to discuss it, or seeks to pre-empt the ultra-sensitive question of Jerusalem, claimed by both sides as their capital. But as both sides keep acknowledging, this is very much an interim agreement in which such issues are left for final negotiation in a few years. If it is signed, both sides will have an enormous incentive to make it work, not least by improving the economic lot of the Palestinians in the territories and combating the Islamic fundamentalism that breeds in the slums of Gaza. If they do, it is more than likely that Palestinian statehood - possibly in a loose confederation with Jordan - will be up for discussion before too long. And at that point Israel would be well on the way to attaining the status so long denied it - that of a normal state at the heart of the Middle East, able to devote its considerable intellectual and commercial talents towards sorting out its economic problems and taking a leading role in the development of its neighbourhood.</p>

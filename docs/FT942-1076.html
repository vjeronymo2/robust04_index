			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Sport: Delay the funeral, tennis is alive and well - Wimbledon The first week of Wimbledon's 108th tournament has produced so much excitement and good tennis that rumours of the sport's imminent demise seem decidedly premature. A heady mixture of nostalgia, emotion and raw-blooded athletic endeavour has given us entertainment of a high order. Rod Laver, the 53-year-old Australian who was a four-time singles champion at Wimbledon, provided the nostalgia on the opening day. The red-haired left-hander, looking slim and fit, received a tremendous ovation when the Duke of Kent, president of the All England Club, presented him with a piece of Waterford crystal to commemorate the silver jubilee of his unique second grand slam in 1969. Following the ceremony, it was appropriate that the world No 1, Pete Sampras, who had idolised Laver when growing up in California, should have opened the Centre Court programme. A convincing win against Jared Palmer, his neighbour in Tampa, Florida, suggested that anyone with pretentions to Sampras's title will have to produce something very special. The emotion belonged to 37-year-old Martina Navratilova. Her arrival on the Centre Court was greeted with rapturous enthusiasm by the assembled crowd, who gave the nine-times champion a lengthy standing ovation that brought a lump to the throat. In my 48 years of visiting Wimbledon, I have never seen anything like it. Fortunately, Martina was not too much affected by the occasion and saw off the challenge of the British girl Claire Taylor without fuss. The opening day had offered no clue about the drama that lay ahead. True, Cedric Pioline, the No 13 seed from France, went out, but that was not unexpected on grass. Suddenly, on Tuesday, the drama began. On the Centre Court, Steffi Graf, Germany's five-time champion, the overwhelming favourite to retain her title, crashed out 7-5 7-6 to the 30-year-old black American, Lori McNeil. As if in sympathy with her legion of tearful fans, the gods wept. This was the biggest upset in the history of Wimbledon. Never before has a defending champion lost her title in the first round. The doom-laden skies created a Wagnerian atmosphere. McNeil played glorious attacking tennis at the net to reveal the shortcomings in the champion's game. In strong, gusty wind, Graf's high ball-toss on serve was a liability. On the still sappy grass, the sliced backhand approaches of McNeil, skidding through fast and low towards her opponent's vulnerable backhand wing, were superbly effective. Even Graf's forehand only worked intermittently. It was obvious that the champion's confidence, dented by a recent loss to Sanchez-Vicario in Hamburg when she had held match points, and another to Mary Pierce in Paris, was still damaged. Before they started McNeil, who had beaten Graf once before - two years ago, in the first round of the Virginia Slims - said she fancied her chance in a first meeting on grass. How well she took it. McNeil is the product of John Wilkerson's public parks programme in Houston which also discovered Lori's one-time doubles partner, Zina Garrison. By coincidence, it was Garrison who inflicted humiliation on Graf when she beat the German en route to the final at Wimbledon in 1990. Graf's unexpected departure left a gaping hole in the draw. The other seeds in the top half responded well. Conchita Martinez (3) and Argentina's fallen angel, Gabriela Sabatini (10), started playing with renewed enthusiasm. Sabatini did well yesterday to beat the Eastbourne winner, Meredith McGrath, in straight sets. Life was not so easy for McNeil. Reacting from her sensational win, she struggled to beat Yone Kamio of Japan, but at least she survived and yesterday she won against Kristie Boogert of Holland more impressively in straight sets. Meanwhile, there was turmoil among the men's seeds. In the course of five days eight disappeared, including two former champions, Michael Stich (2) and Stefan Edberg (3). This year Stich lost in the first round in Australia to Malavai Washington and in the second round in Paris to Aron Krickstein. The brittle German had his cup of grand-slam misery filled to overflowing when he was beaten in a delayed first-round match by Bryan Shelton, another black American. At this rate, Stich will soon lose his No 2 ranking. The present world No 3, Stefan Edberg, is unlikely to be the man to overtake him. Looking vulnerable on serve from the start, the 28-year-old Swede was beaten in five rousing sets by Kenneth Carlsen after leading by two sets to one. It was sad that yesterday sickness forced him to retire when trailing 6-4 6-4 1-0 to Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden. Thursday produced two magnificent encounters. In the first, the French Open champion, Sergi Bruguera of Spain, beat Australia's big hope, Patrick Rafter, in a five-set marathon on Court No 1. Bruguera prefers clay courts and has not played here for three years, but he adapted to the demands of grass with the skill of a natural competitor. Some of his acutely-angled touch volleys were a joy and his ground strokes, fizzing with topspin, made life at the net uncomfortable for the game Australian. Yesterday he won again at the expence of Jean-Philippe Fleurian of France in four sets. How nice it was to see another Frenchman, artistic left-hander Guy Forget, fit again after a year away following operations on a knee. His five-set win against last year's finalist, Jim Courier, was a joyous and skilful occasion, not least because the two combatants, old friends and rivals, displayed a chivalry that is rare these days. Here were two men giving everything but still able to take joy from their opponent's winners. It left you feeling uplifted. How stirring, too, that last year's fine performances from the British men were repeated, this time by Jeremy Bates and Chris Wilkinson. At 31, Bates is performing as well as ever. Perhaps the responsibilities of fatherhood were what he needed to give him stability and maturity. Today he plays Markus Zoecke of Germany. Wilkinson, who reached the third round last year, was not disgraced in losing to Wayne Ferreira at the same stage yesterday. He was relieved to be playing at all after enduring one of those frustrating injury spells that so often end the careers of promising athletes. It has been a good week for Wimbledon and for tennis. Postpone the funeral.</p>

Nesvizhskiy: "Tallinn and Moscow Argue About </F> the Border"]    [Text] Residents of Pechora Region obtaining Estonian  passports    Debates about state ownership of Pechora Region, transferred  in 1944 to the RSFSR [Russian Soviet Federative Socialist  Republic], have been going on since the proclamation of  independence by neighboring Estonia. Not recognizing "Stalinist"  boundaries, the Estonian side continues to refer to "the only  internationally recognized document"--the Tartu Peace Treaty of  1920, in accordance with which Pechora Region was part of  Estonia. Russia, naturally, prefers to proceed from current  administrative borders, gradually transforming them into state  borders, and refers to the will of the current population of the  region, renewed by 90 percent in recent years.    For Russia today it is the state border here, while Estonia  stubbornly adheres to the term "control line" with regard to it,  at the same time the boundary designation remains in the stage  of "informal transparency." "The border essentially exists for  the transportation flow, and if I should want to by-pass the  border check point, I can enter Estonia without any  difficulties," Vitaliy Kustov, deputy chief of administration of  Pechora Region, admitted to the SEGODNYA correspondent in the  course of an interview.    The problem lies not so much in the shortage of border  guards  (of which, as commonly known, there is an abundance in Russia)  as in the complicated nature of the present-day border which is  yet to be demarcated. A couple of weeks ago Estonian border  guards detained several Russian loggers on territory which they  sincerely believed to be Estonian. Some 850 meters of a road  linking the Estonian villages of Vyarsk and Sats belong to  Russia, which established two check points there with two armed  guards at each one, while the road home from the Russian island  of Kolpino lies through Estonian territory. During summer  exchanges of "detained foreigners," consisting of mushroom  pickers and children who wandered into the neighboring country,  are conducted by border guards at the check points.    After transfer of the region to RSFSR a major part of the  indigenous population (before the war there was approximately an  equal number of Russians and Estonians in Pechora) moved to  Estonia. Those left were mainly old people with children or  relatives in Estonia.    By contrast with the northern segment of the border, where  residents of Narva and Ivangorod on the border received passes,  there is nothing like that in Pechora and many found themselves  in a difficult situation. A solution was swiftly suggested "from  the other side": in accordance with Estonian law residents of  the republic born prior to 1940 (within the old borders that  included Pechora Region) as well as their descendants are  Estonian citizens and eligible to receive an Estonian passport.  A special Pechora branch of the Department of Estonian  Citizenship was opened in the border Estonian village of Vyarsk,  where residents of the region are issued Estonian passports.  According to Vitaliy Kustov around 1,000 Pechora Region  residents, both Estonians and Russians, have already obtained  them. It is, however, impossible to cite an exact figure since  there is no dual citizenship treaty between Russia and Estonia  and holders of the passport with three lions prefer not to  advertise their foreign document. Estonians in turn also refuse  to submit lists of their citizens in Pechora.    As reported by Juri Vaidla, chief of "the Department of  Citizenship of the Pechora Region of Estonia," to a SEGODNYA  correspondent, the lists are so highly classified that even the  authorities cannot always gain access to them: "We fear  repressions against those people in Pechora, and the lists may  be obtained by only one person in Tallinn--the minister of  internal affairs of Estonia." The same may be heard from others  as well. Citizens receive Estonian passports as a matter of  course thanks to the "wise" policy of Pechora authorities which  do not allow even those to go abroad whom the Estonians are  prepared to admit. Estonian entry visas for some reason are  specifically checked by our side (for the Estonians it is  sufficient for a passport to show Pechora Region as the  birthplace). The latest innovation of the local administration  differs little from the previous ones. The Pechora Railway  Station, where those wishing to visit their neighbors are  required to disembark in accordance with decree No. 48 of the  regional administration, has been declared a control zone.  Russian NTV television company personnel were not admitted there  with the explanation that their Tallinn colleagues had spent two  hours in a militia station for attempting to disembark at the  railway station with a television camera.    "Pechora leadership is aiming to cut itself off from the  neighbors with a stone wall"--says a Russian woman from the  island of Kolpino, who arrived in Vyarsk for a passport. "We are  simply unable to travel to St. Petersburg each time for a visa."    Meanwhile Pechora Region land is now being claimed not only  by Pechora residents: on the eve of a new round of  Russo-Estonian negotiations there was a meeting of "owners of  land in Pechora Region" in Vyarsk last Saturday. In accordance  with Estonian laws all property confiscated in the years of  Soviet power must be returned to them.    "If Russia is not prepared to recognize our jurisdiction  over  Pechora, let it at least recognize the rights of the heirs,"  Jaak Herodes, deputy of the State Assembly of Estonia, declared.  In any case the issue concerning return of property to the heirs  will be placed on the agenda of Russo-Estonian negotiations in  the very near future. We do not divide by nationality--Estonian,  Russian, or Jew: all these people are citizens of Estonia and it  is obliged to protect their rights." He believes that issuance  of Estonian passports will help residents of Pechora Region to  avoid problems even if only with the Estonian side.    Many of his colleagues, however, have a more radical view:  Ein Tarto, deputy of the State Assembly of Estonia from the  ruling Isamaa [Fatherland] coalition party, who arrived in  Vyarsk, is confident that Russia will sooner or later return  Pechora Region to the republic. Judging by everything the  growing number of Estonian citizens in the disputed region may  become a trump card for Tallinn.    If Estonia refuses to participate in the determination of a  new border, the Russian side will designate the border in a  unilateral manner. But according to Russian law a state border  is established on the basis of bilateral agreements, and  Estonia, armed with the Tartu Treaty of 1920, will hardly agree  to sign a new one. The territorial dispute promises to be  endless.</p>

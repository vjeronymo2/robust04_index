			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Managers at BR warn on contracts: Threat to renegotiate after sale British Rail managers, who are negotiating contracts with other parts of the organisation in preparation for privatisation, say that they will not feel bound by the deals should they later succeed in management buy-outs of BR operations. BR's train operating divisions are negotiating access contracts with Railtrack, the state-owned company which will own the track and signalling after privatisation. The contract negotiations are taking place under the guidance of Mr Roger Salmon, the rail franchising director. The train operators say that the contracts are not being drawn up realistically. Mr Salmon has to arrange a smooth sale of BR's operations to private-sector franchises. The train operating companies will continue as BR divisions for several months but will be incorporated as BR subsidiaries later this year and expect to gain independence as private companies from next year. Senior managers forecast that negotiations to modify the contracts can be expected at the stage of incorporation and then of private sale. This call for renegotiation reflects the tension between the train operators and Railtrack, which has been accused of taking unfair advantage of its monopoly ownership of BR's infrastructure. One manager said: 'The franchising director should not think that the train operating companies will simply buy a pile of contracts.' The office of the franchising director responded that it accepted that some renegotiation might be necessary but it did not expect its work to be totally overturned. It said: 'We are pre-negotiating these contracts with an eye to when these activities are sold as franchises.' The franchising director expects 'quite robust negotiations' when the train operators have established their own sets of accounts. This makes it crucial for him to find other bidders for BR's operations so that management buy-out teams are not left as the sole bidders able to dictate terms. Privatisation critics say the network of contracts needed between the different companies that will provide rail services will create red tape. The government says such contracts are normal in sectors such as the airline industry. In a separate move the seven passenger transport authorities, responsible for commuter railways in the main conurbations, said they could not maintain services unless the government made a long-term commitment to public subsidy. The authorities' track charges are to increase from Pounds 78m to Pounds 222m next year. A meeting is to be held tomorrow with Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister.</p>

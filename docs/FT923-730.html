			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Further cost-cutting at HTV as losses increase to Pounds 5m HTV GROUP has revealed details of a do-or-die Pounds 10m cost-cutting programme as the company announced an increased pre-tax loss of Pounds 5.03m for the six months to June, which was worse than expected. The share price dropped from 41p to 27p. Pressure is on the company, which has the independent television licence for Wales and the west of England, because from the beginning of next year it will start paying Pounds 20.5m a year plus 2 per cent of its advertising revenue to the Treasury under broadcasting legislation. The programme will include a year-long pay freeze for all staff, a reduction in the actuarial costs of 'luxurious' pensions and an end to special loyalty bonuses. A restructuring bringing together the separate Wales and west divisions is already under way. The company is not declaring an interim dividend and the question of a final dividend will be reviewed in the light of autumn trading. Losses per share were 5.4p (5.2p). Mr Louis Sherwood, chairman, conceded that the independence of the company was at stake unless the savings were made. 'We are fiercely independent and we are going to do out best to remain independent.' He added that the company would continue to reduce expenditure next year 'consistent with our licence obligations, in order to deliver to our shareholders a return to profits and dividends'. What Mr Sherwood described as 'extremely disappointing results' were mainly the result of a sharp and unexpected decline in share of HTV's share of ITV advertising revenue from 6.2 per cent to 5.8 per cent. There had been an improvement in operating losses to Pounds 2.09m (Pounds 2.69m) on lower turnover of Pounds 65.1m (Pounds 80.7m). Net interest charges were lower at Pounds 1.89m (Pounds 2.16m) but there was an exceptional charge of Pounds 1m covering restructuring and redundancy costs. Last year's interim pre-tax loss was Pounds 4.84m. Mr Chris Rowlands, recently appointed group finance director, said that almost all the Pounds 10m planned savings had been identified. Until recently HTV believed that the UK economy would improve after the general election. Now no end to the recession was in sight. 'It now seems to us prudent to plan on the assumption that these conditions will continue for an indefinite period,' Mr Sherwood said. The scale of the potential problem is shown by a review of advertising revenue commissioned from consultants Booz Allen. In its franchise bid HTV assumed 3.3 per cent growth in real annual advertising revenue throughout the 10 years of the franchise. Booz Allen has told HTV the growth is likely to be less than 2 per cent.</p>

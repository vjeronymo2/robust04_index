			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RAZO LAWYER SAYS OTHERS COMMITTED 10 ROBBERIES  </P> <P> The 10 holdups that former Harvard student Jose Luis Razo is accused of were  committed by two or three different robbers, one of whom may be Razo's younger  brother, the defendant's attorney said Monday during closing arguments of his  trial.  </P> <P> Razo, 22, told police and newspaper reporters in 1987 that he committed the  string of armed robberies of stores and fast-food restaurants during breaks  from his studies at Harvard. But during his monthlong trial in Superior Court  in Santa Ana, Razo has testified that Richard Longoria, a neighborhood friend  with an extensive criminal record, actually committed the crimes and then told  him the details.  </P> <P> State records, however, show that Longoria was in prison when three of the  robberies were committed.  </P> <P> In an often-impassioned, three-hour address to the jury, Razo's attorney, John  D. Barnett, on Monday attempted to show how the evidence proved that there had  to be at least two different robbers.  </P> <P> "We've got a 5-foot, 3-inch Hispanic, a 6-foot, 3-inch Hispanic, a Hispanic  with a mustache, light-haired people and brown-haired people," said Barnett,  pointing out the various descriptions that the robbery victims gave either to  police or on the witness stand. "The same person can't be all this. Can't be."  </P> <P> Barnett said that, besides the fear of retribution, Razo had another reason why  he could not name any other robbers except Longoria, even though that would  have improved his chances for acquittal.  </P> <P> "The answer may be in blood," Barnett said. "The threat of a long prison  sentence cannot force him to mention his brother's name."  </P> <P> Several of Razo's family members, friends and his parish priest were in the  courtroom Monday, but his brother was not.  </P> <P> Barnett pointed out that Razo and his brother, Albert, look "remarkably" alike,  and that Albert Razo has wavy hair -- a characteristic cited by one robbery  victim in describing the robber.  </P> <P> Last week, Barnett introduced into evidence a picture of Albert Razo, who is  now 19. Razo's psychology tutor at Harvard, Ellen Herbener, had testified that  Razo once mentioned to her that he was concerned about his "little brother" --  then about 16 -- committing crimes in the barrio.  </P> <P> In his own closing arguments, Deputy Dist. Atty. Ravinder Mehta scoffed at  Razo's new defense.  </P> <P> "Razo testified in court that there is only one robber," Mehta said. "But the  story Mr. Razo told you fell apart like a cheap suit . . . and now they're  scrambling to bring in other robbers."  </P> <P> "There is no evidence whatsoever to consider that his brother committed" the  robberies, Mehta declared.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Barnett, Mehta contended, had exaggerated the differences in  victims' descriptions of the robber, which had been made while they were still  shaken by the crimes. In fact, Mehta said, all but one victim testified that  Razo was about the same size as the man who robbed them.  </P> <P> Repeating an argument that has been the basis of the case against Razo since he  was arrested almost two years ago, Mehta said that no one but the robber could  have told police about the string of holdups in the detail that Razo did in  July, 1987.  </P> <P> Razo provided police with dates, times, locations, amounts of money stolen and  accurate, sequential accounts of most of the robberies, Mehta said. In telling  police about the robbery of a Safeway market on Dec. 28, 1985, for example,  Razo said that he hid in the bathroom until the store closed, and when he came  out, he found a female employee doing some work near a clock, Mehta said. The  employee said that the robbery began exactly that way.  </P> <P> During the trial, Razo testified that he was interested in Chicano criminal  behavior, and, after coincidentally bumping into Longoria one night after the  first robbery, Longoria would call him at Harvard and tell him about each  crime.  </P> <P> Barnett argued Monday that Razo wanted to get "inside the mind" of barrio  criminals because his own research at Harvard had shown there to be a dearth of  good, first-hand studies about Latino crime.  </P> <P> While getting so close to what were both boyhood friends and subjects for his  research, Razo delved into the schizophrenic-like world of the drug PCP  (phencyclidine), and suffered a toxicologically induced psychotic breakdown in  which he assumed the persona of the robbers, Barnett contended.  </P> <P> "Jose got the information (about the crimes) from other sources," Barnett  argued. "He wasn't there . . . but in the midst of a dopamine (a brain  chemical) storm, he became his subject. He became the savior of the world. He  became the messenger of God."  </P> <P> Barnett said Razo's psychotic state at the time of his confession, along with  the lack of physical evidence against him and the discrepancies in victims'  descriptions of the robbers, were enough to leave more than a reasonable doubt  about Razo's guilt in the jurors' minds.  </P> <P> Mehta answered that Razo was probably faking psychosis when interviewed in jail  by a forensic psychologist because he knew it might help his defense. And he  pointed out to the jury that all of the robberies occurred during Harvard  breaks.  </P> <P> Razo faces a possible prison sentence of 22 years on the 10 robbery counts.  Jury deliberation begins today.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: FROM THE DOUBLE-CROSS TO THE HOT CROSS  </P> <P> The revolving door turns and where it stops nobody knows. Ever since President  Reagan moved out and President Bush came in, the game of musical chairs has  continued. Reagan appointees are now working the other side of the street  representing private clients seeking assistance.  </P> <P> The most popular profession for ex-Administration appointees seems to be public  relations. "Public relations" has a nice ring to it and, like "consultant," you  can make it mean anything you want it to.  </P> <P> It's interesting to note that these people, who are now charged with buttering  up the media, were not too friendly to us when they were doing Reagan's  bidding. Some are having a hard time persuading my colleagues and myself that  they were really good guys when they worked for the government.  </P> <P> One such person is Sanford Probe, who came into the office to sell me a story  on tax breaks for the hot cross bun industry.  </P> <P> "Why should I talk to you, Sanford?" I asked. "When you were in the White  House, you never returned my calls."  </P> <P> Sanford replied, "It wasn't my fault. How did I know that I'd be representing  the hot cross bun industry when I left the government?"  </P> <P> "That's not a good enough excuse. Remember when I saw you at the Salute to  Nofziger ball? You wouldn't even say hello to me. You walked by as if I wasn't  there."  </P> <P> "I had no choice. I was with Don Regan and he would have become suspicious if I  had spoken to you. He might have thought I was returning your calls."  </P> <P> "All you guys in the revolving door are the same. You treat us like dirt when  you're on the inside and lick our boots when you're on the outside."  </P> <P> "You're making that up. Remember the time when I called and told you that the  Contras had just won $30 million in the New Jersey lottery?"  </P> <P> "It was a phony story. The Contras won the money from Ollie North who sold U.S.  arms to Tehran."  </P> <P> "So I was slightly inaccurate. Does that make me an unreliable source?"  </P> <P> "I didn't say that you were unreliable. I just felt that you were suffering  from a bad case of disinformation. You thought you would be running things  forever. Well, it doesn't work that way in America. You dump on people for two  terms and then it's their chance to dump on you."  </P> <P> "Look, I've learned a lot since I have been working in the private sector. I  now understand that everyone has a job to do whether they're in the Oval Office  or stuck in a traffic jam on the Beltway. If I don't get a story on a tax break  for hot cross buns into the newspaper, I could lose the account."  </P> <P> "Why should the hot cross bun industry get a tax break?"  </P> <P> "Because the Japanese are flooding the country with hot cross buns and killing  our markets."  </P> <P> "How are they flooding America?" I asked.  </P> <P> "They're bringing them in in the glove compartments of their automobiles."  </P> <P> "That doesn't sound like much of a story."  </P> <P> "You don't think so? I'm new at this game. I know I could have gotten away with  it in the White House."  </P> <P> "You can get away with anything in the White House, but when you re-enter the  real world, your veracity is at stake. Remember this, Sanford. Nobody in the  private sector ever lies."  </P> <P> "I wish someone had warned me about that when I took this job."  </P></p>

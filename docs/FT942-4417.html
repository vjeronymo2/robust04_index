			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Record low Netherlands turnout in Euro-poll: UK Conservatives fear disaster - Dutch Christian Democrats hope to gain lead Elections to the European Parliament began yesterday with a record low turnout in the Netherlands and the ruling Conservative party in the UK bracing itself for disaster. In the Netherlands, traditionally one of the most pro-European electorates in the EU, voter turnout slumped to 35 per cent, indicating that the Christian Democrats of outgoing prime minister Mr Ruud Lubbers had recovered the lead they lost in a general election last month. Early exit polls in Denmark suggested no change in the overall balance between pro- and anti-Europeans. Voting was stronger than expected, with a turnout of 52 per cent compared with 46.2 per cent in 1989. In Ireland, polling was slow through the day and a turnout of between 40 and 50 per cent of the country's 2.6m voters was expected. This would compare with a 48 per cent turnout in the 1984 European election, and a 68 per cent turnout in 1989, the latter coinciding with a general election. Elections for the expanded 567-seat parliament will take place in the other eight EU countries on Sunday. Official results are not due to be published until Sunday night. Preliminary forecasts by Dutch television showed that the Christian Democrats stood to win 10 seats in the European Parliament, two seats ahead of Labour, which is now the largest party in the national parliament. For both the Christian Democrats and Labour, the results would be no different from 1989, but would indicate a relative decline as the Dutch will have six more seats in the parliament, for a total of 31. The low Dutch turnout compared badly with the 47 per cent at the last European election in 1989. Exit polls suggested D66, a left-of-centre party, would win four seats - three more than it gained five years ago. The Liberals seemed set to capture six seats, an increase of three. Direct comparison between the 1989 and 1994 elections is complicated by the expansion in the number of Dutch seats. A low turnout traditionally helps the Christian Democrats and hurts Labour. Another factor in favour of the Democrats may have been the appeal to voters by Mr Lubbers, who is fighting an uphill battle to become president of the European Commission. In Denmark, the strongly pro-union Liberal Party, led by Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the former foreign minister, stood to add one seat to win four of Denmark's 16 seats, according to one exit poll. Other polls indicated a strong performance by anti-European movements, the People's Movement against the EU and the June Movement. However, the anti-Europeans, although expected to increase their vote to about 25 per cent from 18.9 per cent, were not expected to add to the four seats they already hold. The Social Democratic party, which dominates the present government coalition, was expected to lose one of its four seats. Its share of the vote appeared to have fallen to about 15 per cent from 23.3 per cent. Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the prime minister, said it was 'a clearly disappointing result'. In the UK, polling was also slow in the election for 84 MEPs, increasing the prospect that the Tories will lose up to two-thirds of their 32 seats, with up to a dozen going to the Liberal Democrats and the rest to Labour. However, Conservative managers believe that a late swing to the party could allow it to hold up to 20 seats, which would be regarded by many activists as a triumph for Mr John Major, the prime minister. However, the latest opinion poll carried out by Mori for The Times indicated that the party could be left with as few as four seats. The poll gave the Conservatives just 23 per cent of the vote, compared with 51 per cent for Labour and 20 per cent for the Liberal Democrats. Such a result would expose Mr Major to renewed criticism from rightwing Eurosceptic MPs, in spite of his generally Eurosceptic approach during the campaign.</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / A fight at the opera: A crisis looms at Covent Garden Tonight on the stage of Covent Garden Maria Ewing will sing the title role in Peter Hall's acclaimed production of Salome. Sing - and dance, too, provocatively dropping every one of the seven veils. A feeling of exposure is one that she shares with Jeremy Isaacs, the rumbustious Scot whose three and a half years as general director of the Royal Opera House have been accompanied by almost non-stop sniping. His current position is typically precarious. The recession has cut both Covent Garden's audiences - from the targeted 85 per cent of capacity to a current 78 per cent, and income from private sources - to Pounds 750,000 below the forecast of Pounds 5.3m. As a result, Mr Isaacs' pledge to cut the Royal Opera House's accumulated deficit of Pounds 3.3m this year appears doomed. Its building, especially the back stage area, is hopelessly antiquated. It is losing prestige to the English National Opera, a quarter of a mile away at the Coliseum. Moreover, David Mellor, the new Secretary of State for the National Heritage, and ultimate paymaster for Covent Garden, is a sceptic of the work of the Opera House. Events seem to be approaching a crisis and there are many who think that, as in Salome, the finale may demand the head of a sacrificial victim - Jeremy Isaacs. For a man cast for a tragic ending Isaacs remains remarkably resilient, keen to sketch out an entirely different scenario. His position is secure until his contract runs out next year, and he would like a renewal until 1997. Covent Garden will then definitely close for at least two years to enable a projected Pounds 250m worth of renovations to take place. An appeal to raise Pounds 90m was announced this week, with the balance coming from a project of shops and offices. The renewal of Mr Isaacs' contract depends upon his board of trustees, headed by Sir Angus Stirling, director of the National Trust. They may well be supportive. The attitude of Mr Mellor is less certain. He could offer additional subsidies for Covent Garden if it brought in a director capable of delivering his ambition to make the venue more accessible and populist. It is unlikely that the trustees would bow to such pressure. Much hangs on a meeting between Sir Angus and Mr Mellor which is scheduled to take place within the next few weeks. Mr Mellor probably has enough on his hands - the reform of the BBC; the fate of the Arts Council; and the Lotteries Bill - without picking a quarrel over Covent Garden. He could accept the Royal Opera House's argument for more aid. More likely he will await the findings of two investigations into the workings of Covent Garden: one, headed by Lady Warnock and part of the Arts Council's reviews of its clients; the other, by accountants Price Waterhouse, at the behest of the Covent Garden Board. Both will report in the autumn; both are likely to recommend more money if the Opera House commits itself to cost savings. The case for the Opera House is persuasive. Compared with state and city subsidy for equivalent institutions in Paris, Milan, and other European cities, Covent Garden is grossly under-funded. In the past six years it has lifted its self-generated revenue from box office and sponsorship from 47 per cent of revenue to 60 per cent. Its annual subsidy of Pounds 18.9m actually funds three companies - the Royal Opera, the Royal Ballet, and the Birmingham Royal Ballet. The opera company gets Pounds 7.75m, less than the Pounds 10.4m. received by the ENO. Its attendances are well above the West End average and in recent months its new productions have received good reviews. But Mellor may be unconvinced. The problem is that Covent Garden has never succeeded in shaking off the air of precariousness which comes from endemic under-funding. Take the Royal Ballet. Straitened financial circumstances have forced it to operate with too few dancers. It cannot afford important new commissions and its audiences have declined - down 7 per cent in the last year. In the desperate search for savings Mr Isaacs has reduced the number of dance performances in favour of opera. One splashy night with a singer like Placido Domingo who commands premium seat prices, grosses Covent Garden Pounds 130,000.  So the morale and reputation of the Royal Ballet slumps. Similar problems dog the Royal Opera. New productions are likely to be joint ventures with other opera houses or modestly costed, which prevents Covent Garden developing a house style. The 1992-93 season is popular, with few risks, and is enlivened with galas which are wonderful for the box office. But they add to Covent Garden's reputation as an elitist institution with seat prices beyond the purse of the genuine opera lover. Mr Isaacs has accepted that he forced prices up too far, too fast and for next season they are frozen. This will gain friends but ensure yet another increase in the deficit. Covent Garden is not asking for a fixed sum of extra cash. It is offering Mr Mellor a list of options - a freeze on seat prices will cost X; increasing the strength of the Royal Ballet will add Y; an increase in regional touring by Birmingham Royal Ballet will amount to Z. But all told he is really looking for an extra Pounds 3m this year. Mr Isaacs feels Covent Garden deserves it partly to compensate for the years of economies but mainly because the Royal Opera House reckons it is last in the queue for aid among the national arts companies. By closing down its London base at the Barbican in 1990 the Royal Shakespeare Company forced the Arts Council and the City to give it millions in additional subsidies, while the National Theatre has regularly received higher grant increases than Covent Garden. Now could be the time to sort out Covent Garden once and for all. The Royal Opera House is clearing the decks in readiness. The appeal for Pounds 90m, to be headed by Mrs Vivien Duffield, one of the richest women in the country, will be launched at the most appropriate time to tempt a major contribution from the government - probably in about 1994 when the revenues from the planned state lottery are expected to start flowing in. Mr Isaacs hopes he will be around then to start the changes: but David Mellor is the piper playing that particular tune.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Demand continues for fixed-rate mortgages FIXED-RATE mortgage offers continued to be issued this week to satisfy increased demand while interest rates remain low. Anne Gunter, of National Westminster bank's mortgage services, says nearly half the bank's customers chose a fixed-rate mortgage last year. The bank has launched three more fixed rate offers, which apply to endowment and pension mortgages only. The choice is between a fix of 7.99 per cent until February 28 1995, one at 8.69 per cent until the end of February 1997 or 9.29 per cent until February 29 2000. All carry a fee of Pounds 250. The redemption penalties are two months, three months and six months respectively. Halifax has issued three new short-term fixed rates, two of which are aimed at first-time buyers. They can choose to pay 6.5 per cent fixed until October 31 1994 if they borrow up to 90 per cent of the value of the home, or 6.7 per cent for the same period on a maximum loan of 95 per cent. Fixed rates are available on all types of mortgage and an insurance-related product has to be taken out. The fee is Pounds 200 and the early redemption penalty is two months' interest. A fixed rate of 7.5 per cent is available until April 30 1995 on all mortgage types. Leeds Permanent has issued a three-year mortgage fixed at 7.45 per cent, but it is restricted to loans on not more than 70 per cent of the value of the home. Those wanting an 80 per cent loan can fix at 7.75 per cent. The fee for either mortgage is Pounds 195 and they are available on all types of loan. The borrower has to buy two insurance-related products. Early redemption charges are staggered annually. Portman building society is launching a first-time buyer's mortgage from Monday, available on repayment mortgages as well as others. Buyers can choose between two types of offer. They can either accept a discount of two percentage points below the society's variable base rate, currently 8.7 per cent, for 12 months - the rate is therefore 6.7 per cent - or they can fix at 6.7 per cent until March 31 1994. The mortgages come with two years redundancy cover but building and contents insurance has to be taken out. There is no application fee. Portman is offering a 7.5 per cent two-year fix, distinguished by requiring no application fee. It is available on all types of mortgage, and is not dependent on the borrower taking out insurance-related products. There is a three months' redemption penalty on these mortgages. Nationwide is also offering a two-year fix at 7.25 per cent, available on repayment and endowment mortgages. The arrangement fee is Pounds 195 and Nationwide's mortgage payment cover policy has to be taken out. Early redemption penalties are six months in the first year, four in the second. Two fixed rate deals became available from Birmingham Midshires this week. The first is 7.35 per cent fixed for two years for an arrangement fee of Pounds 195. The early redemption penalty is three months interest. Those wanting to fix for a longer period may prefer to pay 8.49 per cent fixed until the end of January 1998. The fee is Pounds 245 with a penalty of six months' interest payable on early redemption.</p>

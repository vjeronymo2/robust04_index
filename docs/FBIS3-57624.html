			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Nikolay Burbyga article: "Victims of Undeclared Wars. 4. </F> Submarines Sometimes Never Come to the Surface At All"]    [Excerpts] In the past 27 years -- 1967 through 1994 --  there have been 20 underwater collisions between Russian Navy  submarines and foreign nuclear submarines, mainly U.S. ones.  Eleven of these "encounters" took place in the maritime combat  readiness test sites of the Northern and Pacific Fleets, which  are directly adjacent to Russia's shores. The latest collisions  that were recorded involved the nuclear submarine Baton Rouge in  the Barents Sea in February 1993, and the nuclear submarine  Grayling in March 1993 (both were from the U.S. Navy). Military  experts maintain that such incidents can lead to the loss of  submarines together with their crews and an ensuing  environmental disaster. Alas, there are full grounds for such  depressing conclusions...    A K-129 Soviet diesel missile submarine (the Golf class  according to NATO classification) was lost on 8 March 1968 in  the northern part of the Pacific Ocean as a result of an  unpremeditated collision with a U.S. Navy nuclear submarine.  Captain First Rank Vladimir Kobzar, the submarine commander,  and 98 crew members perished.    IZVESTIYA wrote about this tragedy in a series of articles  under the general heading "Submarine from 'Graveyard' Bay" (Nos.  154, 155, 156, and 158 in 1992). [passage omitted]    We have only spoken about one collision, which led to the  loss of a submarine and crew, but there have been a lot of  collisions like this. The same kind of collision occurred in  1968 when an Echo-II class submarine from the Northern Fleet  (Commander Captain First Rank V. Shekhovnov) collided with an  unidentified U.S. navy nuclear vessel in the Barents Sea.    In 1979 another Echo-II class nuclear vessel belonging to  the  Pacific Fleet (Commander Captain First Rank B. Bogdasaryan)  collided with the U.S. nuclear vessel Tautog off the Kamchatka  coast.    In 1974, in the same area, a Yankee class submarine  (Commander Captain First Rank Yu. Antonovskiy) collided with a  U.S. Navy nuclear vessel...    In all of the listed cases, it was only by a miracle that  the  submarines avoided destruction. According to Admiral of the  Reserve Vladimir Sidorov, former commander of the Pacific Fleet,  these collisions (at the present time they are the most  dangerous accidents at sea) could be stopped with the help of  the signing of an agreement by the Russian and U.S. Governments  on preventing incidents between submarines underwater. And, as  the editorial office has found out, the American side was  familiarized with a draft of this agreement back in June 1993...</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "When Freedom Is Too Much For You"] </F>   [Text] State regulation of the timber industry has been  reintroduced in Buryatia by decision of the republic Council of  Ministers. The republic government was forced into taking this  step by the critical situation in this sector, which was rapidly  privatized two years ago.    The newfound freedom turned out to be a heavy burden for the  15 joint-stock companies formed on the basis of the Transbaykal  region's timber procurement establishments. Their output proved  uncompetitive not only in the world market but also in the  Russian market, as its prime cost is greater than those of its  nearest rivals in Siberia.    Nevertheless, the Government of Buryatia's decision does not  signal a return to the administrative economic management of the  sector. The "Lesopromyshlennaya Kompaniya `Zabaykalles'" state  enterprise will only be a coordinating body. Its main task is  to coordinate interests of the republic and the joint-stock  companies and to create a scientifically and economically based  model of investment in the Transbaykal region's timber industry.</p>

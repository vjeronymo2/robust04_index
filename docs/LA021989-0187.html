			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLIPPERS STARTING TO WORK ON A NEW STREAK;  </P> <P> PLAYING WITHOUT NORMAN, L.A. LOSES FOURTH IN ROW -- BULLETS, 98-93  </P> <P> The Clippers' Son of Streak aged another game Saturday night, although the  team's growth process now comes by inches instead of miles. These games are  considered victories of late.  </P> <P> The new losing streak, after the Clippers had broken the franchise record of 19  straight, reached four with a 98-93 loss to the Washington Bullets before a  crowd of 11,573 at the Sports Arena.  </P> <P> Playing without the injured Ken Norman, their No. 1 rebounder and No. 2 scorer,  it was the sixth time in Coach Don Casey's 13 games that the Clippers had lost  by seven or fewer points. It was a three-point game, 96-93, with 13 seconds to  play, before the Bullets put the game away at the free-throw line.  </P> <P> "I feel good about it," said Gary Grant, the rookie guard who hit six of nine  shots in the second half, mostly on jumpers. His shots got the Clippers close  after they trailed by 11 at halftime.  </P> <P> "I don't feel good about losing, but it's good not to get blown out. We easily  could have won the last two games."  </P> <P> The Clippers, who shot just 35.4% in the first half, trailed by 10 going into  the fourth quarter, 76-66.  </P> <P> Despite allowing Washington several second and third opportunities on offense,  they narrowed the gap. The Clippers never led in the fourth quarter but were  within a point twice, the last time at 88-87 on Quintin Dailey's baseline  jumper with 4:21 remaining.  </P> <P> "I thought we gave them some help," said Washington Coach Wes Unseld, whose  Bullets won for only the fifth time in 26 road games. "Our problem is that we  didn't get much out of our second unit. We got good shots but didn't seem to  convert. Too many missed layups and opportunities. I think we made it tougher  on ourselves than it had to be."  </P> <P> Said Casey: "I thought for the first half it was like pulling teeth after we  extended ourselves against Golden State (on Thursday). But we came back, mainly  because of the energy of the young kids.  </P> <P> "It's nice being in every game. But it's also like a tease."  </P> <P> The night began with more distractions for the Clippers -- news that a trade  might be in the works to send Benoit Benjamin to the Sacramento Kings.  </P> <P> "It's the same dialogue we've had for the last three months," Alan Rothenberg,  the Clippers president, said. "But the trade deadline is coming up in a couple  of days, and I think people are just working faster to see if a trade can be  made."  </P> <P> If it is -- and the Clippers finally part with their enigmatic center -- it may  be because of pressure applied by Larry Fleisher, Benjamin's agent. Fleisher  has said for weeks he does not want Benjamin to re-sign when his contract  expires at the end of this season, and is doing everything possible to prove it  to the Clippers.  </P> <P> Asked recently how much he would request in a new contract, Fleisher said: "Too  much to make it worthwhile for the Clippers."  </P> <P> So, the Clippers, realizing that the Feb. 23 trading deadline is drawing near,  apparently have stepped up their attempts to move Benjamin. General Manager  Elgin Baylor said he has talked to more than 10 teams in recent days and that  all have expressed an interest in the league's seventh-best shot blocker.  </P> <P> Before the game, Benjamin blamed the media for any trade talk that has  surfaced. But in contrast to the past, when he has expressed a desire to stay  in Los Angeles, he now says that Fleisher will do all the talking.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to say anything either way," Benjamin said.  </P> <P> Benjamin finished as one of five Clippers to score in double figures, Charles  Smith lead with 17 and Eric White contributing 16 off the bench in his finest  effort this season. Grant had 14 points and 11 assists.  </P> <P> Jeff Malone scored 20 for Washington, and Bernard King added 18.  </P> <P> Clipper Notes  </P> <P> Clipper President Alan Rothenberg said before the game that the Clippers still  have not been notified of the outcome of the arbitration hearing with Bill  Walton. Gary Vandeweghe, Walton's attorney, said the decision went in favor of  his client, although nothing has been made public. . . . Ken Norman did not  dress because of a strained right knee, suffered Thursday against Golden State.  Benoit Benjamin is the only Clipper to play in all 51 games. . . . The Clippers  set a franchise record with 32 offensive rebounds in the overtime loss to  Golden State. . . . Reggie Williams received one stitch on his lower lip after  a third-quarter collision with Washington's John Williams and referee Joe  Crawford. The Clipper guard, who left the game, also jammed his neck and  developed a headache after his head hit the referee's knee.  </P></p>

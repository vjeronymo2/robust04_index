			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Linda Hutchinson] </F>   [Text] Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, 25 Jan, CANA -- The  Trinidad and Tobago Government will accelerate its efforts to  recover money owed to it by at least six Caribbean Community  (Caricom) countries, a government minister reported Tuesday.    "This process was started by the Ministry of Finance in  1993. In 1994, the minister of finance will attempt to  accelerate the process through direct contact with his  counterparts in the defaulting countries," Junior Finance  Minister Ken Valley said in the Senate.    "These efforts are expected to culminate in 1994 with the  full regularisation of the arrears." He named Antigua and  Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent  and the Grenadines as countries not currently servicing all of  their liabilities to Trinidad and Tobago.    "In some instances, no terms and conditions were determined  for the repayment of the advances," he reported. "It is also the  case in many instances that the countries defaulted several  years ago. At this point, therefore, it has become necessary to  verify the outstanding balances before the full recovery can be  negotiated." At the end of December last year, U.S.517 million  dollars was due to Trinidad and Tobago by its Caricom partners.  The money represents only the bilateral portion of Trinidad and  Tobago's debt portfolio. The multilateral arrears under the  collapsed Caricom multilateral clearing facility amounted to  almost 33 million dollars at the end of last year.    Out of the indebted countries, only Belize and St. Kitts are  fully current and to-date they have repaid principal sums of TT  65,620 dollars and 1,555,914 dollars (one TT dollar = 17.5 U.S.  cents) respectively on the original loan balances, the minister  said. Antigua and Barbuda owed U.S.2.5 million dollars; Dominica  1.3 million dollars; Grenada over 600,000 dollars; Jamaica  97,000 dollars; St. Lucia 388,000 dollars; and St. Vincent and  the Grenadines 100,000 dollars. The Trinidad and Tobago  Government was expected to sign, early this year, a bilateral  agreement with the Government of Guyana, whose bilateral  liability to the government here and the central bank was  U.S.487 million dollars or 94 percent of the total debt. The  Guyana debt was restructured in 1989 but subsequently fell into  arrears. In August last year, a team of government officials  from Trinidad met with Guyanese counterparts to negotiate a  memorandum of understanding for the consolidation of the debt. A  memorandum was signed by both governments and forms the basis of  a bilateral agreement between both countries.    The agreement provides for the liquidation of the arrears of  34.5 million dollars which was due from August 1990 to July  1993. The agreement provides for a rescheduling of these arrears  over a twelve-year period with a six-month moratorium on  principal repayment. The 1993 agreement also provides for two  semi-annual payments of 10.5 million dollars in 1994 and similar  amounts in 1995 and 1996.    "Payments falling due under this agreement may be reduced by  a range of debt conversion techniques including debt-equity  swaps," said Valley. In pursuit of debt-equity swap  opportunities, in March this year, the government is mounting an  investment and trade mission to Guyana. The aim of the mission  is to identify businesses in Guyana in which the participants,  both from the private and state enterprises sectors, will be  prepared to make equity investments."    With regard to the recovery of the amounts due to the  Trinidad and Tobago Government and central bank by the  government and Central Bank of Barbados, both governments last  December signed a memorandum of understanding. The memorandum  provides for the set-off of the government of Trinidad and  Tobago's share of the liability of the cargo airline Caricargo  to the Barbados National Bank against the debt of the Government  of Barbados and the Central Bank of Barbados to Trinidad and  Tobago.    Caricargo's debt to the Bank of Barbados is Bds59 million  dollars (one Bds dollar = 50 U.S. cents) with Trinidad and  Tobago's share being 29.5 million dollars.    The debt set-off will result in Barbados' U.S.25 million  dollar liability being reduced by U.S.15.3 million dollars.</p>

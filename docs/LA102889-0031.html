			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAY AREA QUAKE AFTERMATH AND FREEWAY SAFETY  </P> <P> What in the hell is the federal government doing to help? Loans to help? The  countless victims are in desperate need of help now -- not a loan. How about  giving money to help? Taxpayers deserve a break from the government now!  </P> <P> When foreign countries asked the U.S. for help, we gave millions and millions  away of our tax dollars. Here at home, it's a loan. One has to qualify for a  loan. How can one qualify when he is totally poor now?  </P> <P> I am also sick of people gouging at a time like this. Where is their compassion  for those who have an urgent need? They should hang by their fingers!  </P> <P> TIM LUM  </P> <P> San Francisco  </P></p>

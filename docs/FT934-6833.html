			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Observer: Summing up Tricky moment at yesterday's Queens Moat Houses extraordinary general meeting. Chairman Stanley Metcalfe called for a show of hands to vote on the adjournment of the meeting, a thinly attended event. Advised by the adjudicator that seven votes were in favour and four against, Metcalfe announced the motion did not have the 50 per cent support it needed. He was quickly put right. But shareholders, facing massive dilution through a debt for equity swap, can hardly have been comforted by the chairman's display of mental arithmetic.</p>

			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> KABC-TV Channel 7 will launch a half-hour early morning newscast in the next  few months, says news director Roger Bell. Whether it will begin at 6 or 6:30  a.m. is yet to be worked out with the parent network. Channel 7 currently  carries the hourlong ABC network newscast, "News This Morning," from 6-7 a.m.,  then goes into the two-hour "Good Morning America." KABC reporter Gene Gleasen  will anchor the new broadcast, with the co-anchor and the premiere date still  to be determined. Of the three local network affiliate stations, only Channel 4  now has a locally-produced early-morning newscast (at 6:30 a.m.). ALEENE  MacMINN  </P></p>

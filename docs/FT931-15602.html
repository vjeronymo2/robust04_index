			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Observer: Privy squeal Oh dear, what can the matter be? Yesterday Observer praised the civilised PR man who, needing to use his portable phone while on a train, made the call from the lavatory because he was 'too embarrassed to be seen taking the thing out in a public carriage'. Alas, readers should beware of doing likewise. A man who happened to be travelling in the adjacent coach reports that he and everyone else present overheard not only the remark quoted, but everything else the would-be discreet caller said in the conversation. As if that isn't enough evidence that British Rail's lavatories are leak-prone, its new Class 456 trains' toilets have been locked up for the winter because they are apt to overflow and affect the brakes.</p>

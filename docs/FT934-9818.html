			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Top cabs Sir, Having read your report 'Hackneyed cabbies versus rank outsiders' (October 30), may I suggest Singapore has the best taxis in the world? The taxis are all new Toyotas with air-conditioning and clear meters. The drivers all speak English. Periodically the government encourages courtesy campaigns. Price: 92p for first 0.94 miles and then 27p per mile charged in increments of 4p. You can book taxis by phone or by fax. They are certainly the cheapest and cleanest and most civilised taxis. Nigel Yeung, Singapore</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Mediterranean markets top performance charts MEDITERRANEAN govern-ment debt markets topped international bond performance charts for August, reflecting expectations that high interest rates in Spain and Italy will continue to fall. Italy showed the strongest performance in local currency terms for the third month in a row, with a gain of 5.54 per cent last month, according to J. P. Morgan's government bond index monitor. Spain, which has seen 10-year bond yields slashed by a third since last October, came in with a market return of 4.35 per cent in August as investors bought on the expectation that the Spanish government would manage to hammer out a wage agreement with the unions. 'In Spain, bond prices rose, shrugging off disappointment that key interest rates were not reduced rapidly once the peseta's ERM bands had been widened,' says J. P. Morgan. Investors continue to believe that the trend in interest rate and inflation is downwards, whatever the setbacks and delays prompted by the refusal of Germany to reduce its key discount rate. Overseas buyers have pledged their faith in the UK, particularly in the belief that the economy offers the double benefit of growth with low inflation. Gilts were the third strongest performing debt market, with a local currency return of 3.58 per cent. At the other end of the European scale, Germany's resolve to maintain firm rates in the face of high money supply was behind a return of 1.55 per cent. And Belgium languished at the bottom of the table of principal international bond markets. It provided a return of only 0.61 per cent as investors remained concerned about the central bank's commitment to pegging rates at German levels in spite of the high level of Belgian public debt.</p>

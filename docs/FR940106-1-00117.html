			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Factors Affecting the Species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Lists. A species may be determined to be endangered or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threatened because of one or more of the five factors described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the Sacramento  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> splittail ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pogonichthys macrolepidotus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Sacramento splittail was once  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> widely distributed in the Central Valley of California from Redding to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the modern-day site of Friant Dam near the City of Fresno. It is now  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restricted to western, northern, and southern portions of the Delta due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to dams, diversions, dredging, and the diking and filling of historic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flood basins. Within the species' constricted range, splittail have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> declined by 62 percent since 1984. However, the overall percentage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decline over its historical range is much greater. Populations have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fluctuated somewhat in the past, with most recruitment taking place in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wet years. In wet years since 1976, however, splittail recruitment has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> declined consistently with catches per unit effort of 12.3, 8.1, 2.0,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.3, and 0.3 for 1978, 1982, 1983, 1986, and 1993, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Splittail declines are highest (82 percent) in the shallow-water Suisun  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bay area, which is the center of its distribution. This may reflect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loss of productive brackish-water habitat in Suisun and Grizzly Bays due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to increased salinities caused by low outflows.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, Delta water diversions and exports total to about 9  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> million acre-feet per year. Federal and State projects presently export  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about 6 million acre-feet per year when sufficient water is available,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and in-Delta agricultural uses result in diversion of about 3 million  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional acre-feet per year. Plans currently being prepared could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potentially induce increased exports and diversions in the future. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service knows of 22 major Central Valley Project, State Water Project,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or private organization proposals that would result in increased water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exports from the Delta, reduced water inflow to the Delta, changes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the timing and volume of Delta inflow, or increases in heavy metal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contamination of the Delta. These proposed projects or actions include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but are not limited to Central Valley Project Operations Criteria and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Plan (including Friant Contract Renewals), Los Banos Grandes Reservoir,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Los Vaqueros Reservoir, South Delta Water Management Program, South  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Delta Water Barriers Project, North Delta Water Management Project, West  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Delta Water Management Project, Coastal Aqueduct proposal, Delta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wetlands Corporation Water Storage Project, Folsom Dam Reoperation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Oroville Dam Reoperation, Auburn Dam, Central Valley Project contract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> renewals, the Central Valley Project and State Water Project wheeling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchase agreement, reactivation of the San Luis Drain, Stanislaus-Calaveras River Basin Water Use Program, Suisun Marsh Project Phase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three and Four, Kern Water Bank, Arvin Edison water storage and exchange  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal, Federal Water Project change in diversion point, and State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Water Project Pump additions. These projects would modify or destroy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the habitat of this species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the Federal pumping plant has been operated at capacity for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many years except for a few drought years, increased exports at this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plant appear unlikely. However, the State Water Project pumping plant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the capacity of the State Aqueduct have considerable unused  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity. The California Department of Water Resources (1992) reported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the past and projected State Water Project deliveries from Delta sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the years of 1962 to 2035. In the 1980s, deliveries ranged from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.5 million acre-feet to 2.8 million acre-feet. By 2010, deliveries of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> up to 4.2 million acre-feet are planned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since 1983, the proportion of water exported from the Delta during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October through March has been higher than in earlier years (Moyle  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1992). The timing of these proportionally higher exports have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coincided with the spawning season of the splittail. Federal and State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water diversion projects in the southern Delta export, by absolute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volume, mostly Sacramento River water with some San Joaquin River water.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, during periods of high export pumping and low to moderate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> river outflows, reaches of the San Joaquin River reverse direction and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flow upstream to the pumping plants located in the southern Delta. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State-operated pumping plant presently exports water at rates up to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6,400 cubic feet per second (cfs). The State is considering proposals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to export an additional 3,900 cfs. The Federal pumping plant can export  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water at rates up to 4,600 cfs. In addition, local private diverters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> export up to 5,000 cfs from about 1,800 diversions scattered throughout  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Delta.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When total diversion rates are high relative to Delta outflow, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the lower San Joaquin River and other channels have a net upstream  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i.e., reverse or negative) flow, out-migrating larval and juvenile fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of many species become disoriented. Large mortalities occur as a result  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of loss to pumps and predation by striped bass at the various water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities and other diversion sites. Because data from State and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal pumping facilities indicate that splittail migrate upstream to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spawn, positive outflows are also important to transport splittail young  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> downstream (Meng 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In recent years, the number of days of reversed San Joaquin River  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flow have increased (Moyle  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1992), particularly during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> February-June spawning months for splittail. All size classes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> splittail young suffer near total loss when they are entrained by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pumping plants and diversions in the south Delta. Few young are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectively salvaged at the Federal and State pumping plant screens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This species' embryonic, larval, and postlarval mortality rates also are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher when reduced outflows cause increases in salinity and relocation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the entrapment zone (Moyle and Yoshiyama 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

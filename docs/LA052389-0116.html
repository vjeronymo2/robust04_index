			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: O. J. SIMPSON ENTERS NO-CONTEST PLEA  </P> <P> Actor and former pro football star O.J. Simpson pleaded no contest Monday to a  charge that he beat his wife at their Brentwood home New Year's Day.  </P> <P> Simpson, 41, entered the plea to one count of spousal battery through his  attorney, Howard Weitzman, in West Los Angeles Municipal Court, said city  attorney's spokesman Mike Qualls.  </P> <P> The plea is not an admission of guilt, but allows the defendant to be judged as  guilty. A no-contest plea allows a defendant to deny guilt in another legal  proceeding.  </P> <P> Simpson is accused of slapping, kicking and threatening to kill his wife,  Nicole, in the New Year's Day argument.  </P> <P> Sentencing is set for Wednesday in West Los Angeles Municipal Court. The  maximum penalty is a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.  </P></p>

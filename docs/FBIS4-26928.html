			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Dollar Declines, Hong Kong Dollar Also </F> Declines"]    [Text] Last week, global money and stock markets  experienced major fluctuations. The U.S. dollar hit a record  post-war low and fell below 100 yen. Although there was  certainly some rebound afterwards, the market is still generally  taking a bearish view of the dollar. Even after the central  banks of the major industrial countries joined hands to  intervene, little result was achieved in reversing the trend.  Due to a chain reaction, the world's stock markets generally  slumped. It seems that the central banks may again take action  after the market reopens today. The situation is noteworthy.    After the end of World War II, the exchange rate of the U.S.  dollar against the Japanese yen was pegged at 1 to 360. Some  people said that this was because the United States deliberately  arranged a low exchange rate for the yen in order to boost  Japan's exports and help Japan's economic recovery. Some people  said that the rate was set by MacArthur to seek a "perfect  circle" for the yen, because 360 represents the number of  degrees in a circle. Anyhow, the fixed exchange rate mechanism  was maintained until 1973. After that, the dollar has declined  continuously. It has fallen below the symbolic 100 yen mark and  has reached another significant milestone.    Last August, the dollar once dropped to the low level of 100  yen. Two days after this fall, the U.S. Federal Reserve  intervened in the market and forced the dollar to rebound by 5  yen after selling only $100 million of its reserves. However,  the present situation is quite different.    First, the United States was quite indifferent to the  dollar's decline, and only Japan's central bank intervened.  While the market watched for U.S. action, people could only  hear Clinton, Greenspan, and Bentsen making irrelevant remarks.  Three days later, when the central banks of the major countries  took joint action, the dollar had become too weak to recover.  The Federal Reserve alone spent more then $1 billion of its  reserves fund, but the result could hardly compare with last  year. This made people more worried that the United States will  have to raise interest rates again to support the dollar, and  that this would have an adverse impact on stock markets and  cause substantial falls.    The United States has shaken off economic recession ahead of  the other Western countries this time. It is generally believed  that the economic recovery in the United States is still  stronger than that in Japan. However, the dollar exchange rate  continues to face downward pressure, and this seems to be  contrary to the country's actual economic conditions.    Some economists say that the United States has shown  symptoms  of the "British disease." Britain used to be an economic power  in the past. However, after its colonies gained independence in  the post-war period, overseas markets for British products began  to shrink in the 1960's. Every time strong economic growth  arose in Britain, the nation increased its imports and the trade  deficit increased too. Then, the government was forced to apply  the brake, and this slowed growth. After three such cycles,  Britain finally announced the devaluation of the pound, although  this did not fundamentally solve the problem. At present, there  is high consumption inside the United States, and the savings  rate of the American people is very low. The competitive power  of American goods in overseas markets is rather weak. What is  accompanying economic recovery is an increasing trade deficit.    Facing a weakening U.S. dollar, Clinton could only say that  the foundation of the U.S. economy was healthy and the United  States would continue to strengthen its economy in order to seek  a favorable reaction from the markets. He did not express his  determination to stabilize the dollar, and did not even show an  understanding of the market. The outside world does not  understand U.S. monetary policy and foreign exchange policy  either.    The United States has reopened the trade talks, but people  still suspect that the United States has not given up its  practice of pushing up the yen in order to restrain Japanese  exports and reduce its own trade deficit. On the part of Japan,  a further revaluation of the yen is certainly a bitter  experience. When the Japanese economy, which has been insipid  for a long time, was just showing certain signs of improvement,  the continuing revaluation of the Yen (the market looks forward  to a level of 1 dollar to 95 yen) has dealt heavy blows at the  weak recovery. Japan could not but take solo action to support  the dollar.    The current round of yen revaluation has coincided with  instability in the Japanese political situation and also  precedes the G-7 summit. This has caused people to speculate  that the United States has deliberately taken this opportunity  to exert pressure on Japan.    On the other hand, the role of the U.S. Federal Reserve is  also under suspicion. Earlier this month, the famous American  journalist Bob Woodward, who revealed the Watergate scandal,  published a new book entitled "The Agenda." In it, he exposed  many of the Clinton administration's scandals [as published] and  mentioned that Greenspan "in some aspects was the ghostwriter of  Clinton's economics." If this is true, the independent position  of the Federal Reserve has changed, and it might have changed by  relying on spending cuts and deficit reduction to achieve its  purpose. The recent weakness of the dollar began precisely from  the revelation of this inside story on the front page of THE  WASHINGTON POST.    While the market remains unclear about the orientation of  U.S. monetary policy, it seems that the U.S. dollar will  continue to fluctuate sharply in the near future. Because the  Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the weakness of  the U.S. dollar will cause the exchange rate of the Hong Kong  currency to fall against other major currencies. As a result,  in order to avoid losses caused by fluctuating exchange rates,  foreign capital and ordinary investors have decided to reduce  their holdings of Hong Kong stocks. This is a major reason for  the fall in the Hong Kong stock market.    The pegged exchange rate system has undoubtedly played a  positive role in stabilizing the Hong Kong currency. However,  there is no panacea in the economic field. Before the 1960's,  the Hong Kong dollar was pegged to sterling, and the peg was  removed after sterling's devaluation. Future changes in the  value of the U.S. dollar and its impact on Hong Kong's economy  are something we should pay close attention to.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Pounds 10,000 cash withdrawal revealed in Archer share case Mr Broosk Saib, the beneficiary of profits earned on Anglia share deals arranged by Lord Archer, withdrew Pounds 10,000 in cash shortly after receiving the proceeds of just over Pounds 77,000 from the transactions. The Department of Trade and Industry inspectors who carried out an investigation into alleged insider share dealing in Anglia shares were told that Mr Saib deposited the Pounds 77,000 cheque in his National Westminster Bank account at west London's Cromwell Road branch on February 10. The deposit was made at almost the same time as the appointment by the DTI of inspectors to investigate the transactions for possible breaches of insider dealing law. The government had been informed by the Stock Exchange of Lord Archer's Anglia share dealing orders only days after they took place in mid January. The cheque for the dealing profit was 'account payee only' and was drawn on the Bank of Scotland account of broker Charles Stanley, which bought and sold 50,000 Anglia shares for Mr Saib's benefit on the instructions of Lord Archer. Mr Saib already had a current account at the Cromwell Road branch. However, he opened a Premium Reserve interest-paying account, into which he transferred just over Pounds 50,000 of the proceeds. The inspectors also learned that in February and March there were three significant withdrawals from Mr Saib's NatWest account: there were payments to external accounts of Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 12,000, plus a cash withdrawal of Pounds 10,000. The external accounts which received the payments belonged to 'individuals or organisations' unconnected to Lord Archer, according to an official with a close knowledge of the DTI investigation. The cheque for just over Pounds 77,000 was posted to Lord Archer's London address on February 4. The profit stemmed from the purchase and sale of 50,000 Anglia shares over four working days in mid January. The shares were bought at 485p and sold at 646p. The shares were sold on the day MAI announced a takeover bid for Anglia, of which Lady Archer is a director. Lord Archer has told the DTI inspectors that he did not profit from inside information. The former Conservative party deputy chairman is travelling abroad and, according to a friend, may not return to the UK until the end of the month. The DTI has decided not to take any action against Lord Archer, having received the inspectors' report. Labour yesterday stepped up pressure on Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to publish the report. Mr Derek Fatchett, Labour's industry spokesman, rejected Mr Heseltine's assertion last week that the Financial Services Act gave him 'no power' to publish the report.</p>

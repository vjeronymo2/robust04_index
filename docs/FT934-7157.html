			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Travel: Searching for Swiss powder 'LEAN OUT, lean out] Don't do anything I didn't tell you to do,' came the guide's angry call. I was just beginning to sidestep gingerly across the top of a steep couloir lined with rocks. The guide's instructions were to lean outwards so the edges of the skis would dig better into the hard crust. But the consequences of leaning out too far made me prefer to lean in. The danger was over in a few seconds, but it was one of three or four moments during a week of powder skiing in the Swiss Alps that still make my palms perspire. John Hogg, a Canadian guide who has operated in Switzerland for the past 12 years, prides himself on being able to find untracked powder snow in the Alps for his clients, regardless of the conditions. And, last winter, when I joined his group for six days in the Klosters-Davos region, there had not been any significant new snow for more than a month. The result was that he had to lead us into increasingly inaccessible places, such as the couloir mentioned above. Once we had cleared that we came upon a long, broad pitch of untouched deep snow, only a couple of hundred metres from the top of Davos's always crowded Weissfluh. On other days, we would put skins on our skis and trek for an hour or more from the top of a lift to get to faces - almost always on the north sides of mountains - where there was a chance that the snow would still be skiable. It was, without doubt, the most strenuous holiday I have ever taken, and not just because of the climbing at high altitudes. With the lack of snow and the warm weather, our skiing always ended up in nasty conditions at the bottom - breakable crust, slush and then just rocks and mud, forcing us into long walks. But in addition to the occasional moments of fright and the frequent fatigue, there were wonderful moments. I remember sitting down for a packed lunch in a mountain surrounded valley on a cloudless day, only a mile or so from Klosters but alone. There was satisfaction even in the simple achievement of the steady rhythm maintained by trekking up a slope on skins, or in making a couple of relatively competent parallel turns in heavy, deep snow. Is this sort of holiday for you? It is certainly not for everyone. Two in our group of eight decided on a couple of mornings that they would rather rest, and Hogg says dropouts are not uncommon. The main prerequisite, surprisingly enough, is not a high level of skiing skill, although familiarity with the technique of sidestepping across steep couloirs helps. One of our number, a Swiss, was a modest snow-plougher. Nor does age matter. The best performer in our group was 60. The real key is fitness. In his English language brochure, John warns potential clients that they should be able to run five miles in 45 minutes three times a week. 'I do not have to put it in the German language brochure. The Swiss and the Germans understand,' he says. As for the level of danger, John has an impeccable record as a guide. He is a stickler for safety, forcing everyone to wear an avalanche beeper, carry a shovel and, since last season, wear the new ABS inflatable air bag that is intended to prevent the user from being buried in an avalanche. 'I accept that there are risks, but I try to cut them to a minimum,' he says. 'When I come across a difficult place, I always ask myself what is the worst that can happen.' John's view is that this type of skiing is ideally suited to the Alps. The lift network there is dense enough that you never have to trek too far, and there is always a pleasant inn at the end of the run and a taxi, bus or train to take you back to base. The less strenuous alternative of heli-skiing has become too expensive and, in an increasing number of areas, has been prohibited. But the strain of it all, especially with the paucity of snow in the past few seasons, has taken its toll even on him. He and a Swiss guide are planning to move to British Columbia next year to set up a heli-skiing business.</p>

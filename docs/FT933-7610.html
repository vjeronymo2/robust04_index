			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Airlines must fly solo: The US government will not rescue the industry US airlines, struggling after three years of heavy losses, once had high hopes that the government would help them return to health. But now they realise they will have to find their own cure. A much-heralded report from a government commission on airline competitiveness was not even off the presses before important recommendations started to fall by the wayside. Some of the more ambitious suggestions are widely viewed in Washington as having only a slim chance of passing Congress - notably the proposal that foreign companies should be allowed to raise their voting stakes in US airlines to 49 per cent from 25 per cent. In the past, Both British Airways and KLM, the Dutch national carrier, have had plans to take large stakes in loss-making US airlines frustrated by this limit. The commission also recommended exempting airlines from the new transportation fuel tax included in President Bill Clinton's budget. But in the search for revenues to wrap up a deal that would get the budget through Congress, the exemption was trimmed back to two years only. In many ways, the commission, set up in April, has come along too late. Its recommendations have had no influence on the budget debate. Above all, most big carriers have already taken significant measures to restore profitability, by downgrading some expensive 'hub' airports, and cutting domestic networks to concentrate on profitable routes. Others have built up new sources of revenue from providing logistical and consultancy services to other airlines. It is as well that they have done so, for the commission concluded that the airline industry's problems were not so much the result of structural dysfunctions that could or should be remedied by government as of the airlines' own mistakes. The report notes that much of the decline in profitability has occurred in short-haul markets because of competition from low-cost airlines. 'Average yield declines in these markets are not indicative of irrational pricing behaviour, but of the fact that a large proportion of domestic traffic flies in markets where these low-cost airlines operate. While this development has depressed the yields and profitability of higher-cost airlines in the short term, it is evidence of a dynamic competitive process,' the report concludes. This process has by no means worked itself out. Southwest Airlines, the one leading carrier that has remained profitable, is expanding to the north-east, and is currently engaged in a fare war with USAir which has seen prices for a Baltimore-Cleveland ticket drop as low as Dollars 19. The report also points the finger squarely at management errors. 'The industry itself, primarily by taking on excessive debt, must bear its fair share of the burden for its current state,' the commission writes, citing the 1992 summer fare war, and a pattern of ill-timed expansions, as well as the creation of too many connecting hubs. Nevertheless, the report does identify some areas where government could take measures to help the industry. In the tax area, the commission concludes that the federal government places a large and disproportionate burden on the airline industry, which should 'no longer be viewed as revenue generating machines for the government'. Besides the recommended two-year exemption from the transportation fuel tax, the report argues for rolling back the ticket taxes levied on airlines. However, the current reluctance of Congress to pass anything which reduces government revenues makes this proposal seem unlikely to generate much support. Scepticism over congressional reaction is shared by the International Air Transport Association, which represents most of the world's airlines. More radically, the commission proposes a complete restructuring of the Federal Aviation Authority as an independent corporation, which would remain under government control but would have its own budget safe from raids by Congress and would be able to issue bonds to finance capital improvements. Such improvements are badly needed, the commission says. It also advocates a satellite-based navigation and control system which could save the airline industry Dollars 5bn a year through reduced delays and improved routing. The prospects for effective modernisation are not encouraging. The authority is behind schedule and billions over budget on its 1982 modernisation plan. The commission recommends a public-private consortium to develop and implement improved technology. In the international arena, the commission argues for a complete redrawing of the patchwork of bilateral air traffic agreements that governs world aviation, urging an effort to reach liberal multilateral agreements. The US is in the middle of renegotiating a bilateral accord with the UK and is about to start talks with Germany. A multilateral air agreement is viewed by most industry observers as a distant pipedream. The advantages of such an accord would accrue disproportionately to the US. But it is unlikely to be agreed at all as long as Congress remains reluctant to permit foreigners to own bigger shares in US airlines. In the end, the cure is in the hands of the carriers and their ability to take advantage of a slowly improving economic climate. 'They have learned . . . in the future they will be more conservative,' says Mr Clifford Winston, an economist at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cochabamba -- The preparatory meeting for the  International Decade of the World's Indigenous People, with the  participation of delegates from Latin America and the Caribbean,  has proposed a program for establishing a new order of relations  with indigenous people.    Several proposals were made during the closing ceremony of  this important international event, which was attended by Vice  President Victor Hugo Cardenas, Foreign Minister Antonio  Aranibar, and Nobel Peace Prize winner Rigoberta Menchu.    The three-day event, which ended on the evening of 1 June,  proposed that the new order of relations with indigenous  communities guarantee the recognition of the indigenous identity  and the historical rights of their political, juridical,  economic, social, and cultural institutions.    It must also guarantee the total and free participation of  the indigenous communities in all aspects of society, and  especially in the issues that concern them.    These and other recommendations will be proposed to the  United Nations next December in an effort to prepare a  declaration of the International Decade of World Indigenous  Communities.    Another proposal calls for strict compliance with the  necessary measures to intensify the struggle against racism and  against the cultural, linguistic, racial, and religious  discrimination affecting the indigenous communities.    Also in coordination with the organizations and institutions  of the indigenous communities, a decision was made to adopt new  necessary measures to guarantee the adequate participation of  the indigenous communities in the distribution of the budget of  each country, to eradicate poverty and isolation.    Another proposal advocates the implementation of national  policies for distribution of land, education, employment,  technical assistance, protection of traditional economies, and  sustainable ecological development, respecting the tradition of  the indigenous communities, in order to improve their standard  of living.    The conclusions of the meeting also recommend the protection  of the beliefs and rituals of the indigenous communities as an  expression of their basic right to their cultural identity and  to allow the indigenous communities access to the media to  promote their culture and their opinion of society.    The specific resolutions of the indigenous communities of  Latin America and the Caribbean will seek free participation in  the decisionmaking process for all aspects of society. The  Fides news agency listed the following resolutions:    -- Make express recognition, through the implementation of  constitutional, legislative, and administrative measures, of the  responsibility and historical rights of the indigenous  communities established within states, as well as of the rights  resulting from international treaties and agreements.    -- Establish effective equal mechanisms for the negotiation  and solution of conflicts that may develop between the  indigenous communities and the non-indigenous sector (public or  private) of society, including the possible violation of the  individual or collective human rights of those communities.    -- Establish one day of each year as an official day for  public awareness of indigenous dignity, and study the  possibility of establishing in penal legislation harsh penalties  for those who commit acts harmful to the dignity of indigenous  communities.    -- Adopt measures to ensure the total eradication of  discriminatory policies and practices on labor matters.</p>

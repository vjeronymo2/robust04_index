			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Arts: More bad luck for Oedipus - Theatre Your fears were well founded. As its title led you to forebode, Omma - Oedipus and the Luck of Thebes - the new play by Kenneth McLeish at the Young Vic - is (1) postmodern, (2) swottish, (3) boring, (4) bad. 1. Postmodern. For McLeish it is not enough to re-tell the tale of Oedipus. A time-traveller, he jumps back and forth through the pre- and post-history of Oedipus's family; and at the same time he has to keep us oh] so ironically detached from the whole affair. Thus his play zooms us halfway through the scenario of Sophocles's King Oedipus; Oedipus's enquiries into the past are in motion, Jocasta has just entered, and . . . Then one of the cast of four says 'Enough of that,' and suddenly rattles us back through the pre-Jocasta history of Thebes's royal family - at bewildering speed. Next Omma fast-forwards us to Oedipus's children (the interval occurs in the middle of this bit, by the way), pausing occasionally for the odd one-man choral ode. What next? Back to Oedipus, Jocasta &amp; Co. 2. Swottish. When it comes to the early history of Thebes, McLeish goes overboard. Omma rewinds through Agaue killing her son Pentheus (see The Bacchae), and - a really obscure nugget, this - the occasion when Oedipus's father Laius was guilty of homosexual child molestation and manslaughter. As for the title, 'Omma' - but of course we knew this one] - means 'eye', hence 'apple of the eye', hence 'lucky charm,' hence 'luck'. Since Thebes houses the blind prophet Tiresias, and since Oedipus blinds himself, the eye/luck irony might be interesting . . . if only McLeish had remembered to make it so. 3. Boring. The cast of four, directed by Tim Supple, intone Omma with a truly rare mixture of speed, detachment, and flatness. They wear the same black modern dress throughout, whichever characters they play (Conrad Nelson gets to play Oedipus, Polyneikes, Eteokles, Ismene, and the main choral odes). An impressive variety of lighting picks them out from the encompassing gloom. And they wear head-sets (like disc-jockeys) with microphones just before their mouths so that we hear their voices, droning so rapidly, only as amplified through the loudspeakers. Were they attempting the intensity of maximum restraint? or the coolness of utter objectivity? They didn't quite achieve either. In Act Two, Colin R. Campbell (who at this point is playing Haimon) squeezes a bit of naturalistic vehemence into his speeches: the effect is a relief but, in context, unstylish. As Kreon, Paul M. Meston is quite outstandingly stony. 4. Bad. The best section is, I suppose, the Antigone part of Act Two. Here the pace slows somewhat, McLeish's language occasionally blooms, and something of the tone and structure of Greek tragedy loom into view. Elsewhere, however, Omma is unconcerned with even making its main story lucid to its audience. Poor Oedipus] He had a bad enough time anyway, but now McLeish &amp; Co. have sunk him in obscurantism. At The Young Vic, SE1, until April 2.</p>

			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FIREWORKS IGNITE BLAZE IN OAK VIEW RIVERBED  </P> <P> Two juveniles and an adult started a brush fire Wednesday while setting off  fireworks in the dry bed of the Ventura River in Oak View, authorities said.  </P> <P> Ventura County firefighters doused the flames before the fire had burned more  than half an acre, said Ventura County Sheriff's Lt. Michael Gullon.  </P> <P> But officials had been concerned about the fire's potential to spread.  </P> <P> "It was scary because a brush fire could start another big fire," Gullon said,  referring to the blaze that burned nearly 5,000 acres in Santa Barbara County  last week.  </P> <P> The two juveniles were cited for unlawfully starting a fire and released to the  custody of their parents, Gullon said. The adult was not cited. He was released  pending further investigation, Gullon said.  </P> <P> The Oak View fire was the second minor brush fire in the county Wednesday. A  two-acre fire erupted just after midnight in the dry hills south of Simi  Valley. Authorities were investigating the cause of that fire, a County Fire  Department spokeswoman said.  </P></p>

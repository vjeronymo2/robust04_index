			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Belgrade, 12 Feb -- Zeljko Simic, deputy prime  minister of the Federal Government [of Yugoslavia], said at  [Belgrade's] Surcin airport this evening that serious and  detailed talks were held today in Zagreb and that they  represented the realization of previous negotiations.    A commission for missing persons and humanitarian issues was  formally and legally constituted and it would work under the  auspices of the International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC]  and the UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees].    The commission has eight members--three each from Yugoslavia  and from Croatia and one each from the ICRC and the UNHCR.    Simic also said that all details in connection with the  opening of offices in Belgrade and Zagreb were agreed and that  they would be opened, most likely at the end of this or at the  beginning of next month. [passage omitted]    Simic said that his talks with Croatian President Tudjman  were successful, pointing out that the Croatian president showed  that he was very interested in the normalization of relations  with Yugoslavia.    Simic also said that after these talks he was even more  convinced that meetings at the highest level were, he said,  "more than realistic."    Asked whether the status of the Republic of Serb Krajina  [RSK] was discussed, Simic said that the Yugoslav standpoints  were clear but not so inflexible that they could prevent a  normalization of relations.    The issue of Krajina is very sensitive but the RSK is a  political reality and must be respected, Simic stressed, and  went on to say that the current situation did not suit Zagreb  but an aggressive resolution of the situation would suit Zagreb  even less.</p>

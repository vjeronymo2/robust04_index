			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Washington warns EC with sanctions deadline THE US yesterday set January 1 next year as a deadline for sanctions to take effect against the EC unless agreement is reached to bar discrimination in procurement by government-owned telecommunications and electrical utilities. Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, revealed the deadline while announcing that South Korea has agreed to open key sectors of its telecommunications market to foreign goods and services. Korea has agreed to a number of liberalisation steps, including one for value-added telecommunications services and elimination of investment restrictions. Mrs Hills said some progress has been made in talks with the EC over telecommunications, including the breaking of the monopoly on terminal equipment and opening up the value-added services markets of the member states. But 'barriers remain, particularly in the government equipment market and in a possibly restrictive regulatory regime for services'. Specifically, she cited the EC's 'utilities directive' effective on January 1, requiring EC utilities to favour EC goods and services. 'The directive would replace the informal barriers US firms now face in some EC markets with official discrimination in all EC utilities markets,' Mrs Hills said. She noted the proposed new Gatt Government Procurement Code would mean waiving discriminatory provisions of the utilities directive. The negotiations 'leave us hopeful that the EC will, in advance of January 1, 1993, waive the discriminatory provisions of its Utilities Directive'.</p>

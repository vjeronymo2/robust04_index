			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Italy holds out on steel plan ITALY was last night resisting attempts to reach an overall agreement on the restructuring of the European Union's state-owned steel producers. Mr Paolo Savona, the Italian industry minister, rejected a compromise on subsidies and capacity cuts at Ilva, the loss-making state steelmaker, put forward by the European Commission at a meeting of EU industry ministers in Brussels. The Commission has asked ministers to give their political blessing to Ecu6.8bn (Pounds 5.18bn) of subsidies to six companies - in Italy, east Germany, Spain and Portugal - in exchange for a total of 5.5m tonnes of capacity cuts. Final agreement on the subsidy plans must be unanimous. Political accord would provide the central plank of a wide-ranging EU programme to support the ailing west European steel industry, which is suffering from recession and over-capacity. In the absence of a deal, private EU steelmakers made clear yesterday they were not prepared to produce their own proposals to reduce capacity by a further 10.5m tonnes. They are afraid that state-owned steelmakers will continue to distort the depressed market with subsidised steel. Mr Savona denied Italy was being inflexible. He said there was 'still a little margin to strike a deal'. Workers at the Italian state-owned steel works in Taranto, Europe's largest, yesterday staged a short strike to highlight the threat to jobs posed by the proposed capacity cuts. German and Commission officials said yesterday they were pessimistic about the chances of breaking Italy's veto. Instead, they said they hoped the 11 other EU industry ministers would agree separately on state aid for the Spanish, east German and Portuguese state-owned steel industries, putting more pressure on the Italians. However, other national officials cast doubt on the possibility of even a partial agreement. A loose coalition of Britain, Denmark, Luxembourg and France was still opposed yesterday to elements of the east German and Spanish plans. Mr Tim Sainsbury, British industry minister, said that 'no agreement would be better than a bad agreement'. Meanwhile, the Treuhand privatisation agency, which is handling the sale of Ekostahl, the east German steel producer, will today set a deadline of Tuesday for Riva, the Italian steelmaker, to provide more information on prospects for a new hot rolling mill, including potential profitability.</p>

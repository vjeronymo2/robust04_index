			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Sport (Cricket): The sublime mystery play - The English cricket season is still some way off. But Teresa McLean has ambitions. Anxious to spread understanding of the game into Europe's furthest nooks and crannies, she has addressed herself to cricket's fundamental principles, particles and mysteries A MYSTERY is a 'hidden or inexplicable matter' (Concise Oxford Dictionary), so it would seem that attempting to explain one is a waste of time. But a mystery of the highest order is a 'religious truth divinely revealed, especially one beyond human reason,' which makes an attempted explanation of cricket irresistible. The more one knows about cricket the more mysterious it becomes; the more mysterious, the more sublime. And delicious. Take bowling. Batting and bowling are the twin pillars of cricket, as of all bat and ball games. So far, so simple. But the sunshine is always speckled in Yorkshire and in cricket the player with the ball can only bowl, not throw it, to the batsman. This is one of the game's fundamental principles. The bowler must hurl the hard, heavy, cork, twine-wound, leather-bound, seam-stitched, red-dyed ball at the batsman without straightening his arm in the hurl. If he does straighten his arm, he has thrown instead of bowled, something any old fool could do, and dishonoured the game. The umpire (of whom more later) calls no-ball, which disallows that hurl and gives the batting team a free penalty point, known as a run, because most of the time batsmen have to run up and down to get them. The side with the most runs wins, but there are nobler and more energetic ways of getting them than through the bowler's transgressions. While the bowling arm must stay straight, by the way, the wrist may straighten, twiddle or turn as it pleases. Indeed, such achievements are the pride of spinning skill. Wrist or finger spinners are so called because they spin the ball, but they may well spin their wrists or fingers in the process. The more subtleties the better in perfecting such triumphs as 'the unnatural trouble of screwing the ball out of the back of the hand over a cocked wrist,' to quote one writer, Donald Woods, on Abdul Qadir's bowling. Spin bowling is one of cricket's many inducements to poetic - any way, elaborate - reporting, though its technical language is the poetry of reticence. Good spinners contrive to make the ball 'stop,' 'come back,' 'stand still,' 'hang,' 'turn,' 'float' or even 'move'. What sweeter compliments for spin than an expert commentator declaring: 'That one moved]' England's damp and temperate climate produces more medium pace than spin bowlers, while the West Indies produce speed. Speedy no-balls are common, but throwing is rare, almost exotic, among them; most are pedestrian. Last summer, when the West Indies visited England, an abundance of penalty runs was given away by bowlers pounding in to bowl at cowering, praying batsmen and, as they did so, putting a front foot slightly over the line painted at the end of the wicket (batting strip), the bowler's and batsman's deadline. This is bowling from too near the victim, which is cheating. A no-ball is called. There is a simple, conservationist logic behind these no-ball laws. The mystery lies in their enforcement. It is in the hands of an umpire, the game's divine force of decision and judgment. 'Hard is the lot of the arbitrator,' lamented The Field magazine in 1954, writing about umpires, 'for he can seldom please both sides. He can only suffer criticism with dignity, repudiation with philosophy.' Quite so. It is to the umpire that appeals for the dismissal (removal, getting out - different expressions, same deathly event) of batsmen must be made. Each team has 11 players, some of them bowlers, some batsmen, all liable to bowling and batting service in their team's hour of need, all capable of appealing for an opponent's dismissal. In cricket, an appeal must be made before a decision is made, not after it. The batsmen bat two at a time, one at each end. Their aim is to score more runs than their opponents. When a batsman hits the ball well he runs up to the other end of the wicket, as does his partner at the other end, running in the opposite direction. He scores one run for every length he runs before a fielder throws the ball in to the stumps (three close-standing sticks 28 inches tall), which he has been defending with his bat from the bowler's balls. These are bowled one after another in sets of six, known as overs. At the end of an over, another bowler starts another over at the other end. There are stumps at both ends. The batsman scores four runs every time he hits a ball off the field of play and six every time he hits a ball off the field without a bounce. Bowlers do not like being hit for six. It provokes fiercer efforts to bowl the batsman out - knock one or both of the bails (little sticks 4 3/8 inches long) off the top of the stumps, where they lie in a shallow groove, defying the bowler to displace them. Cricket is not a metric game. Its measurements abound in pounds and ounces, feet, inches and yards. The wicket is 22 yards long. When a batsman is out, he goes off. Sometimes the walk off the field of play can seem a long and humiliating one to a batsman who is going off. But it makes life easier for the umpire. Anyone can see when a batsman has been bowled; no appeal is necessary. The same is usually true when a batsman is caught or finds himself trapped in one of the more spectacular, bucolic means of self-dismissal, such as treading on his own stumps or hitting his own bails off. For the most part, however, many are the methods and marvels of dismissal, and the umpire must pass judgment on them all. They are too many and too complicated to describe, but mention must be made of the most common and most controversial: lbw (leg before wicket), an umpire's nightmare. The batsman, reasonably enough, stands in front of the stumps he is defending, but if a ball is bowled which hits his legs on its way to hitting the stumps, he is out. The umpire signals this by putting his first finger in the air. Leg-before decisions range from the easy (plum) to the mysterious tinged with the mystical. In March 1903 the Rev Jones of Crowborough, Sussex, was inspired by the impenetrabilities of lbw variations to preach a sermon on 'lbw, a parable of the cricket field,' text Matthew XIII, 34. In case things do start to look simple, there are two umpires in each game, one at the bowler's end, between him and the stumps; one at the batsman's end, on the same side as his legs but some distance away, chatting to the fielders out at grass. This position is known as square leg. All fielding positions and batting shots side-ways on to the stumps are square, just as all those almost in line with the stumps are fine. The close-catching fielder with padded gloves, breathing down the batsman's neck, is the wicket-keeper and is too straight to be fine. Other fielders very near the stumps but not fine are silly; fielders far out towards the boundary are deep or long; those not far out are close or short; those on the leg side are on the on side; those on the bat side are on the off side. Hence positions like deep square leg and silly mid-off. You could almost call it poetry in motion, except that most cricketers spend so little time in motion. The main pre-occupation of the field of play is when will it be time for a beer? First-class matches start half-way through the morning, stop for lunch and again for tea, then stop for the day in the early evening. Test matches, which decide the might of nations, last for five days and usually end in a draw. Cricket is a wondrous game, better loved than studied.</p>

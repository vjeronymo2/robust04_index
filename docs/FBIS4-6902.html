			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian Foreign Minister, Mr. Zlenko, talked to a  press conference in Hanoi on Wednesday that his country could  learn from Vietnam's economic experience. Here is Mr. Zlenko at  the presss conference:    [Begin Zlenko recording in Russian fading into Vietnamese  translation] This is the first visit to Vietnam by a Ukrainian  foreign minister since the Republic separated from the former  USSR. In its foreign policy, Ukraine attached great importance  to relations with countries in Asia and the Pacific, in which  Vietnam plays an important role. Ukraine has been confronted  with numerous difficulties in its economic reform when shifting  to a market economy. Production has declined, information  increased, and people's life degraded. In this situation,  Ukraine needs to find new trade partners, especially restoring  relations with traditional clients such as Vietnam.    According to economics, Asia-Pacific has been a dynamic and  promising region of the 20th century. Ukraine admires the  achievements of the Vietnamese people in economic reform while  maintaining political stability. It is good for Ukraine to  learn from the experience of Vietnam and other countries in the  region.    The Ukrainian foreign minister said: He had talks with his  Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Manh Cam and met with Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet. The two sides agreed to continue their  friendship and bilateral comprehensive cooperation in which  Ukraine can develop its potentials in engineering, oil, and gas  exploitation, food processing, and construction.    The two sides also agreed to continue the process for  signing  agrements on encouragement and protection of investments, and  avoidance of double taxation which will serve as a legal  foundation for new bilateral relations to bear fruits.    The Ukrainian foreign minister also said Prime Minister Vo  Van Kiet would visit Ukraine in June this year and believed the  visit would be an important step for further development of  bilateral relations.    Speaking with newsmen on the situation in Bosnia, the  Ukrainian diplomat said: Ukraine wanted to solve the conflict  through peaceful negotiations. Ukraine was gravely concerned  about what had happened there would not only cause much losses  and sorrow for local people but also threaten to drag other  Balkan states into the conflict.    Ukraine hopes efforts by the world community, including  Russia, would soon peacefully solve the crisis. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Bo Yibo dated 25 May and entitled "Make Every </F> Effort To Promote Both Material and Spiritual Civilization"]    [Text] Beijing, 17 Jun (XINHUA) -- The "Anthology of  Education in Professional Ethics in China" will soon be  available. In asking me to write a preface for the anthology,  its chief editor said:    "The Chinese Society for the Study of Cultural and Economic  Development Along the Huang He, the Managerial Science Research  Institute, and the Xinhua Publishing House have organized  scholars and experts in various professions to jointly compile  the `Anthology of Education in Professional Ethics in China' by  -- in light of the norms of professional ethics in their  respective fields and under the current conditions of developing  a socialist market economy -- elaborating on the principles,  content, styles, and methods of vocational ethics education in  order to make vocational ethics education more methodical and  standardized. Such books are useful in laying a foundation for  raising the entire nation's vocational ethics standards and for  promoting socialist spiritual civilization, in clarifying and  surmounting the ideological confusion created by  ultra-individualism and money worship, in improving the  competence of the ranks of the workers and staff, and in  resisting and overcoming unhealthy practices in various  industries, trades, and professions."    It is my belief that vocational ethics education can be  carried out well and effectively only when it is integrated as  an essential part of socialist spiritual civilization.    I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to write  this preface to say a few words about my personal views on the  relationship between the two civilizations.    With the founding of New China, the CPC became the party in  power, and it bore upon its shoulders the heavy responsibility  of promoting the two civilizations. Under the leadership of the  CPC Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the party as a whole  carried out the party's three important styles of work  (integrating theory with practice, practicing criticism and  self-criticism, and forging close ties with the masses); firmly  bore in mind the party's purpose of serving the people  wholeheartedly; was modest and prudent, guarded against  arrogance and rashness, worked hard, observed discipline, and  expended great efforts in learning how to run the economy,  administer state affairs, and ensure the nation's security.  Within a few years, we were able to recover from the wounds of  the war, we revived the national economy, and we implemented  rather successfully the first Five-Year Plan and the remolding  of socialism, thus bringing about a situation characterized by  thriving economic development, an improvement in people's lives,  and a clean and honest party style and general standards of  social conduct. Comparing the new society with the old one,  people became aware that only socialism could save China. Aside  from the correct line, the great successes achieved in the  construction of two civilizations can also be attributed to a  group of party cadres who, in the prime of their lives, had  undergone various tests and had set an example of correctly  carrying out and executing the party's correct line.    Upon the basic completion of its socialist transformation,  China has entered a period of full socialist construction. When  we say full, this naturally covers the building of both material  and spiritual civilization. The policy decision made by the  Eighth CPC National Congress has been correct, in holding that  socialism has been basically established in China; and that  despite the continued existence of class struggle and the need  for further strengthening the people's democratic dictatorship,  the nation's principal contradiction is no longer between the  working and the capitalist classes but rather between the  people's urge for rapid economic and cultural development and  the current economic and cultural conditions that fail to  satisfy the people's needs. The principal missions of the  people throughout the country are to concentrate their strength  for the development of social productive forces, to realize the  state's industrialization programs, and to gradually satisfy the  people's ever-increasing economic and cultural needs. However,  due to insufficient ideological preparedness for all-around  socialist construction -- particularly the emergence of a  relapse concerning the understanding of the principal  contradiction -- and the "leftist" mistake we have committed, we  have been unable to persist in the correct line set by the  Eighth CPC National Congress. Although the party intended to  focus its attention on economic development, the approach was  wrong. While the people were zealous for construction, the  party's guiding principles have not been in line with the  objective economic law, thus resulting in the blunders of the  "Great Leap Forward" and the "People's Commune," which  frustrated the building of the two civilizations. After the  party discovered its flaws and after a five-year adjustment  period, China managed to regain its lease on life concerning the  national economy, with encouraging results being achieved in the  building of spiritual civilization. Jiao Yulu, Lei Feng, and  Wang Jinxi were typical advanced models who sprung up during  this period. Unfortunately, the party has abandoned its central  task of economic construction and has clung for a long period to  the wrong guiding principle of "taking class struggle as the key  link," which subsequently caused the decade-long civil strife of  the "Great Cultural Revolution" and thus the grievous  devastation of the building of the two civilizations.    The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee  made a great historic turn by resolutely terminating the use of  the wrong slogan of "taking class struggle as the key link" --  which was not suitable for a socialist society and which ran  totally counter to China's actual state conditions -- and by  making a timely strategic policy decision to divert the party's  central task to the socialist modernization drive. As reform  and opening up went deeper, Comrade Deng Xiaoping profoundly  pointed out: "The Essence of socialism is to emancipate and  develop the productive forces, eliminate exploitation, and  remove polarization for the final attainment of common  prosperity." "Upholding reform and opening up is a move that  will determine China's fate." Making sure that reform and  opening up will be carried out in a healthy manner, he also put  forward the packaged principle of "being firm in attending to  both material progress and cultural and ideological progress."  Under the guidance of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, we have scored successes that have become the  focus of world attention. There is no denying the fact that  during the new-old transition process, we did made mistakes on  the question of precedence, amid calls for improvements in such  aspects as the party and social atmospheres. Our party is taking  measures to solve these problems. With efforts in party  building being intensified, with the fundamental improvement,  enhancement, and perfection of the party's democratic centralism  for a genuine application in daily life; with the legal system  being improved to such a level that there are sufficient laws  for us to follow, with the anticorruption drive going deeper,  and with the gradual establishment of a socialist market  economic order, all these problems are solvable. Of course, we  need time to solve these problems once and for all. As long as  long as we carry out our work unswervingly and succeed in  finding ways and reaching a consensus, I think that these  problems may -- in fact, must -- be solved within three to five  years.    From a brief account of the historical process mentioned  above, we can reach a common understanding on the following two  points: 1) The extent of the achievements scored by us in  building the two civilizations depends, first of all, on whether  the party's line is correct or not. If the line is correct, our  achievements will be great; if the line is not on the right  track, our achievements will be small or even incline to the  opposite direction. The extent of our achievements also depends  on whether our party organizations at all levels can correctly  implement the party's line as well as a series of principles and  policies it has adopted. The level of understanding gained by  cadres, their ability to have the overall situation well in  hand, and whether they really implement the party's line,  principles, and policies in handling concrete tasks and play an  exemplary role will affect, to a great extent, the success of  the building of the two civilizations. Therefore, arming the  whole party with the theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, enhancing the consciousness of all comrades of  the party concerning the implementation of the party's basic  line -- "one central task and two basic points," and adhering to  the principle of grasping two links at the same time and of  taking a tough stand on both become a key aspect of our endeavor  to successfully build the two civilizations. 2) We must persist  in paying equal attention to building the two civilizations at  the same time. Not a single one of the two civilizations can be  dispensed with. They interact with and promote each other. The  building of material civilization provides a strong material  basis for the building of socialist spiritual civilization.  "Poverty is not socialism." "Socialism must get rid of  poverty." It is very hard to imagine that we can successfully  build a socialist spiritual civilization if we do not develop  the economy or get rid of poverty and backwardness or if we  deviate from an economic basis. Of course, neither do we  approve of the concept that spiritual civilization will be good  naturally when the economy is developed. With regard to  spiritual civilization, what counts is the effort to build it.  If the building of spiritual civilization is carried out  successfully, this will in turn provide a spiritual driving  force as well as support in terms of intellectual resources for  the building of material civilization and an ideological  guarantee for the correct orientation of its development. The  two are organically integrated in the practice of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics.    Recently, the central authorities have repeatedly stressed:  "Judging by the overall situation of reform, opening up, and  modernization in China, the crux of the matter lies in properly  handling the relationships between reform, development, and  stability." I think that these six [figure as received] Chinese  characters -- reform, development, and stability -- are very  profoundly expounded because they also summarize the dialectic  materialist internal relationship between the building of  spiritual civilization and that of material civilization. The  purpose of reform is to achieve development, but if we want to  achieve development very satisfactorily, we must have a stable  social environment. An organic integration between reform,  development, and stability will enable the three to promote one  another. It includes the building of both material civilization  and spiritual civilization.    Professional ethics education is an aspect that ought to be  included in the building of socialist spiritual civilization and  an indispensable condition for establishing a socialist market  economic order. "The Resolution of the CPC Central Committee on  the Guiding Principle for the Building of Socialist Spiritual  Civilization" pointed out: "We must make vigorous efforts to  promote professional ethics in all trades and professions."  Promoting professional ethics becomes particularly conspicuous  and important in the process of shifting from the traditional  planned economic system to a socialist market economic system.    High standards for professional ethics become increasingly  necessary as a new socialist market economic system is gradually  established and as socialist laws and regulations are gradually  amplified. We are entirely capable of attaining these high  standards because we have Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought as  our guidance, because we have accumulated both positive and  negative experience in more than four decades after the founding  of the People's Republic, and because we have a socialist  system, the fine traditions of the party, and the traditional  virtues of the Chinese nation. All these are our strong points.  Meanwhile, we must also draw lessons from the Western  countries' advanced experience in management and their  successful employment of professional ethics education. While  making unremitting efforts to successfully promote economic  construction, we must pay close attention to successfully  building spiritual civilization, and we must vigorously advocate  regular education in and the study of professional ethics among  all trades and professions in a bid to enable all citizens to  live up to a code of conduct compatible with rapid social  development, to conscientiously abide by their respective  trades' and professions' standards of professional ethics, and  to become a new generation of well-educated, well-disciplined  people imbued with lofty ideals and moral values. If everyone  in all trades and professions can "start cultivating  professional ethics for himself or herself" to enable a social  custom under which everyone observes professional ethics to take  shape, the general mood of society will surely improve, we shall  certainly be able to promote the development of social  productive forces, and the overall quality of our entire nation  will surely be enhanced.</p>

			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Former Olympic diver Bruce Kimball's insurance companies have reached "an  agreement in principle" to pay a total of $1.3 million to five victims of the  car accident that killed two teen-agers and injured six others last August,  Kimball's attorney, James A. Murman, said.  </P> <P> Word of the agreement came a week before Kimball plans to ask a judge to reduce  his 17-year prison sentence for drunk-driving manslaughter. Kimball, 25, is  seeking a term of less than 10 years, which could mean a transfer out of  maximum-security Tomoka Correctional Institution.  </P></p>

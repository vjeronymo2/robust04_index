			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Russia's new government Russia's Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin insists that the new government 'will not retreat from the course of continuing and deepening reform'. These remarks come under the heading of disinformation, which is what Mr Clinton embraced during his visit to Moscow last week. Coherent reform is not what the new government will provide. Nor will it supply coherent reaction. It offers the middle course of chaos. The only reformist in a prominent position will be Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation. An isolated reformer in a government dominated by bosses from the military-industrial complex, he is unlikely to achieve much. Yegor Gaidar and Boris Fyodorov are both gone. Securely in place, however, are such old apparatchiks as first deputy prime minister, Oleg Soskovets, and central bank chairman, Viktor Gerashchenko, not to mention the prime minister. These are far from the worst people available. They are not militant xenophobes, for example. But they lack any coherent programme. At best, they will manage decay. At worst, they will bring inflationary disaster. Mr Yeltsin may have dissolved the old parliament, but he has adopted its policies. Meanwhile, outright reactionaries wait in the wings. The old Soviet Union based its system of governance on force and fraud. Deprived of force, the new government intends to fall back on fraud. Leaders of a country whose currency has lost 90 per cent of its value in the past year say that lower inflation is no priority. It is showing that intention by letting two men with reputations in the west, Mr Gaidar and Mr Fyodorov, depart. No wonder the rouble is plummeting on the foreign exchanges. Hyperinflation is looming. Gangsters' fortunes Hyperinflation is what Mr Zhirinovsky and his ilk must be praying for. Normal economic life, let alone the rapid expansion of socially efficient new business, would be impossible. Ordinary people on fixed incomes would starve. Traders, speculators and gangsters would make fortunes. The government would be driven to introduce comprehensive price controls. Queues would stretch around every block, and traders, gangsters, minorities, the government and the president would all bear the blame for the chaos. Serious reformers have lost this battle and may have lost the war. Their only hope is to oppose, explaining to the Russian people why credit expansion will bring not the increases in output promised by Mr Gerashchenko, but the inflation they detest. Unfortunately, they have been sabotaged in this even by supposed western friends. It has been painful to hear Strobe Talbot and Albert Gore, for example, mouth ignorant criticisms of Russia's alleged shock therapy. Anyone who believes that Russia's economy suffers from that, rather than the opposite, knows nothing of events over the past eight years and little of experience elsewhere either. Possible collapse Now the west will have to tell the Russian president why it cannot support the programme on offer. It will have to work out its response to a possible collapse of Mr Yeltsin's power. Last but not least, the west must learn from its mistakes. Maybe, though only maybe, there will be another chance. The west must then have in place an organisation with the skills and the money needed to engage seriously with a reforming government. The purpose of the money would, above all, be to finance the budget without reliance on the printing press. Some in the west will respond that the money is either unavailable or would make no difference. Both replies are silly. The sums required are a small fraction of the hundreds of billions of dollars spent every year, for decades, on defence against the former Soviet Union. Money would also show the Russian people that the west does care, that it backs the reformers in deeds, as well as words, and that it wants to alleviate their arduous transition. The failure of western leaders to engage seriously with Russian reformers on the grounds that it would either be too costly or too difficult was a mistake that could well prove a tragedy. Penny wise, but pound foolish, leaders of the west may have committed a mistake comparable to the Versailles treaty.</p>

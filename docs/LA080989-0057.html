			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> FORCE SHRIMPERS TO EQUIP NET WITH TURTLE PROTECTOR DEVICES, JUDGE URGED  </P> <P> The National Wildlife Federation on Tuesday asked a federal judge to force the  Commerce Department to require Gulf Coast shrimpers to equip their nets with  turtle excluder devices.  </P> <P> The department's temporary new regulations limiting trawl times do not protect  endangered sea turtles as the department claims, the federation argued.  </P> <P> The federation said it has learned that Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher  has data from National Marine Fisheries Service scientists that demonstrates  the mortality rate from a 105-minute tow time is more than four times greater  than what the secretary has admitted.  </P> <P> Mosbacher on Monday announced regulations requiring shrimpers to lift their  nets every 105 minutes to let any captured turtles escape.  </P> <P> "A recent report from the team of scientists charged with managing recovery  efforts for the severely endangered Kemp's Ridley sea turtle states  unequivocally that the species is physiologically unable to withstand tow times  in lieu of required (excluder) use," the federation said in its petition to  U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan.  </P> <P> Hogan is overseeing the federation's legal attack on Mosbacher's failure to  require excluder devices.  </P> <P> Hogan last week ordered Mosbacher to adopt regulations by Monday to protect sea  turtles from drowning in shrimpers' nets.  </P> <P> A new federal law requires shrimpers to use excluder devices -- big boxes  attached to nets with hinged sides that turtles can swim through -- unless the  secretary of commerce has good reason to require other protective measures.  </P> <P> The trawling regulation is to last only until Sept. 7 while the department  solicits comment on what permanent regulations to adopt "in light of  conservation needs of sea turtle populations and the economics of the shrimp  fishing industry."  </P></p>

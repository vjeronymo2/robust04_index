As homage to Roman Dmowski, about 120 PWN supporters lit  lamps and laid red and white carnations at the Tomb of the  Unknown Soldier in Jan Matejko Square. Under the slogans  "Boleslaw Tejkowski for Polish president", "Nationalists not  fascists", "Romanians go home", and "Germans and Jews get out of  Polish Silesia", the demonstrators marched along the streets of  the city toward Market Square, where they burned the flags.    B. Tejkowski, the PWN chairman, told the rally and Cracow  residents gathered in Market Square that Poland's attempts to  join the European Union and President Walesa's intention to  invite NATO armies to our garrisons constitute the greatest  dangers for Poland at the moment.    The police, who did not issue an official permit to the PWN  for the rally, did not intervene.</p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Decline in footwear spending deepens to 'slump' SALES OF footwear in Britain have declined sharply in the past year despite signs of an upturn in overall consumer spending, the British Footwear Manufacturers Federation said yesterday. Spending fell Pounds 198.7m - a 4 per cent drop - in the 12 months to July. The federation said there had been an 'across-the-board slump' with retailers selling 19.3m fewer pairs of shoes, boots and slippers. The downturn represented a 7.6 per cent fall in volume sales, it added. Figures compiled for the federation show a further decline in the first half of the year with volume sales down by 8.6 per cent. In July, the worst month for the sector, sales of men's footwear declined 22 per cent and women's 10.2 per cent. Weakening demand has forced employers to cut the total workforce by 6.2 per cent to 36,000, although the federation said this trend was likely to be reversed in forthcoming months. The main impact of the downturn appears to have been felt by overseas manufacturers who saw direct exports to the UK decline by 18 per cent in the 12 months to July. Companies based in the Far East, which have the lion's share of the export market to Britain - Pounds 217.8m out of a total of Pounds 299m  - saw volume sales fall by 19 per cent. Worst affected was Hong Kong where sales fell by 70 per cent. Sterling devaluation, meanwhile, helped UK manufacturers offset poor demand at home by increasing exports by 17 per cent. Exports of children's footwear showed the strongest growth, up 92 per cent. While welcoming the increase in overseas orders, the federation said export production represented only about 10 per cent of total output.</p>

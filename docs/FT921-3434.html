			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Letter: Autogas brings some relief to Athens in battle against smog Sir, In 'Greeks battle to defeat the nefos' (Business and the Environment, March 11) Kerin Hope discusses the pollution problems in Athens as part of your urban air pollution series. What she fails to mention is that in order to alleviate pollution problems, the government actively encourages the use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPGas) as an automotive fuel (Autogas). As a result, almost all taxis in Athens now run on Autogas. In fact, when the city is suffering from a particularly bad bout of smog, road vehicles not fuelled by Autogas are temporarily banned. Autogas is used in niche areas in many countries apart from Greece to help lower vehicle emissions in urban centres. As in Athens, most taxis in Tokyo run on Autogas as a result of government encouragement and in the US some 3m vehicles are fuelled by it. In the Netherlands, Autogas comprises some 17 per cent of all automotive fuels, supported by the government's introduction of zero duty rate. The technology for Autogas conversion of vehicle engines has been around for many years and the technology continues worldwide to keep pace with newly improved vehicle engine developments. The fuel is clean and highly efficient and it can make a useful contribution towards reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The fuel also has the advantage that it cuts down considerably on carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. Unfortunately, UK excise duty does not encourage the use of LPGas, in spite of its proven environmental advantages.

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Rothschild group to open office in Mexico THE ROTHSCHILD group of the UK has been given permission to open a financial advisory company in Mexico, making it the first foreign investment bank to win such authority. The holding company of NM Rothschild, with the Chilean bank BICE, and Mexican partners, have been granted authorisation to open Rothschild Mexico, a financial boutique that will advise Mexican companies on corporate finance issues, such as mergers and acquisitions, privatisations, project finance, and international equity offerings. Under Mexican law foreigners cannot own a bank or brokerage, although this will be changed when and if the North American Free Trade Agreement is implemented. Until now foreign investment banks, like Rothschild, have had to make do with representative offices, from which they can offer off-shore the full range of corporate finance advice, but cannot be incorporated under Mexican law. Rothschild's new status, says Mr Charles Alexander, the head of Latin America for NM Rothschild, would make a colossal difference. 'We will be able to compete in Mexico without worrying about the regulatory environment,' he said. The company expects to expand on-shore business significantly in Mexico as a result. The corporate finance business in Mexico is booming, as companies seek foreign capital and foreign partners to improve competitiveness before the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement comes into force. So far American banks - such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs - have won the lion's share of the business.</p>

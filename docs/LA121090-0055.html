			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SALES OF MAIL-ORDER EDIBLES ARE MUSHROOMING;  </P> <P> FOOD: MANY CALIFORNIA FIRMS ARE GETTING A SLICE OF THE $1.2-BILLION MARKET,  WHICH IS BUSIEST DURING THE HOLIDAYS. OVERNIGHT DELIVERY SERVICE HAS HELPED.  </P> <P> 'Tis the season for mail-order giving, and more of the gifts crisscrossing the  nation make for a transportable feast.  </P> <P> Fruit in the mail is nothing new, but how about six pints of assorted gelato  packed in dry ice? It's yours, if someone doesn't mind paying $10 a pint to get  it to you.  </P> <P> And forget the mundane fruitcake. Select instead a bouquet of porcini  mushrooms, a pair of smoked quail or a basket of prickly pears.  </P> <P> The 3,600 companies that tempt the palate with mail-order edibles are competing  for the $1.2 billion that Americans are expected to spend on food orders this  year, according to a recent study by the New York market research firm  FIND-SVP.  </P> <P> Growing at an annual rate of about 10%, sales of mail-order foods are likely to  total more than $3 billion by 2000, FIND-SVP said.  </P> <P> Business whips into a frenzy during the final quarter, with some mail-order  companies doing virtually all their shipping between September and January.  Entire 747 jets have been stuffed with nothing but thousands of pounds of  holiday pears from Harry and David.  </P> <P> Based in Medford, Ore., Harry and David has sales of more than $120 million,  making it perhaps the largest mail-order food company in the nation.  </P> <P> FIND-SVP says the top 10 food-by-mail companies control 45% of the market.  About 3,000 companies are characterized as mom-and-pop operations, with sales  less than $50,000 a year.  </P> <P> Although the vast majority of food moves by ground transportation, most of the  industry's growth is in overnight and two-day delivery services, which can  guarantee that a delicate or perishable item arrives intact.  </P> <P> Clambake Celebrations of Cape Cod, Mass., for example, can promise a customer  in Albuquerque, N.M., that she will have lobster, mussels and a few ears of  corn -- all packed in seaweed -- steaming on the stove less than 48 hours after  phoning in the order. The cost: $119.95 for two.  </P> <P> San Francisco's Gelato Classico Italian Ice Cream is just begining to offer its  products by mail. Six pints -- a minimum order at $59.95 -- are packaged in dry  ice in a foam container much like a picnic cooler.  </P> <P> Consultant Jay Walker, who heads Ridgefield, Conn.-based Catalog Media Corp.,  said that though food-by-mail has been big business for a long time, "overnight  delivery . . . allowed a freshness perception for millions of people who didn't  believe they could get (food) fresh in the mail. And it made sure food can be  given as a gift reliably."  </P> <P> Federal Express will tell you that it has been a major boost to the food  industry.  </P> <P> "Our business . . . allows them to extend their business season right up to  Dec. 21," said spokesman David Brandon. "If you do 80% of your business in one  or two months of the year and can extend that selling season by just two weeks,  it's a tremendous boost."  </P> <P> Companies with very narrow product lines can stay in business because they  cater to a national -- rather than local -- clientele. Franklin Foods of North  Franklin, Conn., for example, sells only exotic mushrooms such as Polish cepes,  shiitakes and porcinis. Smithfield, Va.-based Fin 'N Feather will put a smoked  pheasant buffet on your table.  </P> <P> Mr. Spear Inc. of Stockton has cultivated a list of 25,000 fans of its colossal  asparagus, its sole product. "It's an alternative to flowers," said President  Chip Arnett.  </P> <P> His super-premium asparagus, which has been served at the White House, simply  is "not in sufficient enough quantities to make it available from a retail  standpoint," he said.  </P> <P> Consultant Walker believes that the food-by-mail business is "countercyclical"  to the economy -- that is, as the recession deepens, business is likely to  increase.  </P> <P> Consumers who feel pinched for cash typically "trade down" when it comes to  buying gifts, and food is a popular alternative because it has "no comparative  market price," Walker said. "You don't know if a dozen apples from an orchard  in Oregon is a $20 gift or a $40 gift," he said.  </P> <P> Perusing catalogues in the coziness of one's own home and ordering with the  mere push of telephone buttons has become a recreational pastime of sorts for  many Americans.  </P> <P> "People are sitting home, and they're bored, and so they pick up the phone and  buy on a credit card," said Debbie Cohen, a national saleswoman for Melissa's  World Variety Produce Inc., a Los Angeles company that specializes in shipping  exotic produce such as purple potatoes, elephant garlic and prickly pears.  </P> <P> Though consumers who buy foods through the mail make up less than 2% of the  population, they are an affluent lot willing to pay more for convenience and a  guarantee of quality.  </P> <P> A pint of Gelato Classico costs just $3.95 in one of the company's 32 shops,  but the minimum six-pint mail order commands a $36 shipping charge. Too  extravagant to buy for yourself, perhaps, but an exquisite gift to give.  </P> <P> The mail-order business does have its limitations.  </P> <P> Identifying customers can be costly, and it is difficult to adapt quickly to  changes in consumer taste. A company that must put together its Christmas  catalogue by August can't suddenly decide to replace its pecan pie if  cranberries become the rage.  </P> <P> In addition, the threat of higher postal rates always looms large. Third-class  postage, the rate for most catalogues, has increased more than 350% since 1970,  and the U.S. Postal Service plans another rate hike for February.  </P> <P> Mail-order companies are being pressed to collect sales taxes on a higher  proportion of their sales, forcing them to compete harder against local  retailers.  </P> <P> Finally, because the food business is seasonal, some companies actually are  forced to shut down during spring and summer. Others try to round out their  offerings with other products. Harry and David, for example, has a sister  company called Jackson and Perkins, a gardening and flower concern, which helps  smooth out sales through the year.  </P></p>

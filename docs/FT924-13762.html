			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Union fears lack of strike support SENIOR NUM officials conceded yesterday that they might not win a ballot on industrial action to fight the pit closures. With at least 12 months of coal stocks at power stations, the amount of leverage a strike could apply is minimal. Some argue that action would at least disrupt the privatisation process of what is left of the industry, but for that very reason the miners in pits that will survive are unlikely to back a strike call. Even though the shock and anger were widespread, it will not be enough to bury the enmity between the Yorkshire-based National Union of Mineworkers, which represents the majority of miners, and the Nottinghamshire-based Union of Democratic Mineworkers, which was formed after the 1984-85 miners' strike. The UDM, which worked through the 1984-85 strike, and which received public backing from Conservative ministers for its employee buy-out proposals, that has the most reason to feel let down by the closures. Some UDM officials such as Mr Neil Greatrex, president of the union's Nottinghamshire area, are calling - like the NUM - for industrial action. But the UDM's main approach is to try to challenge the government in the courts, either through European Community competition law or through contesting the abandonment of the colliery review procedure. That procedure was strengthened in the 1984-85 strike to persuade Nacods, the supervisors' union, not to join the strike. Mr Peter McNestry, Nacods general secretary, said yesterday that he was considering legal action to reinstate the procedure and at least slow down the closures. The NUM, which still represents about two thirds of miners, will almost certainly back industrial action tomorrow. British Coal says: 'Industrial action would result in the withdrawal of all ex-gratia redundancy payments'. Mr Ken Capstick, vice-chairman of the Yorkshire area NUM, said this was the 'Alamo' for the industry, and argued that action would at least 'raise the temperature' and draw attention to the unions' case for keeping a competitive coal industry. But a strike may not seem attractive to many young miners. The average age is now 32 so that few would be old enough to qualify for the maximum redundancy pay-off of Pounds 37,000. Equally, few will want to jeopardise the money coming their way. Also, Mr Arthur Scargill, the NUM leader, might negate some of the public sympathy for the miners if they took industrial action. Mr Ian Watts, president of the Yorkshire area of the NUM's white-collar section, disagreed. 'Arthur can be very inspiring. At the Labour conference he was one of the few people that filled the hall and got a thunderous reception, despite being so unpopular with the leadership,' he said. Mr Scargill does not come up for re-election until next year, so, come what may, he will be defending the NUM's Alamo.</p>

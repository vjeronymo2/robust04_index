			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> "Fine art has gotten so expensive that people are looking for another area to  invest in, and movies are a common denominator," said Camden House Auctioneers  President Barry Vilkin after a memorabilia auction held this weekend in Los  Angeles. Among the 80 costumes auctioned off were Dorothy's gingham pinafore  from the "The Wizard of Oz," which sold for $9,000, Rhett Butler's coat from  "Gone With the Wind," which brought $6,000, and James Cagney's satin shirt from  "Yankee Doodle Dandy," which sold for $4,500. Other items included police  badges worn by the Keystone Kops, Robert De Niro's boxing trunks from "Raging  Bull," dozens of animation celluloids and drawings from such early Disney films  as "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" and "Sleeping Beauty," and Julius Caesar's  throne from "Cleopatra." Two pair of scuffed black patent leather dance shoes  worn by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers went for $9,000. However, many of the  items in the sale failed to bring the hoped-for prices. A set backdrop of  eyeball images created by surrealist Salvador Dali for the dream sequence in  Alfred Hitchcock's 1945 "Spellbound" went for $10,000, half the minimum  estimated sale price.

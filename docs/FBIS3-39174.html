Correspondent Elli Triandafillou has the following  report:    [Triandafillou] Speaking upon his return at the airport,  Evert said he promoted the national positions during his  contacts. He called on all Greek politicians to follow his  example and visit foreign countries to help elevate the  country's prestige, which, he claimed, is at a very low level.  He also noted that his party's proposal for the signing of an  agreement guaranteeing peace and unchanged borders in the  Balkans is welcomed abroad. He added that the government should  undertake an initiative to implement this because this way  Turkey's expansionist plans in our region will be foiled. He  also stressed that domestic disputes among political parties  should not extend to foreign affairs and underlined that the  Greek presidency of the European Union should succeed.    Referring to the developments on the Skopje issue, the  official opposition leader repeated that the government made a  mistake in abandoning the negotiations within the UN framework.  Evert said that Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou's  clarification, that the prime minister's statement about ending  the dialogue with neighboring Skopje was a "rhetorical  statement" is ironic.    Responding to a question on remarks by Sotirios Kouvelas  [New  Democracy prominent deputy and former state minister] in which  he criticized New Democracy's opposition policy, Evert said he  will listen to all views, but made it clear that the final  decisions are up to him.    Evert will go to Paris in February to meet with French Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur. He also plans to meet German  Chancellor Helmut Kohl and British Prime Minister John Major.</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / World Trade News: EC threatens to counter-retaliate in subsidy dispute THE EUROPEAN Community has threatened to counter-retaliate against the US if Washington goes ahead with trade reprisals over EC oilseed subsidies, fuelling the increasingly bitter row between the world's biggest traders. At today's meeting of Gatt's governing council, the EC will offer the US negotiations on trade concessions in other areas to compensate for the sales lost by American soyabean producers under the oilseed subsidy regime. Washington has said it wants the subsidies dismantled. But indications were yesterday that the US may be willing at least to discuss compensation terms, thereby avoiding a head-on collision in the Gatt meeting. On June 9, Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, published a list of EC exports worth about Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1bn) a year, from which about Dollars 1bn-worth will be selected for imposition of prohibitive tariffs if the two sides cannot reach a negotiated agreement. A Gatt disputes panel has twice condemned the EC's oilseed subsidies, originally paid to processors and now paid to farmers, for violating a 1962 accord with the US under which oilseeds - soyabeans, rapeseed and sunflower seeds - enter the EC duty-free. The American Soyabean Association claims it has lost sales of Dollars 2bn a year as a result, though the US administration puts the figure nearer Dollars 1bn. Even so, it is the largest retaliatory package Washington has ever contemplated. EC officials said yesterday that Brussels would be justified in counter-retaliating against unilateral US reprisals, which are outlawed by Gatt. 'If one party goes outside Gatt, the other is not bound by Gatt rules either,' one senior official said. The disputes panel recommended speedy action by the EC either to dismantle the oilseed subsidies or negotiate compensating concessions, in the absence of which the US should be authorised to take reprisals. But if the US rejects an EC compensation offer, trading partners may be disinclined to sanction retaliation. Gatt officials say its legal system 'is being stretched to the limit' by the oilseeds case. Today's Gatt council meeting will hear a call by Costa Rica for consultations with the EC over a Brussels decision to extend quotas on bananas from Central America. Costa Rica, which says the decision breaches international fair trade rules, says it will take the case to a Gatt disputes panel if the decision is not rescinded. The council will also hear requests from Albania, Estonia, Moldova and Turkmenistan for Gatt observer status ahead of possible membership. Gatt officials say other CIS states have indicated their intention to apply for observer status; Slovenia has said it wants to open membership talks.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Industry (18): US research causes rethink on pay theory - Minimum wages / Edward Balls examines three studies Once the bugbear of free-market analysts, minimum wages are finally seeking intellectual respectability. Five years ago most economists would have agreed with the proposition that minimum wages cost jobs. But in recent years, a growing body of evidence has accumulated which, taken together, provides a counter-blast to this conventional wisdom. Not that conventional economic wisdom has a good track record. Not so long ago most British economists would have sworn that a devaluation of the currency would feed through into wage inflation. Even the most devout advocates of monetary targets are a little more reticent these days in pushing the predictive powers of their favourite measure. Nor have policy-makers been inclined to accept the basic implications of standard economic analysis, and minimum wages are no exception. The US economy - closer to the classical economic textbook model then most developed countries - has had a federal minimum wage for decades. And, within Europe, only the UK has no minimum wage protection at either national, regional, or sectoral level. France, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Luxembourg have a statutory minimum wage, while in Belgium and Greece a national minimum wage is set by collective bargaining. In Germany, Italy and Denmark, pay minima for individual sectors are set by binding collective agreements covering a large proportion of the workforce while, in Ireland, legal minimum rates are set for certain low-wage sectors such as hotels and catering. But the minimum wage does appear to be one area where policy is leading economic research. Anxious to investigate whether increases in minimum wages really do reduce employment and therefore whether low-wage labour markets do conform to the standard textbook theory, a distinguished group of US economists has examined the effects of recent changes in state and federal minimum wages. Their results have turned conventional wisdom upside down. For these studies find that low-wage markets do not work like simple markets on a Saturday morning. Setting a market-clearing price for strawberries is a fairly straightforward process. If strawberries are plentiful then a relatively high-price floor will lead to a glut. But the same logic does not apply to labour markets - notions of fairness, commitment to particular jobs and information about available alternatives make people a more complicated commodity. In fact, the classical assumptions about the labour market - that employers can easily hire workers and that they can costlessly get all the information they need about available jobs and wage rates - are almost never met in practice. When turnover is rapid, and workers are young and inexperienced, it is quite possible for different workers of the same age and with the same skills to be paid very different wages, even in the same company. Under these circumstances, the standard model does not apply. The US studies, all published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge Massachusetts, are: Card (1991). The increase in the US federal minimum wage in 1990, the first for a decade, provided a good natural experiment to test the standard economic theory. David Card, of Princeton University, examined the effect of this increase in the federal minimum wage from Dollars 3.35 to Dollars 3.80 in 1990. He compared its impact on states with differing proportions of low wage workers on the assumption that if the increase in the national minimum wage reduced employment, then total employment should fall faster in low-wage states such as Arkansas, compared to richer states such as Massachusetts. In fact, Card found no significant differences in employment growth in the following year while employment appeared to grow faster in the low-wage states. Katz &amp; Kreuger (1992). The federal minimum wage was again increased in 1991  -from Dollars 3.80 to Dollars 4.25. Lawrence Katz, of Harvard University, and Alan Kreuger, then at Princeton, conducted a survey of employment and wages in 100 Burger King restaurants before and after the increase. Again they found no evidence that employment fell. In fact, employment appeared to rise and, more important, by a greater amount in those stores which previously paid the lowest wages and therefore had to make up the biggest increases. Card and Kreuger (1993). The most compelling survey was conducted by Kreuger, now chief economist at the US Labor Department, in conjunction with Card. In April 1992, New Jersey increased its minimum wage from Dollars 4.25 to Dollars 5.05, giving it the highest state minimum wage in the US. Card and Kreuger surveyed 410 fast-food restaurants before and after the change both in New Jersey and in neighbouring eastern Pennsylvania where the minimum wage had stayed at Dollars 4.25 an hour. The average starting wage at fast-food restaurants in New Jersey increased by 10 per cent following the rise in the minimum wage. By December 1992, full-time equivalent employment had risen in New Jersey's fast-food restaurants, and fallen in Pennsylvania. The biggest increases in employment occurred in those New Jersey stores which were previously paying the lowest wages. The US evidence is overwhelming: increasing minimum wages to a tolerable level in low-wage labour markets does not cost jobs, and can even increase employment. And a recent UK survey tells the same story about the UK wages council rates. Until their abolition last year, the rates set for particular wages councils declined steadily in real terms. But a study by Steve Machin and Alan Manning of the London School of Economics found no evidence of positive employment effects resulting from this decline. Instead, employment declined in industries where wage council rates fell sharply. One result of this growing evidence that minimum wages need not cost jobs has been a softening of the attitude of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. In its recent Unemployment report, the OECD dropped its previous vigorous opposition to minimum wages, warning instead that too high minimum rates will eventually bite into employment, and that they cannot be the central plank of any anti-poverty strategy. Most families living below the poverty line in developed countries are poor because of old age, unemployment or children rather then low wages. What is clear, in the modern labour markets, is that minimum wages can be an effective part of a wider anti-poverty strategy to the extent that they make the benefit systems work more effectively. The Clinton administration, still reportedly considering an increase in the federal minimum, has placed more stress on the Earned Income Tax Credit - a taxable credit to low-wage working families with children. But, as this year's economic report of the president argued, the minimum wage floor is necessary to prevent bad employers from cutting wages and allowing the state to subsidise low pay. In short, it does appear that a minimum wage can be an effective tool as part of a broader anti-poverty strategy. Advocates of minimum wages are no less vociferous than in the past. But today they have more sophisticated arguments, and a wider body of evidence, at their disposal. The author is economic adviser to Gordon Brown, the UK shadow chancellor</p>

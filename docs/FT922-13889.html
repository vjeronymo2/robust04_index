			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Selective buyers spell end of a blind man's market - The stalling of the Mexican bolsa The Mexican stock market, which rose an impressive 30 per cent in the first two months of the year, has shown its first sign of jitters. In March it inched up just 0.8 per cent, and so far this month the market has dropped by 7.2 per cent. New issues cause much of the concern. In the past month Mexican companies have raised just under Dollars 2bn in the domestic and international markets, led by Grupo Financiero Bancomer for Dollars 837m, Cemex for Dollars 608m, and ICA in an initial offering of about Dollars 400m which is due to close this week. Banacci, comprising Banamex, is expected to announce an offering for hundreds of millions of dollars, while the government intends to sell a further 5 per cent of Telmex for between Dollars 1.3bn and Dollars 1.5bn in May or June. The Cemex offering suggests that US investors might finally have had their fill of Mexican paper, since it fell significantly short of the Dollars 700m expected. European demand proved high, but US investors, already substantial holders of Cemex, were less enthusiastic. Stockbrokers are advising investors to choose their shares more carefully, warning that this is no longer a blind man's market. In its monthly report, Vector, the Mexican brokerage, says: 'The real possibility of adjustments to the market underlines our strategy of selectivity.' Likewise Mr Roger Frank of James Capel says: 'This year it is a stock picker's market,' and he advises clients to restrict themselves to construction stocks, Telmex, the telephone monopoly, and Cifra, the retail store. Investors remain worried about the prospects for the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is unlikely to become law in the US this year. If negotiations break down, a signing next year becomes doubtful, and the market could fall further, says Mr Scott Kalb of Smith Barney in New York. Similarly, there is the ever-present risk of bad economic or political news  -from Mexico or the US - upsetting Mexico's delicate political and financial equilibrium. In particular, the credibility of Mexico's quasi-fixed exchange rate - crucial to gains made in the bolsa - depends on falling inflation and large capital inflows to finance the growing trade deficit (Dollars 11.18bn in 1991). So far the financial evidence has vindicated the government's economic policy: economic growth slowed to 3.6 per cent at the end of last year, reducing fears of overheating; foreign inflows of capital easily cover the current account deficit; inflation, while much higher than the government's over-optimistic forecasts, is falling; and interest rates are 5 percentage points lower than in early January. Best of all, corporate profits have beaten all expectations, keeping the market's prospective price/earnings ratio around 12.6 in spite of the whole market more than doubling in price last year. In 1991, average profits were up about 50 per cent in real terms. Mexico has thus remained popular with international investors, which explains why its companies have been able to raise almost Dollars 2bn of equity in one month. Total foreign investment equalled Dollars 24.8bn at the end of March, according to figures from the Prime brokerage, up 32.4 per cent from the end of December, and about one fifth of market capitalisation (and a much higher proportion of the market float). Investment in Mexican American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) increased from Dollars 2.2bn at the beginning of 1991 to Dollars 17.9bn at the end of February this year, reflecting the high demand for Mexican stock by investors who are not allowed or find it too cumbersome to invest directly in the Mexican bolsa. More than 20 Mexican companies now have stock traded in the US. The trend represents a de facto integration of Mexico's stock market with Wall Street, so much so that Mexican share prices are often at the mercy of foreign investors. When the government recently announced the sale this year of another 5 per cent of Telmex, the Mexican stock market fell sharply as US investors sold their ADRs. In the long run this dependence on Wall Street may ease as new Mexican pension funds provide domestic support. Until then, foreign investors will provide much of the impetus, and when they feel nervous, the bolsa inevitably falls.</p>

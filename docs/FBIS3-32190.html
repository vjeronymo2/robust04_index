			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Economy Minister-designate Alvaro Garcia by </F> unidentified reporter; place and date not given, passage within  quotes are editorial commentary]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [ESTRATEGIA] [Former Economy  Ministers] Carlos Ominami and Jorge Marshall maintained  excellent relations with President Patricio Aylwin. How would  you define your relationship with Eduardo Frei?    [Garcia] It is very good, I greatly admire the  president-elect...    [ESTRATEGIA] Do you believe your appointment was decided by  the president alone or do you think partisan interests were  considered?    [Garcia] I have no doubt I was elected by the president, but  I also enjoy my party's support.    [ESTRATEGIA] You are one of the youngest and most handsome  members of the cabinet. What other virtue do you think will  help you do your job as minister?    [Garcia] I do now want to discuss my own virtues because  this  is for others to do, but I would like to talk about what I want  to do "he says calmly and with a smile on his face which becomes  more serious when he refers to his tasks in the ministry." From  the economic viewpoint, Chile's great challenge lies in  constantly increasing its competitivity, which is linked to two  great aspects: increased productivity and increased quality of  the productive apparatus. Chileans have become aware that these  two issues are essential if we are to continue to grow  successfully. This overall consensus has not resulted yet in  specific working agreements or in a joint action of public and  private sectors, or in the private sector itself. I want the  Economy Ministry to reach these agreements and implement them.    [ESTRATEGIA] In this sense, do you think the Economy  Ministry  has failed to do its job?    [Garcia] No, on the contrary; I believe the ground rules  have  been set for a sound relationship between the Economy Ministry  and the private sector that now allow them to work jointly.    This formal dialogue is carried out through the  institutional  channels that have been created. The economy minister presides  over the Committee for the Participation of the Private Sector  in International Economic Relations [Comite de Participacion del  Sector Privado Para las Relaciones Economicas Internacionales],  which groups the main business and labor union leaders. These  subjects have been placed on the agenda of the public as well as  the private sectors. Therefore, an effort is being made to step  up and continue a task that has already been started.    [ESTRATEGIA] Taking this into account, what short-term plans  do you have in mind?    [Garcia] The main objective is to make progress jointly --  businessmen and workers -- to draft an agenda of concrete tasks  that will make global agreements possible. I want this to be a  joint effort so the agenda must also be drafted jointly. I have  some ideas in mind but, above all, I want to discuss them and  reach agreement with business and labor union leaders.    [ESTRATEGIA] Have you started making the contacts?    [Garcia] I have been talking with them but we will really  get  down to work when I assume as economy minister.    [ESTRATEGIA] What do you think about the role of businessmen  and workers during the current administration?    [Garcia] Incredibly positive. In a very brief period of time  a climate of dialogue that never existed in our country has been  established between the government, businessmen, and workers.    Confrontations used to be characteristic of the relationship  between these sectors. During these past four years a method to  define public policies has been established and the challenges  that have surfaced have been tackled jointly. All involved  sectors have revealed a national spirit that has allowed the  country to grow; all sectors have revealed a great commitment  with the country, not just with their sector, which must be  maintained because that is their social duty which they assumed  with great dignity.    [ESTRATEGIA] Within this context do you believe the policy  of  consensus must be maintained?    [Garcia] Absolutely...!    [ESTRATEGIA] Do you think this is why the government has  criticized for its "lack of audacity."    [Garcia] I do not agree there has been a lack of audacity.  On the contrary, I believe it was very audacious to progress on  the path of consensus. It was very audacious because it was  very new and needed great willpower.    [ESTRATEGIA] What challenges will the country have to face  in the macroeconomic field given the scope of the scheduled work?    [Garcia] Our most important effort will be to stay on the  present path. Conditions are right for the economy to grow at a  stable pace of 6 percent, and current investment levels make us  believe this is possible in the long term. We need only  continue to encourage savings and we will finance all our  domestic investments.    The path we have chosen -- the gradual reduction of  inflation  -- will assure a more stable process and, therefore, our  challenge is to continue the program.    [ESTRATEGIA] Do you think estimates for 1994 on growth and  inflation rates are correct?    [Garcia] Yes. We should expect growth rates of between 4 and  5 percent and inflation slightly lower than last year. However,  it is important for the country to be aware that the development  path we have chosen -- which has yielded great results -- also  increases the influence of the world economy on Chile's economy.  Therefore, it is not possible to make economic evolution  projections solely based on local conditions.    There are signs of a recovery in the world economy, which is  promising for our economy, but I do not think the process is  definite. My impression is that 1994 will still be a year of  slow international growth.    [ESTRATEGIA] Would you say we should be optimistic or  cautious during 1994?    [Garcia] I would say we must face the year with austerity.    [ESTRATEGIA] In your opinion, will Chile reach single digit  inflation rate during the next few years?    [Garcia] We must try to reduce inflation to one digit.  Conditions are right.    [ESTRATEGIA] During the presidential campaign, [Copper  Corporation, CODELCO, executive president] Juan Villarzu's  proposals were considered more liberal than those of Minister  Alejandro Foxley. Whose proposals do you think are closer to  your way of thinking?    [Garcia] I was not aware there were differences. I do not  know in what areas...    [ESTRATEGIA] For instance, regarding capital accounts,  privatization, foreign exchange policy...    [Garcia] Minister Foxley encouraged the opening of capital  accounts and this is currently paving the way. I have no doubt  that Villarzu, Foxley, and the entire coalition agree that the  opening of capital accounts is a crucial factor in our export  development.    Chile has a potential offer of services in the international  arena. To materialize this offer we must open capital accounts.  One of the usual hurdles in the commerce of goods has been the  lack of follow up by the financial sector. We all agree on the  absolute need to advance this opening process. We have defined  a path that passes through the normalization of national  capitals market, particularly the banking system which has  sponsored this process.    [ESTRATEGIA] But critics speak against the current  government's gradualism.    [Garcia] Speaking about the capital market, in the past few  days we have seen a Minister Foxley rather annoyed by the  slowness of the process that he is trying to speed up. It  obviously does not depend on the willingness of the Executive  Branch because the bill has been in Congress for more than a  year now.    [ESTRATEGIA] What is your position regarding privatizations?    [Garcia] We discussed the issue at length inside the  coalition. The important aspect of our position is that we do  not have a set criteria as to whether privatizations are good or  bad. Public companies must be efficient and competitive in  order to fulfill their social function. If they are not, there  is no reason why they should continue as public companies. To  advance the privatization process, however, it is essential to  create the mechanisms to ensure the preservation of the common  good in areas where -- some times -- competition does not  operate effectively. When privatizing companies in certain  productive areas it is essential to create regulating mechanisms.    Perhaps the most important part of our proposal is that no  area should be off-limits for private initiative. On the  contrary, we must do the utmost to encourage investments in  areas that are traditionally public -- particularly in the field  of infrastructure. For instance, the president-elect has said  that all new investments in the ports will come from the private  sector.    [ESTRATEGIA] Does it mean then that the issue of  privatizations is more an economic than a political issue?    [Garcia] Absolutely. We are not politically prejudiced about  the issue.    [ESTRATEGIA] Do you believe a public company that is not  administered well should be privatized?    [Garcia] We should consider privatizing inefficient  companies. Sometimes it is a better to rationalize a company  than to sell it. But continuous inefficiency is a very good  reason for privatization.    [ESTRATEGIA] What companies do you think should be  transferred to the private sector?    [Garcia] I do not have any in mind right now. I could not  mention a specific company. But we have agreed on certain  criteria.    [ESTRATEGIA] What about Codelco? Why is there so much fear  about discussing it?    [Garcia] There are two good reasons why the company should  stay in state hands. First, the state can provide a broad field  for possible progress in the areas of efficiency and  rationalization; and second, the company has a great  macroeconomic importance.    [ESTRATEGIA] We have noticed a certain disorder in the  administration of trade agreements during this government. What  will be the role of the Economy Ministry during your  administration?    [Garcia] I would not characterize it as disorder. The  economic opening is an objective for national development, and  commercial agreements constitute one of the mechanisms to  advance in that direction. It is, therefore, necessary for the  Finance, Foreign, and Economy Ministries to participate in this  process because they have areas of concern that must be present  in any discussions.    At the beginning of the year a formal organization was  created -- the Participation Committee -- to call a national  dialogue on this task. It is a mechanism that must continue.  It is adequately facing its tasks. Besides, the participation  of these three ministers converge in this area. I know [Foreign  Ministry foreign debt negotiator] Eduardo Aninat and [Foreign  Minister-designate] Carlos Figueroa quite well and I have no  doubt whatsoever that we will constitute a good working team to  perform this task.    [ESTRATEGIA] Considering the progress achieved lately, what  must be the objectives of Chile's international economic  relations during Eduardo Frei's administration?    [Garcia] We will try to continue to increase Chile's  presence  in international markets. There are areas, particularly the  Asia- Pacific region, where Chile has great development  potential. We will also seek to strengthen our presence in our  traditional markets -- the United States, Japan, and the EC --  and to continue to work on market liberalization, a task that  must be maintained.    This is one of the challenges ahead of us. It requires the  active participation of everyone, that is, the government and  the private sector.</p>

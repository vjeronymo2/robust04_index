			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Election 92: Tories accuse Labour of lacking experience THE CONSERVATIVE party's first rally of the campaign opened with a sustained attack on the alleged lack of experience among leading figures in the Labour party. Launching a national poster campaign - in which a learner-driver's 'L' plate is used as the first letter of the word Labour - Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, and senior colleagues highlighted the choice between Mr John Major and Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, as the next prime minister. In a speech surveying the international scene Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, pressed home the contrast with a tribute to Mr Major's diplomacy in the 15 months of his premiership, and the risks ahead in the post-Cold War world order. A further sign that the party plans a forward-looking campaign based less on its record than on its vision of the future, came in an appeal to first-time voters from Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary. Mr Heseltine's speech, which won the most enthusiastic response of the afternoon from the 800 representatives, said Labour's message of higher taxes for both rich and poor would discourage the young from enterprise and taking responsibility. Mr Heseltine portrayed Labour as rushing like the charge of the light brigade 'into the valley of taxes'. The day was dominated by hammering home Labour's decision to vote against the Budget proposal for a 20 per cent tax rate for the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income. The Tories are confident that the opposition to the reduced rate band leaves Labour more vulnerable on tax even than its previous policy of raising the top tax rate and removing the ceiling on national insurance contributions. Mr Patten, reinforcing the Tories' central message that Labour cannot be trusted with the economy, said the only thing the party could be trusted to do was to raise taxes. 'Neil Kinnock's message is simple: 'Read my lips, lots more taxes',' he said. Both Mr Patten and Mr Heseltine drew murmurs of support from the audience of senior party workers when they attacked Labour's 'scare campaign' on the health service. Party officials said that the negative campaigning tone of the day's speeches would change today with the address from the prime minister which, in setting out his vision of the future for Britain would set the tone for the campaign.</p>

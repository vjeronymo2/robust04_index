			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: O&amp;Y creditors find investor for energy unit Creditors of Olympia &amp; York, the failed Canadian property developer, have found an outside investor to inject badly-needed capital into Gulf Canada Resources, the oil and gas producer formerly controlled by O&amp;Y. Torch Energy Advisors, a Houston-based investment management group, will pay CDollars 300m (USDollars 214m) for 55m newly-issued units, each comprising one Gulf common share and a one-quarter warrant to buy one share at CDollars 6.25 over the next two years. The warrants, if exercised, would raise another CDollars 86m. The deal will allow the international lender group, led by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Credit Lyonnais, Royal Bank of Canada and Dai-Ichi Kangyo, to cut its stake in Gulf Canada to 52 per cent from 70 per cent. Torch will have a 25 per cent interest. Torch also has an option until December 9 to make an offer for Gulf shares held by the banks and other shareholders for CDollars 5.38 each. This is significantly higher than the CDollars 4.50 at which Gulf shares were trading on the Toronto stock exchange immediately prior to the announcement. O&amp;Y pledged its Gulf shares to the banks as partial collateral for a USDollars 2.5bn syndicated loan. The banks seized the shares when O&amp;Y collapsed in 1992. Mr Ken Croft, analyst at Levesque Securities in Calgary, said the banks have faced a dilemma: 'They believe there's more value in the company than the current share price suggests. But to realise that gain would require someone to put in extra money.' Gulf has extensive operations in western Canada, northern Russia and Indonesia. It produced an average of 93,500 barrels a day of liquids and 296m cubic feet of natural gas in 1993. But the company has lost more than CDollars 400m since 1990, and has CDollars 1.7bn of debt. It has disposed of several businesses in the past two years in an effort to alleviate its financial position. Mr Chuck Shultz, Gulf chief executive, said Torch's purchase would provide capital to develop its remaining assets. Gulf also indicated that a sturdier capital base may allow it to resume dividend payments on its preferred shares.</p>

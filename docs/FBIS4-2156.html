			<p>BFN     [Text] Zhengzhou, April 6 (XINHUA) -- Hard work, the  traditional way for the Chinese nation to become prosperous, is  no longer regarded as the only way to get rich, especially by  the new generation of peasants.    Young peasants are finding that scientific and technological  means are more important in their farm production, as a craze  for new farming skills and advanced methods of production  emerges in the vast rural areas of this huge agricultural  country. The progress of the state "Spark Program", which is  aimed at using advanced but suitable technology to promote the  local economy in the rural areas, has helped train large numbers  of young peasants in Central China's Henan Province. They have  been equipped with modern know-how and land management knowledge.    The province's over 13 million young farmers are now very  active in technical training.    More than 50 percent of young people in rural areas have  mastered one or two skills.    Lou Tingfeng, a young peasant in Baofeng County, Henan, now  earns 50,000 yuan (about 5,882 U.S. dollars) each year by  raising scorpions after attending a training course.    He and the neighboring township government jointly founded a  specialised scorpion farm with a total investment of 800,000  yuan (nearly 100,000 U.S. dollars).    The farm is expected to produce an annual production value  of  six million yuan (about 700,000 U.S. dollars) and make a profit  of one million yuan.    Following his example, many local villagers have come to him  for technical advice. Lou has held four training classes on  scorpion raising, with the attendance of over 500 people.    Now his students are scattered in surrounding counties,  spreading the technique. Lou has been called by local  government an outstanding young man in helping others to get  well-off.    Henan now has over 20,000 such young people engaging in  various types of specialised production such as fish raising,  farm product processing, and fruit tree and vegetable planting.  They play an exemplary role in the local economy.    Statistics show that 180 technical projects have been  carried  out in the rural areas of henan.    The provincial government has carried out a demonstration  campaign on rural comprehensive development among young people  in its seven cities, 25 medium-income counties and 20  poverty-stricken counties in the Funiu and Taihang mountains.    A total of 45.5 million yuan (about 5.5 million U.S.  dollars)  has been invested in 401 rural development projects involving  thousands of young peasants. The projects have made profits of  850 million yuan (about 100 million U.S. dollars).    At the same time, various forms of special technology  associations, research societies and technical service firms  have mushroomed in the province to serve the campaign.    In such organizations, young farmers are learning new  techniques with great enthusiasm.    Local officials hold that there will soon be an average of  6,000 young peasants trained in the province in the province  each year.</p>

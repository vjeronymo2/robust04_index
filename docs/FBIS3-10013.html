			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the Guatemalan Army in Guatemala City </F> on 27 February]    [Text] The Guatemalan Army reports to the national and  international community:    1. That the constitutional president of the republic and  commander general of the Army has preserved the apolitical  nature of the armed institution since the start of this mandate  on 6 June 1993.    2. That, consequently, the president of Guatemala has never  tried to involve the Army in political-electoral activities such  as the recent popular consultation, and has thus fully respected  the duties that the Constitution of the republic assigned to the  Armed Forces.    3. That, in the same way there has been no presidential  attempt to manipulate the Army, the president has not issued  orders to influence the Civilian Self-Defense Voluntary  Committees either.    4. That, in rejecting any claim contrary to the  aforementioned, the Army is reaffirming its absolute respect for  the country's institutions and its support for the current  constitutional government of the Republic headed by Ramiro De  Leon Carpio.    5. That, in view of the need to promote the highest degree  of well-being for the Guatemalan people, the Army urges all  segments of the population to intensify efforts in favor of  harmony, peace, and national reconciliation.    [Issued] Guatemala City, 27 February 1994.    "Fiftieth anniversary of the revolution of 20 October 1944."</p>

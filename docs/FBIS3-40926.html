Semipalatinsk Test Site Continues To Pose Questions"]    [Text] At a meeting between Tulegen Zhukeyev, state  counselor of the Republic of Kazakhstan, and journalists  discussion again turned to the future of a nuclear device  prepared for testing at the Semipalatinsk test site but still in  an underground gallery, as the test site has been closed to date  under an edict of the president of Kazakhstan. Nuclear tests  have accordingly ended.    What, then, will become of the nuclear charge? What is its  future? Could a spontaneous underground nuclear explosion  eventually occur? These and other questions are worrying people.    The state counselor thinks the nuclear charge should be  neutralized. However, according to him, Kazakhstan is unable to  do this itself. Only those who prepared the charge and placed  it underground for testing are capable of doing it.    However, as we have learned from informed sources, the  nuclear charge's removal from the gallery entails very  complicated engineering operations. This is not only expensive,  it is dangerous too, as it was never planned that the device  would be removed. It was prepared only for detonation and was  carefully sealed up.    We have heard from certain officers at the test site that  destroying the charge in situ would be the simplest and most  expedient solution. That is to say, detonate it and let that be  an end to the matter, particularly as its yield compared with  those detonated at the test site in previous years is not very  great.    But a new problem is coming to a head. The military unit  which provided support services for tests at the Semipalatinsk  site is being disbanded. Shortly there will be no one to remove  or detonate the charge, depending on which decision is made.  Perhaps our descendants will be left this "surprise" as a  keepsake?</p>

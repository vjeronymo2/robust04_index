			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / US steel union to have seats on boards HALF the steel workers in the US will have representatives on company boards in return for more flexible working practices, if deals at two of the biggest steel companies are ratified. Bethlehem Steel, the country's second largest producer after USX, and National Steel, the fourth biggest, reached initial agreement with the United Steelworkers of America over the weekend. These new, six-year deals would be double the length of previous labour agreements in the industry. The agreements are similar to those already completed between the union and two other producers, Inland and LTV. These have been ratified. The new accords would cover some 50,000 of the country's 100,000 steelworkers. Under both the Bethlehem and National deals, to be ratified within coming weeks, union members would be able to appoint a representative to the board and participate in joint committees with managements 'at all levels of their company, right down to the shop floor,' the union said. These committees, known as local boards, would participate in all decisions affecting their area of work, including capital spending and planning. Pension benefits would also be raised and health care benefits frozen. The union would be given a lien on some of the companies' assets to assure these benefits were maintained, the union said. In return, steelworkers would agree to work more flexibly and be trained in a wider range of skills to make this possible. Also, they would receive no pay rise until August 1995 when the average hourly wage of Dollars 13.69 (Pounds 9.13) would be raised by 50 cents. They would also receive up to Dollars 3,000 each in bonuses, Dollars 1,000 of which to be linked to company profitability. The wage deal would be subject to renegotiation after three years. Bethlehem refused to comment on the deal, before it is put to the workers' vote, beyond saying: 'It assures an uninterrupted supply of steel to our customers for six years. There are provisions which allow an increase in productivity, and which will result in a closer partnership with our staff.'</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Special Report on Language Courses: A beginner's guide to Japanese - The problems of learning one of the 'difficult' languages EUROPE'S conception of Japan is changing: from 'difficult' market to that of important trading opportunity. Japan's former protectionism has shifted to an equally vigorous internationalism, and there is increasing scope for more complex commercial relationships, strategic partnerships and technological exchange. In the spring of 1991, the UK's Department of Trade and Industry, together with a committee of leading industrialists, launched Priority Japan, a consciousness-raising exercise with specific economic goals: to assist an increase to Pounds 5bn in annual sales to Japan in three years, and to narrow the balance of trade. As commercial links between Britain and Japan increase, so does the demand for Japanese language as a working tool. Learning Japanese indicates a serious commitment to doing business in that country. Many of the most imaginative business language training initiatives in the UK are coming from the public sector. A DTI pump-priming fund of Pounds 1.6m over four years, to be matched by private funding, was established in 1989, to support business-oriented intensive language courses which include a substantial period of study in Japan. (See box) The courses are intended for high flyers; graduates and/or people with several years' business experience. The University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) offers a one-year programme combining intensive language study with a survey of the contemporary Japanese economy. 'Business in Practice' brings participants together in seminars led by people from sectors such as pharmaceuticals, energy, electronics and finance, who are working at a senior level in companies doing business with Japan. The fourth component of the course is a three-month work placement in Japan, giving practical insight into how business functions. The Scottish Centre for Japanese Studies at Stirling University runs a similarly intensive year-long programme, including three months' study at the Graduate School of Policy Science at Saitama University, with a further optional three months' work placement in Japan. The Centre utilises some imaginative computer software, designed for the course by Richard Harrison, to reinforce tuition and assist individual study. The structure of Japanese is simpler than many European languages, and it is not necessary to be skilled in script in the early stages in order to speak and understand. Most native English speakers find Japanese easier to pronounce than, say, French. A more serious difficulty is to master the appropriate 'register', or level of formality, with which to address and respond to interlocutors. The SOAS course emphasises the relationship between Japanese language and culture. 'In class, participants are expected to behave in a Japanese way from the word go, and the lectors are very strict about that,' explains Wendy Moor, the project co-ordinator. 'It is important preparation for when they go to Japan and work there. The protocol and etiquette of Japanese business life are absolutely vital. You can't really separate culture and language.' The courses are taxing. The demands, not only of an unfamiliar language, but also of an unfamiliar discipline, place strain on the students. 'The most intelligent, articulate, open-minded person will still have problems,' admits Wendy Moor. 'Everybody's pulled through so far, but it's been tough.' Course providers in both the public and private sectors agree that between nine months and a year of intensive study is required to reach a level at which one can expect to converse in most business and social situations. This inevitably poses problems for companies. Many staff who need to learn Japanese will be senior personnel, and not readily spared for long periods. But companies with a serious 'Japan strategy' are making the commitment. Cable &amp; Wireless, for example, is planning to train one employee per year on the SOAS programme for the next ten years, spearheading a continuing Japan development programme, and building the training into the career structure of suitable personnel. New corporate sponsors for the SOAS course starting this month include the Oracle Corporation, and Sotheby's. The insight which staff gain through knowledge of the language is worth the investment, according to Dr Clive Morton of the engineering company Komatsu UK. 'The logic of it is that they learn the Japanese approaches,' he says. 'They can understand where Japanese engineers are coming from, in particular in terms of their design activity and production improvements.' But while government and industrial leaders are ringing in their exhortations, many at grass roots level are less than convinced they need to act. 'We've been quite disappointed at the reaction of many companies,' says Wendy Moor. 'Some simply don't have any idea of what it is to learn Japanese at business level. They still think you can learn by having once-a-week evening classes.' There is no objective evidence on whether this reluctance is recession-led, or due to a lack of corporate imagination. But Wendy Moor feels that more must be done to change their minds. 'I think it's a question of educating companies into what we're trying to do,' she says. 'They should have a Japanese approach in how they train their staff - in a nutshell, long term. The Japanese think ten, 20 years ahead. And in Britain especially, that's not how we think at all. That's why we're getting behind. We're losing the race.'</p>

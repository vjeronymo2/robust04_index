			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Honeymoon may be over for French privatisations - International offerings On Wednesday morning, officials from the French economy ministry will announce the results of the public offer for Renault's flotation. They will do so with mixed emotions. The issue is set to be oversubscribed. But the motor group, one of the stars of the French public sector, has not seen the strength of demand enjoyed by previous sales in France's ambitious privatisation programme. Most industry analysts expect the partial privatisation to draw between 1.5m and 2m private investors, compared with an average of between 2.5m and 3m for the previous four big privatisation sales. Last-minute buying may push up the number but an important question is emerging: Are French privatisations losing their pulling power? The answer depends on where one looks. While private investors have held back, institutional investors - comprising the bulk of the foreign interest in French privatisations - have rushed to buy Renault shares. The institutional tranche, less than 40 per cent of the overall issue, has been oversubscribed a healthy 15 times. For individuals and institutions alike, however, future French privatisation issues are likely to be greeted with an increasingly sober response. For the French government, and the investment banks which place the privatisation shares, therefore, the going may become more difficult. 'The honeymoon could be over,' says Mr Michel Fleuriet, president of Merrill Lynch Finance in Paris. There are several reasons. The depressed stock market, which has seen the CAC-40 index of leading shares fall by almost 20 per cent since its February peak, is one factor that has weighed on Renault and which will continue to complicate privatisation issues. Of the previous four big privatisations, only Banque Nationale de Paris is trading above its issue price. On the institutional side, such factors are compounded by the international competition for investors' funds. 'Renault was a dream sale, with people approaching us,' says one banker in London. 'But institutions have a lot of options coming up next year with Italian and Scandinavian privatisations coming to market.' In spite of these obstacles, the French government and its investment bank advisers are sanguine. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, argues that the strength of demand for the initial privatisations has been abnormal, and that momentum can be maintained in the privatisation drive. Many observers agree. Mr Fleuriet at Merrill Lynch claims that there remain a number of potentially attractive assets in the public sector, citing Usinor Sacilor, the steel group, as a company which will benefit from an upturn in the industry cycle. But he argues that the appeal of privatisation issues from now on will be on a case-by-case basis. Most are expected to draw continued competition from investment banks seeking a slice of the privatisation business. The placings, if not the advisory roles in the issues, have proved profitable. 'The commission rates have totalled about 3 per cent of the amount raised, which has created a fairly lucrative business,' says one foreign banker involved in some of the issues. A counterpart at another foreign investment bank says that pricing will remain the key. 'Renault was nicely priced, at about nine times prospective earnings,' he says. 'So long as the government remains realistic about its pricing then I don't see any major problems.'</p>

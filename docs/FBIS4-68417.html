			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with State Property Minister Avtandil Silagadze </F> by Otar Khutsishvili: "Where Did the Promised Vouchers Disappear  To?"; date and place not given]    [Text] The things people say trying to explain the  country's troubles and ruination! Some blame it on former  communists who have come to power: "Their attempts to build  communism didn't work, now they've jumped on the market economy  bandwagon, but they've come up empty there also." Others blame  the national movements, the leaders of all those political  parties: "These sloganeers and populists don't know anything and  never will." Still others blame everything on the government:  "If so-and-so had instituted reforms and carried out  privatization soon enough we wouldn't be in this fix today." I  was interested in this latter and decided to meet with the  republic's State Property Minister Avtandil Silagadze. Our  conversation started with an unconventional question.    [Khutsishvili] Batono Avtandil, is the bickering with your  opponents getting you down?    [Silagadze] I have to admit it sometimes does. Not because  we  have many shortcomings in our work and can't give an answer (I  never try to conceal anything) but rather because our opponents  mostly argue with me from populist sentiments and  incompetence--they are so incompetent that sometimes it's  ridiculous. For example, consider the sensational "incident" in  which one fair-sized store on Rustaveli Avenue was sold for 17  dollars.    [Khutsishvili] What really happened?    [Silagadze] What happened was that last year the Tbilisi  Main  Administration of State Property privatized three establishments  on Rustaveli Avenue in compliance with all laws and procedures.    One of them was the Mukhura Wine Store (78 square meters)  which a labor collective bought for one billion coupons (worth  17,429 dollars at the rate then). Another was Footwear Reception  Outlet No 1 (six square meters), which was bought for 688  dollars at the current rate then, on a competitive basis, by the  Mothers' and Children's Association. The third establishment was  Footwear Reception Outlet No 11 (16 square meters) which was  bought for 6,874 dollars by a labor collective. The collective  couldn't pay that amount by the deadline and the results of the  auction were annulled. Incidentally, it wasn't the space of  these establishments that was privatized but rather the leasing  rights and the assets in the stores, and for a period of 10  years.    [Khutsishvili] I'm glad the "17-dollar deal" turned out to  be  just a rumor, but there have been cases where certain  "influential" persons have acquired the people's property for  peanuts. Last year in Rustavi, for example, 1.2 million coupons  was enough to buy the Construction Mechanization Administration  and its machinery and equipment. Now that amount wouldn't buy  you one used tire, let alone the machinery.    [Silagadze] A number of things need to be clarified  regarding  that case. First of all, that establishment was not sold on the  basis of our privatization law but in accordance with former  all-union laws. Therefore, even if our country hadn't had the  law on privatization of state enterprises, that establishment  would still have been privatized. Second, the leasing agreement  stipulated from the beginning the establishment's purchase price  of 1.2 million rubles (compare how many tires could have been  bought at that price then), which was set by the book value of  fixed assets at that time. Third, the payment of the amount  started with rubles and ended before 3 August 1993--the period  in which the ratio of the ruble to the coupon was 1:1.    Let me add that the Ministry has not yet made a final  decision as to the privatization of that establishment. In  general we have come up against big difficulties in appraising  establishments to be privatized. At the present rate of  hyperinflation, it would probably be better to assess  establishments first on the basis of some hard currency, for  example U.S. dollars, and then sell them for coupons at the  appropriate rate of exchange.    [Khutsishvili] But what about so-called "covert  privatization"? People have the notion that all the industrial  enterprises, construction establishments, and retail trade and  service outlets in the republic are privately owned. If that is  so, why do you need a government-approved list of establishments  to be privatized?    [Silagadze] Unfortunately, that notion is not groundless.  There are, in fact, persons who have taken possession of some  establishment or other and acquired state property unlawfully.  That, however, is not privatization; it is a crime, and anyone  who commits it must be punished to the full extent of the law.  We have studied the problem and turned the materials over to the  Procuracy to deal with. We are going to step up our efforts  along these lines.    [Khutsishvili] People say all the tea factories and wineries  have been sold off.    [Silagadze] We in the Ministry have only registered the  privatization of the Khoni Tea Factory, which was sold on a  competitive basis. If any self-styled owners turn up for the  others, they will answer to the law. I can say the same thing  about the wineries, except for three or four which were leased  in previous years with the right of purchase.    [Khutsishvili] What about the hotels of Tbilisi?    [Silagadze] The same as with the tea factories. Only one of  them--the Achara [Ajaria] Hotel--was founded as a joint stock  company, and if other people imitate that there's nothing wrong  with it. In fact, we welcome it. In all the civilized countries,  hotels are privately owned.    [Khutsishvili] Batono Avtandil, let me turn once again to  the  government-approved list of establishments to be privatized.  According to it, 4,950 establishments were supposed to be  privatized last year, but the actual number did not exceed 902  (18.1 percent). What happened?    [Silagadze] A lot of factors: the prolonged war in Abkhazia,  internal disarray, the terrible crime situation, the lack of a  legislative base, and, of course, our inexperience. All of these  had an impact on privatization, which basically only affected  retail and consumer outlets. In the first stage, of course, that  was the orientation.    [Khutsishvili] You have mentioned objective obstacles to  privatization. Have any subjective factors been at work as well?    [Silagadze] Of course there have. One major factor is a  mistrust of privatization (because it's such a new thing). This  may be perfectly natural: establishments are being removed from  higher-level jurisdiction and beginning a new, independent life,  and this certainly has to influence the activities of state  structures, their functions and rights and duties.    [Khutsishvili] At first many people thought that  privatization in Georgia ought to take place lightning-fast, by  the "shock therapy" method. But it didn't work. Why?    [Silagadze] It didn't work out because it did not fit our  conditions. "Shock therapy" couldn't have worked for us because  the privatization law did not call for selling property directly  to labor collectives and other legal and physical persons.  That's why the State Privatization Program, which encompassed  the second half of 1992 and the first half of 1993, was not  carried out. The timeframe has been extended to the end of 1994.    [Khutsishvili] The timeframe could be extended indefinitely.  Do you really think that privatization ought not to be speeded  up?    [Silagadze] No, I'm in favor of speeding it up, but it has  to  be done rationally, taking account of the republic's specifics.  It is especially essential to do this because all foreign  investors who want to invest capital with us prefer to work with  privatized rather than with state enterprises. And there's  another factor: the assets of state establishments are being  looted and plundered savagely these days. Once they are  privately owned, this process will stop.    [Khutsishvili] And despite the fact that enterprises are  being looted, one might say that the privatization of the  republic's industry has hardly started at all. Everybody is  aware, in fact, that if private entrepreneurs don't show up and  get interested, we cannot create the market economy that we are  pinning our hopes on.    [Silagadze] I agree. If we want our economy to grow strong,  privatization really will have to be speeded up in industry,  although it is also a fact that most of the joint stock  companies these days (19 out of 35 in the republic) were  established in the Ministry of Industry (versus five in the  Agriculture and Food Industry Ministry, three in the Ministry of  Architecture and Construction, one in the Ministry of Trade and  Material Resources, two in the Department of Transportation, and  so forth). This is the ministry that has the best privatization  program. If it is implemented, our industry will soon advance to  the front.    [Khutsishvili] Exactly how many joint stock companies will  be  established in the Ministry of Industry system?    [Silagadze] Around two hundred.    [Khutsishvili] Does that mean you think it is possible to  plan the number in advance?    [Silagadze] I believe it is justified to the extent that it  enables the state to carry out its policy in the privatization  sphere. That is why it has adopted the criterion of the book  value of the enterprises' fixed assets as of 1 January 1993. If  that value exceeds 30 million rubles, the enterprise will have  to be made into a joint stock company. This only applies to  enterprises whose privatization is permitted by the state  privatization program.    [Khutsishvili] But why have we taken this figure as the unit  of measurement?    [Silagadze] Because many people have shunned conversion to  joint stock companies. If it hadn't been established, a small  segment of the public would have very easily taken possession of  all the assets, while the majority would remain empty-handed.    [Khutsishvili] That's understandable, but what are we to do  with enterprises that are valued at less than that?    [Silagadze] They are to be privatized basically by auction  and on a competitive basis. But even in the case of a  competitive sale, the state can play something of a regulating  role on the establishment. How? The establishment is obliged to  fill state orders, maintain its profile, its workplaces and so  on.    [Khutsishvili] It's good when the state plays a regulating  role in privatization processes. But it also has its negative  side. Because the state retains 51 percent of the stock package,  many enterprises are refraining from privatization.    [Silagadze] This motive does exist, but let's also keep in  mind that it enables the state to manage the country's economy.  In this case, the state retains 51 percent of the stock package,  one portion of which is turned over to the labor collective free  of charge, a minimum of 35 percent is sold for privatization  cards, and the rest is sold for money (including to foreign  investors). As I have said, this is essential to manage the  process, but I don't think the state needs to retain a stock  package in so many enterprises (there are about 400 such  enterprises on the list). The list ought to be shortened  considerably. This kind of privatization should take place  basically in enterprises in which strategic goods are produced.    Let me add that if the state wants to maintain its position  in an enterprise it can sell a package of stocks on a  competitive basis, the terms of which will be binding on the  owner, and we will have to have the future owner submit future  business plans. I am certain that the best program will be  submitted by the enterprise's workers and that they will win the  competition.    [Khutsishvili] Another question: we promised the public we  would distribute vouchers to them back in January of last year.  But then in September.... Where did the promised vouchers  disappear to?    [Silagadze] I'm sorry I can't give a positive answer yet.  Almost everything is in readiness to print the vouchers (the  design was made some while ago), but we haven't been able to  come to financial terms with the company in France that is  supposed to make the privatization cards for us. In other  respects, the work is proceeding rapidly, lists of residents are  being drawn up, and if the finance problem is settled we will  have the vouchers in hand in two months.    [Khutsishvili] If privatization is speeded up but we don't  have the vouchers, what will be left to give for them?    [Silagadze] That just won't happen. A minimum of 35 percent  of the shares of all joint stock companies are to be sold for  vouchers alone. And so, the public is not going to be hurt; the  portion of assets allocated to vouchers will never be sold. As  far as the face value of the voucher is concerned, that will be  announced prior to distribution. [end of Q and A]    This, then, is the minister's, and the Ministry's,  position with regard to privatization, the problems which need  to be solved promptly in order to implement reforms and revive  the country's economy. But what can the Ministry alone do in  this big effort if the government doesn't get busy; and the  government (both the former and the present government)--let's  be frank--hasn't accomplished much reform. Quite apart from real  accomplishments, the government doesn't even have a specific  program to bring the country out of the crisis. There is plenty  of debate, plenty of discussion of these issues; but nothing is  getting done.    Reforms aside, February is over and the amounts of  goods that were supposed to have been issued to the stores in  January are not there yet. Our only consolation is bread, but  because we are not complying with retail bread quota terms (it  is not being delivered to the stores according to stipulated  schedules and amounts), it is being sold without ration coupons,  there are long lines again, and all the while there are daily  food commission meetings being held in the Cabinet of Ministers,  and the public has had it up to here with their promises.... No  country on earth can eat promises!</p>

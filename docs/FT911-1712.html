			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Appointments: Barclays recruits Japanese and Dutch directors BARCLAYS has appointed its first two non-British directors. They are Mr Shijuro Ogata of Japan and Mr Jan Peelen of the Netherlands, writes David Lascelles, Banking Editor.

Mr Peelen is a director of Unilever with responsibility for the East Asian and Pacific region.

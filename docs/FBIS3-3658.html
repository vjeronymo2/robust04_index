It called on party committees at all levels  to strengthen leadership over propaganda and ideological work,  comprehensively implement the guidelines of Comrade Jiang  Zemin's important speech given at the national propaganda and  ideological work conference, and, with the guidance of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line, arm the people with  scientific theories, guide them with correct public opinion,  mold them with noble spirit, encourage them with outstanding  works, and provide a still more effective ideological guarantee  and press environment for safeguarding the stability of the  capital and for attaining the strategic objective of "achieving  a fairly comfortable life three years ahead of schedule."    Leading comrades attending the conference were Chen Xitong,  secretary of the municipal party committee; Li Qiyan, mayor; Li  Zhijian, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee and  concurrently director of its propaganda department; Ouyang  Wenan, Yang Chaoshi, and Qiang Wei, standing committee members  of the municipal party committee; and He Luli, vice mayor.  [passage omitted]    Chen Xitong gave an important speech at the conference. He  emphasized the great importance of the national propaganda and  ideological work conference and urged: Leaders at all levels in  the municipality should conscientiously relay, study, and  implement the guidelines of the conference and, in particular,  study well the important speeches of Comrade Jiang Zemin and  other leading comrades. We should implement the basic  principles for this year's work as defined by the central  authorities and take the initiative in subordinating to and  serving the endeavor of "seizing the opportunity to deepen  reform, open wider to the outside world, promote development,  and maintain stability," which meets the basic interests of the  work of the entire party. Propaganda and ideological work  should advocate concerted efforts. We should implement the  guidelines of the national propaganda and ideological work  conference, especially the speech of Comrade Jiang Zemin.    Chen Xitong pointed out: Beijing's propaganda and  ideological work has produced great achievements in publicizing  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, raising  ideological and theoretical levels, and adhering to the correct  press guidance over the past few years. It has also made  important contributions to ensuring the stability of the  capital, promoting economic construction, reform, and opening  up, and strengthening the socialist spiritual civilization. As  has been proven in practice, Beijing's contingents of  propaganda, ideological, and theoretical workers can withstand  tests.    Chen Xitong emphasized: In the new situation where the  establishment of the socialist market economy system is  accelerated, it is very important to achieve success in  propaganda and ideological work. The main melody of propaganda  and ideological work is publicizing socialism with Chinese  characteristics. A good command of this main melody will bring  about success in carrying out propaganda work correctly and  effectively. We should arm the people with scientific theories,  guide them with correct public opinion, mold them with noble  spirit, and encourage them with outstanding works. It is hoped  that party organizations at all levels will strengthen  leadership over propaganda and ideological work and that all  trades and professions will support propaganda and ideological  work.    Chen Xitong put forward clear requirements on improvement of  the contingents of propaganda and ideological workers. He said:  To make propaganda and ideological work successful, the  contingents of propaganda cadres should first intensify the  study of the basic theory and basic knowledge of Marxism and  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. They should learn to resolve issues with  Marxist stand, viewpoints, and methods. We should step up  efforts to improve the leading bodies of propaganda and  ideological fronts, pay attention to promoting young cadres, and  maintain the stability of the contingents of propaganda and  ideological cadres.

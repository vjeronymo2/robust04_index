			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Shulamit Schmerling on Prime Minister Yitzhaq </F> Rabin's address at the United Kibbutzim Movement convention in  Ramat Ef'al on 21 April]    [Text] Today the prime minister addressed a sympathetic  audience: Kibbutz members do not shout slogans characteristic  of right-wing demonstrations, and their applause is genuine.  Yet when the discussion touched on the future of the Golan  Heights, the tone changed. Confronted with very bitter and  harsh criticism voiced by Golan kibbutzim representatives, who  said: You are sacrificing us in advance; you are closing down  the settlements, the prime minister laid his cards on the table,  stating in no uncertain terms: For the sake of peace, I am  willing to remove settlements.    [Begin Rabin recording] I view the Golan Heights through the  security prism, first and foremost, no matter whether  settlements exist there or not. Security, more than any other  consideration, is my criterion for the Golan. Settlements may  be removed only for the sake of peace. If we reach the point  where we need to remove settlements for the sake of peace, I  have been and will remain in favor of it. And I am not trying  to whitewash anything or throw up a smoke screen. For me, peace  is a higher value for Israel's future and security than this or  that group of settlements.    Just this once, let us view the situation in a framework  befitting the new reality, befitting a big and strong country,  and not the country we were on the eve of our War of  Independence, when we had to hold on to every settlement. [end  recording]    The prime minister went on to warn: If the peace processes  do not make progress this year or by mid-1995 at the latest, we  will return to the days of tension, political stalemate, and  great peril.    He referred to terror, too. He said, for instance, that  since 1 January 1994, the terrorist policy of Hamas and the  other radical organizations changed. They realized that without  attacks inside the State of Israel, they will not attain their  objectives. As a result, 23 have been murdered since 1 January,  20 of them inside Israel.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Intelekt Agency item under rubric "Pre-Election Marathon": </F> "Nova Khvylya on the March. Will It Be Better Than the Old?"]    [Text] The non-party bloc Nova Khvylya [New Wave] consists  of people who are well known in the Lvov area and Ukraine  generally: present people's deputies I. Yukhnovskyy, M. Kosiv,  I. Hryniv, V. Pynzenyk, and T. Stetskiv, also I. Koliushko, L.  Zakharchyshyn, O. Kryvenko, Yu. Kolotiy, O. Pavlenko, Z. Hladun,  and Z. Romovska. It's no wonder that the press conference the  bloc held in Lvov caught journalists' interest.    Mykhaylo Kosiv explained the bloc's name this way: right now  Lvov is represented in Parliament by the "Sixtiers," and it's  time someone worthy replaced replaced them, promising young  politicians, professional jurists, economists and political  scientists.    It was emphasized that the New Wavers are by no means  unanimous. Ihor Hryniv, for example, thinks the only way to  solve the problem of late wages is to print more money, which  the Supreme Council has to approve at the current session.  Viktor Pynzenyk definitely disagrees, and said in his usual  colorful manner just what steps need to be taken. First,  eliminate that pseudo-bank, the Ukrainian National Bank. Next,  put the head of the bank in one of the shafts where strategic  weapons have been stored, guarded by at least one division.  Third, fix the exchange rate of the karbovanets to the U.S.  dollar at 50,000 to 1. Fourth, keep strictly to the rule that  the budget is exclusively for budget-funded organizations. No  enterprise or organization has any claim to budget funds.    Press conference participants also disagreed on the role of  people's deputies role in handling problems of the regions they  were elected from. Viktor Pynzenyk believes all local problems  are the job of rayon and oblast deputies. A Ukraine people's  deputy should deal exclusively with republic-level problems.  Ihor Hryniv's view of the situation in Parliament is that  deputies from the eastern oblasts have formed a lobby resulting  in a strong imbalance in subsidies.    Regarding cooperation between Ukraine and other countries,  V.  Pynzenyk thinks we do not lack for ties. We have them. What we  do need is rubles, dollars, and... wisdom. Former members of the  CEMA and USSR want to cooperate with us, and they will. All we  need to do is abolish the artificially high exchange rate of the  Ukrainian 373 karbovanets and the U.S. dollar.    Our policy's strategic line should follow the path our  forefathers blazed, of their Varangians to the Greeks, say M.  Kosiv, T. Stetskiv, and O. Kryvenko. Our foreign policy and  geographic position will serve day by day to strengthen our  position in the Black Sea reagion. Building a terminal in Odessa  will reduce our dependency on our northern neighbor. The recent  treaty between Russia and Georgia is nothing but a shotgun  wedding, hence unstable.    At the end of the press conference, T. Stetskiv assured  journalists that Nova Khvylya is willing at any time to  coordinate the bloc's lists with those of democratic parties,  and if a Nova Khvylya candidate's rating is lower, he will  withdraw from the campaign.</p>

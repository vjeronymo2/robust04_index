During the hearing and discussion of the reports a number of  conceptual differences were revealed on the issues of local  governing, contradictions in interpretation of legal concepts  between law-makers and experts, in particular, in definition of  a status of the Hural of representatives of citizens at Somon  and Aymag level, its inter-relations with a head of  administrative governing, distribution of powers and functions  between them.    Presence of such theoretical contradictions, confusion at a  conceptual level were confirmed in speeches of practical workers  secretaries of Aymag, City Hurals of representatives of citizens.    As they said, representatives of local elected authorities  are practically fully dependent on heads of administrations, do  not have a real power to solve any local issue.

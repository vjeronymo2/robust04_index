			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Golts report: "NATO-Russia: Partnership Should </F> Be For Sake of Peace, Not For Sake of Partnership"]    [Text] The sessions, held twice a year, of NATO's leading  working organs -- the Military Committee and the Nuclear  Planning Group -- have never minded about drawing journalists'  attention. Both in the past, in the years of military  confrontation between East and West, and now, when Europe and  the world are in a strategically uncertain situation, these  organs' decisions have had an enormous influence on the level of  security on the continent.    It is hard to recall a representative of a nonmember country  ever taking part in these sessions. This time, NATO ministers  will be addressed by their Russian colleague Pavel Grachev.  According to an opinion voiced during a special briefing at the  U.S. Defense Department, the Russian Federation defense  minister's speech is of enormous interest to NATO ministers.    And that interest is pragmatic rather than idle. NATO  believes that a clearer understanding of Russia's  military-political goals and priorities will make it possible to  overcome a not very pleasant state of uncertainty. This  uncertainty has arisen because all of a sudden Moscow sharply  put the brakes on its accession to NATO's "Partnership for  Peace" program. And it provided an excuse for people to talk  about a kind of Russian haughtiness toward those states which  had already joined the program.    Yet somehow what is being lost sight of is the fact that the  "Partnership" program itself is only just being set up. The  idea of a "partnership" open to all was a compromise in a  difficult situation for NATO. When, on the one hand, a number  of East European states stated their willingness to immediately  join NATO on the pretext of the "threat from the East." And, on  the other, Moscow resolutely opposed this prospect, rightly  seeing it as a selfish attempt to revive military confrontation  in Europe. The idea was then transformed into a collection of  the most general principles.    Essentially "Partnership for Peace" is now just a way to  ease  the European states' mutual fears until such time as it is  possible to elaborate an integrated and universally acceptable  approach to safeguarding security on the European Continent.  And this search does not end with the "Partnership" program.  We need only mention the French plan for stability in Europe,  and the proposal from the FRG and the Netherlands to strengthen  the CSCE's peacekeeping role. Finally, we cannot fail to recall  the Russian idea of galvanizing the North Atlantic Cooperation  Council as the core of a future security structure.    But, in parallel with this quest, there has been in recent  months a rush by some 20 East European countries and former  Soviet republics to join the "Partnership." And their joining  looks like more of a symbolic act.    Russia has already recovered from its desire to collect the  mere symbols of unity with the West. It now wants serious work  in the sphere of strengthening pan-European stability. That is  why the Russian Federation defense minister insists that setting  out the provisions of the Russian military doctrine is of even  greater importance than presenting to NATO the parameters and  directions devised in Moscow for political and military  cooperation with this organization. After all, in this context  these parameters will no longer look like claims for a special  status of relationship with NATO. This status should simply  correspond in the most natural way to the status of a nuclear  power responsible for the verification and nonproliferation  regimes, and to Russia's approaches toward safeguarding its own  and the world's security.    It seems as though NATO has not yet reached a general  decision about just how to deal with the Russian approach. It  is constantly reiterating that partnership, as U.S. Ambassador  to Russia Pickering aptly put it, is a kind of "smorgasbord"  open to everyone. Everyone can take the dish they want. In  other words, each state determines the parameters of cooperation  itself. But, after all, somebody has to act as the cook,  supplying certain dishes and monitoring their quality....    A Pentagon spokesmen stated that Russia's special role could  be marked by a special statement or declaration. The FRG  defense minister considers it realistic for Russia to take part  in the NATO Council decisionmaking process, primarily when it is  a question of pan-European security and global strategic issues.  At the same time, NATO is insisting that Russia should not have  the right of veto or any other additional privileges. But the  main privilege on which Moscow is insisting is a partnership  with NATO for the sake of peace, not just for the sake of  partnership.</p>

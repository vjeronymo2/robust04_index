			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not to be cast out this time Sir, I note Mr Sol Kerzner, the South African hotel tycoon, has proposed building a Dollars 450m Holy Land 'Sun City' in Israel's Timna Valley, provided he is granted a casino concession (World Trade News, July 22). A reconstruction of King Solomon's temple, perhaps? Will the money-changers have secure tenure this time? Ben Temkin, Hoofdweg 689, 2131BC Hoofddorp, The Netherlands</p>

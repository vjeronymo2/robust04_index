			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] A step forward was made here in Lusaka today. After  15 days of discussions, the negotiating teams from the  government and the National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] today reached an agreement on the future of the  Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel [Vorgan]. Radio  Vorgan will not close down but its officials will have to follow  the legal procedures for its continued operation. There is a  law in Angola and Vorgan will have to abide by it.    The negotiating teams have already begun discussions on the  next issue -- the swearing in of UNITA deputies. The mediators  have already presented to the negotiating teams from the  government and UNITA the initial document on modalities for the  swearing in of UNITA deputies. The government says it agrees  with the document. UNITA has requested time to study it but it  says it will give its reply tomorrow.    A meeting between the government and UNITA, to be attended  by  Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the UN secretary  general in Angola, and observers, has been scheduled for  tomorrow.</p>

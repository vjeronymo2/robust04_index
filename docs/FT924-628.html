			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Christie's Christie's confirmation of faint stirrings in the art market comes as a considerable relief to the hard-pressed auction house, but it may have a wider significance too. Increased demand for pretty pictures adds to the impression that the investing classes are finally recovering their nerve. Although modest, Christie's 4 per cent improvement in dollar-denominated sales in the autumn season shows the serious art market is at last heading in the right direction. The number of lots topping Dollars 1m rose from 34 to 38, with a sale of impressionist paintings in New York being particularly well-supported. Demand has been fuelled by private American buyers rather than the Japanese corporations and Australian entrepreneurs who drove up prices in the 1980s. America's wealthy may believe they have seen the floor for asset prices. Alternatively, they may simply be fed up with the returns from cash or IBM shares. The art market, is, though, still severely depressed, as Christie's and Sotheby's sorry profits testify. Sales stand at only 40 per cent of peak levels. Christie's decision to follow Sotheby's in lifting its buyer's premium from 10 per cent to 15 per cent should help margins rebound when real recovery takes hold. Added to their seller's commission, the auction houses will keep up to 25 per cent of the price of many sales. Such are the joys of duopolies, if not of fickle markets.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Although various parliamentary [as heard] groups are  supporting President Rafael Caldera's suspension of  constitutional guarantees, they contend that the measures must  be temporary in nature.    Hector Romero Navas, president of the Federation of  Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry  [Fedecamaras], said that the measure that meeting of the  Fedecamaras Board of Directors, Romero Navas said the controls  do nothing to eliminate the roots of the crisis, adding that  there are other solutions. He said confidence can be recovered  by giving positive signals accompanied by a unified economic  program. He said the measures adopted by the national government  must be temporary.    [Begin Romero Navas recording] We think the government  should  have taken this opportunity to establish a deadline, saying  something like: We will find a solution in 30 days, or in 60  days. It is easy to decree something, while it is more difficult  to rescind it. The only way to step back from a situation such  as this is to prepare a program that has strong political  support and the support of the Venezuelan people who, in the  end, have to be assured that we will overcome inflation. [end  recording]    Berend Roosen, president of the National Council of Commerce  and Services, said the availability of supplies will depend on  the swiftness with which foreign exchange is delivered. He said  that if the implementation of measures is delayed, production  will be delayed. He said the people fear the emergence of a new  Differential Exchange System.    [Begin Roosen recording] The freezing of prices will have an  effect. We will see this happen because of price controls. It is  also true that these controls will provide some stability, but  in the end it is not the best thing to do. Remember the  Differential Exchange System. It was easy to start it, but  getting out of it was very turbulent. [end recording]    Regarding prices, (CAVIDEA) [expansion unknown] President  Simon Nobile said distortions have emerged in the underground  economy, adding that wherever price hikes have been excessive,  prices can be lowered.    [Begin Nobile recording] Prices will be brought down. The  established commercial sector maintains prices at an agreed-upon  level. In other sectors, however, prices were above this level.  At a time when more products are available, prices will have to  return to their normal levels -- levels maintained by the rest  of the commercial sector. In this sense, products marked at  prices above normal levels will have to be adjusted. [end  recording]    These sectors support the measures if they are temporary in  nature, and they also want signs of confidence displayed,  because, at this point in time, the eyes of the world are upon  our country.</p>

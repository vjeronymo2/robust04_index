			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Eagle-Picher Asbestos Suits Consolidated: U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein  said he will create a class action consolidating 65,000 asbestos injury claims  against Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. Attorneys for the victims said they would  fight Weinstein's attempts to consolidate the cases, saying the company's  $625-million long-term settlement plan is not enough. Weinstein faces an  additional roadblock in the form of a petition filed Monday in U.S. Bankruptcy  Court in Cincinnati seeking to force the Cincinnati-based industrial products  manufacturer involuntarily into bankruptcy proceedings. Under federal law, the  bankruptcy petition puts all other court action on hold.  </P></p>

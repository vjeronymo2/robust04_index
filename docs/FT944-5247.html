			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Ministers act to defuse row on executive pay increases Senior ministers are considering ways of promoting tighter shareholder control over executive salary increases after a Commons row about a 75 per cent pay rise for the chief executive of British Gas. Mr David Hunt, the cabinet's chief political troubleshooter, started looking at ways of defusing the issue after Mr John Major, the prime minister, condemned 'unjustified' pay increases last month during question time exchanges with Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader. Mr Hunt met senior ministers including Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to explore ways of reducing the potential for damage to the government. Cabinet colleagues say that Mr Major and Mr Clarke were 'livid' about Mr Cedric Brown's pay rise, which followed public concern about substantial salary increases in the privatised water companies. Some ministers believe that the row has seriously undermined the case for privatisation by fuelling Labour claims that it amounts to little more than a chance for public-sector managers to make a financial killing. However, Mr Hunt's soundings failed to identify an easy solution to the salaries problem, which has been referred to the cabinet's standing committee on industrial and consumer affairs. Ideas include amending company law to require salary increases to be approved by a weighted majority of shareholders and giving regulators of privatised industries powers to investigate salaries as well as prices. Neither proposal has attracted much support from ministers, who are wary of appearing to interfere in the salary arrangements of private-sector companies. The most likely outcome is a greater effort by ministers to persuade shareholders to use their existing powers under the companies acts to control executive pay through resolutions at annual meetings. These powers are rarely used because few small investors take an active part in company affairs. Mr Major used a Commons written answer last week to point out that institutional investment funds, which control most large public companies, can influence events 'behind the scenes'. But senior ministers are privately dismissive of the scope for meaningful action by managers of institutional funds, who are said to be uninterested in controlling the salaries of their executive colleagues. Ministers have also reopened an inquiry launched a year ago by Mr Stephen Dorrell, the then Treasury financial secretary, into the level of dividends. The review was shelved after the publication of a letter to Mr Dorrell from Lord Hanson accusing the minister of 'sounding like a socialist'.</p>

			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COMMODITIES;  </P> <P> PLATINUM FUTURES GAIN ON BUYING BY JAPAN JEWELERS  </P> <P> Prices of platinum futures gained strongly Monday after a modest rally led by  Japanese jewelry makers pushed prices through key resistance levels, triggering  widespread buying.  </P> <P> On other markets, gold and silver futures also advanced, copper futures  declined, energy futures gained, grains and soybeans were mostly higher and  livestock and meat futures were mixed.  </P> <P> Platinum settled $7.40 to $8.30 higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange,  with the contract for delivery in April at $546.70 an ounce.  </P> <P> Japanese commercial traders, who recently had been absent from the platinum  market, began buying futures early in the session, which encouraged others to  enter the market.  </P> <P> The rally slowly gathered steam, then accelerated rapidly in afternoon trading  after the April contract's price surpassed $544 an ounce, analysts said.  </P> <P> "We hit buy stops right over that, ran up to $548, then pulled back," said  Bette Raptopoulos, a metals market analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities  Inc. in New York.  </P> <P> Observers noted an easing of concern about the possibility that a strike in the  base-metals section of South Africa's Rustenburg metals complex would spread to  the platinum refinery, which processes about half of the world's platinum.  </P> <P> "That's definitely a contributing factor but it's not as prominent as it was  last week," said James Steel, an analyst with Refco in New York.  </P> <P> Trading volume in precious metals futures was thin, both on the New York Merc  and on New York's Commodity Exchange, where gold and silver futures are traded.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Copper Futures Slump  </P> <P> Gold settled $1.10 to $1.20 higher with April at $390.50 an ounce; silver was  0.6 to 0.8 cent higher with March at $5.809 an ounce.  </P> <P> Copper futures retreated on the Commodity Exchange after five straight days of  gains.  </P> <P> The decline was linked to the London Metal Exchange's report of a relatively  large, 4,500-ton increase last week in its warehouse stocks of copper, and to a  337-ton increase over the weekend in warehouse stocks registered with the  Commodity Exchange.  </P> <P> Copper settled 1.4 to 3.1 cents lower, with May at $1.42 a pound.  </P> <P> Oil futures climbed moderately higher on the New York Merc after an  International Energy Agency report showing a reduction in crude oil output by  the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries last month.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Soviet energy officials said Monday that they were willing to extend  a previously announced 5% cutback in crude oil production beyond the original  six-month deadline in a bid to help boost prices.  </P> <P> West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 to 21 cents higher, with April at  $18.67 a barrel; heating oil was 0.32 to 0.63 cent higher, with April at 51.43  cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 0.06 to 0.87 cent higher, with April  at 51.59 cents a gallon.  </P> <P> Wheat futures made solid gains on the Chicago Board of Trade after a weekend of  drier-than-expected weather in the Great Plains, the heart of the winter-wheat  country.  </P> <P> Wheat also was supported by reports that China was seeking to buy 400,000  metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Livestock Prices Mixed  </P> <P> Wheat settled 2.25 to 7.50 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in  March at $4.35 a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to 1.50 cents higher, with  March at $2.7975 a bushel; oats were 2.50 to 4.25 cents higher, with March at  $2.0975 a bushel, and soybeans were 2.75 to 8.50 cents higher, with March at  $7.705 a bushel.  </P> <P> Livestock futures settled mixed in lackluster trading on the Chicago Mercantile  Exchange. Frozen pork bellies finished sharply higher, erasing about half the  losses sustained in last Friday's steep selloff.  </P> <P> Live cattle were 0.15 cent lower to 0.12 cent higher, with April at 77.80 cents  a pound; feeder cattle were 0.15 to 0.43 cent lower, with March at 82.10 cents  a pound; live hogs were 0.28 cent lower to 0.52 cent higher, with April at  43.87 cents a pound, and frozen pork bellies were 1.85 cent lower to 1.38 cent  higher, with March at 38.95 cents a pound.  </P> <P> Tables, Page 12  </P></p>

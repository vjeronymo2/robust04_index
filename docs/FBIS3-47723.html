Reporting on the meeting, Finance Minister Tharin  Nimmanhemin  said that the subjects discussed during the meeting include  preparations for an unofficial meeting of the finance ministers  of the members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or  APEC, which will be held in Hawaii, the United States, on 18-19  March. The U.S. treasury secretary proposed that a meeting of  senior APEC officials be held prior to the ministerial meeting.  Tharin said Thailand will be represented by Fiscal Policy  Office Director Somchai Ruchuphan. The meeting will discuss  financial and monetary matters within the framework of an  earlier discussion held by APEC leaders in terms of the economic  development of the Asia and Pacific region with a view of  achieving a stable, high growth rate. Discussions will also  stress bilateral cooperation.    Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen said  after an official consultation with the Thai prime minister that  the United States is interested in expanding cooperation with  the Asia and Pacific region. He said the United States is  interested in reaching a conclusion with Thailand about the  financial service sector -- Thailand is at a disadvantage from  the conditions of the just-concluded GATT round of trade talks  and seeks to begin talks at a bilateral level. It is believed  that future negotiations will help Thailand settle the problems.  He said the United States adheres to the principle of trade  expansion, which equally benefits its trading partners in Asia.    Asked by the mass media about U.S. assistance and  cooperation  for Asian countries, the U.S. secretary of treasury said  Thailand and Indonesia can play an important role in expanding  cooperation to other countries within the framework of trade  liberalization which is supported by the United States.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hefei, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Having received  complaints from two members of the Provincial Committee of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) that  some traffic check stations had imposed charges on passing  vehicles at random, the Anhui provincial government issued an  emergency circular to cancel or ban of such traffic check  stations.    The provincial committee of the CPPCC has become an  important  source for the government of Anhui in east China to make  decisions.    By the end of last month, 645 of the 653 proposals made by  members of the first session of the seventh congress of the  provincial committee of the CPPCC have been dealt with by the  local government. Some 426 of the proposals were adopted.    The CPPCC, which consists of personnel from all walks of  life, is a major advisory body to the Communist Party of China  and plays an indispensable role in the country's political life.    Wang Rongkang, a member of the Chinese Peasants and Workers  Democratic Party, put forward three proposals about the stable  and sustained development of agriculture which were adopted by  the provincial commission for agriculture and the department of  agriculture. According to the proposals, an agricultural  information service center and 280,000 agricultural technology  models have been set up in the province.    The provincial commission for agriculture also suggested  that  the provincial government invest a part of its annual increased  revenue in agriculture.    As to the proposals that cannot be put into practice within  a  short period, the government will give members clear  explanations.    About 93 percent of the members of the CPPCC in Anhui are  satisfied or basically satisfied with the handling of their  proposals, a recent poll conducted by the CPPCC provincial  committee showed.</p>

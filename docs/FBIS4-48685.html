			<p>BFN     [Text] The valiant, patriotic, and revolutionary Armed  Forces for the Liberation of Angola, FALA, continue to defend  Ndalatando, the capital of Cuanza Norte, against the aggression  of Eduardo dos Santos' troops. Our correspondent Firmino  Lukamba reports from the area:    Violent clashes took place on 22 May, when FALA troops  attacked a convoy of government troops that tried to supply its  forces besieged around Ndalatando. After one hour and 38  minutes of heavy clashes along the road between  Camassai-Quichucula, the enemy was forced to retreat, leaving  behind three cars [word indistinct], a 10,000 liter fuel tank,  15 confirmed dead soldiers, 18 AKM-47 weapons, and an  unspecified number of [words indistinct] military equipment. We  were unable to present the list of all the captured war materiel  [words indistinct] our logistical department is involved in the  process.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NCUA received 417 comments on the proposed rule: 330 from natural person credit unions, 29 from corporate credit unions, 33 from credit union trade associations, 10 from state regulatory agencies, 10 from individuals, 3 from central credit unions, 1 from a chapter of a state league, and 1 from a bank trade association. Of the commenters 291 were opposed to any NCUA regulation in the area of corporate credit union governance, 95 supported some regulation in that area but stated that the proposed regulation went too far, and 31 supported the proposed regulation with no or only minor modifications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many of the commenters who objected to any regulation in the area of corporate credit union governance expressed the view that the Board should not go forward with a proposed regulation in the face of opposition by the majority of commenters on the ANPR. Some suggested that the decision to go forward was an indication that the Board did not bother to consider the comments and that commenting was useless. In fact, the Board took very seriously the comments of interested parties, and relied on them to produce what it considers to be a better product. The regulatory process, while allowing interested parties to participate in rule making through submission of written data, views, and arguments, does not bind the Board to abide by such submissions. Having solicited comments, the Board, as an independent regulatory body, must then act in its best judgment to establish policies that it believes will ensure the safety and soundness of federally chartered and insured credit unions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board has concluded that because the interests of trade associations (which are basically political organizations) and financial institutions often conflict, trade association control of a corporate credit union can cause, and in several instances has caused, improper allocation of corporate resources. By this rule, the Board seeks to position corporate credit unions to remain free of conflicts of interest and to avoid the appearance of such conflicts that could diminish public confidence in the credit union system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters on the proposed rule who objected to any regulation on interlocks did so primarily on the basis that corporate credit union governance is not a safety and soundness issue. The fact is that trade association control of corporate credit unions is a safety and soundness issue. Less than arms length financial transactions, and problems of financial and fiduciary accountability and control in corporate credit unions with close board and management ties to trade associations, can affect resource allocation decisions. The Board is well aware of several instances where such misallocations have occurred. To prevent both the real and apparent conflicts of interest, the Board has determined that regulatory changes are in order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters who were in favor of some regulation in the area of corporate credit union governance tended to believe that the proposed regulation was on the right track but that some of its provisions were too broad. The commenters argued that the proposed rule could be modified and still meet the goal of eliminating trade association control of corporate credit unions. The Board agrees and has amended the proposed rule as discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> C. Section-by-Section Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 704.2&blank;Definitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rule retains the proposed addition to the definition of ``corporate credit union'': the requirement that a corporate credit union may not condition a credit union's eligibility to join the corporate credit union on that credit union's membership in any other organization. Most of the commenters who favored some regulation in this area supported the amendment. In a first step in providing a clearer definition of what a corporate credit union is, the final rule also adds two new elements to the definition. These are that a corporate credit union is chartered by state or federal law as a credit union and that it provides share and loan services to other credit unions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Among the commenters who favored some regulation, many suggested that the term ``credit union-related organization'' was confusing. Accordingly, that term has been eliminated and replaced with the term ``trade association,'' which is defined in the final rule to include entities owned or controlled directly or indirectly by a trade association. When used in the regulation, ``trade association'' is modified by the words ``credit union.'' ``Credit union trade association'' includes, but is not necessarily limited to, state credit union leagues and league service corporations, national credit union trade associations and their affiliates and service organizations, and local, state, and national special interest credit union associations and organizations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 704.12(a)&blank;Board Representation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule provided that the board was to be determined as stipulated in the standard federal corporate credit union bylaws. Some commenters objected to requiring state chartered corporate credit unions to comply with federal bylaws. The Board is sensitive to state interests but believes it is critical that each corporate credit union follow election procedures that will provide an opportunity for full participation by all members. At the same time, the Board does not wish to intrude unnecessarily on a state's prerogative, so the final rule makes clear that state chartered corporate credit unions need only follow the federal bylaws which govern elections. These would be the notice provisions of Article IV, Section 2, and Article V, both as amended in the final rule. Since these bylaws provide for elections by mail ballot, with procedures for nominations by petition, Section 704.12(a)(2) of the proposed rule has been deleted as unnecessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

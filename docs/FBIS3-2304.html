[Begin recording] [Unidentified CPPCC member] I think  everyone has now clearly seen that during the remaining time, it  is impossible to place our hopes on the British side for  cooperation for a smooth transition of power.    [Second unidentified CPPCC member] Now, the Hong Kong issue  is not whether or not we want democracy. The process for  democracy has been properly arranged by the Basic Law. It  includes a method by which we can proceed in an orderly way and  step by step. It can enable Hong Kong to develop properly and  to prosper today, tomorrow, and in the future. The  complications and the causes have all been created by the  British side, which has ulterior motives. Therefore, the  compatriots in Hong Kong and the people in China will not agree  with them.

			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH GIVES ANTI-ABORTION MARCHERS HIS SUPPORT BUT CHOOSES NOT TO MEET THEM  </P> <P> President Bush assured anti-abortion marchers today of his "deep conviction"  against the Supreme Court ruling 17 years ago today that legalized abortion,  and his steadfast opposition to abortion on demand.  </P> <P> Bush, speaking by telephone to marchers gathered outside the White House before  their annual march past the Capitol and the Supreme Court, said the  anti-abortion movement reminds Americans "of the self-evident moral superiority  of adoption over abortion."  </P> <P> Bush also addressed the March for Life last year on his third day as President,  continuing the tradition of his predecessor, Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> Bush did not mention his support for a constitutional amendment to outlaw  abortion. And, in another departure from past practice, neither he nor Vice  President Dan Quayle met with organizers of the annual anti-abortion march.  </P> <P> Even as Bush spoke, pro-choice forces led by the Planned Parenthood Federation  were urging Americans to call the White House switchboard to register their  support for legal abortions.  </P> <P> After hearing Bush and a handful of congressmen and other speakers, the crowd,  estimated by U.S. Park Police at 35,000, marched up Pennsylvania Avenue to the  U.S. Capitol and the Supreme Court.  </P> <P> Earlier, backers of legal abortion raised the specter of Romania's former  Communist repression in warning against a rollback of abortion rights.  </P> <P> The head of the National Abortion Rights Action League told a gathering on  Capitol Hill that legalizing abortions was one of the first steps Romania took  after overthrowing its hated dictator last month.  </P> <P> "Romanians know firsthand what most Americans can only imagine -- the deadly  impact of government bans on abortion," said Kate Michelman, executive director  of the abortion-rights lobbying group.  </P> <P> "It would be a travesty if the United States, the beacon of democracy in the  world, applauded Romania's reforms while adopting repressive anti-choice laws  here at home," she said.  </P> <P> Activists on both sides of the issue -- sensing 1990 will be a pivotal year in  the political debate on abortion -- held competing events marking the  anniversary of the high court decision, Roe v. Wade, that legalized abortions.  </P> <P> Abortion-rights advocates also gathered on the Mall outside the Capitol where a  temporary memorial was erected in tribute to all women who have died from  illegal, botched abortions -- including Becky Bell, a 17-year-old Indianapolis  girl who died in September, 1988, after a self-induced abortion.  </P> <P> Bill Bell, her father, said his daughter died because Indiana law requires  minors to obtain parental consent before they can get a legal abortion.  </P> <P> "Our daughter was punished," he said.  </P></p>

Soldiers and police fired tear gas as  gangs defied a state of emergency and tore through the streets, smashing and  burning Mauritanian shops. A Reuters news agency correspondent counted 33  bodies at the main hospital morgue. The victims were mainly light-skinned Moors  of Arab and Berber descent. Most Senegalese are black.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "No Middlemen"] </F>   [Text] The businessmen have changed their tactics in  preparation for the 1994 elections. They are now investing less  in traditional politicians and turning to their own leaders in  an attempt to reach the front line in national politics. "No  middlemen," says Senator Albano Franco (PSDB [Brazilian Social  Democracy Party], Sergipe), president of the National  Confederation of Industry and one of the first businessmen to  exchange private management for public administration 27 years  ago. The legalization of business contributions to parties and  candidates and the fears aroused by revelation of the bribery  schemes headed by P.C. Farias and Joao Alves have made  self-financing more attractive. "Since the managers proved to be  incompetent and corrupt, the best thing for the businessman to  do is get involved in hand-to-hand combat himself," says Antonio  Fabio Ribeiro, president of the Brasilia Federation of  Industries and a stockholder in Encol.    In the homestretch of the race for party affiliation--the  deadline was Sunday the 9th--the switching of people and parties  was intense. At least four prominent business leaders made their  choices at the end of the year. The president of the Minas  Gerais Federation of Industries, Joao Alencar Gomes da Silva,  landed in the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], from  where he may run for state governor. The former president of the  Rio Grande do Sul Federation of Industries, Luiz Carlos  Mandelli, joined the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] and is also  expected to run for governor. Two other federation  presidents--Fernando Bezerra (PMDB) of Rio Grande do Norte and  Miguel de Souza (PTB [Brazilian Labor Party]) of Rondonia--will  seek seats in the National Congress. "We are encouraging our  fellow businessmen to join, and we now have representatives in  several parties," says Albano Franco happily.    The bevy of businessmen includes the heir to a  communications  empire. Edson Queiroz Filho of Ceara, who is a stockholder in  the Edson Queiroz Group, a 21-company conglomerate that expects  to bill about $500 million this year, intends to run for the  Senate. Queiroz, who is Tasso Jereissati's brother-in-law,  president of the PSDB, and former governor of Ceara, founded the  PP [Progressive Party] in his state. His decision to be a  candidate is causing his rivalry with his brother-in-law to  intensify even further. Queiroz is entering the scene with the  strength of a group that controls the Green Seas System (the  Globo Network's affiliate in the state), the DIARIO DO NORDESTE,  and 23 radio stations.    "The new candidacies by businessmen show that the latter  were  no longer able to solve their problems quietly through  negotiations with the administration," says Deputy Flavio Rocha  (Rio Grande do Norte), heir to the Guararapes textile group. He  wants to be the PL [Liberal Party] candidate for president of  the republic. Someone else noting the rush by businessmen to  enter politics is the president of the Sao Paulo PFL [Liberal  Front Party] and former minister of agriculture under Collor,  Antonio Cabrera. With only three days left in which to join a  party, Cabrera found that among the new party members in his  state, there were 18 businessmen who wanted to run for federal  deputy. One of them is Aires da Cunha, owner of Blue Life, the  country's third-largest private health care group.    As orphans of the PRN [National Reconstruction Party],  several people who had once been part of Collor's troops went  looking for parties that would help them fulfill their desire to  return to public life. That was the case with former President  Collor's friend and backer of the story about Operation Uruguay,  businessman Luiz Estevao de Oliveira, who is now a candidate for  district deputy in Brasilia. Although wanting to join the PSDB,  he had to be content with the PP. Former Minister of Health  Alceni Guerra, the victim of an unfounded accusation concerning  fraud in the purchase of bicycles for sanitary agents, is  considering an invitation to run for the Senate or even for  governor of Parana on the PFL ticket.    The invasion by businessmen is occurring at a time when  career politicians are losing ground. Several of them are also  showing discouragement. "I'm tired of this disgusting business,"  says Ceara Governor Ciro Gomes (PSDB), who will leave the  governor's palace in Ceara for Harvard University in the  aristocratic State of Boston [as published] in the United  States. If he can get a full scholarship, Ciro will spend 12  months studying economics and political science. After 36  consecutive years in office, Senator Jutahy Magalhaes (PSDB,  Bahia) is also going to retire. His place will be taken by his  son, Jutahy, Jr., former minister of social welfare. The PSDB  also expects to say farewell to Senator Jose Richa (Parana).  Defeated in his 1990 bid for state governor and thoroughly  trounced in the 1993 congressional campaign, Richa has become  discouraged and has already announced that he will not run in  1994.    Because of all that, Congress is expecting to see more new  faces than it ever has before. Only 40 percent of the  congressmen managed to get reelected in 1986. The number fell to  32 percent in 1990. Governor Leonel Brizola (Rio de Janeiro)  believes that 85 percent of the current Congress is going to be  replaced. That change does not necessarily indicate a change in  the ideological profile of the legislative branch. "Today's  Congress is worse than yesterday's, and the one we get tomorrow  will be worse than the one we have today," predicts Deputy  Nelson Jobim (PMDB, Rio Grande do Sul).  <H5>  Election Timetable </H5>   The parties that may present candidates for president of the  republic are the PDT [Democratic Labor Party], the PFL, the PL,  the PMDB, the PSD [Democratic Social Party], the PRN, the PSDB,  the PT [Workers Party], the PTB, the PP, and the PPR. Here are  the key dates in connection with the 1994 elections:    9 January: Deadline for party affiliation by candidates.    2 April: Deadline for resignation from public office in  order  to be a candidate; start of the period for holding regional and  national conventions.    31 May: Deadline for registration and change of registration  by voters; end of the period for holding conventions.    10 June: Deadline for registering slates of candidates with  the TSE [Superior Electoral Court] and TRE's [Regional Electoral  Courts].    2 August: Start of campaigning for the first round of  balloting.    30 September: Last day of free radio and TV time.    3 October: Elections for president of the republic,  governors, senators, and federal and state deputies.    24 October: Start of campaigning for the second round of  balloting.    12 November: Last day of free radio and TV time.    15 November: Second round of balloting in elections for  president of the republic and governors in cases where no  candidate received more than 50 percent of the vote in the first  round.</p>

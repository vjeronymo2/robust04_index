			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Brazil unveils details of plan for real currency Brazil yesterday unveiled details of its plan to replace the currency, the cruzeiro real, which is plagued by annual inflation of about 2,500 per cent. This is part of an overall economic restructuring programme for Brazil, the only large South American economy still grappling with near hyper-inflation. A new accounting unit, the URV (real unit of value), is to come into effect today. Its value will be fixed at Dollars 1 (67 pence) but its cruzeiro equivalent will be increased daily to reflect inflation of the local currency. Salaries must be denominated in URVs, with immediate effect. The government hopes the private sector will switch other prices and contracts voluntarily. Once the URV has gone into widespread use, probably not before May, the cruzeiro is to be abolished. A new currency called the real, fixed at parity to the URV, is to take its place. The government chose this complicated two-step process to let contracts be adjusted to the new accounting unit and avoid legal challenges. Mr Winston Fritsch, economic policy secretary, described the URV as an 'economic lobotomy', designed to remove Brazilians' memory and expectation of inflation. The country's profligate governments, federal and state, have been forced to issue short-term securities at very high interest rates to finance their budget deficits. This has fuelled inflation. Partly as a result, the economy has become highly indexed, with prices often adjusted several times each month to reflect past inflation. The government hopes that, by linking all contracts and prices to the URV, prices will continue to increase in cruzeiro terms but will be stable in URV and dollar terms. Once people realise the URV is stable, expectations of inflation will wither. 'Only when we move to the real will the fall in inflation be rapid,' according to Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, finance minister. Most economists agree the plan works, in theory, and that it was correct to tackle the budget deficit first. The government finished negotiating the budget with Congress last week and can now claim it has closed a projected deficit of about 5 per cent of GDP. Even so, the economic programme still faces many problems, especially political pressures to increase spending before the presidential and congressional elections in October. Also, the compulsory conversion of salaries into URVs may be unpopular, especially since the government had promised conversion would be voluntary.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Christoph Bertram editorial: "Should the Western Alliance </F> Accept East European States? -- Pro: A NATO That Avoids Its  Responsibility Toward the East Europeans After the Debacle in  the Balkans Is Resigning Politically"]    [Text] In reality the quarrel about the expansion of the  Western alliance to the east is not a quarrel about whether NATO  can and must contribute to safeguarding security in East and  Central Europe -- this has long been recognized everywhere. Nor  is it a quarrel about whether the states in this region should  be accepted as full members into the NATO club immediately.  Much rather, it is a quarrel about whether or not some of these  states should be given a clear prospect for this membership even  now.    At the beginning of next week the NATO heads of government  will decide against clarity in Brussels and, instead, in favor  of a deliberately vague, deliberately cloudy "Partnership for  Peace" -- common consultations and common maneuvers, but little  more. Theo Sommer thinks that this is good and sufficient. I,  on the other hand, think that this tactic of delays is  insufficient and even dangerous, because it contradicts the  interests of Germany, the interests of NATO, and the interests  of the states in Central and East Europe as well.    Germany's interests: In NATO and in the European Union we  are the country with the most neighbors in the uncertain East.  For unrest and upheavals, civil war, and migrations of poverty  there not to endanger stability here we must promote stability  in the region as much as possible. Defense Minister Volker  Ruehe said in his statement at the turn of the year: "It is in  our urgent interest that NATO and the European Union, that  prosperity and democracy do not end at Germany's eastern  borders."    NATO's interests: As a result of the end of the Cold War,  the Western alliance has lost its actual task -- averting the  Soviet urge for expansion, and not even Mr. Zhirinovskiy will  give it back. The Western inability to respond cohesively and  with determination to the challenges of the first European  conflict of the new time, the Balkan war, gives little reason  for the hope that the alliance will react to future massacres in  East Europe with anything else than with agonizing abstinence.  To be better equipped against future dangers from the  disorderly east and southeast of the continent, NATO must expand  its own zone of stability. "Those who are in it are safe," NATO  Secretary General Manfred Woerner says, "those who are not in it  are not safe."    Finally, the interests of the East European reform states:  Even though they have freed themselves from the forced Soviet  pact of the past, they see themselves increasingly classified by  Moscow as belonging to the new Russian zone of influence, the  "near abroad." Some people in the West shrug off their worries  as emotional exaggeration. However, how disquieted would the  Germans or British be, if Moscow wanted to order them that they  must not be members of the Western alliance and if, at the same  time, it were to increase the size of its army, as announced?  After the latest Russian elections Estonian President Meri  called the "partnership program" of the NATO summit a "used-up  bottle of perfume" -- "nice to look at, but empty."    What should be done instead? The successful reform countries  -- Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic at first, others  perhaps later -- should receive the promise of the Western  alliance even now that they will become full members of the  alliance by the year 2000. The necessary adjustment should be  carried out in clearly defined stages: renunciation of  potential territorial claims on neighbors; protection of the  minorities in the country; adjustment of the armed forces to  NATO rules; primacy of politics over the armed forces; reliable  democratic structures; and coordination of foreign and security  policy with the other NATO partners. As long as these  conditions have not been fulfilled, a formal security guarantee  by the NATO states for these countries would have little  credibility; however, as soon as they have been fulfilled, there  is no longer any reason to refuse them assistance by the  alliance.    When the NATO chiefs still leave things at vague intentions  of cooperation with everyone at their NATO summit, this is done  primarily out of consideration for Boris Yeltsin's Russia. Even  though last August the Russian president told his Polish  counterpart Walesa that Russia understands Poland's intention to  join NATO and that in the long run "such a decision by sovereign  Poland, which is oriented toward all-European integration, does  not contradict Russia's interests." However, shortly afterwards  the Moscow diplomats went into reverse gear. In December  Yeltsin grumbled that speedy acceptance of the East European  states into NATO damages Russia's strategic interests. The head  of Moscow's foreign espionage even said: The expansion of NATO  "would bring the world's largest military power with its  gigantic attack potential directly to Russia's borders." And  today Foreign Minister Kozyrev warns that NATO's expansion to  the east is grist to Zhirinovskiy's mill. No one can be  surprised that Russia is reacting hypersensitively. However, P4P  -- as "Partnership for Peace" is called in NATO jargon -- is no  meaningful answer to this sensitivity. On the one hand, the  refusal clearly to promise NATO membership to the East European  states rather strengthens Russia's claim to its own, exclusive  zone of influence in the area of the former Soviet Union and the  Warsaw Pact and does not tone it down. On the other hand, by  delaying the membership of the East Europeans, the shaping of  the future relationship between NATO and Russia is being delayed  as well.    After all, a date for accession by the reform countries  would put pressure on NATO immediately to start and  institutionalize the strategic dialogue with Russia. The  expansion of a stability-oriented, no longer anti-Russian NATO  would not be detrimental at all to the properly understood  interests of a democratic Russia. On the contrary: According  to Vaclav Havel, it would be the "approach of a sphere of  democracy and stability." Moscow's suspicious military as well  as the new nationalists and neoimperialists are certainly still  miles and miles away from this insight. However, instead of  showing them consideration with the help of P4P, NATO should  make use of the time that it has to do the best possible work to  convince them: In close cooperation with Moscow, promoting the  insight that the stability of East and Central Europe is a  common interest. Without the simultaneous strategic dialogue  with Moscow, NATO's expansion toward the east could look like an  isolation of Russia. However, without this expansion toward the  east, this dialogue will hardly take place.    Since NATO shies away from these decisions, it will miss the  opportunity of making the uncertainties in East Europe more  masterable by damming them up and making them more predictable  for all of Europe. However, could instead, as some people hope,  the European Union become the anchor of stability for East  Europe? The idea is not so absurd: After all, the European  Union already constitutes a security community; also without the  NATO treaty would an attack on a country of the European Union  be considered as an attack on all other partners and would be  answered as such. In addition, the Western European Union  [WEU], which is to develop into the security pillar of the  European Union, according to the Maastricht treaty, commits the  partners to providing "all military and other help and support  that is in their power" in case of an attack on a member state;  in this it goes even further than the North Atlantic alliance.    Thus, should not NATO but the European Union be expanded?  The best thing would be both, in clear steps. However, whoever  thinks that the European Union track helps avoid the security  policy dilemma of NATO expansion, is wrong. In particular  because the European Union is a security community, the  acceptance of new members has security policy consequences --  not only the desired ones for East Europe, but also undesired  ones for the European-U.S. relationship. Three renowned experts  of the U.S. RAND Corporation, the leading security policy think  tank of the United States, warned in the fall edition of FOREIGN  AFFAIRS: "A situation in which a country like Germany commits  itself to assisting Poland within the framework of the WEU but  not within the framework of NATO, could destroy the Atlantic  alliance." The United States will not permit new security  duties to be foisted on itself. Rather, it has to agree  expressly to them. Therefore, the expansion of the European  Union is no alternative to expanding the Atlantic alliance.    A NATO that avoids its responsibility toward the East  Europeans after the debacle in the Balkans is resigning  politically. An alliance that closes itself to the acceptance  of new members becomes sterile. Whoever hesitates now, when  NATO would still be able to provide effective supports to  security in East Europe, might discover in a few years that he  has not only lost time but has also gambled away the future of  the Western alliance.</p>

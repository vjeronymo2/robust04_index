			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Lib Dems outline plan for greater UN powers THE UNITED Nations should be given the power to intervene in countries' domestic affairs, as part of a thorough-going reform of its working, the Liberal Democrats said yesterday. Sir David Steel, the party's foreign affairs spokesman, said the criticisms made of the UN over its role in the former Yugoslavia and in Somalia reflected the unwillingness of the international community to consider changes to nations' attitudes to sovereignty following the end of the cold war. 'The UN as an organisation has never lived up to the dreams of its founders nor to its charter,' he said at the launch of Beyond The Nation State, a document to be discussed at the party's annual conference later this month. The paper envisages the more systematic development of a range of sanctions against countries which breach criteria on, for instance, human rights and the environment. The UN is urged to improve its information gathering and set up a permanent peacekeeping force. The paper proposes that Japan should become a member of the Security Council and that in due course the French and British membership should be replaced by a single European Community seat.

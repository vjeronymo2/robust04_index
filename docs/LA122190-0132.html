			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> COUNCIL OKS SEIZURE OF LOTS NEAR PARK  </P> <P> The City Council has voted to take by eminent domain the remaining portions of  seven "encyclopedia lots" in the Central Park area. The city earlier this year  had voted to acquire most of the lots so that Ellis Avenue could be widened.  </P> <P> Property owners protested this week that the city doesn't actually need the  lots and is not offering enough money for them. The council, however, said the  land is needed and that Orange County Superior Court will determine its value.  </P> <P> The land in question consists of small tracts given away about 80 years ago as  part of an Encyclopedia Americana sales campaign. People who bought a set of  encyclopedias for $126 also were given a small lot in what was then an eroded  gully area northwest of the small village of Huntington Beach. That land was  considered worthless in those days.  </P> <P> The city this year said the fair market value of the 25-by-112-foot lots is  $10,000 each. Owners believe the land is worth more than that, and sued to  block the city's seizure of the land. The case is pending.  </P> <P> In the earlier eminent domain action this year, the city sought to take only  portions of the lots immediately needed for widening Ellis Avenue.  </P> <P> The City Council on Monday night moved to buy the rest of the land because the  remnants would not be marketable.  </P> <P> Barbara Harmon, of Burbank, owner of one of the lots, was among those  protesting the council's action.  </P> <P> "The city already owns the land across the street (Ellis Avenue). It does not  need my land," she argued.  </P> <P> City Atty. Gail Hutton, however, said the rights of the lot owners are being  legally protected by the Superior Court's review of the eminent domain.  </P> <P> "The court will decide what is appropriate," Hutton said.

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Survey of Lebanon (1): Long road from hell - Reduced to rubble by 17 years of civil wars and invasion, the former 'Switzerland' of the Middle East is trying to embark on a process of reconstruction and national healing / Weighing the chances for Lebanon's blueprint for renewal LEBANON is making a brave attempt to rise from the structural and political rubble left by 17 years of war. Few countries in the Middle East, including Iraq and Iran, have suffered quite so comprehensively during the past two decades. It is also worth recalling that only a few years ago Lebanon was being written off as a nation. The prognosis then was much like the one for Bosnia today: fragmentation into a series of mini-states or cantons, each susceptible to manipulation by an external power, and carrying a legacy of bitterness that could explode again into conflict at any moment. The parallel is far from exact, but the efforts being made to reverse the results of the earlier descent into the chilling process of 'ethnic cleansing' offer hope that some of the ugliest lessons of the civil war have been learned. But that hope has yet to be translated into confidence. The fault lines between Lebanon's religious minorities remain all too visible, the gulf between the affluent and the mass of the poor is huge, and the central government's ability to shape the country's future is severely constrained by the attitudes of neighbouring countries and by developments elsewhere in the Middle East. On the credit side, Lebanon again has a functioning central government, a legitimately elected if not fully representative parliament, and a reconstructed army which, under the command of the impressive General Emile Lahoud, has extended its authority over a large part of the country. The militias have, with one notable exception, been disarmed and security on the streets of Beirut is now better than in some large western cities. Mr Rafik al-Hariri, prime minister for the past seven months, can claim a large measure of responsibility. His behind the scenes efforts contributed substantially to the 1989 Taif Agreement which laid the groundwork for the country's political rehabilitation, and his background as a highly successful businessman in the Gulf has brought an entrepreneurial drive to the process of reconstruction. It is a measure of the hopes resting on him that the currency has appreciated by 20 per cent against the dollar since he took office and that over Dollars 1bn has been committed from overseas towards the reconstruction programme. The cabinet, while still suffering from the inefficiencies imposed by the need to keep a confessional balance, has generally benefited from the injection of technocrats with private sector experience. The central bank, with the arrival soon of a top management team with extensive international contacts, will provide additional expertise in the handling of the economy and the revival of a capital market. Vital work to repair the basic infrastructure, especially electricity, water and waste disposal, is getting underway. A regular power supply, presently limited in many areas to six to eight hours a day, will have an immediate impact on public morale and is fundamental to the more ambitious reconstruction schemes such as the rebuilding of Beirut's city centre. The management of the rebuilding programme and its level of priority offer their own political challenges. Creating a new city centre fit for bankers to work in has to be balanced against the needs of the poorest section of society, heavily represented among the 900,000 people uprooted during the war, many of whom remain without jobs. Reports that apartments are changing hands in the more fashionable parts of Beirut for well over Dollars 1m are unlikely to be well received among those squatting in the bombed out ruins of buildings and getting the minimum wage of Dollars 90 a month. Such disparities provide ready ammunition for those domestic and foreign interests still engaged in the battle over the future political direction of Lebanon. The most basic shift in influence since the eruption of the civil war in 1975 has taken place between the Christian and Moslem communities. Many Christians find it difficult to accept that the demographic changes of the past 50 years are now reflected in the new constitutional arrangements in the Taif Agreement. Mr Hariri, a Sunni Moslem, whose selection as prime minister was vigorously backed by President Elias Hrawi, the Maronite Christian head of state, insists that the country can only be governed effectively through the agreement of the leaders of all the religious minorities. He hopes that by the time of the next parliamentary elections, in just over three years time, a new generation of post-war leaders will have emerged to make reconciliation easier, but that process will in turn be powerfully influenced by what happens in Syria, Iran, Israel and elsewhere in the Middle East. Nothing is more crucial to Lebanon than a successful outcome to the Middle East peace process. An agreement between Syria and Israel on the Golan Heights should open the way for both those countries to pull their troops out of Lebanon. That would remove any justification for Hizbollah, the radical Shia group, to continue as a separate armed faction outside the authority of the national army. Lebanese officials have too little chance of influencing the outcome. Many cabinet members, whatever their private thoughts, acknowledge that the Syrian military presence (and political influence) will remain at least until Israel has left the southern strip of territory it controls and the Lebanese army has established its authority there. Even after that Syria can be expected to ensure close political and economic co-operation between the two countries. The intentions of Hizbollah are the subject of even more intense debate. As a radical Islamic organisation which draws its funds and inspiration from Iran, and is notorious in the west for its involvement in bombings and kidnappings, Hizbollah appears to be opposed to most things that the Beirut government is trying to achieve. Above all, it wants to see an Islamic state imposed in Lebanon, but must surely understand that the rest of the country, including part of the Shia community, would literally fight to prevent it. However, Hizbollah, like Iran, would be emboldened by political successes for radical Islam elsewhere in the region and is well placed to take advantage of any breakdown in central authority. It is a measure of Lebanon's continuing confessional rivalries that there is as yet little sign of a concerted effort to close ranks and plan how best to meet the Hizbollah challenge. Many members of the Maronite community are still more obsessed with getting Syria out of Lebanon, an attitude which has cost them dear in the past and has simultaneously given Hizbollah the opportunity to widen its own role. Given that Syria and Iran still find a common purpose in their hostility towards Iraq, and Israel has presumably abandoned any thought of again interfering more fundamentally in Lebanese politics, the options for the Maronites are few. It is Mr Hariri's hope that eventually they will recognise that by working within the revised political system their future prosperity will be better assured. Part of the problem is that so much of Lebanon's political debate still takes place behind closed doors and continues to be fed by rumour and speculation. The press generally enjoys greater freedom than elsewhere in the Arab world, but tends to reflect a particular view, while Parliament never discusses the great issues affecting the country such as the peace process, the treaty with Syria and the implementation of the Taif Agreement. These institutions have to be further strengthened in the years ahead if the country is to lessen its dangerous dependence on individual leaders. Most Lebanese agree that without the continuing presence of Mr Hariri the political outlook for Lebanon would be much different, and for most of them much worse. He first came to prominence in Saudi Arabia by outbidding international competition to build the Intercontinental hotel in Taif, and completed the project in an extraordinary eight months and 15 days. Lebanese are keeping their fingers crossed that he can perform similar miracles on his home territory.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>   [Text] The news of the espionage committed by British  security officials who installed surveillance devices in the  Islamic Republic of Iran's Embassy in London, an incident that  was revealed yesterday by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, removes  the veil from a series of ambiguities relating to Britain's  latest allegations against Iran.    Our president, who was addressing the press festival  yesterday, said the British Government violated international  norms by planting a secret microphone in our embassy in London.  It also raised the controversy of collaboration between Iran  and the IRA.    About two weeks ago, the British Foreign Office claimed that  its security personnel had discovered documentary evidence that  the Islamic Republic of Iran was providing funds to the IRA  through its agents and was seeking to plan to deliver weapons to  the IRA too. These claims were immediately endorsed by the  minister for Northern Ireland affairs in the House of Commons.  But not much had happened when a spokesman for Sinn Fein--the  political wing of the IRA-- refuted the British claim as a  baseless shot in the dark and unfounded propaganda, adding: To  eclipse its defeat in organizing peace talks on Ireland, the  British Government has resorted to such accusations.    Similarly, three days after the British allegations against  the Islamic Republic of Iran and following a swift and  categorical rebuttal by our officials, London's newspapers  revealed that the accusations by John Major's government were  totally unfounded and bereft of any grounds or evidence. In  this regard, THE SUNDAY TIMES, in its 1 May edition, wrote: The  British Government has no acceptable documentary evidence to  present to the court.    It thus appears that the veteran statesmen of London  resorted  to espionage and an overt violation of international laws by  planting listening devices in our embassy to pursue objectives  that were more important than their international credibility  and reputation. Many possibilities can be enumerated in an  analysis of these actions and London's desired objectives. No  one should ignore that John Major's government and the  Conservative party led by him are confronting serious problems  stemming from a dichotomy in the party. This problem is so  crucial that there is talk of the resignation of John Major's  government.    Despite the defensive action by the British Government in  leveling charges against the Islamic Republic of Iran being  nipped in the bud, and neither British officials nor the British  rumormongering newspapers presenting any plausible evidence of  Iran's support for the Irish secessionists, the British  Government strove to initiate this unfounded rumor in a  so-called preemptive move to prevent humiliation regarding its  espionage activities in the Islamic Republic of Iran's Embassy.    The British Government--by trampling international laws  underfoot--has confirmed that it attaches no importance to its  commitments to international rights and diplomatic immunity and  that when the country's interests dictate, it considers any  illegal activity justified.    As a country professing reciprocal respect for others'  rights, Britain has--by its recent acts of espionage in the  Islamic Republic of Iran's Embassy--again revealed its  interventionist and aggressive nature. The past record of  espionage is nothing new for the British echelons. They believe  that the colonial world of past centuries continues and that  Britain has the right to interfere in others' affairs and to  trample upon diplomatic immunity.    For such countries, wholesome relations based on reciprocal  interests have no meaning. What is important is getting  information and capitalizing on the amicable approach of the  other side. The issue of British spying on the Islamic Republic  of Iran's Embassy is not the first such incident. It is  certainly not the last. Every country should be vigilant, aware  that such intentions and actions might not be confined to one  embassy in Britain alone.</p>

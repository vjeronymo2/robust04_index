			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHUTTLE CREW PREPARES FOR LOFTY HOLIDAY  </P> <P> Five astronauts scheduled to be orbiting the Earth on Christmas climbed aboard  the space shuttle Columbia on Friday for the final two hours of a successful  practice countdown.  </P> <P> The test, which began Thursday, covered the final 24 hours of an actual count  and provided training for both the launch team and the astronauts, who checked  spacecraft communications circuits and other systems just as they will on  launch day.  </P> <P> "Everything proceeded smoothly during today's terminal countdown demonstration  test," National Aeronautics and Space Administration spokeswoman Lisa Malone  said.  </P> <P> Columbia is scheduled to be launched Dec. 18, but officials said the schedule  is tight and that liftoff might have to be delayed a day or two. Shuttle  managers will select a launch date on Tuesday after a two-day flight readiness  review.  </P> <P> During the 10-day mission, the astronauts are to release a Navy communications  satellite and then track down and retrieve for return to Earth a science  satellite that has been orbiting the globe for nearly six years.  </P> <P> Once the Long Duration Exposure Facility satellite is secure in the cargo bay,  the crew members are scheduled to conduct medical and materials processing  experiments for five days.  </P> <P> They said they are planning something special for their Christmas in space, but  would not reveal those plans.  </P> <P> The commander of the mission is Dan Brandenstein, the pilot is Jim Wetherbee  and mission specialists are Bonnie Dunbar, Marsha Ivins and David Low.  </P></p>

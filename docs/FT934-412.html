			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: How taxman finds out . . . I am aware that inheritance tax liability includes all gifts within the seven years before death. But how does the Inland Revenue know? I am not talking about deliberate evasion; but if I choose to draw cash out of my bank account, or cash in some shares, and give the money away now and again, how does the Revenue back-track on this if I die within seven years? If you make a gift, this is treated as a potentially exempt transfer which becomes fully exempt from tax once the period of seven years has elapsed. There is no need to declare the gift when it is made but, should you die within the seven-year period, it is necessary for the executors to declare all gifts made within the previous seven years when applying for probate. Therefore, each individual should keep records of gifts made so that the executors can get hold of the information, if required. Reply by Barry Stillerman of accountant Stoy Hayward.

			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> BRONCOS GO NOWHERE IF THE PLAYOFFS ARE SEEDED  </P> <P> The National Football League playoffs should have been seeded: 1. San Francisco  49ers, 2. Los Angeles Rams, 3. New York Giants, 4. Minnesota Vikings, 5.  Philadelphia Eagles, 6. Denver Broncos, 7. Cleveland Browns, 8. Buffalo Bills,  9. Houston Oilers, 10. Pittsburgh Steelers. Denver, as no better than the sixth  best in the 10-team field, wouldn't have made the semifinals if form held true.  </P> <P> With all due respect to Byrum Saam, who did baseball for 38 years in  Philadelphia and goes into the broadcasters' wing of the Hall of Fame this  summer, he was no Chuck Thompson, and Chuck still has his rather prominent  proboscis pressed against the window.  </P> <P> OK, if you must know, my "greatest" quarterback is Harry Agganis. And as far as  all the accolades being heaped on the 49ers are concerned, when they have  produced back-to-back unbeaten seasons like the Canton Bulldogs did, I'll  concur.  </P> <P> It was on Nov. 22 that Kirby Puckett became the first $3 million-a-year  ballplayer. And despite a half-dozen guys signing for more since, Kirby has not  demanded his contract be renegotiated. Quite a guy.  </P> <P> Earl Weaver reached a personal milestone in decorum while managing in the  Seniors League in Florida: He grabbed and tossed an umpire's hat into the  stands while arguing his ejection. "Never happened during the 96 times I was  tossed out in the major leagues," he said proudly.  </P> <P> It was during the recent Vinny Pazienza-Eddie Van Kirk fight in Providence,  R.I., that Hector Camacho leaped into the ring, grabbed a round card from one  of the ring girls, bared his chest and pranced around the ring. Yes, the  Pazienza-Camacho bout in Atlantic City, N.J., Saturday should be a real wowser.  </P> <P> Brian Williams not only changed schools, Maryland to Arizona, he changed  majors, communication to history. Kid doesn't know what he wants.  </P> <P> Strange sight in Philadelphia the other day: the hulking 10-foot bronze statue  of "Rocky," jack-hammered out of its moorings at the Spectrum, moving up Broad  Street on the way to the Museum of Art for filming in "Rocky V."  </P> <P> Gee, a weightlifter failed a drug test at the Commonwealth Games in New  Zealand, huh?  </P> <P> The Miami Heat is in the running to become only the 11th team in pro hoops  history to have more victories on the road than at home. The 22-60 Nets of  1976-77 won just 10 times at the Nassau Coliseum.  </P> <P> They don't make Continental Basketball Association all-star games like they  used to. The score of this year's contest was 107-105. Last year, the lads shot  the lights out (literally), 182-168. Power in the gym cut off and the teams had  to return the next day to conclude.  </P> <P> There were 1,162,033 ballots cast in NBA All-Star voting, and Michael Jordan  came away with just 321,114, less than 28 percent. Is this some sort of joke or  was Isiah Thomas doing the counting?  </P> <P> Is it possible the NCAA can't see that Nike logo on both the shirts and warmups  of Georgetown, a clear violation?  </P> <P> The list of the top heavyweights of all-time in a recent Boxing Illustrated  issue, not done in jest, had Sonny Liston and Larry Holmes 4-5 in front of Jack  Johnson (6), Jack Dempsey (7) and Rocky Marciano (8). Muhammad Ali, Joe Louis  and Mike Tyson are 1-2-3.  </P> <P> Joe Montana tosses a three-yard pass over the middle and Jerry Rice runs four  miles for a score. Yet Joe gets credit for the yardage and his passing  statistics go through the roof. This is as bad as some of Wilt Chamberlain's  rebound totals. Time was when no one contested Stilt for missed free throws  when he was on defense.  </P></p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Excalibur incurs Pounds 6m deficit and makes boardroom changes PRE-TAX losses of Pounds 6.2m for the year to April 30, a halved dividend and a new position of group chief executive were announced yesterday by Excalibur, the precision engineering and jewellery group. The outcome compared with profits of Pounds 20,000 last time, restated from Pounds 1.11m after applying FRS 3. However, Mr Michael Griffiths, chairman, said decisive action had been taken to eliminate loss-making businesses, and there were plans to sell some assets to strengthen the balance sheet, which was just over 100 per cent geared at the year end. The shares rose 1 1/2 p to 13p. Earlier this year they had jumped on bid speculation to 20 3/4 p, but fell back when talks with a possible buyer ended in May. Mr Richard Griffiths, the chairman's brother, is stepping down as managing director to be a non-executive, and Mr Arthur Church, is joining as group chief executive. Group sales fell from Pounds 65.1m to Pounds 61.6m. Profits from precision engineering came to Pounds 2.09m (Pounds 2.25m) after losses of about Pounds 500,000 at Hi-Ton. Giftware profits fell from Pounds 1.83m to Pounds 1.32m while jewellery losses rose to Pounds 1.81m (Pounds 1.14m). There were restructuring costs of Pounds 602,000 in precision engineering - where Hi-Ton will be merged with Burman on one site. Provisions of Pounds 5.78m against the jewellery division and interest of Pounds 1.42m (Pounds 1.82m) contributed to the pre-tax loss. Losses were 10.5p (0.1p). The final dividend is halved to 0.3p to give a total of 0.5p (1p).</p>

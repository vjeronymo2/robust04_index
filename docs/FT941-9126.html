			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Profits warning clips 5p off Argyll shares Argyll, the supermarket group, warned yesterday that fierce competition in the grocery market would reduce its profits this year, but announced a smaller underlying sales fall for the past four months than the City was expecting. The group, which includes Safeway, Presto and Lo-Cost, said the outcome for the year to April 2 would be 'slightly below last year', due to a fall in gross margins and like-for-like sales. That was before the effect of new depreciation policies, which will knock Pounds 40m off profits. The grocery sector faces looming saturation and the rapid growth of cut-price discounters, and has been rocked in recent weeks by statements from Argyll's rivals, Tesco and J Sainsbury. Tesco said it was cutting its expansion programme, while Sainsbury revealed a 1 per cent fall in underlying sales - leading to the biggest-ever one-day fall in its share price. But yesterday's news from Argyll knocked only 5p off its shares, which closed at 256p. Some analysts suggested that Argyll's comments about a recent recovery in margins, together with its rivals' insistence that they expected to hold margins at their new levels, indicated the market was stabilising. Sir Alistair Grant, Argyll chairman, said he privately agreed with the Sainsbury chairman, Mr David Sainsbury, that the 'hottest' period of price competition had passed, although further price cuts could not be ruled out. 'There have been no real winners in this recent period of competitive activity,' he said. 'But we are running our business on the basis that this is a very competitive market and we cannot be out of line with our competitors.' Total sales for the 16 weeks to February 5 were up 10.7 per cent. New stores added 11.1 per cent, while sales from existing stores fell 0.4 per cent - beating analysts' forecasts of a fall of 1 per cent or more. The decline resulted from 'exceptionally low inflation', including a fall in grocery prices in December, as well as trading down by customers to cheaper products and a fall in margins as Safeway responded to price-cutting by its rivals. Sir Alistair said Argyll's gross margin had fallen almost one percentage point. But it had recovered slightly in recent weeks as customers were buying more own-label products, with a higher margin, and increasing volumes had enabled Safeway to negotiate better terms with its suppliers. In spite of the profits fall, Argyll anticipates a final dividend of 7.75p, lifting the total from 10.9p to 11.5p, but said future increases would match earnings growth.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> General comments regarding the applicability and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suitability of the proposed oven exposure procedure are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested. Specific comments are also requested regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variation in the procedure, such as: The use of an oven  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> atmosphere other than air; if flow through the catalyst is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended; and the composition and flow rate of the gas or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gaseous mixture that is used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regardless of which method is used to age the catalyst, some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> means must be used to determine the effects of the aging process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the intended purpose of this process, the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> straightforward evaluation would involve the determination of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extent to which the performance characteristics of the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catalyst had been adversely affected. Of particular significance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be the adverse effect on the catalyst's conversion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capabilities with respect to the oxidation of HC and CO and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the reduction of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The use of a procedure which uses a synthetic exhaust gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mixture for evaluating the effects of thermal stressing is being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed for several reasons. One of the main reasons is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relative simplicity of such a procedure. For example, it would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not involve the questions regarding the in-use representativeness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of test parameters, such as the temperature of the mixture and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the duration of the test, that arise when a synthetic exhaust gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mixture is used for actually thermally stressing a catalyst. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation purposes, any fixed temperature which allowed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversion reactions of interest to occur could be specified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The specification of a particular exposure time would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required since the conversion efficiency existing as a result of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the previous thermal stressing would be involved rather than a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time-related change in efficiency. Furthermore, a procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which used synthetic exhaust gas would be simpler than a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure that used actual exhaust gas. Using synthetic exhaust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas mixtures alleviates the need for detailed information not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> readily available at this time. Another reason for proposing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of synthetic exhaust gas mixtures is the standardization that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results; all catalysts would be aged under the specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions that are proposed in subpart E of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. The composition of the synthetic exhaust gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mixture that is specified in this subpart is comparable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compositions of synthetic exhaust gas mixtures currently used by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catalyst manufacturers for testing related to the kinds of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines covered by the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments are solicited concerning these specifications,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly with regard to the chemical composition and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature of the synthetic exhaust mixture and its flow rate as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it enters the test catalyst.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A fixed catalyst efficiency loss limit of 20 percent for HC,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CO, and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is proposed in this notice on the basis of on-highway  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience and the absence of information at this time regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the conversion efficiencies that will be used with small engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To illustrate this loss limit, a catalyst with initial HC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversion efficiency of 50 percent would be required to maintain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at least a conversion efficiency of 40 percent after thermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aging.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments are requested regarding the use of a different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fixed deterioration limit. Comments are also requested regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the relative advantages and disadvantages of one fixed limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> versus several limits that are proportional to initial conversion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> V. Test Procedure Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA received a technical review of an early draft of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test procedure from the Small Engine Committee of the Society of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Automotive Engineers (SAE) in September 1993. EPA requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on several points mentioned in SAE's comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing that during each mode of the emission test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cycle, engine manufacturers collect and analyze exhaust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituents and measure engine parameters during a period of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time referred to as the ``sampling period.'' EPA is proposing that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sampling period be a minimum of four minutes long. The SAE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended test procedure J1088 recommends the sampling period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be ``*&blank;*&blank;* at least two minutes. Longer averaging times may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to ascertain the true time averaged emissions if data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variability over time is significant.'' Based on EPA's experience  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with several small (two to four kW) engines, a two-minute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> averaging time for idle modes is not sufficient to make accurate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel flow measurements. EPA requests comment on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriateness of a four minute averaging time, including any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available test data to substantiate an averaging time less than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> four minutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing that for the final calculation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brake-specific emission rate (gr/kWh), any power measured during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the idle mode not be included in the calculation for the reported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brake-specific emission rate. EPA believes the idle mode is, by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition, that engine operating mode during which no useful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work is performed. Any power measured during this mode is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of the frictional losses resulting from the dynamometer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is concerned that an engine manufacturer using an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inappropriately large dynamometer with a large frictional loss  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not provide an accurate measurement of the engine idle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mode. EPA believes it is inappropriate to include power generated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the engine to overcome the windage losses of the dynamometer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the calculation of emissions during the idle mode. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comment on the appropriateness of including power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measured by the dynamometer in the calculation of the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brake-specific emission rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAVY, EMIRATES IN JOINT GULF ACTION  </P> <P> The Pentagon today announced that U.S. Navy ships are holding a "short-notice  exercise" with forces of the United Arab Emirates in the Persian Gulf area,  where tensions have heightened over Iraqi threats against Kuwait.  </P> <P> At the State Department, meanwhile, spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said both  Iraq and Kuwait had built up their forces and U.S. officials are "very  concerned."  </P> <P> "Iraq and others know there is no place for coercion in a civilized world," she  said. "All disputes should be handled through peaceful means."  </P> <P> Pete Williams, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters he could provide no details  on the exercise beyond saying that it began Monday and that two Navy vessels  left early from their port at Bahrain, midway up the gulf, in order to  participate.  </P> <P> Williams declined to comment on the purpose of the maneuvers or say whether  they were scheduled before Iraqi President Saddam Hussein last Friday accused  Kuwait of stealing $2.4-billion worth of oil from wells on Iraqi territory and  of trying to wreck the Iraqi economy by conspiring to push down world oil  prices.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said of the situation today,  "We're concerned about the troop buildup by Iraq and we ask that all parties  strive to avoid violence."  </P> <P> Williams declined to comment on a Washington Post report today that U.S. Navy  ships in the gulf had been put on alert in response to the tensions between  Iraq and Kuwait. He said Pentagon policy prohibits any comment on alert status.  </P> <P> The Pentagon spokesman said U.S. policy toward the gulf region has not changed.  </P> <P> "We would take very seriously any threats . . . to U.S. friends in the region,"  he said.  </P> <P> When asked whether the United States would come to Kuwait's defense if attacked  by Iraq, Williams said he could not comment.  </P></p>

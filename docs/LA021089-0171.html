			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> SPORTS;  </P> <P> TROOPERS COOL RED-HOT CANSECO  </P> <P> Jose Canseco, named most valuable player of the American League last year for  his speed on the baseball diamond, was cited for the speed of his 1989 Jaguar  in Miami early today.  </P> <P> The 24-year-old Cuban-born Canseco was stopped after his bright red car was  spotted going an estimated 125 m.p.h. on Interstate 95 in south Broward County.  Troopers caught up with him in north Dade County at about 1:25 a.m., said  Florida Highway Patrol spokesman Lt. Tim Betts. The Oakland A's right fielder  was cited for reckless driving and allowed to drive home, Betts said. "He was  very reasonable. He did not deny it or say he did it," said Betts. "He just  accepted his ticket."  </P> <P> The penalty for reckless driving could be imprisonment for up to 90 days, or a  fine of $25 to $500, or both, Betts said.  </P></p>

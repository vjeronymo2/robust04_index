			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERATORS CHARGED BUT CLINICS ARE OPEN ANYWAY  </P> <P> A day after seven people were accused of operating four clinics with bogus  medical personnel, two of the clinics were open and attracting a steady stream  of patients in the heavily immigrant Westlake district Saturday.  </P> <P> Young Latino families, carrying small babies and trailing children in frilly  white dresses, climbed the steps to the Santa Ines and Bonnie Brae medical  clinics at 2033 W. 7th St. Several of those questioned said they had not heard  of the arrests.  </P> <P> That may change soon. "That situation will be addressed next week," said  Michael Qualls, a spokesman for the city attorney's office.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plan Not Disclosed  </P> <P> He declined to be specific, but indicated that there will be an attempt to shut  down the clinics. The likely avenue for doing so, he indicated, will be a civil  complaint. "The enforcement action is not concluded," he said.  </P> <P> The clinics were treating up to 1,000 people a week, according to City Atty.  James K. Hahn. But he said it appears that only two of the medical personnel  were licensed in any health care profession. The rest of the staff -- 15 people  -- "were not licensed to provide the general health care they were giving,"  Hahn said Friday.  </P> <P> The clinics advertised treatments that included X-rays, therapy and accident  care. One young man entered the Santa Ines clinic on crutches. A spokeswoman  for the operators, who refused to identify herself, denied access to the clinic  to a reporter.  </P> <P> "There's no comment until after the trial," she said.  </P> <P> Two of the clinics, San Cristobal Medical Clinic in Boyle Heights and La  Familia Health Center in Wilmington, were closed Saturday. Green graffiti  reading "ick" was sprayed on the glass window of the San Cristobal clinic.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Began in 1983  </P> <P> Among those charged in the case is Salvador Cano, 38, of Santa Ana, president  of Santa Ines Medical Enterprises Inc., the corporate owner of the clinics,  which began operating in 1983.  </P> <P> Also accused was Cano's wife, Enriqueta Silva, 40, a doctor, who worked at the  clinic; James E. Mack, 68, of Studio City, a disbarred attorney; Kelly S.  Klatt, 36, of San Pedro, a Los Angeles police officer on disability leave;  Klatt's wife, Samantha, 37; Alan B. Miller, 38, of Van Nuys, administrator of  the clinics, and Frank Hegyi, 47, of Los Angeles, another clinic administrator.  </P> <P> They are charged in a 74-count indictment with practicing medicine without a  license, forging a prescription, falsely advertising as a doctor, and other  misdemeanors.  </P> <P> They also are charged with violations of the state Labor Code and Unemployment  Insurance Code, stemming from the alleged exploitation of their work force.  Employees were required to work 10- to 12-hour shifts without any days off,  according to investigators.  </P> <P> Salvador Perez took his 2-month-old son, Milton, to the clinic Saturday. But he  left after a few minutes.  </P> <P> "They no have doctors," the 30-year-old father said in halting English. He  shrugged and disappeared into the morning throng along Alvarado Street.  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in  Japanese at 0045 GMT on 20 February in its "Discussion" program  carries a 15-minute live interview with Social Democratic Party  of Japan [SDPJ] General Secretary Wataru Kubo on the cabinet  reshuffle being planned by Prime Minister Hosokawa.  Interviewers are NHK commentator Takashi Yamamoto and Tokyo  University professor Takeshi Sasaki.    Asked about the SDPJ's position on Prime Minister  Hosokawa-proposed cabinet reshuffle, Kubo says: "We believe the  cabinet reshuffle should not be carried out if it weakens the  centripetal force of the ruling parties. Therefore, it would be  best not to reshuffle the cabinet during the current, crucial  period in which the Diet is being held."    He adds: "I know the prime minister has the arbitrary power  to reshuffle the cabinet. However, as we are a coalition  government, he should get the full understanding of the  coalition partners. As members of the coalition government, we  are seriously concerned about the possibility the cabinet  reshuffle will produce negative results."    Citing rumors the purpose of the cabinet reshuffle is to  replace Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura, Yamamoto asks for  Kubo's view.    Kubo says: "If a cabinet reshuffle is done simply to change  certain ministers, it should not be termed a cabinet reshuffle."    He adds: "I do not think the cabinet should be reshuffled if  the purpose is just to remove certain ministers, and it is not a  good idea to carry out a reshuffle at present because Diet  deliberations on the supplementary budget are about to begin."    He says any reshuffle should be carried out after the  immediate political issues have been solved.    Kubo is asked about current relations between Prime Minister  Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura. He says their  relations are not as bad as reported.    He says: "We cannot do anything about it if the prime  minister decides to reshuffle the cabinet because it is needed  to keep the ruling parties united, or if he believes that unless  there is a reshuffle, it will be difficult to deal with the  current ordinary Diet session and the many important political  issues."    He is asked how the party will respond when its chairman,  Murayama, is asked by the prime minister to join the cabinet as  minister in charge of political reform in place of minister  Yamahana, who is an SDPJ member?    Kubo says: "It's up to the chairman."    Yamamoto takes up the issue of political realignment and  asks  if the SDPJ has agreed with Sakigake and the Democratic  Socialist Party [DSP] to create a new political force. Kubo  denies this, saying there is no behind-the-scenes agreement.    He also asks Kubo about the next general election, which  will  be held under the new electoral system.    Kubo says: "I think the ruling parties have to cooperate  with each other as much as possible in the election. There is a  feeling that the ruling parties should be unified into one party  to win the election. I do not think it is right."    He says he feels it is impossible for the ruling parties to  become one because of their differences in political ideals. He  suggests, though, that Japan may enter an era in which  politicians are divided into new conservatives and new  reformists.    He is asked if it is inevitable that the SDPJ will split in  the process of promoting realignment in the political world.  Kubo says it is impossible to get along with party members who  are negative about being part of the coalition government.    At 0115 GMT the interview ends.</p>

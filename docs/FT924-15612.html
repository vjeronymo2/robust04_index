			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Markets: The excitement of being safe and boring - The Bottom Line SHAREHOLDERS in the water and electricity companies might be forgiven for being startled - and for wondering what to do now. Their apparently 'safe and boring' investments have outperformed the stock market steadily since the general election in April - water by 50 per cent by the end of August and electricity by 25 per cent. But after sterling's exit from the ERM they have abruptly lost half that relative gain. This week's call for lower water charges from Ofwat, the water industry regulator, also reminded the market that utilities remain highly regulated. The case for holding the stocks - which used to be relatively straightforward - has become more complex. Many small shareholders of utilities picked up the stock in the privatisations, water in 1989 and electricity in 1990. The conventional wisdom for holding them is that they are 'safe' investments, quasi-bonds. They pay a relatively high yield to compensate for relatively modest growth prospects. But with little competition entering their markets, they generate profits and dividends which are less sensitive to the economic cycle than many industries. These qualities have come to the fore in the recession. However that picture is complicated by several factors. Political risk disappeared with the general election result. But both water and the regional electricity companies remain highly regulated by watchdogs which have proved they are not shy of intervening. Last week Ofwat told the water companies that they must hold back the increase in next year's prices by two percentage points, and a wider review of industry pricing is due in 1994. Water and electricity also face the threat of new environmental legislation, both from Britain and the EC. The electricity industry has spent nearly Pounds 1bn on limiting sulphur emissions, and water companies are in the middle of an investment programme of up to Pounds 42bn to meet EC directives. But many stockbrokers are arguing that the attractions of the stocks still outweigh the disadvantages, particularly if the market's first hopes that the ERM exit meant a fast economic recovery prove too optimistic. The lack of overseas profits for both water and electricity means they are less affected than many by the depreciation of sterling. As their annual price rises are linked to inflation under the regulatory formula, they may be able to protect margins better than other companies, provided they control costs. However, their greatest attraction remains the dividend growth as dividends for many companies on the stock market are likely to grow more slowly than they did in the 1980s. Analysts expect the water companies to pay out increases above the rate of inflation of 4 to 5 per cent a year until the 1995 industry review, and 2 to 3 per cent afterwards. For the electricity companies, expectations are 6 to 8 per cent real growth until 1995, and 4 to 5 per cent thereafter. Brokers are at present divided in recommending whether to sell and take the profits that still remain, or to buy more, taking advantage of the recent weakness. According to Peter Hyde, analyst at stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson Securities, last week's intervention by Ofwat 'was a reminder that regulation is tightening' but he feels that many investors are still likely to be tempted by the security and defensive qualities of the water stocks. In the present day-by-day economic turbulence there is a good case for holding on, at least until the macroeconomic picture becomes clearer and the rival attractions of faster-growing companies can be assessed.</p>

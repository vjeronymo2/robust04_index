			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Reinsurance row grows with talk of legal action NCM, the Dutch company which is Britain's largest short-term export credit insurer, is considering legal action over the European Commission's plans to tighten curbs on government subsidies to export finance. The possible action is the latest twist in a UK campaign to secure changes in the proposed regulations, which, it is feared, would unfairly penalise British credit insurers and exporters. Mr Colin Foxall, NCM's managing director, has written to Mr Karel Van Miert, the European competition commissioner, saying that part of the draft EU regulations on short-term credit insurance could give rise to a legal challenge. NCM is concerned by the assertion that UK government financing of a small part of the country's reinsurance exposure constitutes a state aid and is therefore anti-competitive. Britain and NCM have insisted that the financing, through the Export Credit Guarantee Department, is available purely on a contingency basis to cushion against the risk of sudden shortages of reinsurance capacity. The government also argues that the UK's reforms of its reinsurance market have brought it closer than any other EU member to the free-market operation which the commission's proposed rules are intended to encourage. The UK says the current proposals could lead either to the complete withdrawal of government support, threatening the stability of the reinsurance market, or could increase the scope for government subsidy. Mr Van Miert is sympathetic to these arguments. He agreed last July to delay publication of the final rules until this autumn while the commission tried to accommodate the UK's objections. However, it is understood the commission is still not prepared to do more than offer the UK a waiver from the rules until 1997.</p>

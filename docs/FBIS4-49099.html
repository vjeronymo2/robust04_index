			<p>BFN     [Text] Golmud, May 2 (XINHUA) -- A meeting was held here  Sunday [1 May] to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the opening  to traffic of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, a railway line with the  highest altitude in the world winding across the Qinghai-Tibet  Plateau of China.    The first phase of the railway, starting from Xining,  capital  city of Qinghai Province, and ending at Golmud, a city of the  same province where the railway meets the Qinghai-Tibet Highway,  was completed and opened to traffic exactly ten years ago.    Linking the remote "roof of the world" with vast domestic  areas, the 846.9-kilometer railway is truly a life artery of  the Tibet Autonomous Region and Qinghai Province.    Most parts of the line pass through either freezing areas on  high ice-capped mountains or harsh deserts that are frequently  stricken by natural disasters.    Its construction has cost years of devotion and diligence by  more than 10,000 young technicians and workers--and even their  lives--as well as huge state investment.    Also thanks to the efforts and self-sacrifice of innumerable  workers, the Qinghai-Tibet Railway has been well maintained  during the ten-year period of operation.    Several advanced units and outstanding individuals were  rewarded for their dedication at the meeting.    They were honored for their victory in a kind of struggle  not  only with adverse natural conditions but also with their inner  selves, while working all year round in extremely desolate  places along the railway line.    Their sweat and blood have been rewarded with vitality and  hope brought about by the steel dragons moving on the line.    During the past decade, four million passengers and 15  million tons of cargo have been transported via the railway.    Difficulty in communication between Tibet and other parts of  the country has been greatly relieved.    Local people suddenly find themselves among colorful  products  from all over the country, while veils over the mysterious land  have also been lifted, with rich local mineral resources being  exploited and more and more people riding the rails to visit or  trade here.</p>

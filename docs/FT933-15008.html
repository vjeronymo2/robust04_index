			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Books: Malice, misery and the married classes - Andrew Adonis eavesdrops on the violent reality of aristocratic liaisons BROKEN LIVES: SEPARATION AND DIVORCE IN ENGLAND 1660-1857 by Lawrence Stone Oxford Pounds 16.95, 355 pages THIS IS the third of Lawrence Stone's volumes on marriage in early modern England. A fascinating collection of case studies of marital discord among the 17th and 18th century upper classes, it follows an analytical study and a volume of case studies of the making of marriages in the period. However, Broken Lives stands on its own, and might best be recommended not as an accompaniment to Stone's earlier tomes but as a follow-up - moving backwards, as it were - to Lady Chatterley for those who found their Sunday sex insufficiently explicit or violent. Skip the scholarly introduction, and get straight down to Chapter 1: Botler v. Botler, the battered wife. One groom apart, in Broken Lives the servants know their place - which is alternately to save their mistresses from being battered to death, to spy on their illicit liaisons the better to extract silence money thereafter, and, when the inevitable case for cruelty, adultery, annulment, separation, alimony, or a variable combination of them, reached the ecclesiastical courts (whose records are the main source for the study), to provide the peep-hole and sheet-stain evidence critical to success or failure. Divorce, of course, was not available until 1857 - the best one could hope for was annulment on grounds of impotence, which again depended heavily on the sheets. A few chapters in, you become accustomed to the cultural idiosyncracies of yesteryear, such as the total ignorance of the reproductive system and the almost unfettered control of the men over property and children. If the individuals portrayed here (admittedly they are an exceptional lot, even of their own class in their own day) were not so unrelentingly selfish, one could even sympathise with those trapped in a society that was starting to tie sex to love yet still requiring its social leaders to treat their marriages as business deals, and forbidding them from seeking satisfaction elsewhere. Yet the sheer violence continues to amaze. And this of the very rich to the very rich. Take Dineley v. Dineley. In 1717 Sir John Dineley, Bart., grandson of a deputy-governor of Bombay whose son secured a baronetcy and a seat in Parliament through marriage to a Worcestershire heiress, in turn married Mary Lawford, the 14-year-old heiress to a Bristol merchant's fortune. Neither was quite typical: he, a second son not expected to inherit, had been sent to sea; she was almost illiterate, which was unusual for one of her station by that time. But in marriage he acted to form, and was sufficiently pukka to be made a local JP. A man of violent disposition, Sir John was frequently given to kicking Mary out of bed at night and locking her out of the house. When Mary quarrelled with his mistress, he chained her to a post in the garret. She, in turn, grew familiar with Sir Robert Jason, a neighbour, and took to the bottle. The crunch came when Sir John feared that his wife, off to the races at Chipping Campden, was about to elope with Sir Robert. Again beaten and chained to a post in the garret - and only released, black and blue, when the local gossip became intolerable - Mary sued for separation with alimony on grounds of cruelty. The case ran for nine years, consumed much of their combined fortune, but ended up with Mary in prison and in penury. Meanwhile, Sir John engaged in a bitter quarrel with his equally violent younger brother Samuel, heir to the Dineley estates under their father's will. Depriving Samuel of his reversion became his life's passion. By a complicated ruse, requiring the consent of his (now adult) son whom he had deserted to abject poverty and near death in London, Sir John succeeded in doing so. Samuel's revenge was to hire some ruffians, abduct Sir John from the streets of Bristol in broad daylight, bundle him into a barge, get the ruffians drunk, and then set them to throttle his brother in his presence - the murder taking about half an hour. Discovered, Samuel was hanged before an enormous crowd, after praying: 'Lord do not reward me according to my desserts.' By the end of the book, the notion of just desserts seems far-fetched. Then is the time to turn to the introduction, where Stone makes excellent sense of it all.</p>

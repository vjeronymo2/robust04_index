			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / R-R faces US challenge over jet trainer engine ROLLS-ROYCE is facing a challenge from Garrett, the US aero-engine maker, for a slice of the Pounds 400m business to power the US Navy's new T-45 Goshawk jet trainer built by McDonnell Douglas and BAe. The UK engine maker is providing its Adour engine, jointly produced with Turbomeca of France, for the T-45 programme. The first T-45 aircraft, a modified version of BAe's Hawk trainer, was rolled out at McDonnell-Douglas' St Louis plant last Thursday. The US Navy needs 268 T-45 aircraft, which, with a complete training and support system, represent about Dollars 4.5bn (Pounds 2.5bn) worth of business for the partners in the programme. These include McDonnell-Douglas, the prime contractor; BAe, principal airframe sub-contractor; Rolls-Royce, the engine supplier; and Hughes, providing the simulators. The programme is one of the biggest Anglo-US collaboration ventures in military aircraft, at a time of decline in the defence aerospace sector. Rolls-Royce and Turbomeca seemed secure as the engine suppliers for the T-45. But Garrett has proposed supplying a new version of its F-124 turbofan as an alternative to the Rolls-Royce-Turbomeca Adour engine. Garrett's proposal is to introduce the F-124 engine variant it is considering developing for the US Navy's new trainer on the T-45 production line from the 97th aircraft by mid-1996. Rolls-Royce successfully fought off an earlier attempt a few years ago by Garrett controlled to develop an engine for the Hawk in competition with the Adour. While not under-estimating the latest challenge, the UK company appears confident it will again be able to fend off its US competitor on the T-45 programme. Mr David Marshall, commercial director for Rolls-Royce military engines, said one of the big advantages of the Adour engine was its proven track record. He confirmed that the T-45 programme was expected to lead to Pounds 200m in engine sales for the Rolls-Royce-Turbomeca Adour partnership and a further Pounds 200m in spares and support. France has shown interest in the new US Navy trainer. BAe and McDonnell Douglas have put a proposal to the French Navy including an option to supply 40 T-45 aircraft with another, involving 15 aircraft. Under heavy defence budgetary pressures, Paris is unlikely to take a decision before next year.</p>

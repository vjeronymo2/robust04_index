			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Letter: Not EC figures I was astonished to see that on February 12 you carried on the front page a table entitled '1992 EC Budget', quoting the European Commission as its source. The Commission has consistently refused to publish any such table showing a breakdown of net balances by country. Given that the debate about net balances now appears to be running in the UK, I think it appropriate to point out that European Community integration makes such calculation increasingly difficult. How, for example, do you break down and assess the efforts made at Community level by each member state in order to improve research and training and to meet the EC's commitments abroad? There could be a margin of error of up to 15 per cent, which clearly illustrates the shortcomings of such an exercise. Bruno Dethomas, Commission of the European Communities, Brussels</p>

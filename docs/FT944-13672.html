			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (16): Making savings all round - Reduced business travel is not the only benefit of video-conferencing After a series of false starts, video-conferencing is taking off. Tumbling prices and smaller systems - including the first desktop systems - mean that video-conferencing can now provide a real alternative to business travel. In 1984, a video-conferencing system would have cost Pounds 250,000 according to Phil Simmonds, marketing manager of GPT Communications Services. 'Today, a professional quality system the size of a television set can be bought for around 10 per cent of that price,' says Mr Simmonds. And it is possible to buy systems which are even smaller and cheaper. There are three main types of video-conferencing system: large systems designed to equip video-conferencing studios for between Pounds 25,000 and Pounds 30,000; smaller roll-about (movable) systems for between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds 17,000, and desktop systems. BT, for example, sells a desktop system the size of a portable television for Pounds 5,999. A lower cost option than using a dedicated video-conferencing unit is to add video-conferencing capabilities to a personal computer. Judith Jeffcoate of the research consultancy Ovum believes that between 1996 and the end of 1998, revenues from PCs equipped for video-conferencing will exceed those from conventional video-conferencing equipment. An increasing number of suppliers have developed or are selling systems of this kind including Canada-based Northern Telecom (with the Visit system distributed by UK computer dealers P&amp;P), US semiconductor company Intel, AT&amp;T GIS (Global Information Solutions), BT, IBM, Apple, Picturetel, Olivetti and Griffin Sight &amp; Sound. Some computers now come fully equipped for video-conferencing, allowing users to transmit live video images of themselves to other, similarly-equipped users, and to see on their PC the person they are talking to. For example, Sun Microsystems sells a Unix workstation which includes camera, real-time video capture and compression and a storage disk. But most users will have to buy a special kit if they want to carry out a video-conference in a window on their personal computer. For example, Olivetti, IBM, BT and ICL sell kits which include a small video camera which sits on top of the PC, a card which slots into the PC and software (some of the hardware in these kits was developed by BT). The kit makes it possible for users to transmit still or moving video images, photographs or sound. In most cases users will also need an ISDN (digital) phone line to enable them to carry out a phone conversation and transmit data (such as video images) at the same time. Many PC-based products allow people engaged in a video-conference to point to or edit information they can both see on their screens. Intel says that with its system, users at far-flung sites can edit a report together, both looking at the same version on their screens. The systems is modular so US users can either buy the ProShare shared editing software separately or the full kit. New products are also coming to the market. In late October, BT plans to launch Presence, which it describes as the UK's first self-contained desktop ISDN videophone and the VC6000 roll-about video-conferencing system. A report from the Economist Intelligence Unit, International Business Travel: a changing profile, suggests that video-conferencing will gain popularity. 'Video-conferencing is perceived to have several benefits and it is perhaps the ability to streamline travel costs that is considered to be the major one,' says the report. Benefits can include: Time savings. Citibank Europe saves 200 man hours of travel time per month by using video-conferencing for Europe-USA staff meetings and its chairman's speeches. Cost savings. ICL, the UK computer company owned by Fujitsu of Japan, says it makes 50 per cent savings on travel costs through using video-conferencing for board meetings and links with Japan. Faster product development. When Ford of Europe introduced video-conferencing it helped to cut down product-development times. Staff at different sites can hold a video-conference to sort out a problem, rather than travelling for a day. Greater team spirit. Ford also believes that video-conferencing helps to hold different groups together. Shorter meetings. Users of studio-based systems such as pharmaceutical company SmithKline Beecham, find that video-conferencing promotes regular, shorter meetings. This is because its video-conferencing suites are booked in advance, end automatically, and are often charged out to the department using them. Better access to experts. UK high-street bank National Westminster has installed a number of AT&amp;T videolink services at 10 branches. This allows customers to speak directly from their local branch to NatWest's household insurance specialists located in Bristol. But video-conferencing systems have their limitations. Mr Simmonds says: 'They aren't good for the initial meeting with someone - it's better to meet people first in the flesh.' This is especially true of PC-based systems, which usually provide video images at 15 frames a second. At this speed, images will be jerky, so if business contacts make even small movements, it will look as if they are swaying around wildly. As well as keeping still, it is also important to try and establish eye contact by looking into the camera, whether in a one-to-one or a large video-conferencing meeting. In larger, 'multipoint' video-conferencing meetings, people should speak one at a time, because it is harder than in face-to-face meetings to listen to a babble of voices. Adrian Butcher, BT's general manager for videotelephony, says a number of factors must be considered when conducting a video-conference, but 'multipoint tends to encourage the disciplines that ought to prevail in a business meeting. People tend to think about what they are going to say before they say it, and there is usually a chairman in charge'. He believes that, unlike many technologies, video-conferencing systems (especially the smaller ones) can sometimes pay for themselves immediately through savings in travel costs. But he does not think that businesses should look at cost savings alone. 'The real power of these systems comes from faster decision-making,' he says. 'Suddenly, dialogue can proceed at the speed of dialogue, not at the speed of people's diaries.'</p>

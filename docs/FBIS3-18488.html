			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Wider Still and Wider"] </F>   [Text] After four days of exhausting negotiation, partial  victory is within sight. Sweden, Finland and Austria yesterday  signalled acceptance of the terms offered for their entry to the  European Union [EU]. If the deal is endorsed in the promised  referendums, the EU's borders will be extended from next January  east to the Russian frontier and north beyond the Arctic Circle.    The inclusion of these three rich, stable democracies ends  the long and unfortunate exclusion of Scandinavia and the Alps  from the political and economic mainstream. Apart from Denmark,  no country from Europe's northernmost tier has been able to  bring to the continental union its enormous assets: a rich  history, a vibrant culture, a deeply embedded commitment to  democracy, a disproportionate influence within the United  Nations and a moral outreach far beyond the lakes and forests of  its isolated region.    Britain has long pressed for their inclusion; enlargement of  the Community was the main task the British presidency set  itself. Federalists feared that widening would prevent deepening  and would dilute the cohesion of the cosy continental club. If  this was ever true, it only strengthened the argument for  enlargement. British sympathy for its former partners in the  European Free Trade Association may have played a part, as may  the unvoiced hope that northern Protestant rectitude would be a  useful counterbalance to the more excitable political traditions  of the Mediterranean.    The disappointment yesterday was that only three instead of  four applicants were able to clinch agreement. Hours after the  expiration of Monday's midnight deadline, Austria was still  locked in tense negotiations, mostly over its insistence on  keeping a limit for the next 10 years on heavy lorries crossing  the Alps, worries that alpine chalets will be snapped up by  non-Austrians and difficulties in compensating high-cost  mountain farmers who must cut prices to EU levels. But at the  last moment a deal was struck.    Norway, by contrast, was always the most problematic  applicant. It has admitted deadlock and put off further  discussions until next week. Its failure to conclude a deal  would be deeply disappointing. Even the Austrian Government,  once buoyed by public opinion, has seen a steady fall in support  for membership as one issue after another -- the environment,  traditional neutrality, disillusion over Brussels bureaucracy  and a growing right-wing Austria-first nationalism -- has  undermined the case for membership.    Norway, on the rim of Europe, is a much more difficult case.  Norwegians, separate from Sweden for less than a century, care  passionately about their sovereignty, their fisheries and their  simple way of life on their sparse, long northern coastline.  All are under threat, and the Spanish demand for access to  Norwegian fishing waters may be the last straw that turns a  suspicious public against any outcome. Once before Norway has  fallen at the final hurdle. Another rebuff would so scar the  political establishment that no Oslo government might be able to  contemplate membership again.    Even in Finland and Sweden, public opinion cannot yet be  taken for granted. Finland is probably now the most  pro-membership, converted by its current recession and the new  security threat from an unstable Russia. If a referendum is  held here first, the result might encourage wavering Swedish and  Austrian voters. All four countries have made substantial  concessions to accept the entire EU post-Maastricht deal.  Brussels must now do its utmost to offer terms that Norway can  accept. A wider union is a better union, one that in the future  must also include Central and East Europe.</p>

Exactly 22 years ago, our heroic and combative revolutionary  POOR PEOPLE'S GUERRILLA ARMY-EGP-emerged. Today it is an active  URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] member. TO  STRUGGLE AGAINST SOCIAL INJUSTICES.    On this 19 January we are 22 years old, taking the  revolutionary message to the poor people, Indians, and  Spanish-speaking Indians [ladinos], to our brothers seeking  peace with social justice, respect for human rights, and  economic and political changes. We have achieved acceptance by  the people in general.    The government and Army have tried to defeat us militarily  with great offensives against our war fronts during 1987 to 1988  and during February and May 1993, which ended with a suspension  of the dialogue and the fall of Serrano Elias. Our fighters and  cadres have known how to face and defeat Army offensives.    We firmly continue our revolutionary struggle and are  willing  to sign peace if the government and Army accept to make deep  human rights, economic, and political changes in the country.  If this is not the case, the armed struggle shall continue,  because they have never defeated us.    UNTIL WE REACH FINAL VICTORY    POOR PEOPLE'S GUERRILLA ARMY - EGP -    THE PEOPLE WHO ORGANIZE    PEOPLE WHO TRIUMPH!    LONG LIVE THE 22D EGP ANNIVERSARY!    LONG LIVE THE CUC!

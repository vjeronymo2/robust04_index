The delegation was here  at an invitation of the regional autonomous government of  Madrid, the Chamber of Trade and Commerce, and Spanish business  circles showing high interest in developing cooperation with  Kazan.    At a news conference here, Mintimer Shaymiyev noted that  "the  results of the meetings and talks in Madrid have exceeded all  our hopes." In the course of the visit a whole range of  agreements on development of bilateral economic cooperation, as  well as on cultural and information exchanges were signed.    Answering the question on Tatarstan's relations with the  Russian central government, the president, in particular, said:  "At the moment, we are finalizing our work on establishing  relations between Russia and Tatarstan on the basis of a series  of agreements. I have recently met with Boris Yeltsin and Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and I hope that in February we can  even sign the treaty on the division and delegation of powers.  On 13 March elections will be held in Tatarstan to the Russian  Federal Assembly where our republic is not represented at the  moment." "We always had and still enjoy a high level of mutual  understanding with President Yeltsin and this will guarantee  successful solution of the disputed issues and stability of our  relations, as well as continuation of the democratization  process in Russia," stressed the president of Tatarstan.</p>

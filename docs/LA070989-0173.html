			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRIME RISE TRIGGERS A NEW SWEEP ON GANGS  </P> <P> As new statistics revealed a 9.2% increase in the number of crimes citywide,  Los Angeles police continued their weekend sweep of gang-infested  neighborhoods, arresting more than 185 people, including at least 153 suspected  gang members.  </P> <P> The arrests were part of the Los Angeles Police Department's periodic  "Operation Hammer" to combat gang- and drug-related crimes.  </P> <P> Operation Hammer, which was introduced last year, is one of the task forces the  Police Department is using to blitz the rising number of crimes citywide, said  LAPD spokesman Lt. Fred Nixon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Story in Figures  </P> <P> Statistics released Friday showed there were 162,711 major crimes recorded in  Los Angeles during the first six months of 1989, compared to 149,021 in the  same period last year.  </P> <P> There were also increases in almost all categories of serious crimes. Robberies  rose 19.9%, with 14,654 robberies committed between Jan. 1 and June 30,  compared with 12,214 in the same period last year. The next sharpest rise was  in aggravated assaults, which rose 18% to 21,355 so far this year, compared to  18,065 last year. Auto thefts were up 14.6%; homicides rose 14.5% to 395 so far  this year; auto burglaries increased 7.1%; thefts from autos were up 3.2% and  rapes rose 0.2% to 992.  </P> <P> The only crimes showing a decline were thefts from people -- down 14.5% -- and  burglaries -- down by 4.3%.  </P> <P> "With the numbers being no more encouraging than they are," Nixon said, Police  Chief Daryl F. Gates "is mandating his managers to reverse that."  </P> <P> On Friday and Saturday evenings, an extra 200 officers were deployed in  neighborhoods in Rampart, Northeast, Newton, Hollenbeck and Central areas.  About 60 arrests were made early Saturday night, most of them suspected gang  members, said Sgt. John Fletcher. The sweep was scheduled to continue into this  morning. On Friday, police spokesmen said they made 127 arrests and seized six  cars. The seizure of suspected gang members' cars is an important part of  Operation Hammer, police say.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Less Mobility  </P> <P> Said Sgt. Steve Tuohy: "If we get a carload of gang members and we have any  legal justification, we impound the car. We use that as a tool to take away  their wheels for a bit. It gives them less mobility."  </P> <P> Despite the increased patrols, police reported that five people were wounded in  gang-related shootings early Saturday. In South-Central Los Angeles, two male  gang members and a teen-age girl were wounded in a drive-by shooting. The names  of the three victims were not immediately released.  </P> <P> Another unidentified man was wounded in the buttocks in what police say was a  gang-related drive-by shooting in Lincoln Heights early Saturday morning. And  police reported that another man was shot and wounded in the foot about 1 a.m.  Saturday southwest of downtown.  </P></p>

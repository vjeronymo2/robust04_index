			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STRIKE  </P> <P> Comedian Rodney Dangerfield will sit out another appearance at Bally's Hotel  and Casino in Las Vegas rather than cross musicians' picket lines, but the  Pointer Sisters and singer Engelbert Humperdinck are expected to keep their  scheduled dates this week. The Pointers, who refused to cross the picket line  earlier, are set to play Caesars Palace tonight through Monday. Humperdinck was  scheduled to begin Tuesday night at the Las Vegas Hilton. He performed earlier  this year despite the strike, then quit midway through the engagement to honor  the line. Musicians have been on strike for 20 weeks over the issue of taped  music and guaranteed work. Several entertainers have honored the picket lines,  but more are beginning to return to the showrooms. Dangerfield, who was to open  Thursday, says he is "very anxious to go back to work, but I find it  emotionally very difficult to go out and tell jokes while this unpleasant  situation still exists."

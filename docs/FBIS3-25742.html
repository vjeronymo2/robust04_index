			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Acting President Eduardo dos Santos wound up his  visit to the French capital yesterday. He had arrived in Paris  on 23 February and, according to diplomatic sources, the three  days of his visit translated into a resounding failure. The  Futungo de Belas Palace chieftain did not come anywhere near  achieving the goals he had set for himself on this trip, because  the French Government is rather reluctant to provide economic  and military aid to Luanda.    In what must have been a major shock to the strongman at  Luanda's Futungo de Belas Palace, the French authorities said  that everyone is waiting for the outcome of the Lusaka talks.  It is worth noting that Eduardo dos Santos was granted an  audience by French President Francois Mitterrand yesterday. The  unelected president of Angola is now packing his bags and will  be returning to Luanda today, after his visit turned out to be a  complete failure and he found that many people in the French  capital contested his regime. Angolan, French, and Italian  citizens gathered to demonstrate against his presence in the  fatherland of Charles de Gaulle. Those people, who are the  friends of Angola and of the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola, UNITA, unreservedly asked for an end to  the carnage that Eduardo dos Santos has been masterminding in  this country. They carried placards and shouted the following  slogans: We want Angola to be free of massacres by the Riot  Police! Dos Santos, free the thousands of political prisoners  you are still holding! Return the bodies of the UNITA peace  negotiators who were murdered in Luanda!    That demonstration, which took place in front of Luanda's  embassy in the French capital, received direct support from a  number of French parties that maintain friendly relations with  UNITA.    Observers have made it clear that the Futungo de Belas  Palace  chieftain's visit to Paris was both premature and poorly  planned. No head of state has ever been as humiliated in Europe  as Eduardo dos Santos was in his visit to France. Luanda's  strongman failed miserably and was unable to achieve his goals.  The government led by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur was very  rigorous, stuck to its promises, and did not allow the Popular  Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party to buy any  weapons or combat helicopters. The team led by Eduardo dos  Santos had already been preparing to engage in such talks.    The Futungo de Belas chieftain was not received by powerful  Defense Minister Francois Leotard or by the mayor of the city of  Paris, a very important figure in the European Community.  Moreover, the French media covered only very sparsely the  Luanda chieftain's visit, which wound up yesterday. The few  newspapers that have reported on the visit have noted that the  government led by Eduardo dos Santos has remained insensitive to  the Angolan people's suffering. [passage omitted]</p>

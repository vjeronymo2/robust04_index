			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Books: Ben after the Booker SONGS OF ENCHANTMENT by Ben Okri Cape Pounds 14.99, 297 pages TALLER WOMEN by Lawrence Naumoff Flamingo Pounds 5.99, 289 pages FUCKING MARTIN by Dale Peck Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 9.99, 228 pages ST PATRICK'S DAUGHTER by Margaret Mulvihill Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 14.99, 252 pages THE BOOKER PRIZE casts a long shadow, although whether for good or evil is open to debate. Some authors never write another book after winning Britain's top literary award; others write the same one again and again, in the hope of reliving past glories. Some achieve only fleeting fame, others become so notorious that the mere mention of their name can start a riot. And always there is that nagging feeling: after the Booker, what next? For Ben Okri, who won it two years ago with The Famished Road, the answer is a sequel, Songs of Enchantment, which takes up more or less where the earlier book left off. Azaro the spirit child is older now, growing up in a world as crazy as ever, living with his parents in dire poverty while all around him an unnamed African country slides inexorably into chaos. This is a land where foreheads catch fire, eyes fall from sockets, babies impregnate themselves and the sky splits open and fish swim in the cracks. There are also Jackal-headed Masquerades, tree stumps that scream in the night, a Party of the Rich and a troupe of malignant spirits which roams the forests, entering people's thoughts at will. Got the picture? It helps to have read the first book, because questions of when, where, why, how and who are not addressed at the beginning of the second. The author launches into a lot of stuff about the seven mountains of our secret destiny and the song of a circling spirit, a song for those of us who never see that beyond the chaos there can always be a new sunlight. Well, yes, but what one was hoping to see was a novel, with a beginning, a middle and an end, some characters on the way and perhaps some sort of plot-induced crisis that could all be resolved satisfactorily in the final act. It is what fiction used to be about, after all. And will be again, once the current fad for Satanic Verses-style fantasy has run its course. In fact Okri can tell a perfectly good tale when he sets out to, as he has already shown in two volumes of short stories. Fans of The Famished Road will doubtless enjoy the sequel as well, but those who prefer a more realistic edge to their fiction might opt instead for Lawrence Naumoff's Taller Women, a droll and sharply funny look at the sex war, as seen through the eyes of a group of deeply conventional American suburbanites. Chief among them is Lydia, a hospital administrator, who lives with her doctor boyfriend but spends much of the time analysing his defects to her friend Martha. The two of them are the epitome of American womanhood, who look and think the way American women have been trained to look and think, and know without a doubt that they are at the cutting edge of all that a modern woman ought to be. Actually of course they are prisoners of the American Way, pre-programmed to talk non-stop nonsense about everything, and to be deeply satisfied with themselves for doing so. Naumoff sends them up rotten, with plenty of whip-smart dialogue and some hilarious insights into the absurdities of human nature. His biography reveals no background of TV sit-com writing, but that is the kind of writing he does, and very good it is too. Dale Peck's first novel Fucking Martin was called Martin and John in America, but we British have stronger stomachs and are not offended by rude words. Fucking Martin is about the size of it too, because there are several characters called Martin in the book, and several called John as well. The author is telling several stories within a story, each with a different set of characters with the same name, and it is not always easy to distinguish between them. That said however, it is a remarkably mature work for a young writer, albeit one still a little obsessed with his parents. There's an awful lot of 'My mother . . . my father . . . ' in the book, which reads very much like the autobiography of a young homosexual brought up in Kansas and now living in New York. His theme is the fashionable one of being gay in the time of AIDS and he handles it well enough, without the stomach-turning sexual detail that you find in the work of Alan Hollinghurst, Aldo Busi or even Edmund White. St Patrick's Daughter, by Margaret Mulvihill, is set in London, Dublin and Paris, but mostly London. It tells the story of a handsome but feckless Irishman who flees wife and daughter in his native land and sets up in Camden Town, where he ekes out a living as an assistant in a second-hand clothes shop. He is joined by his daughter, who thinks of herself as St Patrick's child because her father once played the title role in a minor film about the saint. She finds her father not quite as saintly as she had expected, but plenty of fun all the same. Mulvihill's humour is sly and gentle, her observation acute. The story has no great plot, but this is meant to be 'slice of life' writing rather than a rattling good yarn.</p>

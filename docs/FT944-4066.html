			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (11): Yorkshire caution curbs speculation  -Leeds and the North-East / If there is no substantial speculative office building in the city soon, Leeds will lose the edge it has established over Birmingham and Manchester The feel-good factor may still be an elusive one for many companies, but not so in Leeds. Of all northern cities, Leeds, with about 700,000 residents, has established itself as a pre-eminent financial and services centre. Southern-based corporates, along with government departments dispersing into the regions have been persuaded to move to the city and prosperity seems to abound. The latest arrival is Direct Line which, much to the astonishment of local residents, says it chose Leeds because of the 'neutral Leeds accent,' vital for their telephone operation. The company has taken over 90,000 sq ft of office space in Headrow House for its direct insurance selling. There is no doubt Leeds has a dynamic service sector. Last year, more than 300,000 sq ft of office space was either let or sold. The city has diversified its industrial economy over the years and is now reaping the reward. The office market in Leeds has largely remained on track during the recession and the city's links with specialist, financial and legal services has actually expanded during the past 12 months. There are also sites ready for speculative development or pre-commitment from tenants, including the remainder of the impressive Granary Wharf scheme. This riverside plan is proving to be a catalyst for the development of a previously untapped area, south of the city but within walking distance for staff who want to amble into the city at lunchtime. When Leeds Development Corporation was set up in 1988, most of the waterfront area was derelict. Now, all that has changed and the LDC has invested some Pounds 600,000 in a new footbridge linking the city with the scheme. This in turn has led to even further development, including a Pounds 6m brewery wharf museum by Tetley's. In all, some Pounds 72m of the Pounds 255m private sector investment has been attracted to the waterfront. Despite all the encouraging signs in and around the city however, the Yorkshire caution which perhaps helped it through the deepest parts of the recession, is still holding everything in check. Potential development plans are in place but if there is no substantial speculative office building in the city soon, Leeds will lose the edge it has established over Birmingham and Manchester. There are rumours that at least one of three leading developers will be moving into the city early next year. There has also recently been an upsurge in out-of-town development, led initially by the growth of retail developments away from the city centre. Companies are now taking office space adjacent to motorways where rents are, at least for the moment, significantly cheaper and where staff and customers have little or no car parking problems. Business people in Leeds say, with a fair degree of pride, that it is caution which helped many local firms survive and in some cases prosper, during the recession and it will not easily cast aside. Mike Hartley, a senior director with Richard Ellis Regional, based in Leeds, says: 'The lack of speculative development in the city is surprising when one considers that Leeds has not suffered a reduction in its rental levels over the past few years. There is no doubt that rentals are now rising and Leeds is certainly perceived as a place where funds are available to invest.' The city has enjoyed a good rental progression with figures showing a 9.1 per cent increase between 1979 and 1994. Top office rental values in Leeds now stand at about Pounds 17-Pounds 18 a sq ft which reflects the shortage of prime accommodation. The rents are more in line with Birmingham and Manchester although the lack of new development has inevitably reduced the number of investment transactions which have taken place. The largest transaction recorded during the first half of the year was the purchase of 21-22 Park Place by Pearl Assurance for a reported Pounds 5.5m. Eagle Star, however, recently completed a deal for 50,000 sq ft of office space, effectively taking the last available prime office building in Leeds. Mr Hartley says: 'There has been a lack of confidence but the recession did not bite as deeply in Leeds as elsewhere. Here, everything is in place and the rents are slowly coming up and there are major development opportunities with planning permission. 'There is no doubt people are confident and they have good reason to be here, but they are also extremely cautious. So it is only a matter of time before speculative schemes do go ahead. That will make all the difference.' The upturn in the regional property market is undoubtedly being driven by the financial and business services sector and this is why Leeds is well placed. According to Alistair Russell, a senior partner at Jones Lang Wootton, which has recently opened new offices in Carlton Tower in Leeds, business confidence in the area is very high. The demand for office accommodation is, he says, positive and improving. 'There is a very positive mood about, even if it is tempered slightly with the traditional caution of the area. We have expanded here for a very good reason and feel that companies are on the verge of a significant change for the better.'</p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Malaysia, Australia kiss and make up: Kieran Cooke and Nikki Tait see the heat taken out of a diplomatic confrontation Like two rather awkward dancing partners, Malaysia and Australia are doing the diplomatic waltz again. Last month Mr Paul Keating, Australia's blunt speaking prime minister, trod on Malaysia's toes by describing Dr Mahathir Mohamad, his Malaysian counterpart, as a 'recalcitrant' for not attending the recent Apec summit in Seattle. Malaysia responded by imposing restrictions on contacts with Australia and there was talk of downgrading diplomatic relations. But after Mr Keating wrote a personal letter to Dr Mahathir and twice publicly expressed regret for his remark Malaysia has now agreed to be friends. 'The government does not wish to prolong this issue and will take no further action,' said a statement after a weekend meeting of the Malaysian cabinet. Australia, clearly relieved the row has ended, says it wants further to develop relations. But damage has been done to business confidence in what has always been a fragile relationship. Australia is turning more towards the fast-growing economies of southeast Asia, and Malaysia has become one of Australia's top dozen trading partners  -in 1992-3 Australia exported goods worth ADollars 1.3bn (Pounds 590m) to Malaysia and imported some ADollars 970m worth. But during the recent debacle Australian companies had begun to report the cancellation of export orders: last week, for example, Voxson of Brisbane, which makes and exports mobile phones, saw one of its Malaysian dealers halt an impending order for cellular equipment. Meanwhile, the Malaysian authorities moved quickly to ban Australian commercials and TV programmes, including a film on the well-known Australian, Crocodile Dundee. Business people on both sides now wonder how long it will take to normalise ties again. A vocal contingent in Australia has consistently warned about putting too many eggs in the Asian basket, citing the political instabilities they feel prevail in the region. One test case could be a multi-billion-dollar bid by Transfield, the large privately-owned Sydney engineering group, to supply 27 patrol vessels to the Malaysian navy. As peace overtures gathered pace last week, officials seemed to feel the company was at least in the running for the order. Hopes rose further after Dr Mahathir visited the Australian stand at a local defence exhibition. But for Malaysia, there are questions about how the row might affect Australian investment in the country. Malaysian statistics show Australia's investments there trebled last year to more than Dollars 830m (Pounds 557m), making it one of the leading investors in the country. And at a time when Malaysia is seeing a sharp drop in the growth of foreign investment - with foreign capital going to other emerging economies such as China and Vietnam - a fall-off in Australian investment could hurt. 'The Australians have been clumsy,' said a diplomat in Kuala Lumpur. 'But Malaysia is gaining a reputation as a difficult country to deal with - at least on the political level. Damage has been done on both sides.' Dr Mahathir, though, seems to relish the role of spokesman of the smaller nations, attacking the west, particularly the US, on a range of issues including human rights and the environment. 'Sometimes you have to be a bit notorious to be a bit famous,' he said recently. 'In order to be known, you have to be nasty. I'm sometimes nasty toward governments, not business people.'</p>

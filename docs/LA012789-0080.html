			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO EARNINGS: GREAT AMERICAN REPORTS PROFIT OF $20.1 MILLION  </P> <P> Thanks to a non-recurring $77.7-million gain on the sale of investment  securities, Great American First Savings Bank reported a $20.1-million profit  for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, up from its $13.1-million profit for the  same quarter in 1987.  </P> <P> The gain, made on the sale of Great American's remaining Federal Home Loan  Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac) shares, helped counterbalance a $72-million  provision for probable loan and interest losses, a charge on earnings.  </P> <P> Great American also sold the balance of its Freddie Mac stock in the third  quarter and the gain of $17.5 million enabled the S&amp;L to show a profit then  as well.  </P> <P> The large loan-loss provision is part of Great American's continuing effort to  bring its problem loans under control. The provision reduces the S&amp;L's  non-performing loans to $382 million as of Dec. 31, or 2.4% of $16.1 billion in  assets. That's a considerable improvement from March, 1988, when bad loans  totaled $556 million, or nearly 3.7% of assets.  </P> <P> Jim Krzeminski, chief financial officer, said Great American hopes to reduce  its bad loans to 2% of assets by the end of 1989. The S&amp;L has attributed  much of its loan problems to the overbuilt Phoenix real estate market. Great  American inherited a significant loan portfolio there in 1986 when it acquired  Great American/Arizona.  </P> <P> For the full year, Great American reported a profit of $50.3 million, down from  $88.1 million in fiscal 1987. The lower fiscal-year profit came despite gains  totaling $96 million on investment transactions, including the sale of Freddie  Mac stock, contrasted with gains of $59 million in fiscal 1987.  </P> <P> Although analysts generally praised Great American's reduced bad-loan portfolio  as well as its timing of the Freddie Mac stock sale, several expressed  reservations about Great American's "core earnings," or money made from its  lending activities. Those earnings are now being dragged down, they said, by  Great American's sale in recent years of high-quality packaged loans to boost  earnings.  </P> <P> Great American's interest-rate "spread," or the difference between its cost of  funds and money earned from lending activity figured as a percentage of assets,  was 1.97% for all of 1988. That's significantly below the 2.55% interest spread  at H. F. Ahmanson, parent company of Home Savings, the 2.7% spread at Home  Federal Savings and the "close to 2.85%" spread at Great Western Savings, said  Gary Gordon, a securities analyst with Paine Webber in New York.  </P> <P> "Their core earnings didn't deteriorate, but they did not improve," Gordon  said. "They have a lot of loans not earning interest and, over the last few  years, they have been generating lots of earnings by selling their best loans.  Those aren't around making earnings," Gordon said.  </P> <P> Another Wall Street analyst who follows Great American and who asked not to be  named said Great American's low spread is worrisome because, if interest rates  go up as the analyst expects in 1989, the S&amp;L will find it harder to  compensate for a squeezed interest spread with further gains on sale of loans  and securities.  </P> <P> Krzeminski said Great American was slower than other S&amp;Ls in converting its  portfolio from predominantly fixed-rate loans to those with variable interest  rates indexed to its cost of funds. Last year, however, 94% of all Great  American's loans carried adjustable interest rates, Krzeminski said.  </P> <P> Great American's fourth-quarter earnings were also boosted by $17 million in  gains from real estate investments, contrasted with a loss of $7 million in the  comparable quarter the previous year.

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Belgium (9): Regionalism may not be such a great handicap - Flemish-Walloon compromise ONE of the better books on Belgium appearing this autumn had the modest title: 'The Belgians'. Sponsored by the Foreign Ministry and the Office for Foreign Trade, it offers a readable, well-illustrated account of Belgium's history, its government and its multilingual culture, interpersed with disarming nuggets of information such as: 'Since the end of World War II, Belgium has already had 36 different governments.' The divisions between a Flemish North and Walloon South may have left Belgium politically weak; but from an economic standpoint, the country has remained surprisingly resilient - to the point where its increasing regionalism may be less of a national handicap than is often imagined. 'The Belgians' was published just before a long weekend of horsetrading between Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the prime minister, and the leaders of the four main parties in his government. It culminated in what may prove a historic compromise between the Flemish and the Walloons. If passed by parliament, it will redraw the map of Belgium as a federal state, wrapping up the third stage of constitutional reforms first set out in 1988. Part of the plan means that the regions will assume new responsibilities from the national government, notably for agriculture and foreign trade. Responsibility for scientific research and for legislation concerning social assistance agencies will be shared between the regions and the communities - the other main political divisions built around the Dutch, German and French languages. From an investor's point of view, the three increasingly autonomous regions  -Brussels, Flanders and Wallonia - stress that the reforms will not change the long-standing decentralised approach to job-creation. Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgium's finance minister, makes clear that the three will market themselves in the same way as other European regions, such as Bavaria or Catalonia. Each Belgian region has developed its own distinctive sales pitch. In Flanders, the accent is on its location at the heart of the European single market due to come into effect on January 1, 1993. Equipped with the three major seaports - Antwerp, Ghent and Zeebrugge - Flanders has first-class, toll-free highways backed up by a dense railway network which puts London, Paris, Bonn, Cologne and Dusseldorf all less than 300km away. Not unreasonably, the region can lay claim to being ideally situated as a test market for northern Europe. Indeed, there are times when what regional officials call 'Flanders/Belgium' is portrayed almost as an extension of Netherlands and Germany in terms of productivity, low inflation, and skilled, multilingual workforce. With only 58 per cent of the Belgian population, Flanders accounts for 74 per cent of the country's exports to Europe. Automobile sub-contracting is an important source of jobs since Ford, General Motors, Renault and Volvo plants are all nearby. Ms Josee Mercken, managing director of Flanders Investment Office, stresses that small, clean, high-technology businesses such as microelectronics are what the region wants. But Europe's deflationary cycle has made it much harder for Flanders to pull in foreign investment, with companies postponing decisions until early next year, she adds. Wallonia's experience this year is similar. The region has largely recovered from the corporate horror story of the late 1970s, when steel and glass industry closures took their toll; but unemployment is still between 12 and 14 per cent, forcing the Walloons to dream up new ideas on how to sell itself to the outside world. One aim is to revive Wallonia's pioneer heritage in industry. Walloons set up a steel plant in Sweden around 1800, and the first glass manufacturing operation in Japan in the late 19th century. Mr Jean-Marie Agarkow, deputy general manager at the office of foreign investment, describes the pioneer theme as similar to an American Wild West movie; but this time the 'good guys' in white hats are the Japanese who are being welcomed in Wallonia with a fervour more readily associated with job-hungry Britain. One of the latest Japanese investors is Tsuji, the Osaka-based school for cooks. Tsuji bought a chateau near Mons for BFr30m and is prepared to put in a total of BFr110m to train Japanese cooks for six months in the fine arts of Belgian and European cuisine. Pushing the Brussels bureaucracy to ease up on visa restrictions was a bit of a nightmare, says one Walloon official, but in the event it worked. Wallonia has moved faster than Flanders to adjust to EC demands that richer countries (such as Belgium) rein in national investment assistance to their own regions, so as to avoid undermining the effect of Community aid to poorer member states. The Walloon response was typically practical: the definition of a small-to-medium business was raised from its original level of a company employing 40-to-70 people to the EC level of 250 people and BFr20m turnover. These companies can now expect the same level of tax write-offs or capital relief of up to 21 per cent, plus some aid if they locate in a special assistance area. For much of the late 1980s, Brussels might have looked up at its nose at such inducements. With its newly-minted image as the 'political capital of Europe', Brussels seemed to be riding the crest of a wave created by the single market 1992 project. More recently, the economic downturn has dented confidence. Some 15,000 civil servants work in Brussels, three-quarters for the European Commission. With families, that means 37,000 people. If one includes the growing press corps and the diplomatic corps, conference goers, lobbyists and international visitors, this group alone is estimated to generate BFr22.5bn, of which all but BFr1.5bn stays in Belgium. This combination of spending power and political influence is the real drawing power of Brussels  -even if it has a long way to go before it can match Washington DC, the capital with which it is often compared by Eurocrats.</p>

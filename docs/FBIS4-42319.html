			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Antje Vollmer, frontrunner of Alliance </F> 90/Greens in the upcoming Bundestag elections, by Wolfgang  Wischmeyer; place and date not given: "`I Advise the SPD To Get  to Its Feet as Quickly as Possible'"]    [Text] [Wischmeyer] You were once called a "partisan of  permanent departure." Where are you departing to just now?    [Vollmer] What might be more interesting is that from where  I have just departed to enter politics again -- it was from a  far distance. I am currently working in the science college in  Berlin with 30 scientists and artists who help each other think  -- a bit of monastery and a bit of magic mountain.    [Wischmeyer] And from there you go into the morasses of  everyday politics. What is your objective on your return to the  Bundestag?    [Vollmer] I am not coming back as a greenhorn, but as  someone who has enough experience with green policies and  sufficient experience in opposition politics. What would be  attractive is the Greens getting the chance to create something.    [Wischmeyer] Are they capable of doing that?    [Vollmer] If things fail it will certainly not be because of  the Greens.    [Wischmeyer] Abolition of the Bundeswehr, leaving NATO --  will the Mannheim resolutions not stand in the way of this?    [Vollmer] We have indicated very clearly that the Mannheim  resolutions are very general ideas, but not a specific  government program.    [Wischmeyer] How do you see the Social Democratic Party's  [SPD] behavior after the presidential elections?    [Vollmer] I would advise the SPD to get to its feet as  quickly as possible and realize that there are only six months  left to win the Bundestag elections. I think there has been a  strategic miscalculation within the SPD. If you think you can  push through your own presidential candidate six months before  the decisive battle, then this is not very realistic. They  should have tried to reach a consensus. The SPD should let  things rest now and start a reform debate quickly. Scharping  may be right in saying that you have to pick up voters from the  CDU [Christian Democratic Union]. But the question is where do  you want to take them. If you want to leave them where they are  and what they are, this is not picking them up, but this way  everything will stay the same. This is what the atmosphere in  the country is like at the moment.    [Wischmeyer] Should not an important office in the state be  given to a politician from eastern Germany?    [Vollmer] I find it a bit strange that this demand comes  from those who have presented western candidates for the Federal  Constitutional Court and the presidency. Next time round,  action will count, and not good intentions.    [Wischmeyer] Scharping is rebuking the FDP [Free Democratic  Party] for not yielding to the Social Democrats. That is not a  good sign for dealing with smaller parties. What do you find so  attractive in this partner of your dreams?    [Vollmer] Only that he is our real opportunity for turning  green, ecological, democratic policies into government policy.  But I would rather have a different election campaign. One  that mobilizes society to effect a change in politics.    [Wischmeyer] A coalition between SPD, FDP, and Alliance  90/Greens is out of the question?    [Vollmer] No, anything is still possible.    [Wischmeyer] The SPD candidate for chancellor likes giving  your party the cold shoulder. He seems to expect the Greens to  come into his boat themselves. Coalition by all means? Where  are the limits?    [Vollmer] We will not take part in a government project that  does not include a clear start to an ecological economic policy,  and we cannot participate in a program that does not adopt  principles of a liberal, foreigner-friendly domestic policy.  For me, this includes a law on immigration. And then there  must be a revaluation of work.    [Wischmeyer] Scharping's election program does not even  mention basic ecological reconstruction. Is there another SPD  beside him that is giving you hope?    [Vollmer] I have always expected, and I still do, Oskar  Lafontaine wanting more radical changes in economic policy and  also in social policies by the year 2000. There have been two  election campaign models in the SPD. One of them was the  Lafontaine campaign, which got very close to the Greens' issues.  Scharping is now trying the opposite method. We will see how  far this gets him. I for my part will do an election campaign  event together with Oskar Lafontaine that will be entitled  "Reform Perspectives for the New Republic."    [Wischmeyer] Does this mean the Scharping strategy is not in  line with the SPD's potential?    [Vollmer] I would advise Scharping to form a sort of  political twin with Lafontaine. I think that twosomes of the  same sex have proved successful in politics, such as Clinton and  Gore, Gorbachev and Yakovlev. You have to cover different  positions. But you must also want to achieve the common things  and must not use the other partner as an ornament. This is a  good advice for everyone, including the Greens, even for Helmut  Kohl, except that there is no more twin for him.    [Wischmeyer] What do you expect from the SPD?    [Vollmer] We must not introduce ecology via fiscal and  financial issues alone, which is a point where people are  particularly reluctant. There is more at stake. We need a  second phase of railroad and public transport reforms. We could  really be world leaders in ecological technologies. In social  policy we must redistribute private wealth to take the burden  off public poverty. And there is another debate: Half of our  population will soon be over 50. What could a policy look like  that would not have to ask people's children to pay up to five  times as much as they did? Thinking about this also has to do  with the dignity of old people.    [Wischmeyer] But there is not even agreement on very simple  issues: the price of gasoline, speed limit....    [Vollmer] If the SPD expects us to rethink our Mannheim  resolutions, we can expect them to rethink their position with  regard to the speed limit.    [Wischmeyer] You think that the SPD cannot be that crazy....    [Vollmer] ...that this would be a stumbling block for them.  There must be a bit of reason, they are all over 50 themselves.    [Wischmeyer] And gasoline prices? An immediate rise of 50  pfennig, and another 30 pfennig per year, that would make 5  marks by the year 2000. Is this still valid?    [Vollmer] I will not indicate any prices beyond the year  2000, because this would be idiotic. But the 50 pfennig and the  speed limit belong to the basics of transportation policy. This  goes without saying. But this will only be possible if people  realize that a change in politics is necessary. If the  ecological question, the rise in the ratio of old people, the  difficult situation worldwide after the end of the Cold War, are  taken seriously. If we discuss these issues, we will get to  agree whether we will charge 50 pfennig more for gasoline. What  annoys me is that in a year such as this, election campaigns are  about 50 pfennig peanuts issues.    [Wischmeyer] Unemployment will be an important topic in the  election campaign. The Greens have not had much to say on this.    [Vollmer] I do not agree. I think you have to start by  thoroughly thinking about revolutionizing the term of work. We  must have a debate on basic salaries. Pension systems are  getting insecure, the age structure creates problems of its own,  and even economic growth will not lead to everyone getting a  full job of the old type. It is, therefore, high time to say  there must be a basic salary for all, which shall give people  more freedom to organize their jobs according to their needs;  reduction of working hours for all, in order to distribute the  existing jobs more evenly. This is a concept where all elements  fit into each other.    [Wischmeyer] A necessary element is more flexible working  hours. Your party considers this the work of the devil.    [Vollmer] Elements that do not automatically fit together  can be made to fit. I would like to see old taboos originating  from Social Democratic and trade union backgrounds being given  up. This will have to happen, if we want to reintegrate the  unemployed and do not want to drive women out of gainful  employment again.    [Wischmeyer] On your 50th birthday, Lafontaine wrote that he  would prefer to see you holding a political office. What is the  political office that Antje Vollmer would like to hold, if there  was one for her?    [Vollmer] It is not within my power to choose. Politicians'  lives are much more a game of roulette today than they used to  be, especially for women.    [Wischmeyer] [Alliance 90/Greens politician Joschka] Fischer  would be content with the role of backbencher, Vollmer would  only sit in the third row.... Why are you so modest?    [Vollmer] Fischer will certainly not remain a backbencher,  and I will not ban my own revolutionary ideas either. But I  have become a lot more realistic where my very own perspectives  are concerned. For a start, I just want to be part of the game  again, everything else remains to be seen.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A.A. Zhmud; UDC 681.316.56:538.61(088.8)] </F>   [Abstract] A feasibility of constructing different types of  optical memory devices based on interference systems of spatial  light scanning with wavelength re-tunable semiconductor  injection lasers is examined and an analysis is made of their  characteristics. Functioning of these devices is based on the  effect of changes in the spatial structure of the interference  picture at the output of a multiple-beam Fizo interferometer  (FI) with changes in the wavelength of laser which illuminates  the interferometer. Optical memory devices with one Fizo  interferometer and two crossed FI in the scanning system are  discussed. A block diagram of a simple optical memory device  with a multiple-beam FI in the scanning system is provided.  Problems of constructing memory devices with a super-large  capacity are also examined.

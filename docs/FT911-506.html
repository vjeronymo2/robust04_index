			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family (The Week Ahead): The brewers' round THE round of brewers' results opens next week with Allied-Lyons first of the major groups to report on Tuesday. Full year pre-tax profits are expected to be down 16 per cent on 1989-90 at around Pounds 475m, reflecting the impact of the well-publicised Pounds 147m of foreign exchange losses. Analysts will be looking for evidence from the new chairman and chief executive of a strong recovery this year. First half results from Grand Metropolitan on Wednesday may have been hit by the recession, Gulf war, and decline of the dollar. City forecasts range from Pounds 389m to Pounds 395m compared with Pounds 409m last time. Greenall Whitley should provide some clues on Monday to how well pubs have been weathering the squeeze on consumer spending. Analysts expect interim profits of Pounds 20.5m, ex-property, a 6 per cent advance. A subdued picture is expected to emerge when Hanson, the diversified UK-based conglomerate, unveils its interim figures next Tuesday. Analysts forecast at best a 4 per cent advance to Pounds 590m-Pounds 595m from the year-ago profit level of Pounds 570m. The building products and titanium dioxide businesses will have continued to struggle but this should be offset by a solid performance from tobacco and consumer industries. First contributions from Peabody, the US coal miner, and Cavenham Forest Industries will provide the bulk of the growth. On Thursday BOC is expected to announce a fall in pre-tax profits for the six months to March 31. Industrial gases, its main business, are only partially resistant to the recession and profits will be hit by the weak dollar. The outcome for the half-year is likely to be in the region of Pounds 150m to Pounds 155m - down about 10 per cent on 1989/90. Royal Insurance and General Accident, two of the country's leading general insurers, are expected to report substantial pre-tax losses for the first quarter of 1991 next week. Analysts are expecting losses of between Pounds 58m and Pounds 83m for GA which reports on Tuesday and between Pounds 59m and Pounds 79m for Royal which reports on Thursday compared with losses of Pounds 81m and Pounds 79m last year. But in 1990 results were heavily influenced by claims stemming from the storms of January 1990. This year has seen no comparable catastrophe, indicating a very serious deterioration in underlying underwriting experience. Marks and Spencer, Britain's most famous retailer, is announcing its results on Tuesday and some analysts are thinking the previously unthinkable in predicting that pre-tax profits might fall this year. Last year, the company made Pounds 604.2m pre-tax and seemed to be weathering the recession well. But a deteriorating trading environment and the company's decision to axe 850 jobs have led analysts to fear that profits may have been hit more than originally feared. After including an exceptional charge of Pounds 16m relating to the redundancy programme, pre-tax profits are unlikely to move ahead greatly from last year's outcome. Pre-tax profits at J. Sainsbury, the expansive grocery chain, seem set to top Pounds 500m when the company announces its annual results on Wednesday. After a strong trading period, analysts expect the company to come in at around the Pounds 505m mark representing a 22 per cent increase on the previous year.</p>

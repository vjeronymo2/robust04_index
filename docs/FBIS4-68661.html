			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Grigoryev: "The Chairman of the Central </F> Bank Has Taken a Stricter Position on Credit: Direct Centralized  Credit Has Been Acknowledged To Be Inefficient"]    [Text] In addition to the membership of more than 800  domestic banks, the prestige of the ARB [Association of Russian  Banks] was confirmed by the caliber of guests who took part in  the proceedings of the ARB Fourth Congress.    Since the completion of work on the basic directions for the  monetary and credit policy of the Bank of Russia coincided in  time with a regular ARB congress, Viktor Gerashchenko devoted  his report to outlining a fresh concept. This made it possible  for the chairman of the Central Bank to avoid the direct,  unprejudiced, and (judging by the experience of the previous ARB  congress) generally nonsensical polemics with delegates to the  congress while keeping his presentation topical and current.    In the belief that attaining stability and manageability in  the monetary system of the country is its main objective, the  Central Bank considers "the absence of effective instruments of  control over the money supply" to be a high-priority problem. In  conjunction with this, the concept--in the opinion of Central  Bank representatives an extremely harmful one--of reorganizing  the banking system on the pattern of the American Federal  Reserve System poses a major threat. The emergence of several  emission centers, even if with limited powers, will bring about  uncontrollable growth of the money supply and will very shortly  create financial chaos in Russia, cautioned Viktor Gerashchenko.    The generally standard methods of monetary regulation--a  reserve requirement policy, the level of refinancing rates, the  volume of credit outlays, at times interpreted in an extremely  exotic manner, with the peculiarities of Russia taken into  account--constituted the positive segment of the Central Bank  program.    The volume of mandatory reserve requirements is, first, the  main technique for regulating the credit multiplier; second, it  makes it possible to influence the composition of the holding  portfolios of banks by stimulating their interest in certain  securities. The current level of these requirements (20 percent  for demand accounts and 15 percent for time deposits) is quite  high, which is however justified given the current inflationary  situation. It is another matter that any structure of the  reserve funds at all has been lacking so far. Tied-up funds sit  in accounts at the Central Bank. Besides, an atrocious  settlement system deprived the banks of an opportunity for the  current management of reserves. The Central Bank is now ready to  allow the use of state securities for meeting reserve  requirements. It is understood that this is primarily about  one-year treasury bills issued by the Ministry of Finance to  cover last year's debt of the state budget to enterprises. The  profit margin on these securities was set at the level of 40  percent annually. Including the bills on the list of reserve  assets is the only way to interest the commercial banks in them.    Mr. Gerashchenko greatly upset the bankers by confirming the  intention to extend reserve requirements to foreign exchange  deposits. Apparently, the interests of the Central Bank and the  U.S. Federal Reserve System coincide in this instance. In recent  years, the Federal Reserve System has been experiencing certain  difficulties because of an increase in demand for cash dollars:  the rate of cash emission has been above the index of inflation  by one order of magnitude. The rapidly growing demand for  dollars outside of the United States, primarily in Russia, is  the main reason for this paradox. The Central Bank has now  decided to support its American colleagues and will restrict the  amount of dollars in Russia.    This year the Central Bank intends to make major changes in  the principles and instruments of refinancing. Viktor  Gerashchenko finally directly acknowledged the ineffectiveness  and even the outright unprofitability of the direct extension of  credit to enterprises by the Central Bank. Moreover, the Central  Bank intends to rectify the consequences of its own credit  abuses and not only root out this vice in practice but wipe it  out in the documents, sanitizing to this end the balance sheets  of banks that have participated in the distribution of  centralized credit. Viktor Gerashchenko believes that the  defaulted debt of enterprises by virtue of centralized credit  should be converted into public debt with state obligations  being drawn up. This touching concern for banks, most of which  have made good money off the centralized-credit windfall, runs  into a number of obstacles. In particular, quite a few loans  were not extended by decisions of the government. The Central  Bank extended some on its own, too. It is not easy to understand  what obligations on these loans have to do with the public debt.    The quantitative planks for the volume of emission and the  level of the refinancing rate have been set forth in a joint  declaration of the government and the Central Bank. The Central  Bank complied with them strictly in the first quarter. In the  opinion of Viktor Gerashchenko, the planks are realistic. The  chairman of the Central Bank commented on rumors concerning a  prompt sharp reduction in the refinancing rate which were  triggered by his presentation in the State Duma. Unlike ARB  President Sergey Yegorov, who unambiguously evaluated the  current interest rate policy of the Central bank of Russia as  smothering not only production but also (!!!--Andrey Grigoryev)  the banking system, Mr. Gerashchenko stated neatly that "the  downward trend that has emerged in the credit market may render  the refinancing rate unjustifiably high," and then the Central  Bank will proceed to reduce it. The quotas of increment of  financial aggregates (see BIZNES-SEGODNYA No. 28, 19 April)  restrict the volume of credit to the banking system to 16-17  billion rubles [R]. For this reason "the Central Bank effects  financing under strict conditions." The volume of credit  distributed on an auction basis will expand. Although  regulations on centralized credit auctions provide for an  opportunity for directed credit to the "real sector of the  economy," the Central Bank will not facilitate this by reducing  the auction rate. The Central Bank considers a reduction in the  segmentation of money markets to be an important task of credit  policy; to this end the Central Bank intends to structure the  distribution of resources taking into account the demand  emerging in the course of the auctions.    The Central Bank intends to compensate for the limited  potential of refinancing by using new methods to sustain  liquidity in the banking system. First, there is a transition to  lombard credit. Having signed a contract of indefinite duration  with a territorial main branch of the Central Bank, banks will  be able to receive credit against the pledge of state securities  and first-class bills of exchange. A list of these will be  established by the Board of Directors of the Central bank. The  interest on lombard credit will be higher than the refinancing  rate. Second, if a debit balance is a threat, banks will be able  to receive credit for up to seven days in an amount not to  exceed 25 percent of the compulsory reserve fund against a  pledge of first-class assets (foreign exchange, precious  metals). The rate will be 20 percent higher than the refinancing  rate.    As we evaluate the generally progressive plans, we are just  left wondering what stood in the way of the Central Bank  carrying out at least some of the aforementioned undertakings  last year at the latest?    Besides, the chief of the Central Bank came out in favor of  a  major effort to reform the legislative foundation for banking.  However, Mr. Gerashchenko emphasized primarily the legal  problems of the Central Bank itself. In particular, two  significant decisions that were incorporated in presidential  edicts--the conversion of enterprise debt into bills of exchange  and the indexation of deposits in the Savings Bank--were made  without consultations with the Central Bank and were legally  improper. As far as the issues of legislative regulation of the  operation of commercial banks are concerned, they were  substantively dealt with by Garegin Tosunyan, ARB deputy  president and chairman of the Tekhnobank, who presented a draft  of the banking legislation reform developed by the ARB.    The first deputy prime minister of the government greatly  spoiled the mood of participants in the ARB Congress. Starting  by outlining well-known truths to the effect that structural  changes in the economy are the foundation for Russia's  prosperity, including that of its banking sector, Oleg Soskovets  put into words the measures that in his opinion are necessary  for the industrial crisis to be successfully overcome. Speaking  before the bankers, Mr. Soskovets decided to cover plans for the  search for money. Naturally this was about distribution or, more  precisely, administrative redistribution. The funds to satisfy  the lobbyists supporting the "industrial" deputy prime minister  are not available in the budget; the Central Bank has begun to  display firmness on this score, having grasped the  ineffectiveness of direct centralized provision of credit to  "producers." This has prompted the government to turn its gaze  to the vaults of commercial banks (it is to be understood that  official statements by the first deputy prime minister reflect  the point of view of the cabinet).    As a theoretical basis for the measures planned, Mr.  Soskovets used the notion of the unlawfulness and fallaciousness  of banking per se (which, incidentally, many of the speakers at  the congress tried to refute, regardless of polemics with the  deputy prime minister). In the soft wording of Oleg Soskovets,  the notion was voiced as a thesis about the "unjustified nature  of banks' profit from speculative transactions with foreign  exchange and intermediary operations." In conjunction with this,  the government considers it feasible to "allocate 50 percent of  banks' profits from such operations as easy credit for retooling  programs in industry and the agro-industrial complex." It is  necessary to allocate one-third of the internal funds of  commercial banks for the same purposes. Besides, Mr. Soskovets  charged that the banks, having accumulated considerable funds,  allocate them "to intermediary and commercial operations which  do not bring about a growth of the stock of merchandise and are  not associated with supporting state programs or investment  activities."    Soskovets' first thesis calls for taking money away from the  banks, while the second affects both enterprises and the  population. After all, it is precisely their funds that the  banks accumulate. The activities generating the growth of the  "stock of merchandise" which the deputy prime minister means  will plainly bring about a reduction in the real volume of  capital. If the crazy ideas outlined above are implemented, the  holders of bank deposits will at best receive symbolic interest  on them, and at worst, will receive "frozen" accounts.    While we insist that the presentation of the first deputy  prime minister should be viewed as the official position of the  government, it is hard to seriously consider the government  capable of such undertakings. Besides, Oleg Nikolayevich himself  understands in retrospect that nobody will give him the windfall  money to support state enterprises (some of which are becoming  the property of Mr. Soskovets), and that the government is not  in a position to "allocate" the capital of the banks anywhere  without regard for the interests of shareholders and depositors.  However, it is extremely lamentable that officials so highly  placed allow themselves to engage in absolutely irresponsible  and stupid twaddle, and then in premises as respectable as the  Hall of Columns in the House of Unions.</p>

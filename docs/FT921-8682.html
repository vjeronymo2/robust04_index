			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / MPs will protest to Lloyd's chairman THE GOVERNMENT is facing mounting pressure from its own backbenchers, many of whom are Names, to step into the fray at Lloyd's with the aim of imposing regulatory reform. A group of about 25 MPs is to visit Lloyd's on Monday and is expected to discuss concerns about alleged malpractices with Mr David Coleridge, the chairman of Lloyd's. Lloyd's said yesterday that the visit was planned three weeks ago as part of the efforts of the Lloyd's council, its governing body, to publicise the recommendations of a market task force which completed an investigation into business practices at Lloyd's last month. A group of Conservative and Labour MPs is dissatisfied with the way the market has handled its relations with Names - the individuals whose assets provide the insurance market's capital. MPs who attended a meeting with Mr Coleridge on Tuesday say they were unimpressed. Mr Coleridge had been urged to provide information to Names about syndicates stored on computers at Lloyd's. Commons motions tabled on Thursday by two Labour MPs, Mr Brian Sedgemore and Mr Dennis Skinner, sharply criticised the Lloyd's market and suggested there was 'structural rottenness' which required regulation under the Financial Services Act. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, who speaks for Labour on City matters, has called for an independent investigation into allegations by Names that market insiders have been given access to the best business. Yesterday Mr Richard Page, MP for Hertfordshire South West and vice-chairman of the Tory trade and industry committee, said: 'I believe that they (Lloyd's) have got to address the self-regulation problem in a very forthright and immediate fashion - and, if not, then it is a function that the government should step in and impose on them.' That view was echoed by other Tory MPs, about 40 of whom are Names at Lloyd's. Mr Spencer Batiste, MP for Elmet, said many MPs would like Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, to intervene. Mr Batiste, who joined Lloyd's in 1987, said many MPs felt that Lloyd's seemed 'unable to put its own house in order'. Mr Rupert Allason, MP for Torbay and a member of Lloyd's since 1974, said he had been assured by his agent that syndicate managers would be 'feeling the squeeze' like everybody else in future years. He expected to make an underwriting loss this year.</p>

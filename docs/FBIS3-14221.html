			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Lebanese Forces Commander Dr. </F> Samir Ja'ja' by radio correspondent Kamal Tarabayh in the studio  on 23 March -- recorded]    [Text] [Ja'ja'] My response [to charges of alleged  involvement by members of the Lebanese Forces security  organization in the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church] is  as follows: First, there has been no security body in the  Lebanese Forces [LF] since the dissolving of the militias four  years ago. Second, what is taking place is an ethical,  political, and media crime against liberties in Lebanon. Third:  I have never heard of the so-called Jiris Tawfiq al-Khuri.  Simon Edmond al-Kharyati was a member of the Lebanese Forces  before the dissolution of the militias. With regard to those  against whom arrest warrants were issued, they left Lebanon more  than one year ago.    [Tarabayh] Do you admit some of these elements were members  of the LF before the dissolution of the militias?    [Ja'ja'] Yes. [words indistinct] I told you who were with LF  when it was still militias.    [Tarabayh] Who, among the suspects, were members of the LF  before the militias were dissolved?    [Ja'ja'] Among the detainees, Simon Edmond al-Kharyati was a  member of the militias. Tony Ilyas 'Ubayd left Lebanon at least  one and one-half years ago and is now in Australia.    [Tarabayh] What about the arrest of Colonel Fu'ad Malik, who  is still a member of the LF?    [Ja'ja'] Yes, of course. I consider this a political issue  which aims at striking at the people's belief in their  political, social, and religious institutions. Tony Ilyas  'Ubayd left Lebanon one and one-half years ago; Rushdi Tawfiq  left Lebanon three years ago; and John Yusuf Shahin left Lebanon  one year ago. Documents will be presented about the places of  residence of those persons: Two in Australia and one in Canada.  This will prove they have not returned to Lebanon since their  departure.    [Tarabayh] It has been reported that LF security was  certainly infiltrated by the Israeli Mosad. Do you admit this?    [Ja'ja'] Never.    [Tarabayh] It is said that former members of LF security  were  trained by and had good links with the Israeli Mosad. These are  facts.    [Ja'ja'] I ask for public trials and defense lawyers.  Investigations will reveal all facts to public opinion and the  media.    [Tarabayh] What are the steps to be taken by the LF in light  of this situation?    [Ja'ja'] We will demand public trials to see who is right.    [Tarabayh] What is the situation now in Ghidras?    [Ja'ja'] The situation has not changed. There are more  restrictions on people coming to Ghidras.    [Tarabayh] Thank you, Dr. Samir Ja'ja'.</p>

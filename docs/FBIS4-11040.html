			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 19 Apr (NA) -- Local Interpol  agents this morning detained a Bolivian citizen. His capture  was requested by the Bolivian Interpol on charges of  participating in eight murders in the Bolivian city of Sucre.    The individual was identified as Juan Carlos Garcia Guaman  or  Guzman. He was a member of a paramilitary group during the  governments of Generals Luis Garcia Meza and Luis Arce Gomez.  He allegedly participated in the killing of eight Movement of  the Revolutionary Left [MIR] leaders.    Garcia was placed at the disposal of Federal Judge Adolfo  Bagnasco and will testify tomorrow.    The incident that prompted Garcia's capture occurred on 17  July 1980 when the group in which Garcia participated entered  the MIR party offices on Harrington Street, in Sucre, and  machine gunned the eight persons in the room.

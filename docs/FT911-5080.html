			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / S African steel and gold ban lifted: EC rejects last minute objections from ANC EC foreign ministers yesterday ignored last minute objections from the African National Congress and the European Parliament, and lifted the 1986 ban on the import of South African iron, steel and gold coins. Welcoming the move, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, Britain's EC affairs minister, said afterwards that 'as reform is moving ahead in South Africa, we could start moving ahead by looking at whether sports restrictions and certain 1985 sanctions, such as on the sale of crude oil, could be removed'. British restrictions on sporting contacts with South Africa were agreed with the Commonwealth, while most of the 1985 measures, mainly the sale of military and police equipment, are authorised by the United Nations. The European Commission has already stepped up aid which amounted to Ecus 120m (Pounds 82.8m) in 1986-90 to Ecus 60m this year for economic projects to help South African blacks. The EC decided last year to lift a voluntary ban on investment in South Africa, and to remove the other 1986 measures, the bans on iron, steel and gold Krugerrands, once Pretoria had tabled legislation scrapping the main pillars of apartheid - the Group Areas and Land Acts. This condition has now been met. The removal of the sanctions was approved unanimously despite protests from the ANC, South African trade unions and the pro-sanctions majority in the European Parliament. The ministers thus proved bolder than the European Commission, which decided on March 26 to ask for repeal of the 1986 sanctions, but kept their request quiet, out of an evident desire to avoid trouble with the European Parliament. EC foreign ministers agreed yesterday to ship an extra 400,000 tonnes of food to the Horn of Africa by the end of May to stave off famine there. The Commission had told ministers that some 17m people face starvation. Europe's non-governmental aid organisations said the moves were inadequate. Some 750,000 tonnes was needed urgently to help some 30m people in the Horn, where in parts of Eritrea and Tigray stocks will be exhausted in three to four weeks. In London, Mrs Lynda Chalker, the overseas development minister, announced a further Pounds 33m in aid to famine-hit countries in Africa. About Pounds 30m would be non-food aid aimed specifically at famine and refugee relief and the remainder on 5,000 tonnes of food for Ethiopia and Sudan. The new aid pledge follows Pounds 27m of mainly food aid already offered to Ethiopia, Sudan, Mozambique, Malawi and Angola since the scale of the crisis became apparent last September.

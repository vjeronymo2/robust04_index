			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (5): One commenter indicated that the regulations need to be modified to accommodate people who may still have longline permit applications pending under the moratorium.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (5): There were no permit applications pending when the moratorium ended, therefore no change was necessary in the regulations to respond to this comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (6): The Council indicated that the language of the permit eligibility criteria concerning the linkage between longline permits and northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) lobster limited entry permits needed revision to be consistent with the intent of the Council. That is, the criteria in the proposed rule would not have afforded eligibility for a Hawaii longline limited entry permit to someone who, at the end of the moratorium, was the last holder of record of a moratorium longline limited entry permit and held a northwest Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) lobster limited entry permit, both of which were obtained from another party. It was the Council's intent that a person who obtained both permits from another party would thus be eligible for a Hawaii longline limited entry permit based on ``the lobster fishery criterion'' referred to in Amendment 7.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (6): A new paragraph &sect;685.9(b)(2)(iv) has been added to be consistent with the Council's intent. It is estimated that five longline permit holders will be affected by this change by qualifying for new permits under these criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Changes from the Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An item inadvertently not discussed in the proposed rule is that initial permit decisions are made by the Chief, Fisheries Management Division, Southwest Region, NMFS. This final rule includes a provision for appeals of permit decisions to the Regional Director. Experience in the moratorium program indicates a need for an appeal process to review decisions that applicants believe are incorrect or based on faulty interpretation of facts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``length overall'' of a vessel has been revised to mean only the horizontal distance between the foremost part of the stem and the aftermost part of the stern. The length overall does not include fittings or attachments that extend beyond these two points, including bowsprits, rudders, or outboard motor brackets. References in the proposed definition to other vessel length measurements appearing in U.S. Coast Guard or state vessel registration documents have been removed because they could have resulted in the use of different vessel length measurement systems. As revised, the definition provides a consistent and uniform method of determining vessel length for all vessels participating in the fishery; it is the same method of length measurement used in many other federally regulated fisheries. Under this definition, the longest vessel active in the fishery in the moratorium is 101 feet (30.8 m) rather than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93 feet (28 meters), as described in the preamble to the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The eligibility criteria for issuance of a Hawaii limited entry permit in &sect;685.9(b)(2) were modified. As noted in response to comment Number 6 the linkage between longline permits and NWHI lobster limited entry permits was modified to be consistent with Council intent. Also, several moratorium permits were invalidated due to the sinking or destruction of vessels. The holders of these permits had been active during the moratorium period and therefore would qualify for permits under the new program. By focussing on the last holder of record of limited entry permits issued under the moratorium, the final rule provides that these individuals will qualify for new permits, consistent with the intent of Amendment 7.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A prohibition (&sect;685.9(a)(4)) was added to require that necessary permits be on board vessels and available for inspection by an authorized agent unless the vessel was at sea when the permit was issued, in which case the permit must be on board the vessel on the next trip. The requirement for the permit to be on board the vessel was in effect during the moratorium, but was inadvertently omitted from the proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

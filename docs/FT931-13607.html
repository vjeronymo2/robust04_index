			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Miller quits as Wang chairman WANG Laboratories, the US computer group, announced yesterday that Mr Richard Miller, chairman and chief executive, had resigned. Three executives were named to lead the company as it prepares to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy prot-ection. Wang, which has been cutting its operations for the past year, said it would eventually halt manufacturing. Mr Miller said he had proposed stepping down 'because the company needs to finalise a smaller and less-costly management structure that will lead the company into the future.' Mr Michael Mee, formerly an executive vice-president, was named as Wang's new chairman and chief financial officer. He said Wang would continue to refocus its business on imaging software and services. 'Over time,' Mr Mee said, 'Wang will exit manufacturing.' Mr Joseph Tucci, who was named as president and chief executive, said that plans to reduce manufacturing were likely to affect plants in Taiwan, Ireland and Australia. He said Wang had about 1,000 manufacturing employees. A Wang official said the company was in the process of selling its Taiwan plant to a group of investors. Similar arrangements might be made in Ireland and Australia, he suggested. In addition to the appointments of Mr Mee and Mr Tucci, Mr Donald Casey was named as president and chief development officer.</p>

We do not know whether  its outcome will also be effective. We hope it will. This is  so because the protracted Turkish disobedience, which aims to  maintain an "internationally unacceptable"--according to the  White House description--status quo in Cyprus, also represents  an issue of prestige for the American superpower.    The U.S. President's interference, manifested in his letters  to Andreas Papandreou and Tansu Ciller and his hasty dispatch of  Robert Lamb to Cyprus with new proposals, does not aim to offer  artificial resuscitation to Turkish intransigence when the  Security Council's deadline for reaching an agreement "without  delay" on the confidence-building measures (CBM's) expires.  Removing the urgent need for this arrangement is tantamount to  tolerating the prolongation of the pseudostate's life and  rewarding the filibustering tactics that Rauf Denktas follows to  torpedo every process.    Besides, the U.S. element has another reason to avert any  adulteration of the CBM's, since it is morally committed by its  earlier declarations according to which "the measures must be  accepted as they stand because they are fair."    Consequently, Denktas' excuses about the customs and other  points cannot be accepted or camouflaged politically with the  new U.S. intervention.    So, the effort to do what must be done should be focused  elsewhere. There must be pressure to persuade Ankara that it  cannot act arbitrarily, provoke, and renege. President Clinton  has effective levers of persuasion and levers of pressure given  that Turkey is facing an internal economic crisis because of the  neosultan mentality that governs its policy. What is sought for  Turkey's people is internal tranquillity and prosperity. If  Turkey stays on the downhill slope it is on then it will pay  dearly for its expansionist and arbitrary policy, because Turkey  will be isolated from a united Europe and become weak about  demonstrating military strength and expansionist influence in  the region.    President Clinton, as the leader of the sole superpower,  should aim at the right Cyprus solution and also at harmonizing  Turkish policy with the more general U.S. view of international  problems in accordance with his specifications.    The White House strategy was outlined with the Clinton  doctrine, which declared: "We will try to persuade first and,  if necessary, we will intervene."    We have no doubt that the U.S. President tried to persuade  Ankara and his new intervention is probably within this  framework. But it will take a major dilemma if Turkey is to be  persuaded and if a more active White House intervention is not  to become necessary. This should be summed up in what would  happen if Turkey remains disobedient to the UN Security Council  resolutions. If we were the ones to pay for Turkish  intransigence then Ankara would never retreat, since its  intransigence would insure the perpetuation of what it has  illegally acquired through the invasion and the unhindered  distribution of the enslaved Greek homes and property.</p>

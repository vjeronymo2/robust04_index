			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / International Company News: General Re climbs despite lacklustre fourth quarter GENERAL Re, the largest reinsurance company in the US, yesterday reported an increase in after-tax profits for the year, to Dollars 656.7m from Dollars 613.6m, although operating income excluding realised gains had been static. The fourth-quarter advance in net profit was from Dollars 155.5m in 1990 to Dollars 184.2m. This figure for the final 1991 quarter was described as 'unsatisfactory' by General Re, but it added that the figure would have been only 'marginally so' had the big Oakland, California, fire not occured. General Re said its underwriting results had fallen 'short of our goals', but pointed out that they compared favourably with the rest of the reinsurance industry. The combined underwriting/expense ratio for the year increased from 99 per cent to 102 per cent, year-on-year, and in the fourth quarter alone reached 103 per cent. Operating income for the year, excluding realised gains, amounted to Dollars 561.8m, compared with Dollars 566m, with the fourth quarter showing a small improvement at Dollars 147.6m, against Dollars 146.8m. Revenues during the year increased slightly from Dollars 2.95bn to Dollars 3.2bn Shares in General Re, known to be operating in a weak reinsurance market, closed Dollars 1 7/8 higher at Dollars 95 1/8.</p>

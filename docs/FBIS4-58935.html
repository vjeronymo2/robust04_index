			<p>BFN     [Text] The U.S. assistant secretary of state for Middle  East affairs made a statement in Amman yesterday in which he  disclosed the U.S. Administration's determination to interfere  in the events witnessed in Yemen. He described what is taking  place there as civil war, and talked about what he called  military victories and the determination to fight in these  events.    This fact that this statement was made by someone who is  also  an official in the CIA reveals once again the dubious U.S.  intentions toward this fraternal country.    In a comment on this, JANA's political editor asked whether  these Americans have come to mediate, as their media claim, or  whether they have come, as is their custom, to sow discord,  incite hatred, and make the fighting spread, within the  framework of the plan they are implementing to destroy the Arab  nation.</p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-EXECUTIVE PLEADS GUILTY IN NAVY CONTRACT FRAUD  </P> <P> A former executive of a United Technologies Corp. division pleaded guilty  Friday to conspiring to illegally obtain inside information about a Pentagon  competition for a lucrative Navy contract.  </P> <P> Roger K. Engel, 49, a former vice president of the company's Norden Systems  division in Norwalk, Conn., pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the  government.  </P> <P> Engel, who agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department's investigation of  Pentagon procurement fraud called Operation Ill Wind, could receive a five-year  sentence and be fined up to $250,000.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton in Alexandria, Va., scheduled sentencing  for May 11.  </P> <P> Engel is the third former Norden Systems executive to plead guilty to  participating in the conspiracy to obtain inside bid information about a  $150-million contract to build a battlefield air traffic-control system for the  Marine Corps.  </P> <P> A former senior vice president of Norden, James E. Rapinec, 54, and C. J.  Richardson, a former marketing executive, pleaded guilty in December and are  also cooperating with prosecutors.  </P> <P> The three men have admitted that they arranged in 1988 for Norden to pay  defense consultant Thomas E. Muldoon $49,500 to get information about the  Navy's contract competition from his contacts in the Defense Department.  </P> <P> Muldoon was paid $27,500 before the Ill Wind investigation was disclosed in  June, 1988, when FBI agents searched the offices of a number of defense  contractors. Muldoon was sentenced last week to 27 months in prison in an  unrelated procurement case.  </P></p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Learmonth Burchett advances to Pounds 1.61m PROFITS before tax at Learmonth &amp; Burchett Management Systems jumped from Pounds 303,000 to Pounds 1.61m over the year to April 30, helped by a rights issue in January which enabled the computing services group to eliminate bank debt. The City had been expecting slightly more, however, and the shares were marked down 17p to close at 288p on little volume. Turnover rose 10.5 per cent, from Pounds 21.4m to Pounds 23.6m, while development costs were cut by 3 per cent to Pounds 3.1m, against Pounds 3.22m. Earnings per share were 7p, against 0.7p, and the company has returned to the dividend list with a single payment of 0.75p. The company now has net cash balances of Pounds 2m and no debt. LBMS is a computing services company specialising in software 'tools' and software programmes. Mr Rainer Burchett, chairman, said he believed the company's tool sets for systems engineers and process management engineers were well positioned for the expected market growth. Overseas sales were now 40 per cent of turnover and growth in the US had been particularly strong. Software product sales were 50 per cent of turnover. The principal brake on the company's growth and its efforts to reach a 10 per cent gross profit margin, however, was the depressed state of the UK market.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Russia and The G7: West foresees more close co-operation - Summit Communique Introduction At the request of heads of state and government of the seven major industrialised countries and of the president of the EC Commission, and in the process of preparation of the Tokyo summit, foreign and finance ministers of G7 countries and representatives of the European Community met in Tokyo April 14, 1993 to discuss support for reform in the Russian Federation. Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan opened the meeting, which was chaired jointly by Mr Kabun Muto, minister for foreign affairs and Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, minister of finance. On April 15 1993, the ministers met with Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime minister and finance minister of Russia, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, foreign minister, for an extended discussion of the economic and political situation in Russia and to review how the international community could best support Russia's reform programme. Our Russian colleagues reaffirmed the determination of President Yeltsin and his government to move forward with reform. They welcomed our determination to support the reform process. 2 Support for Russia's Reform Russia has embarked on a far reaching transformation process with the aim of building a democratic society, establishing a market economy and improving the welfare of its people under the leadership of President Yeltsin. Russia has made courageous and extraordinary progress in the last two years. Russian reform and progress towards democratisation are essential to world peace. We want to see a democratic, stable and economically strong Russia, firmly integrated into the community of democratic states and into the world economy. We are confident that the G7 and Russia will continue to co-operate constructively and responsibly in international affairs. The Russian people themselves must bear primary responsibility for economic and political reform. The development of a market economy in Russia will be a long, arduous undertaking which will require difficult adjustments by the Russian people. We assure them of our support in coping with the inevitable hardships of the transition period. We remain resolved to work with Russia to develop lasting co-operation based on the principles of partnership and help for self-help laid out at the Munich Summit. Our assistance will be pragmatic, visible, tangible and effective, tailored to Russian absorptive capacity and phased with the progress of reform. We welcome the recognition by the Russian government that both monetary stabilisation and further structural reform. including privatisation, are critical. A positive environment for private initiatives and investment, including a proper legal and administrative framework, is crucial for the transformation of the economy. Better access to export markets is indispensable to structural reform in Russia. 3 Bilateral and Multilateral Actions We have agreed on a series of multilateral actions closely linked with our bilateral efforts as described in the Annex. Close co-ordination among our countries and international organisations as well as close contacts with the Russian authorities will be necessary. Russia is currently experiencing a particularly difficult situation. We are also mindful of the challenging tasks facing other economies in transition. The success of the Russian reform programme is in the interest of all countries. . . 4. Next Steps Our meeting in Tokyo has helped lay the foundation for the meeting to be held with President Yeltsin in July in Tokyo. The heads of state and government of the G7 democracies and the president of the EC Commission will continue to pay close attention to developments in Russia. They look forward to a fruitful review in July.</p>

The high-ranking  government official said he did not know.    Does any government official know the answer? An  investigation by this newspaper has showed that no one can.  Neither the Ministry of Government nor the Foreign Ministry  really know how many DEA agents operate in Bolivia. This is  because they are hidden among the U.S. Embassy staff.    This issue came into the limelight more than a year ago when  a DEA agent wounded a Bolivian citizen in Santa Cruz. He was  immediately expatriated. The explanation given at that time was  that he was accredited as a diplomat. He thus had diplomatic  immunity under which, according to the Vienna Convention, the  host country grants immunity to representatives of the  governments with whom it maintains relations.    The Vienna Convention establishes that it is not necessary  for an embassy to inform a host government on the functions of  its embassy personnel because it is understood that their  activities will be strictly restricted to diplomatic norms.  There is a clear contradiction, however, between the work done  by the DEA agents and these norms which are being ignored by  both the DEA and the rest of the U.S. embassy members, who on  more than on one occasion have openly intervened in internal  Bolivian affairs.    The main subject that interests us -- that is, the "safe  houses" that the DEA keeps in several Bolivian cities where  alleged drug traffickers are questioned -- deserves official  explanation.    Claiming that the national police do not merit confidence  because connections have been found between some officers and  drug traffickers does not justify a third party carrying out the  duties of the Bolivian State.    Both the district prosecutor and the Human Rights Assembly  of  Santa Cruz have said that these agents ignore Bolivian laws and  their actions are not controlled by our national authorities who  have limited themselves to say: "There is no smoke without  fire." What is worse, the DEA chief refuses to receive a  national deputy in his office to discuss the charges.    We must recall that this is not the first time that this  kind  of irregular procedures by the DEA has been made public. During  the last administration, former Interior Minister Carlos  Saavedra Bruno was very concerned about charges that were made  and he said he would ask the U.S. Embassy for a report on the  activities of these "diplomats." The subject was not discussed  again, however, because of the election campaign flurry. But  the fact that the issue has again come to the limelight shows  that it cannot be controlled by our authorities. And this  cannot be so.    Following the announcement that the new U.S. drug  enforcement  policy has ruled out the militarization of the issue and efforts  will be concentrated on police interdiction -- which certainly  is good news -- it is necessary to establish clear rules that  must be respected by any kind of foreign "advisers" in this  field. Beside preserving our national sovereignty on such a  sensitive subject, the establishment of an agreement will help  the two countries to maintain relations in an atmosphere of  mutual respect.</p>

The new buildings,  which contrast with the modernistic concrete boxes that formed the early  nucleus of the campus, include the Italianate-style Alumni House, the Cubist  Student Services Building and the Pop-Modernist Graduate School of Management.  </P> <P> As university architect at Stanford, Neuman will oversee design of campus  buildings, including a plan to add more than 2 million square feet of space  over the next decade.  </P></p>

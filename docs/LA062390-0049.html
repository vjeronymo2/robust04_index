			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BELLA LEWITZKY AND THE NEA  </P> <P> What sanctimonious drivel coming from the lips of Lewitzky! I for one (but I am  certainly not alone in this) say to her: "Go ahead and keep your pious hands  off public tax monies!"  </P> <P> What people like Lewitzky and Michael Hudson of the (misnamed) People of the  American Way fail to realize is that the proposed NEA restrictions now being  considered by Congress in no way trample on anyone's First Amendment rights!  </P> <P> RANDALL J.

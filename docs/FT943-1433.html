			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Warsaw hotel financing debacle dismays Poles: A row eroding confidence in foreign investors A FFr340m (Pounds 40.8m) hotel financing package put together by Banque Nationale de Paris four years ago, in the days just after communism had collapsed in Poland, is coming under attack as it becomes clear the loans can never be repaid. Mr Jan Parys, new head of Holding Wars, the Warsaw city council-controlled company which owns the Mercure hotel in Warsaw, has said the construction costs of the hotel - built by Compagnie Generale de Batiment Construction (CBC) of France - were too high and the eight-year loan carrying a fixed 11 per cent interest rate condemned the project to permanent losses. The three-star, 250-room Mercure is one of the handful of hotels built in Warsaw over the past four years to cater for businessmen and tourists. This year it has had an average 70 per cent occupancy rate and expects to earn FFr45m at an operating cost of FFr22.5m. However, the terms of the loan, which was guaranteed by Coface, the French state export credit agency, require the hotel to pay FFr65m a year in capital and interest payments. Holding Wars is trying to renegotiate the terms of the loan. Three Polish banks, including the Bank Handlowy, which ultimately guaranteed the credits, are negotiating to take over the unpaid portion, worth FFr369m, from BNP. In the talks with the Polish banks BNP has agreed to waive its FFr29m fee for early repayment of the loan while Coface will not be asking for its insurance premium over the eight-year life of the loan to be paid, which saves another FFr27m. The talks are expected to be completed by the end of this month. CBC, which originally held 50 per cent of the equity in the Warsaw Mercure, withdrew in February. The hotel retains the Pullman franchise but the French hotel group has also withdrawn from the project. Day-to-day management of the hotel is now in the hands of Medan, a small French com-pany. CBC and Pullman were responsible for the original business plan in 1990 which was approved by Coface and the BNP. The French government also actively promoted the scheme. Foreign property consultants agree that the project was too expensive and suggest that the construction costs of a 250-room hotel like the Mercure in Warsaw should not have been higher than FFr130m for the scheme to be profitable. 'They didn't know what they were doing when they signed the deal,' says one. The debacle threatens Polish confidence in foreign investors. 'Who in 1990 would have questioned a business plan accepted by such renowned foreign companies?' Mr Parys says ruefully of his predecessors' decision to go ahead with the project. The centre is being built by Skanska, the Swedish building company, with the cost of the first phase set at Dollars 35.5m.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Blair puts fresh blood into shadow cabinet: 'Modernisers' promoted to economic portfolios Mr Tony Blair yesterday announced a shake-up of the shadow cabinet designed to promote fresh blood and put the main economic departments in the hands of his close allies. After a day of tortuous negotiations with the 18 shadow ministers elected by Labour MPs on Wednesday, Mr Blair settled on a line-up in which only five portfolios remain unchanged. The core economic appointments went to Mr Gordon Brown, who remains shadow chancellor, Ms Harriet Harman, who becomes shadow employment secretary, and Mr Jack Cunningham, who takes over as shadow trade and industry secretary. All three support the 'modernising' group which has helped Mr Blair to move Labour away from its former tax and spend economic philosophy. Mr Robin Cook, a traditionalist who had made plain his desire to remain close to the heart of economic policymaking, moves from the DTI brief to take over as shadow foreign secretary. The move was described as a promotion, reflecting Mr Cook's achievement in topping the poll for both the shadow cabinet and the MPs' section of the party's national executive. However, in a gesture to the traditionalists, Mr Cook has been promised membership of a new economic policy sub-committee which will also include Mr John Prescott, the traditionalist deputy leader. The big loser appeared to be Mrs Margaret Beckett, the former acting leader, who was re-elected to the shadow cabinet in second place, but failed to win one of the three big jobs shadowing the Treasury, Home Office or Foreign Office. Mrs Beckett, who unsuccessfully contested the leadership on a broadly traditionalist platform, was appointed shadow health secretary after failing to persuade Mr Blair that her popularity deserved a greater reward. Mr Jack Straw, a leading moderniser who ran Mr Blair's leadership campaign, was promoted from environment to the Home Office portfolio, in spite of polling poorly in the elections. Ms Mo Mowlam, another moderniser, moves from national heritage to replace Mr Kevin McNamara as shadow Northern Ireland secretary. The shadow cabinet's leading leftwing members moved sideways. Mr David Blunkett switched from health to education, Mr Michael Meacher from open government to transport, and Ms Joan Lestor from the family to overseas development. Mr Chris Smith, formerly environmental protection spokesman, replaces Ms Mowlam at national heritage; Mr Frank Dobson moves from transport to environment and London; and Mrs Ann Taylor moves from education to leader of the Commons and citizens' charter. Mr Gavin Strang retains his agriculture brief, Mr Donald Dewar, social security, Mr George Robertson, Scotland, Mr Ron Davies, Wales and Mr David Clark, defence.</p>

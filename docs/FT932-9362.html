			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Compromise reached on Clinton tax plan DEMOCRATS on the US Congress's main tax committee have agreed to make significant alterations to some of President Bill Clinton's tax proposals but to preserve the broad outlines of his plan. The compromise bill agreed by the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee still faces a rough passage in the full House and an even bumpier ride in the Senate. It will make a smaller increase in the corporate tax rate than Mr Clinton had proposed and allow substantial exemptions to the new energy tax that is to be assessed on the thermal content of fuels. But Mr Clinton welcomed the new bill, brokered by Mr Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who chairs the Ways and Means committee. He said the changes did not 'reduce the overall contribution from the business sector, they just shifted the way it comes.' As expected, Mr Rostenkowski's compromise would increase the corporate tax rate from 34 to 35 per cent, rather than 36 per cent as Mr Clinton had requested, but would abandon the administration's proposal for an investment tax credit. It will also abandon the administration's plan for new regulations that would increase the rate of taxation on foreign royalty income. After giving way to farmers and airlines over some elements of the energy tax, the administration will also have to give ground to the aluminium industry, a heavy user of electricity which has won an exemption from the tax. The bill preserves the largest component of Mr Clinton's plan, an increase in the income tax rates on the wealthiest 2 per cent of taxpayers.</p>

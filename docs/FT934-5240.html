			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Markets welcome assault on PSBR Financial markets gave a warm welcome to the Budget, marking up equities, gilts and sterling in response to a larger-than-expected cut in the projected public-sector borrowing requirement. Most economists, including five of the seven 'wise men' who advise the chancellor, hailed the focus on reduced public spending and the fact that the package avoids significant near-term additions to the tax burden. Professor Patrick Minford, one of the seven, said: 'This is a skilful Budget which has moved public spending control back to the centre of the budgetary process.' Other economists warned that extra taxes planned for 1995 and beyond would take a lot of spending power out of the economy. Mr Andrew Sentance, director of economics at the Confederation of British Industry and another of the 'wise men', said the chancellor might have to cut interest rates to sustain economic recovery. The FT-SE 100 share index rose 31.1 points on the day to close at 3,166.9. UK gilts rose 1 1/2 points in response to the PSBR projections. Sterling gained half a pfennig to close in London at DM2.5475, firming slightly in New York to DM2.5486. Economists' reactions, Page 35 Bonds, Page 57 Currencies, Page 59 London stocks, Page 68</p>

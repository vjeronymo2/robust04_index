			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Wistful sign-off for SDP 'WHAT Social Democrats have always said is that people are much more important than politics,' Mr John Cartwright, Social Democrat MP for Woolwich, concluded yesterday in a faintly wistful party political broadcast last night. Appropriately, it is only if their constituents share that 'people rather than politics' attitude that Mr Cartwright and Mrs Rosie Barnes, the Social Democrat MP for neighbouring Greenwich, stand any chance of re-election. The precedents for MPs prospering without parties are not encouraging. The SDP itself was broken in the mould of British politics, formally winding itself up in June 1990. Its survivors, however, remain entitled to a broadcast on the basis of the party's performance in the 1987 election. The product of one day's facilities from the BBC and the assistance of Mr Mike Thomas, a former SDP MP, this final appeal to the common sense of the ordinary voter came poignantly five years almost to the day after Mrs Barnes' by-election victory in Greenwich. But because it is not an election broadcast, it could not urge people explicitly to vote for the two MPs, nor even say where they are standing. Instead, Mr Cartwright said it was made 'because we want to make it clear to people that the ideas of social democracy are still there, still alive, and they're still extremely relevant to Britain at the present point.' In a quick-fire duet on the SDP's approach, the two MPs offered a serving of the party's familiar brand of compassion and efficiency. Of its most famous incarnation, Dr David Owen, the party's former leader who is standing down at the election, there was no mention. He had used a party broadcast during the Liberal Democrat conference last autumn to call for an anti-federalist crusade. Mr Cartwright concluded: 'A handful of Social Democrats in the House of Commons would clearly be part of that bridgehead for common sense which most people want to see between the two big parties.' With just two candidates, both of whom are defending majorities of about 2,000 in London constituencies against strong Labour challenges, belief in their ability to achieve even this is hard to square with the classic SDP mix of heart and head.</p>

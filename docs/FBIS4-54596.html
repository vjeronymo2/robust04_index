			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 3 (CTK) -- About 1.8 billion korunas  ($62 million) gained through the sales of surplus and  unnecessary Army property were transferred to the state budget  in 1993, Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys said at a press  conference today.    He said he was pleased at the government's approval of the  method of sales of Army buildings worth about 1 billion korunas  ($34,5 million). The Czech Army will get rid of this property  either by transferring them free of charge to municipalities, in  exchange for flats, or by selling them through real estate  agencies, Baudys said.    The Army has been selling unnecessary buildings because it  is  impossible for it to continuously earmark soldiers for guarding  them and money for their maintenance, Baudys explained.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with interim President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya </F> by Gerald Papy in Bujumbura; date not given]    [Text] A fair number of observers are predicting that  Burundian interim President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya will play a  key role in the stability of the country. President of the  National Assembly and of the FRODEBU [Burundian Democratic  Front] majority party, Ntibantunganya, who claims that recent  events have brought the government and army closer together, has  been designated to serve as the interim government leader  following the death of former head of state, Cyprien  Ntaryiamira, who was assassinated in Kigali. A rather frail  figure in a grey suit, he is a man who has established himself  following the conflict in Kamenge, the Hutu "rebel" stronghold  in Bujumbura, and who consented to receive us in his residence  overlooking the capital.    [Papy] The Kamenge crisis turned out to be a major political  test for the government. Was it a successful one?    [Ntibantunganya] I have personally congratulated the army on  its behaviour while the crisis was being resolved, both the  command and the troops in general. The aim of the disarmament  operation was to carry it out while causing as little damage as  possible. And that was what duly happened. It should serve as  an example for the security of the capital. However,  disarmament alone is not enough. We must now examine the defense  and security of the population in a global context, break the  yoke of distrust between the population and its army, encourage  this rapprochement so that reasonable solutions can be found in  tense situations.  <H5>  The Debate Is Open </H5>   [Papy] Is army reform a path that must be trodden in order  to  ensure stability in Burundi?    [Ntibantunganya] The problem with the army (which has a  Tutsi  majority -- LA LIBRE BELGIQUE editor's note) must be analyzed by  all of the country's leading politicians. The debate is open.  Moreover, you know, the army is not opposed to this. Even  before June 1993 (the date of democratic elections), a report  pointing to the same conclusion was drawn up by the military  institute itself. What is more, I would hope that people might  take a fresh look at it now. I do not think there is a need to  deal with the problem in terms of "ethnic quotas." Rather, we  must get to grips with it in the general framework of the  various state corps: The police, the army, and the  administration on the basis of ideological, regional, and ethnic  criteria so that these institutions are representative, legal,  and respectful of human rights.    [Papy] Claims are being made that a certain military  hierarchy which has gained in strength through the present  collaboration is actively backing your candidacy in the  presidential elections. Is this true?    [Ntibantunganya] First of all, the time has not yet come to  stand as a candidate. The current priority is to restore  security. Secondly, the army should not support a single  candidate, but rather the political authorities he represents  within the framework of democratic mechanisms.    [Papy] There are those who reproach the FRODEBU of being  incapable managers, the prime illustration of this supposedly  being the "rebellion" in Kamenge, which was supported by some of  your members.    [Ntibantunganya] It should be recalled that the government  established after the elections did not have the time to  establish its authority. President Ndadaye was assassinated  just 102 days after coming to power. Then he was hunted down  and the country was left to its own devices. How can you be  expected to govern a country as large as this one responsibly  when you lose two presidents in the space of six months? On the  other hand, the reaction after the tragic death of Cyprien  Ntaryiamira was positive. The country stayed calm and we did not  experience any spiral of violence like in Rwanda.  <H5>  Disinterest </H5>   On this latter point, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya deplores the  disinterest of the international community and "the abdication  of responsibilities" by the United Nations which "is setting up  a Human Rights Commission and at the same time showing that it  is incapable of guaranteeing even the very first of these  rights, the right to live." Furthermore, the Burundian Interim  President is calling for the presence in Bujumbura of UN civil  authorities who would serve as a base from which the democratic  process could be observed and monitored.    Today, President Ntibantunganya is being forced to face up  to  one priority: "To stamp out extremism" with the help of the  population.</p>

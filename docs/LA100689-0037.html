			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> It will be just like the old days, sort of, when the Jefferson Airplane plays a  free concert Saturday in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, with the Grateful  Dead's Bob Weir as opening act. Admission will be one can of food for the San  Francisco Food Bank. But demonstrating how things have changed in the 20 years  since free concerts in the park were the norm there, a radio station has had to  take out a $1-million insurance policy to cover the event.

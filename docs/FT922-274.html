			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Clamour for Collor's impeachment: Scandal has left Brazilian president's empire in tatters WHEN Fernando Collor de Mello swept into office as Brazil's first directly elected president for 30 years, he expected to go down in history as the man who saved the Brazilian economy. Now, with his empire in tatters amid Brazil's worst corruption scandal, Mr Collor seems more likely to enter the history books as the first Brazilian president to face impeachment. In a nation obsessed by soap operas - more people have access to television than to clean water - viewing figures are at record levels for live coverage of the congressional inquiry into Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, a close friend and campaign treasurer of Mr Collor. Known as 'Collorgate', the scandal directly implicates Mr Collor and many senior presidential aides accused of running a 'parallel scheme of government' to line their pockets. Instead of glory, Mr Collor is facing calls for his impeachment. The former leader of his government in the Congress is demanding he undergo a lie detection test while his younger brother Pedro, who initiated the investigation, insists he be submitted to medical examination to assess his sanity. When the inquiry began four weeks ago it was expected the matter would be quickly buried. But after the distraction of the Earth Summit, the last two weeks have seen dramatic revelations which have paralysed the economy and caused the stock market to drop 20 per cent. Businessmen and politicians have given detailed evidence of the alleged parallel scheme of government, telling of 30 per cent kickbacks - apparently the highest in Brazilian history - and cajoling phone calls from presidential aides. The latest bombshell was dropped by Mr Renan Calheiros, the government's former congressional leader, who said that he had warned Mr Collor of the situation 20 months ago. More damaging testimony is expected today from Mr Luis Octavio Motta Veiga, a former head of Petrobras, the state oil company. Mr Motta Veiga has already claimed that presidential aides were using the company for their own ends and he was dismissed because he would not collaborate in agreeing a Dollars 40m (Pounds 21.6m) interest-free loan for an airline which already owed money to Petrobras. Although little concrete proof has emerged, a poll last week found 65 per cent of the population believes Mr Collor to be personally corrupt. He did not help matters with an emotional address to the nation in which he could barely control his anger. Nor did Mr Mario Amato, president of the powerful Sao Paulo Business Federation, who, attempting to ease the situation, said 'we're all corrupt'. He later insisted he was referring only to the 'widespread culture of tax evasion'. The only thing likely to save Mr Collor is fear of what would happen to the newly democratic system were he forced out. Brazilian politics is highly fragmented and there is no obvious alternative candidate for the unenviable job of rescuing an economy from its third year of recession and monthly inflation of 23 per cent. Mr Collor's vice-president is widely considered unfit for office and the military has shown no desire to return to power.</p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUNNI MUSLIM A VOICE FOR MODERATION IN LEBANON  </P> <P> Salim Hoss, a Sunni Muslim who has been a voice of moderation through 14 years  of civil war in Lebanon, returns to the prime minister's office for the fourth  time in 13 years to try to end the fighting.  </P> <P> The 59-year-old economist is a firm backer of democracy, a free-wheeling  economy and Christian-Muslim coexistence. He is married to a Christian.  </P> <P> Hoss' main asset is the wide respect he commands among both Christians and  Muslims.  </P> <P> His previous tenure in office began June 2, 1987, a day after Prime Minister  Rashid Karami was assassinated.  </P> <P> Trained as an economist at the American University of Beirut, Hoss obtained a  doctorate in economics and business administration from Indiana University in  1959.  </P> <P> The tall, balding, bespectacled Hoss does not smoke or drink and normally goes  to bed early. He prefers Oriental food and likes to spend evenings listening to  classical music.  </P></p>

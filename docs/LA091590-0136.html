			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ESPERANZA'S RUSHERS RIP DIAMOND BAR  </P> <P> Esperanza High School's strong running game offset a weak passing night by  senior quarterback Keith McDonald and paced the Aztecs to a 30-3 victory over  Diamond Bar Friday night at Valencia High School.  </P> <P> Esperanza (2-0) rushed for 218 yards and had four running backs score  touchdowns.  </P> <P> The Aztec defense added a safety late in the game.  </P> <P> McDonald threw four interceptions -- his all-time worst -- and completed one of  nine pass attempts in the second half. He completed 9 of 21 for 113 yards on  the night.  </P> <P> Garrick Emry anchored the ground game for Esperanza with 92 yards on 17  attempts and a touchdown. His performance was supported by Chris Weissman  (three carries for 55 yards and a touchdown), Jarod Smith (five carries for 41  yards and a touchdown) and Marcus Tayui (six carries for 24 yards and a score).  </P> <P> Diamond Bar's (1-1) only score was a 37-yard field goal by Nate Wolford with  4:55 remaining in the first half. The Brahmas managed 94 yards rushing and 46  yards passing. DENNIS KAISER  </P></p>

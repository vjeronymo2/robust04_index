			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Conservatives follow Labour lead in focusing on the individual: Employment White Paper - People, Jobs and Opportunity LABOUR claims to have been first off the mark. To stress its distance from the old collectivism it has been promising a charter to increase the rights of individuals at work. Yesterday - in a white paper entitled People, Jobs and Opportunity - the Conservative party outlined its plans for 'unlocking the potential of each and every individual' by widening choice and freedom and, in some cases, increasing rights. 'There is a new recognition of the role and importance of the individual employee,' it said. In the past 13 years individual rights at work have meant, for the Conservatives, the right to challenge the trade union collective. Labour's accusation that proposals in the original green paper on employment were just the 'old agenda' of negative union-bashing appears to have struck home. For the Conservatives to adopt the theme of individual rights at work will seem like a bad joke to many trade unionists. They say the labour market de-regulation of the past decade has stripped workers of rights by, for example, denying people the right to appeal against unfair dismissal until they have been employed for two years. The Conservatives, however, do not have Labour's problem of trying to marry individual rights with collective ones. Emphasising the continuing differences with Labour, the white paper rejects the 'increasingly inappropriate patterns of industrial relations, based on collective bargaining and collective agreements'. Labour's backing for ideas such as a national minimum wage and works councils - and the European Community's attempts to introduce uniform models of industrial relations - are rejected in favour of a less prescriptive approach. 'Much depends on the actions of employers . . . the government's role is to create the framework within which individual choice and opportunity can flourish.' The white paper, which in places has the tentative air of a green paper, is very much a political document. But it includes suggestions for best practice which employers should follow as well as changes to the law. The proposals include: Terms of employment: Laws would be introduced to give every employee working more than eight hours a week the right to a statement on his or her terms and conditions of employment within two months of starting work. Employees going to work abroad would be entitled to receive additional information before departure. The statement would include information about pay, hours of work and holidays and, possibly, training. Any changes would be notified by the employer directly to individuals in writing. The government proposes to extend the jurisdiction of industrial tribunals so they are able to decide complaints about breaches of employment contracts when an employee leaves. Poaching of trained employees: The government floats the idea of legislation that would make it harder for employers to poach workers trained by other organisations. Employers 'may want to offer training under a contract which provides for the individual to work for a period after training or repay some of the costs'. The government is considering simplifying the procedure for training contracts by bringing them within the jurisdiction of industrial tribunals. Voucher scheme for careers advice: These will be on offer in some areas from April 1993 and are aimed at strengthening career information, assessment and counselling services for adults who are, in the main, already in employment. The white paper does not detail who will be entitled to the vouchers but the idea would be to concentrate on the lowest skilled and lowest paid. Young people are entitled by law to help from their local careers service. The white paper says provision for adults is 'variable'. A few of the employer-led training and enterprise councils (Tecs) are piloting a careers-advice voucher scheme offering credits of between about Pounds 60 and Pounds 120 to individuals. A total of 15 Tecs will be involved in extending the scheme and it is intended 250,000 people will benefit over two years. Individual training accounts: An individual and the employer would contribute jointly over time to an 'account' for training. The white paper makes no specific proposals but says the government 'believes that this is an approach worth testing further'. Tecs will be asked to organise pilot projects. Home study: Vocational 'open learning' materials and back-up services will be available in local libraries over the next three years. Pilot schemes will be set up by Tecs to make vouchers available to unemployed people so they can buy home-study books, courses and support. Flexible working: The Department of Employment will soon publish a guide on the benefits of flexible working, providing good-practice guidance on annualised hours, career breaks and working from home. It will continue to oppose European Commission proposals to restrict working hours 'unnecessarily'. Equal opportunities: A government minister will chair a proposed advisory group to assist in encouraging and disseminating good employment practice for older workers. The white paper says employers sometimes forget the value of older workers but says legislation on age limits in recruitment and other issues would be ineffective. The Employment Department plans guidance on sexual harassment. Trade unions: As first outlined in a green paper last autumn individuals would be given greater freedom to join the union of their choice, a right to more financial information about it and a right to restrain unlawful organisation of industrial action in a public service they use. Union members would be 'protected' against abuses of 'check-off' arrangements under which subscriptions are deducted from salary. Poaching employees, Page 11 Letters, Page 17</p>

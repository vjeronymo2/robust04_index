			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Slight Rise In Foreign Trade In </F> 1993"]    [Text] Netherlands foreign trade seems to have increased  slightly compared to 1992. Last year's imports were worth 235  billion guilders and exports 258 billion guilders. In 1992,  these figures were 236 billion and 247 billion guilders  respectively.    The CBS [Central Bureau of Statistics] points out, however,  that a comparison between the two years is difficult because  since 1 January 1993 companies which import from or export to  countries in the European Union [EU] no longer have to submit  customs documents.    Instead, companies are now legally obliged to submit details  of their trading activities directly to the CBS. Dutch exports  to EU countries exceeded imports in 1993. While exports  amounted to 191 billion guilders, imports were 144 billion  guilders.    Outside the EU the balance was reversed. Exports to non-EU  countries amounted to 67 billion guilders, compared to imports  of 91 billion guilders. There was no change in the country's  top three trading partners. Germany and Belgium were, as usual,  firmly established in the top two places. For exports, France  ranked third and for imports the United Kingdom ranked third.    Major increases were recorded last year in exports to China,  Indonesia and Brazil. Ireland and China accounted for an  increased share of imports.</p>

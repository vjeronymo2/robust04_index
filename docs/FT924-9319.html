			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / World Trade News: US and French farm lobbies deprive world of Gatt deal - A chance slipped away because governments 'haven't got the guts to face them down,' one negotiator says A GATT deal has slipped through the world's fingers because of the power of the US and French farm lobbies, and because, as one senior EC negotiator put it, governments 'haven't got the guts - that's the word, guts - to face them down.' On the evenings of October 12 and November 3, EC negotiators say the US was ready to settle both on the farm chapter of the Uruguay Round and on the linked dispute over EC oilseeds production. On the first occasion, they say, Mr Ed Madigan, the US agriculture sec-retary, took a phone call from Mr Dean Kleckner, head of the US Farm Bureau, the main lobby group, after which he said a deal was not possible then. On November 3, Mr Madigan broke off the Chicago talks to vote in the US presidential election. The throngs of lobbyists in the hotel where the talks were held had been complaining they had been unable to reach Mr Madigan during the previous two days. EC negotiators assume they did during the agriculture secretary's unusually long voting break, after which the US went several steps backwards on the draft oilseeds compromise - a factor in the collapse of the talks. France, too, as Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, French agriculture secretary, confirmed yesterday in parliament, had been trying to put pressure on Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, in Chicago. Once it became clear in Paris how close to a deal the two sides had been on October 12, Mr Soisson was mandated to block agreement, Commission officials close to the French government say. France ignored the Commission's argument that Paris had signed up to greater cuts under CAP reform than the EC would suffer under a Gatt deal. Nonetheless, one highly-placed Commission official says that when Mr Soisson was shown the CAP figures in Brussels, he said if he had known that was the position, he would have refused the job. 'It is clear that France never really intended to comply with CAP reform,' the official said. After a long silence on Gatt, Mr Jacques Delors, Commission President, then pitched in to the controversy, saying 'the adolescent Community should be able to say 'no' to its big brother (the US), provided it has a sound argument to do so.' Mr Delors dismissed as 'pure slander', suggestions that he was motivated by French presidential ambitions; his aides say he feared serious unrest in France and felt the EC was being railroaded as part of the re-elect Bush effort. Mr MacSharry, nevertheless, let it be known that he regarded Mr Delors' periodic interventions as little short of sabotage. He also built an alliance in the 16-strong Commission to defeat Mr Delors. Senior EC officials confirm Mr Soisson's claim that Mr Delors phoned Mr MacSharry in Chicago to express his opposition to the deal then taking shape. The Commission president is also understood to have said that two member states would veto such a package - invoking overwhelming national interest - and that he would oppose Mr MacSharry inside the Commission. The farm commissioner pressed on anyway, but, as one senior official said angrily, the intervention from Brussels 'didn't help our credibility.' In the event, Mr MacSharry was left at the altar by Mr Madigan, and the Commission had no Gatt package to vote on. But on his return, Mr MacSharry appears to be trying to put Mr Delors on the spot. He is understood to have written to the Commission president handing over to him his Gatt negotiating responsibilities, although Mr Delors' spokesman said yesterday: 'This does not correspond to reality.' The irony in the French position is that without a Uruguay Round agreement which would protect the reformed CAP, France's and the EC's cereals and beef exports will be at the mercy of a series of subsidy complaints being prepared for Gatt by Australia, New Zealand and Argentina, quite aside from the effect of US sanctions. That, of course, is if the world's main traders continue to play by Gatt rules - an assumption which may prove optimistic. See Editorial Comment</p>

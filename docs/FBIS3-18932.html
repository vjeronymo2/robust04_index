"We said in December that very likely the budget objectives  for 1994 would not be met and that new measures would have to be  taken within the year," said Russo. "We are now confirming that  opinion, which is widely shared," he said.    He also said he believed the elections were weighing on  Italy's economy, and that "political uncertainties have to be  clarified before a full-scale recovery can take place."    "The U.S. recovery reflects the fact that recession began  there first and now the country is recovering. The rate of  recovery is good but not exceptional; for Europe the timing is  slower," Russo said.    Italy's gross domestic product should grow 1-1.1 percent,  "as  predicted in December," he added.</p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DADDY TRACK  </P> <P> Ideal parent-child time allocation will come with the six-hour, four-day work  week. Meanwhile, there are all sorts of time-bending tricks to live by now.  Properly utilized youth groups (such as Boy Scouts and Indian Guides) can offer  team daddying by matching skills and time available to maximize children's  growth and development. Back when I was parenting, athletic dads coached  sports. "Nerd" dads (that was me) set up the butter-making, rifle-range,  blood-typing, Mother's Day-corsage, ant-farm and secret-code projects.  Weekend-off dads handled hiking, fishing and camping. Night-working dads led  the museum historical site and factory trips after school.  </P> <P> EDWARD H. GUYOT, Santa Clarita  </P></p>

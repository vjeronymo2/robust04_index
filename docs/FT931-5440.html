			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: Weak economic data fuel strong Treasuries rally NEWS of a big rise in weekly jobless claims and a fall in monthly factory orders fuelled another big rally in US bond markets yesterday, although prices came off their highs late in the day on nervousness ahead of today's key employment report. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  25/32 at 105 5/32 , yielding 6.722 per cent. Earlier in the day the issue had been more than a full point higher, and the yield had dropped down below 6.7 per cent for the first time ever. At the short end of the market the gains were considerably less pronounced. The two-year note was up  1/8 at 100 1/4 , to yield 3.721 per cent. Buyers of government securities were evident overnight on foreign markets, but prices did not really take off until New York trading opened. The market was energised by two sets of economic data - the 26,000 increase in unemployment claims during the third week of January (analysts had expected claims to rise by not much more than 5,000) and the 1.3 per cent decline in January factory orders (analysts had expected a decline of about only half that figure). The figures, while bullish for bonds because they suggest the economic recovery may be slowing, were not enough on their own to justify yesterday's big gains. Traders said that the market recently has been 'feeding on itself', and that there has been a big move into bonds by investors in mortgage-backed securities, where falling interest rates have raised fears of heavy pre-payment by mortgage-holders. Some dealers categorised some of yesterday's early buying as 'panicky'. The market retreated later in the day, however, as investors took to the sidelines before today's important jobs report for February. The monthly employment numbers are traditionally the most closely watched indicators of economic activity, and investors will be looking to today's statistics for the latest indication on how the labour market is responding to recent improvements in economic growth. Analysts are forecasting that non-farm payrolls will show a moderate increase of about 125,000 for February, which would follow January's 106,000 gain. MOST European bond markets continued to rally yesterday despite disappointment when the Bundesbank decided to leave German official interest rates unchanged. An initial setback on the news was reversed as bond markets turned their sights instead to the next planned meeting of the Bundesbank council, on March 18. The German market jumped to new highs once the news had been digested, before falling back to end with 10-year bund yields just one basis point down on the day. The gains were stronger in other continental markets, however, with the yield on Danish government bonds falling by 12 basis points, on Swedish bonds by nine basis points and on Spanish bonds by three basis points. 'Europe is relaxed about today's news,' said Mr Richard Gray, an analyst with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London. Longer-dated bond prices across Europe could continue to strengthen in anticipation of the forthcoming German cuts, though short-term interest rates would remain volatile as pressures ebbed and flowed in the European exchange rate mechanism, he said. The March bund future on Liffe, which opened the day at 95.90, fell to below 95.60 and then jumped as high as 96.16 before settling back at 95.95. French bond futures followed a similar pattern, the March Notionell contract on the Matif in Paris hitting a high of 114.80 before settling back at 114.46. After a strong performance this week which has seen the yield spread between the French and German markets tighten notably, French cash bonds eased back a little yesterday. UK government bonds eased on the day, though continuing demand for sterling paper - which also prompted Pounds 350m of Eurosterling bonds to be issued - acted as a support to the market. The June long gilt future, which started the day at 106 1/2 , slid to 106 1/4 by the close, while cash gilts lost less than a quarter of a point.</p>

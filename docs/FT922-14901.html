			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Bonuses paid early to avoid Labour tax plans: City's poll fears seen as cause of payments shift THERE has been a marked increase in the number of companies bringing forward bonus payments to avoid the possibility of being affected by Labour's proposed tax increases. Computer Management Group, which claims to process 10 per cent of the UK's payroll market, says it has noted a distinct shift in bonus payments across a broad sector of industry. Mr John Benson, the group's managing director, said: 'While it is not uncommon for companies to make bonus payments at this point in the financial year, the only obvious conclusion that can be drawn from our observations is that companies are making these payments in the 1991-92 tax year rather than take the risk of potentially higher rates in the 1992-93 tax year.' He added that the company's confidentiality clause prohibited him from naming any of the companies involved. A number of banks and stockbrokers in the City, which normally award bonuses in the late spring and early summer, have brought them forward. Smith New Court, for example, said it had brought forward a proportion of each person's bonus to avoid the possibility of higher tax under Labour. The apparent acceptance that Labour might win the election is an embarrassment to some City firms. As recently as early March, 48 per cent of Smith New Court's fund manager clients thought the election would lead to an overall majority for the Tories. Other city firms that are believed to have brought forward bonuses include SG Warburg and Robert Fleming. Indications that bonus payments have increased in the approach to the general election follow reports from accountants that clients have been seeking other 'tax-efficient' measures so that they will receive income in the current financial year.</p>

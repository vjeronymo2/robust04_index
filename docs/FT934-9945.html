			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Computers in Finance (1): Cost-consciousness takes control - The growth in investment in new technology tends to camouflage a measure of disillusionment with the results of computerisation which may curb budgets in future THE global financial services industry has continued to invest strongly in computer technology despite deep recession and economic uncertainty in its principal markets. The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) estimates that spending on information technology by US banks had a compound annual growth rate of 8.4 per cent in the decade between 1980 and 1990 with little sign of slackening in the early 1990s. Non-interest expenses on the other hand, grew at only 4.7 per cent. Figures for the UK compiled by Price Waterhouse, the management consultants, suggest a growth rate of 7.5 per cent between last year and this. These are somewhat below the most aggressive growth rates of the 1980s, but the banks, building societies, trusts and insurance companies remain the computer industry's prime customers. To some extent, financial services companies have little choice but to continue to upgrade their computer systems. Their back office accounting systems demand an annual increases in raw processing power of up to 40 per cent. Add the newer, front office applications and the numbers become very large indeed. In the banks' favour, however, is the fact that the real cost of computing power continues to fall rapidly. BCG estimates that over the decade of the 1980s, the cost per unit of capacity fell by 90 per cent. The actual sums spent, however, can be very large amounting, in a big bank, to four per cent or more of revenues. In 1992, according to Information Week magazine, JP Morgan had an IT budget of Dollars 625m, some 6.1 per cent of revenues. Banc One, the innovative Ohio-based bank, spent Dollars 390m, 6.5 per cent of its Dollars 5.9bn revenues. In Europe, Paribas spent Dollars 914m out of revenues of Dollars 21bn while in the UK National Westminster spent Dollars 835m spent on revenues of Pounds 18bn. The growth in investment, however, tends to camouflage a measure of disillusionment with the results of computerisation which may curb budgets in future. BCG earlier this year surveyed IT spending in 12 banks, six in Europe, five in the US and one in Australasia. All were large, well-managed institutions with a good record in information technology. Yet BCG concluded that up to 40 per cent of the money they were spending on IT was of low value. Six of the banks, for example, gave examples of significant project failures or disappointments which in total cost more than Dollars 100m. Eight of them said that there were more successes than failures in 'leading edge' projects where either the technology or the application was stretching the boundaries of experience. It is not surprising therefore than in the cost-conscious 1990s, Price Waterhouse should conclude that new and emerging technologies are not at the top of most IT directors' wish lists - 'rather, the cost-wary IT director of 1992/93 seems more concerned with providing a reliable, proven, flexible and maintainable system solution to a business problem than in providing 'competitive advantage through leading-edge technology.' Competitive advantage, the watch words of the eighties, have been tempered in favour of cost-containment.' Mr Simon Farmbrough and David Marsh of BCG have produced a list of 'golden rules' to help financial services companies get better value from their IT investments. 'Do not commission IT projects,' they warn, going on to explain that what should be commissioned is a system to exploit a business opportunity. 'We commissioned a customer database project - we should have commissioned a cross-selling initiative,' bemoaned one bank's chief information officer. They point to one bank which tried to develop a system to monitor profitability at the level of individual customers. It required a new mainframe-based, bank-wide information design: Dollars 50m and three years later, it is still under development. Another bank, meanwhile, went for segment profitability at the strategic level using personal computers. Its initiative was implemented in 12 months at a cost of Dollars 1m and is already bringing benefits. FARMBROUGH and Marsh are especially hard on banks which neither attempt to quantity the benefits from a project nor assign responsibility to managers for faults and failures. They are in no doubt that the potential for benefit from well-aligned IT investments is huge, but that profiting from them is a management issue, not a technical one. Some technologies, however, seem likely to confer significant benefits over the next few year. One of the more important is object-oriented programming or OOP. In essence, it is a technique which makes it possible to re-use pieces of computer code rather than developing them from scratch each time. OOP offers a way out of the trap of 'legacy' systems which imprison so many companies. Legacy systems were developed in old technologies which are too inflexible to adapt to modern market demands. According to Price Waterhouse: 'IT directors feel hamstrung by the age, complexity and poor integration of existing systems. These systems soak up scarce resources and inhibit a fast response to business needs, but there is little funding to replace them. A classic Catch-22 situation.' Some companies are moving rapidly to solve the problem. There can be few international bankers who have never encountered Midas, the venerable banking system developed by BIS, now part of the ACT group. Written first in the 1970s, it has had its face lifted a number of times. Now, however, the latest additions to the system are being developed using object-oriented programming methods developed by a small UK company Softwright Systems and the computer giant International Business Machines. The idea is that, over time, Midas will become in its entirety an object-oriented system, extending its useful life beyond 2000. A decade ago, financial institutions had to decide how to respond to the challenge of the personal computer after years of centralised processing. In retrospect, that was merely the thin edge of the wedge. Today, the situation is more complex. Among the technologies such as object orientation which have to be taken into account are client-server computing, graphical user interfaces, opens systems and artificial intelligence. All of these are essential to what is becoming known as business process re-engineering, recreating new business infrastructures to meet business needs of increasing flexibility and responsiveness. Opening this year's Sibos conference, Mr Eric Chilton, newly appointed chairman of Swift, the interbank payments messaging system, warned: 'Re-engineering is not adapting old methodologies to the changing environment. It is rather a fundamental reappraisal of the whole end-to-end process. This requires dramatic change and complete rethinking.' Many the world's financial institutions are already rethinking their strategies as they prepare for the business environment of the late 1990s. In this process, technology is the means rather than the end. Technological bravado is going out of fashion like winking lights on computer cabinets.</p>

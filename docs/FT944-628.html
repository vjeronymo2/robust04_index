			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Battle of Trafalgar begins - Bids The first take-over of a privatised utility began this week with Trafalgar House's Pounds 1.25bn bid for Northern Electric, writes David Lascelles. It should provide an interesting test for what could be a wave of take-overs and mergers in the power sector. Northern was quick to reject the bid as coming from 'a financially challenged conglomerate', a reference to Trafalgar's troubled recent history. It also said the bid consisted of 'paper of uncertain value'. These, though, are the clashes one expects in a contested bid. Northern's private shareholders (and there are 120,000 with fewer than 1,000 each) can afford to wait many weeks, even months, for the smoke to clear before having to make firm decisions. The bid is worth Pounds 10.48 a share in cash, or slightly more in a mixture of cash and convertible shares. The offer price is not far enough above the price of the shares themselves (Pounds 10.06 at last night's close) to guarantee success, but there is a long way to go. A big question is whether the bid will be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission where, being the first of its kind, its fate would be hard to predict. Here, Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, could play an important role. He said this week that the bid raised a number of issues which he would like to examine. At his prompting, Trafalgar has offered Pounds 20 already to each of Northern's customers to make it more acceptable. The government itself owns a blocking 'golden share' but this expires on March 31 and is unlikely to play a big role in the bid (which could not be completed much before then, anyway). Politically, however, Labour might try to portray this as yet another bonanza for privatisation stockholders, which could be another reason for sending it to the MMC. Whether the debate touches on the merits of the bid itself remains to be seen. Trafalgar is thought to be making the sally to get its hands on Northern's strong cash flow; it has nothing special to offer managerially. On the other hand, financial analysts feel Northern's management could do with a bit of gingering up. Portals, the specialist paper supplier, this week succumbed at last to the overtures from De La Rue and accepted a Pounds 682m offer from the world's biggest commercial bank-note printer, writes Chris Price. The move will give De La Rue control of one of its main paper suppliers and boost its access to Portals' customer contacts among the world's central banks. Jeremy Marshall, De La Rue's chief executive, said: 'With Portals' paper manufacturing and our printing expertise, the enlarged group will be able to enjoy greater technological focus, particularly in anti-counterfeiting, and a strengthening of customer relationships.' The deal is expected to dilute De La Rue earnings slightly for the year to March 31 1995, be neutral in 1995-96, and enhance earnings the year after. De La Rue will pay Pounds 403m in cash for Portals, with the rest being covered by a fully underwritten issue of new shares. The offer of nine shares and Pounds 124 in cash for every 20 Portals shares values the latter at Pounds 10.50 per share. Portals' shareholders will be offered a full cash alternative of Pounds 10.11 1/2 a share and a mix-and-match facility.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CURRENT TAKEOVER BIDS AND MERGERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company        Value of  Market    Price   Value of bid for         bid per  price+   before    bid Pds    Bidder                  share+              bid        ms+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Andrews Sykes       65*     135       67      10.70    Euro Fire Prot.

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Letter: 'Snake' may lessen ERM's difficulties (1) Sir, Rather than fixing a new and arbitrary 15 per cent fluctuation band for most ERM currencies, ERM members might have been better off considering a mechanism that allows for both market forces and flexible excess control. A true 'snake' may be the answer. It could be created by first letting all ERM currencies briefly float in order to establish a true market reference exchange rate for currency couples and then introducing a flexible fluctuation band around the moving average (calculated for a uniform period of time) of each exchange rate. The boundaries for this band could be set at one or more standard deviation of each currency couple. This snake would let market forces act quite freely, while also allowing for central bank intervention each time the boundaries or the flexible band are approached or touched. This way there would hardly be any need for periodic re-sets of rigid thresholds. Lucien Peters, 21 rue de Gostingen, L-5414 Canach, Luxembourg</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Hoechst to appoint first foreigner to main board Hoechst, the German chemicals multinational, yesterday announced an infusion of fresh blood - and foreign experience - into top management. Mr Ernest Drew, 57, chairman and chief executive of the group's Hoechst Celanese US subsidiary, is to become the first foreign member of the main board in the company's history. Mr Horst Waesche, 54, president of Hoechst-Japan, will also join the board after spending virtually his entire career in eastern Asia. Mr Drew will replace Mr Hans Georg Janson on his retirement on January 10 next year, while Mr Waesche will take the seat of Mr Karl Holoubek. In the interim, chairman Mr Jurgen Dormann, in office since spring, will reshuffle boardroom responsibilities. Mr Drew, whose only previous foreign working experience was in Canada, said yesterday he had no preferences and no idea what he would be doing apart from starting German lessons today. However, he expected announcements in the next few months which would indicate the future direction of the company. Mr Drew was until recently head of a working party which reported to the board last month after investigating possible structural changes in group operations. These seem likely to include a more aggressive approach to investment in the Asia Pacific region, where demand for chemicals and raw materials for manufacturing is growing at double the rate in Europe. Mr Waesche, who has worked for Hoechst in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, recently completed a restructuring of Japanese operations which he has run since 1987. The appointments appear to complete a top-level shake-out which started shortly after Mr Dormann's arrival when the company announced that membership of the management board was to be reduced from 11 to nine.</p>

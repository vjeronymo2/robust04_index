During the comment period on the proposal, comments were received which indicated that customers of Western's Integrated Projects would not support inclusion of the PRP in the Integrated Projects. Subsequently, on July 11, 1994, Western announced its intent to modify its original proposal and market this power and energy independent of the Integrated Projects. Western has determined that capacity and energy produced by the PRP will be allocated to those members of Intermountain Consumers Power Association (ICPA) and Utah Municipal Power Agency (UMPA) located in Utah and Wasatch Counties in Utah. ICPA and UMPA are hereinafter referred to as the Contractors. Power will be allocated to the Contractors proportional to their load. Separate power sales contracts will be offered to each of the Contractors. The term of the contracts will extend until September 30, 2008. Contractors will pay all of the annual powerplant expenses of the PRP including an amount to assist the Provo River Water Users Association (Water Users) repayment of the United States original investment in the PRP. In return, the Contractors will receive all of the marketable output of the PRP. Service to the Contractor's will begin upon execution of the electric service contracts. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=2 --> Mr. Kenneth G.

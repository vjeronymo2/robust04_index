			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / MoD rapped for 72% extra cost of Trident base The construction of Britain's Trident nuclear submarine base has cost Pounds 1.9bn, 72 per cent more in real terms than originally expected, says a report published by the National Audit Office today. The cost overrun on the 10-year programme of works at Faslane in Strathclyde and nearby Coulport reflects changes in nuclear safety standards, and a failure by the Ministry of Defence to define precise requirements in the early stages, the public spending watchdog says. The programme, one of the biggest construction exercises in Europe, was largely completed last July - a year later than planned - while some individual projects have been delayed for more than two years. The NAO describes the Trident works as a 'considerable technical achievement' which had to contend with changes in safety standards and sometimes unco-ordinated instructions from the ministry. One of the biggest overruns was in spending on consultancy, which ran to Pounds 360m against an original projection of Pounds 78m. A giant shiplift, as tall as an 11-storey building and as long as a football stadium, cost nearly three times more than anticipated, at about Pounds 340m. The watchdog found that in the MoD 'problems of co-ordination frequently arose' because 'a large number of authorities had an interest in defining the works requirement'. Only after 1991 was there a single point of authority for project definition. The project was managed for the defence ministry by the Property Services Agency, the government's property management body, both before and after the agency's privatisation in 1992. The NAO says there were defects in the reporting arrangements between the ministry and the agency, leading to a failure of control over design changes. These problems were largely corrected after April 1992. It was originally hoped that the base would be ready for sea trials of the first Trident submarine in June 1992. This deadline was eventually abandoned, but because of the initially strict timetable contracts were entered without agreement on precise designs. As design changes became necessary, and stricter safety standards were imposed, the contractors were able to demand extra time and money.</p>

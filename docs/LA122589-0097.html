			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FROM THE 'GREATEST SHOWMAN ON EARTH'  </P> <P> Step right up, ladies and gentlemen, the Barnum Museum is not for suckers.  </P> <P> The three floors of the newly refurbished museum located in Bridgeport, Conn.,  are filled with memorabilia from the life and times of Phineas Taylor Barnum  (1810-1891), the father of mass-market entertainment.  </P> <P> Welcoming guests to the first floor is a six-foot animated statue of Barnum.  Visitors can find displays dedicated to Barnum's life: photographs, articles of  clothing, his checkbook (his checks were imprinted with a picture of his first  mansion). Video monitors offer bits of the 1986 TV film, "Barnum," starring  Burt Lancaster.  </P> <P> The second floor offers selections of 19th-Century fine and decorative arts,  reproductions of Barnum's four mansions and a display of the many goods made in  Bridgeport's factories since the beginning of New England's industrial age.  </P> <P> The entire third floor is dedicated to Barnum's circuses and his American  Museum in New York. Here you can find advance publicity material for singer  Jenny Lind and scaled-down furnishings from the home of Gen. Tom Thumb, as well  as a scale model of "The Greatest Show on Earth."  </P> <P> The museum is open Tuesdays through Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and  Sundays from noon to 4:30 p.m. It is closed Mondays and national holidays.  Admission is $4 for adults, $3 for seniors and students, and $2 for children  ages 2 to 18.  </P></p>

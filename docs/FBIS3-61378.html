			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General A. Lebed by A. Platitsyn; </F> place and date not given: "I Shall Remain the People's Champion"]    [Text] Since the newspapers published in the Dniester  region are not distributed on the Bessarabian territory of the  republic (especially, naturally, the newspaper of the 14th  Russian Army SOLDAT OTECHESTVA), it is sometimes necessary to  print excerpts from certain articles or references to them.    In this case the interest in the item is so great  (after being quoted repeatedly on radio and television) that we  decided to reprint the article in its entirety in spite of its  length. The more so since the crucial nature of the information  and the clarity of presentation are among its undisputed  merits.    [Platitsyn] Alexksandr Ivanovich, it seems that in the  Dniester region things are proceeding to a point where, as you  predicted in an interview for KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA in April, the  people are just about to "reach for their pitchforks."  Negotiations on a political settlement, in spite of the efforts  of the mission of the CSCE and the plan it proposed for  reconciliation of the sides, have come up against insurmountable  differences. Nobody wants to back down. Having been left the  only collector of old Soviet money, the republic is rushing  toward a financial and economic crash. One cannot quite  understand the attempts on the part of the authorities to  regulate monetary circulation by political methods. What do you  have to say about the situation that has developed?    [Lebed] Pay attention to the trio in the Dniester delegation  to the negotiations with Moldova. A. Volkova, V. Yakovlev, and  T. Zenovich will make every effort to continue these  negotiations forever and make sure they come to nothing. And  this in no way serves the interests of the people. Both  delegations remind one of cats in heat sitting for hours  opposite one another howling plaintively but always ready to  pounce on a rival. The conclusion of the CSCE mission is a  balanced and well-considered document. Not everything in it is  indisputable. But it is possible to talk. This requires only one  thing--the existence of political will. And this is lacking and  none can be seen in the future so far. I do not want to  second-guess Moldova--they are approaching the subject of the  negotiations from different positions.    As for the Dniester region, the question is extremely clear  here. From many years of experience we know that authority  corrupts people so severely that it is necessary to be very  stalwart and conscientious person in order to have the courage  to renounce it voluntarily. Under the cover of political  demagogy and primitive duping of the people, authorities in the  PMR [Dniester Moldovan Republic] are doing everything they can  to preserve the gigantic political superstructure that has been  created recently. This entire theater with the president, the  commander in chief, the ministers, the generals, and the  innumerable host of civil servants and assistants constitute an  unbearable burden on the people's back. In words we all respect  Lenin for his modesty and his Spartan way of life, but in  reality practically nobody is willing to give up their  privileges provided by power. On the contrary, they have  conveniently placed their wives and children in prestigious  offices, stuck antennas in luxurious government foreign  limousines, and darkened the windows in them so that the people  cannot see their servants, and they ride around Tiraspol  splashing mud on the bus stops of the people they are supposed  to be serving day and night.    If there is an opportunity they take a free trip to America  or Austria, and they do not even consider it necessary to inform  the people of the purposes or results of these trips, or they  might fly to Sakhalin to hang out for 10 days. Which is not to  say that any fish will be delivered from there. Understandably,  a person would have to be a fool to turn down such benefits. Let  us imagine for a moment that same "colonel" Gratov:  sober-minded, he rides the bus, he has gone without pay for  three months. This is not even funny. People like him would lay  down their life for the republic although, true, they send  others to defend it. And they themselves will get drunk feeling  sorry for the deceased. This is why we cannot count on the  success of the negotiations under these conditions.    The people of the republic must beware of something else.  The  stubbornness of the Dniester region could end up with  unfavorable consequences for the republic. Both Russia and the  CSCE (God help Ukraine to survive by itself) could turn against  it, and then the evil wish of V. Novodvorskaya, who suggested  that Romania seize the Dniester "dowry" lock, stock, and barrel,  might come true. And events might develop.    Anna Zakharovna Volkova uttered some remarkable words:  "Think, people!" I can only add: "Think and act, people! Act  before they reign you in completely...."    [Platitsyn] Might it not turn out that the complete  paralysis  of the economy and hyperinflation in the republic will make any  negotiations in the political area unnecessary?    [Lebed] Now about money. Tajikistan, tormented by war and  interethnic strife, has pawned its mountains and its glaciers in  exchange for the credit of 120 billion Russian rubles of the  1993 model in cash. It was granted because the republic did not  send its mujahidin to protect the White House. There, they  measure before they cut.    Russia has not and will not give anything to the Dniester  region, and there is no longer anything to pawn here. Everything  has long since been secretly mortgaged and remortgaged. The  naive citizens of the republic and the old timers, their heads  filled with ideological cliches, who raised a fuss during the  proceedings on the Ilashu case, think that the republic is being  controlled by the president and the Supreme Soviet. Would that  it were! The real ruler of this region is the Moscow  supermillionaire with the nickname of Zika. I know that the  authorities are now beginning to pretend that this is the first  time they have heard about this. Zagradskiy will be especially  adamant. Fortunately, this is well known in the corresponding  institutions of Russia and Interpol, where the figure of our  banker stands out in a fairly unattractive light.    The rapid collapse of prices has not made itself fully felt  yet. This avalanche is just beginning to slide. By the new year,  when the PMR is left in proud solitude with the "Leninists" whom  nobody needs, everything will inevitably collapse. And no matter  how the authorities may try by arbitrary decisions to control  the "Dniester ruble" with the American dollar, they will not  succeed. There are Napoleons all over the place, although, true,  it is nice to cure them somewhere else.    The miracle will not happen. Merchants will close down and  seek their fortune in other regions. The markets, which even  today look like they have been raided by Mamay, will finally  turn into refuges for the homeless and city dogs and cats, and I  do not think it is even necessary to remind you of what is going  on in the stores. It cannot be ruled out that a "nest egg" has  been stashed for the new year in the warehouses and bases, and  it will be brought out before the holiday so that those in the  darkened limousines can see how the people fight over it in the  waiting lines.    And after the new year "we will pour out the water." True,  the "farm boys" (there is such a category of prisoners) do not  like to take the "ration," it is considered "too low," and  therefore there will be bread, milk will be rationed, there will  be juices, and there will be pickles in jars and nowhere to get  rid of them. And those who today are beating their chests and  putting on a show of excessive fastidiousness for the people  will switch to dollars and Russian rubles. They have them. And  in sufficient quantities.    [Platitsyn] You obviously have in mind the public statement  by the speaker of the Supreme Soviet when Grigoriy Stepanovich  who, without justifying the high price he put on moral damage to  him, began to "count his chickens before they were hatched,"  promising the blind and disabled to more than compensate through  the court for budget outlays stolen by A. Bolshakov and others.    [Lebed] Very nicely put. I read the so-called complaint of  Grigoriy Stepanovich, which was extremely illiterate from the  standpoint of the civil code. G. Marakutsa applied to an  "independent" court as "chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the  Dniester Moldovan Republic" and not as a citizen. Thus, exerting  pressure on the court: "You, Semen Afanasyevich, decide who is  guilty but keep in mind whose side you must defend if you want  to remain in your post!" Typical "telephone law."    I was in Moscow when Grigoriy Stepanovich suddenly started  counting the unexpected receipts of foreign millions. I saw his  theatrical demarche on a videotape and I got the impression that  it was all a cheap trick.    What can come of this? The speaker, clearly twisting the  facts and making unproved accusations, is raising the question  in a very narrow way. He persistently exclaims: "Prove that it  was I!" But let us agree that under the wing of an honest leader  all kinds of crooks and swindlers can operate with impunity. And  who needs a chief of the legislative power who gives his tacit  consent to the creation of "miracles?" The plan is simple--to  divert people's attention.    The court completed its "proceedings" on the Bergman-Gratov  case at the beginning of May, but the court decisions have not  yet been carried out because for seven months Bergman's case has  been sitting in the Supreme Court of the PMR. Bergman has been  stubborn and demands that Shevtsov, Belousov, and others be  called as witnesses in the Stepygin case.    Exactly the same thing will happen with this case. The court  will begin to dig around in this mud, spread it on other  individuals, the case will drag out for months if not years, and  Grigoriy Stepanovich will continue to rule the Supreme Soviet as  if nothing had happened.    And then, frankly, I do not believe him. Grigoriy  Stepanovich  has already made many blunders. Once in an interview for the  newspaper SEGODNYA he named too high a pension for former  military servicemen so that the pensioners almost had a stroke.  Then right on the air in front of all the Dniester region he  nailed V. Gorbov to the cross, informing Dniester region  residents of the out-and-out lie about the son of a "deserter"  from the Shevtsov Guard, who was supposed to have been pursuing  his activities in organs of the Moldovan Ministry of State  Security in Beltsy. Next on AsKET [expansion not given] came  Gorbov's only legal wife, who announced with a tremor in her  voice: "Forgive me, Grigoriy Stepanovich, but I did not give  birth to any sons. God did not send me any!" Let us ask  ourselves this question: Is it possible to believe a person when  it comes to serious matters if he has the habit of lying about  small things? I do not think so.    As for the documents, we shall submit them: We shall mention  the accounts through which money and licenses with the  signatures of some very well-known people passed and we shall  name names. The people say that a friend in need is a friend  indeed. There is a time for everything.    And I will end by reminding the readers of a statement from  Minister A. Saydakov in court. At that time he was acting in the  role of voluntary advocate in the case of D. Kondratovich, who  also wanted to withdraw from AsKET R1.5 million to study the  problems of the "gays." What did Aleksandr Yefimovich say at  that time? That soon the courts would be flooded with complaints  from the powers that be about protection of their "sullied"  honor. And have many complaints been filed up to this point? Not  a single one! Draw your own conclusions....    [Platitsyn] Aleksandr Ivanovich, it seems that Anna Volkova  stated in public that you, having neither documents nor "even  poor copies," had entered, to put it mildly, on the path of back  room intrigue and you are persistently trying to discredit the  authorities in the eyes of the population. Now, judging from  everything, the time has come for you to begin to "play your  trumps." Do you have a lot of them in your hand?    [Lebed] More than enough. In general I am doing work that is  alien to me. But it has already turned out that people are  coming to me and continuously supplementing my collection of  documents about the life of the "Dniester Court." Since the  minister of security is not very intelligent, Shevtsov's  "disinformation" sticks out like a sore thumb and therefore  these "documents" go immediately into the wastebasket. I have  specialists capable of distinguishing authentic from counterfeit.    But honest people who have access to the real documents, all  those who suffocate in an atmosphere of falsehood and  lawlessness, who understand the danger to themselves and those  around them, are coming to me. I cannot give the names of these  people because they would be fired immediately. And the most  obstinate would be "removed from circulation," as Vadim-Vladimir  Shevtsov-Antyufeyev likes to say.    Let us recall that everything that was discussed previously  has been confirmed. We have asserted so many times that  Bolshakov junior is a thief and a crook. It turns out that he is  also scum. We did not want to believe it; on the contrary, the  authorities allowed him to dance a "hopak" and scoff at the  patriotic feelings of the Ukrainians. And where is Aleksandr  Zakharovich now? Why is he not rushing to court to protect his  "honor?"    There are many cases like this. And the longer the  authorities engage in protection of such people the more  resolutely I will rip off their masks and the more painful will  be their fall from the heights of the power Olympus. Theirs and  that of their protectors.    [Platitsyn] Aleksandr Ivanovich, is it true that you just  like to shake things up, after all you have a wall in front of  you? Or do you intend to rock the boat to the end? All you would  have to do would be turn all the cases over to the authorities  and you could have a good life.    [Lebed] "A wall, but a rotten one"--Lenin said. That is the  first thing. Second, everything you are hinting at has already  been suggested to me many times. A Volvo, and money, and a bank  account, and other nice things. In payment for my silence. But I  could not do that. Because that would be tantamount to  putting an end to my biography with my own hand. I  want to continue to stand up for the righteous cause of the  people. And this does not produce any dividends, but morally you  feel wonderful. Unlike certain others...I do not want to drown  my conscience in endless drunkenness. And I still cannot "turn  over" the cases. Not yet, they would simply burn them and  pretend to be the "fire hoses." I already have experience....    [Platitsyn] All right, one might say that A. Bolshakov has  already been crucified. Who is next?    [Lebed] Whoever shouts the loudest: "Stop,  thief!"--and is thrilled by the feeling of having others'  millions in his pocket.    [Platitsyn] Aleksandr Ivanovich, tell me honestly, why did  you agree this summer to run as a candidate in the pre-elections  for Parliament? One gets the impression that by this action you  wanted to test your popularity among the people and be convinced  that the people believe in you as they did before and will  render you all kinds of assistance in the event that there are  radical changes in the republic. And now we have the elections.  In spite of the fact that Professor Yakovlev grabbed on to your  "shirttails" and threw himself at your feet to keep you out of  his private domain, you won a convincing victory. A month later,  having run through your scenario, you slammed the door and  resigned as deputy. The voters were in shock, and now the  Parliament has a hold of "shirttails" and does not want to let  go. What next?    [Lebed] Nothing. The decree on "nonacceptance of Lebed's  resignation" is a game being played with the public. Many people  in the Parliament made the sign of the cross and breathed a sigh  of relief as soon as the door slammed behind me. It was easier  for them without somebody disturbing their somnolent  complacency. You can say as much as you want to about the  subject of "the influence of moonlight on the swinging of a pine  cone" or make predictions about when the Moldovan lei will go  bad. And you can do this today when thousands of workers of the  best enterprise in the city--I have in mind Odema--are going on  Christmas holidays for a month because of a lack of raw  material. And the Parliament can find nothing more important to  do than discuss the concept of the republic's socioeconomic  development. They promise to prepare such a concept by the end  of February. And so one wants to shout: Dear friends, and by the  end of February everybody in this republic will die waiting this  concept. Let us think and guess what they will feed the people  tomorrow. And then for now we will somehow scrape by without the  concept....    The people are your witnesses, I did not participate in the  election campaign and I did not nominate myself. I did get in  the way of either A. Safonov or A. Radchenko. True, Mayor  Radchenko was bursting to ask me "personally" a certain five  questions, but after he became a monopolist of the "Dnieper  Mouthpiece" I lost any desire to meet with this person. I could  ask him only one question, but I am afraid he would not be able  to answer it. He does not have the intellect.    Why did I "slam" the door? I do not want to be a part of  this  power, it will inevitably come to an ignominious end. I am a  patient person and I will wait until all of them, receding, have  their back to the wall, and in front of them are the facts. Then  I and others will have an opportunity to admire their kind faces  with the appearance of a set of pensive dumbbells....    [Platitsyn] One painful question, Aleksandr Ivanovich. It is  known that in December everyone who has anything to do with the  Russian army will receive their maintenance pay in new Russian  rubles. And we are speaking about billions. Will it not turn out  that against the background of the general poverty your officers  will get fat and make those around them envious of their  well-being?    [Lebed] I did not create this problem. Immediately after the  Moscow events, as early as the beginning of October, I suggested  a way out of the delicate situation in which the Dniester region  had found itself by the will of "citizens of the world" Shevtsov  and Matveyev. In an interview in the newspaper IZVESTIYA  President I. Smirnov, like a drunk rabbit, flaunted it: "We are  living without Russia, not as well, but we are living...." How  much worse we are living will be shown in the next few days.    In the 14th Army there are many contractors from Russia;  they  have come to serve, and for this they receive not "Kerenskiy"  money but normal money. And recently there has been increased  dissatisfaction among officers and noncommissioned officers who  actually receive several times less than their counterparts in  Russia. What kind of order do you give in such a situation?    They can use Russian money in the commissaries and,  incidentally, at Russian prices. The merchants will probably  surround the military compounds with commercial stores, healthy  market competition will appear, some things will find their way  to the bazaars, and the merchants will have gasoline, cognac,  and other niceties of life. Many will enter on the path of  usury, but that is a matter of their conscience. No prohibitions  will help here. All able-bodied people of Ukraine are living out  of suitcases today: They take pork fat--to Moscow and the border  oblasts of Russia, they get rubles--in exchange for coupons,  more pork fat--more rubles.    It makes me bitter to think that many people of the Dniester  region will suffer in this situation, but I am powerless to help  everyone.    Since 25 July, when Russia exchanged the old rubles, there  has been plenty of time to think and we should not waste time on  empty debates about Yakovlev's theories. In my view they should  have postponed all those festive trips to America and Austria  and they should have been working on this day and night and not  on the development of a concept or a text for the hymn of the  PMR, which by the time it is approved could turn out to be a  funeral dirge for the republic.    [Platitsyn] You speak about an outbreak of usurious  activity.  But as far as I know the authorities are prepared to take  resolute measures against private black marketeers.    [Lebed] Who believes that? For years they have been unable  to  drive out the gypsies on one small section who established a  monopoly on trade in alcohol and tobacco in the city. And you  talk about resolute measures. Maybe Zagryadskiy or someone will  fight against the black marketeers during times when they are  sober? This is a kind of snow job without any snow...    [Platitsyn] You have gloomy predictions. Will they come  true?    [Lebed] Definitely. Everything in life develops according  the  clearcut laws. We all have the same god. He has mercy on the  intelligent and just, and he punishes fools and sinners. Moldova  has introduced the leu. For better or worse you can get 30 cents  for it. People are gloating over this here, they are figuring  out when the end will come for the lei, and in terms of  inflation it is compared with its Romanian brother. Behind the  primitive political shooting matches they completely forget  about the hundreds of thousands of people who have relatives on  the Right Bank who go to Kishinev on business, and there are  plenty of occasions. For now it is not that the people have  nothing with which to pay a police fine, they do not even have  anything with which to buy a piece of bread. So a leu that goes  through a private party and commercial structures without  Zagryadskiy's knowledge will sooner or later end up in the  Dniester region and crowd out the "monopoly money." Instead of  thinking about solving the problem we are allowing Kondratovich  to arrange public investigations: Which politicians are "fools  with unwashed necks" and which have clean necks. It is nothing  but a big mess....    [Platitsyn] But still the authorities could find a way out  of  the situation. Not all of the plans are presented for widespread  discussion by the masses.    [Lebed] They will, by firing into the next ambulance or  microbus filled with workers....    [Platitsyn] Oh, ho, Aleksandr Ivanovich, you are not saying  that these barbaric attacks are the work of Shevtsov? That these  were deliberate bloody provocations to stir up hatred for the  enemy?    [Lebed] For now I do not want to say that. I know only that  on the days when they were carried out soldiers from both sides  had abandoned their positions and were fraternizing and  exchanging triple kisses for Easter. And the politicians did not  like this. It is not important to me which bank the organizers  of these monstrous crimes were sitting on. Both of them, greedy  for high power and unable to find other ways of satisfying their  political ambitions besides rivers of blood of their faithful  servants, I would tie together with one rope and drop into the  Dniester. I am sure that not very many flowers would be thrown  after them....    [Platitsyn] But are you not afraid of evoking the anger of  G.  Andreyeva? In June she stated: "Let them make just one move and  we will again take up our weapons and fight against Lebed."    [Lebed] Let us not get sidetracked by the schizophrenic  outbursts of that woman whom nobody can put in her place. This  shows once again the face of the power such advisers wield.    [Platitsyn] Incidentally, on 27 November, in an article  entitled "Has No One Been Forgotten?" published in  DNESTROVOSKAYA PRAVDA, N. Vorobyev, who through his reporting is  constantly spreading a pathological hatred for you and the 14th  Army, reported how Lebed's "soldiers" in bulletproof vests  degraded the dignity of valiant fighters from Kostenko's  battalion, demanding that they give up one at a time and come  out of the school without their weapons....    [Lebed] I have already said that it was stupid to sign off  on  the measure. In order to dot all the i's, let us return to the  document. I have before me order No. 53 of 12 July 1992. I quote  verbatim: "Recently there have been more frequent cases of  arbitrary abandonment of combat positions (desertion) by  individual military servicemen and even entire units. Thus on  the night of 22 June Lieutenant Colonel Kostenko unilaterally  led his subdivisions away from their positions into the city of  Bendery and made other units to do the same thing, which was a  treasonous violation of the order on retaining the units at the  line they had reached. There had also been similar treasonous  actions previously. At the present time units of the Second  Motorized Infantry Battalion RG [expansion not given] under the  leadership of Lieutenant Colonel Kostenko did not carry out the  order to liberate the city and are engaged in looting and even  murdering peaceful residents." With this same order the  battalion commander replaced Kostenko with Lieutenant Colonel  A.G. Askerov. Who signed this order? The chief of the  administration of defense of the PMR and the current inspector  general of the Dniester troops, General S. Kitsak. The order was  signed and I was instructed to remove Kostenko. These are the  kinds of valiant "protectors" whom Madame Vorobyev is now trying  to make look good. And I could give a couple more examples of  "valor and heroism" so that people will know how everything  really was. And where did the dozens missing in action go? Time  will also provide an answer to this....    [Platitsyn] From my discussion with you I get the impression  that the PMR today...    [Lebed] ...The rule of arbitrariness and lawlessness. I know  for certain that this republic, created against a background of  the noble idea of fighting nationalism, has gradually been  transformed into an instrument for uncontrolled rule of people  and mockery of moral sense in the name of satisfying the greedy  whims of a pathetic band. The authorities are answerable to  absolutely no one in this drive, which is protected by Russian  peacekeepers on the one side and Ukrainian border guards on the  other. Alas we have not yet learned to answer to our own  conscience....    [Platitsyn] Aleksandr Ivanovich, everything is in somber  tones, there is no light. Where can poor Ivan go?    [Lebed] Anna Zakhrovna Volkova has uttered some remarkable  words: "Think, people!" I can only add: "Think and act, people!  Act before they have bridled you completely and turned you into  speechless cattle! Respect your own humanity! Get rid of the  crooks who are capitalizing like parasites on the results of  your labor! Act, people! Act before it is too late."    And there is no need to suggest how our people should act.  Our people are not stupid.</p>

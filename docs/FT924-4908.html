			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Vantage Spring MR DICK SPRING, and the Irish Labour party which he leads, surprised even themselves in the general election last week. The party more than doubled its share of the popular vote and its share of the seats in the Dail. Even though Labour remains very much the third party, and Ireland will continue to have to be governed by a coalition, Mr Spring has pulled off a remarkable achievement. He is entitled to say that he represents the only party that is on the way up. Labour's strong showing is one of a series of events that suggests that the old mould of Irish politics is being cracked, if not broken. Two years ago the country elected a woman and a non-traditionalist as president. Seen from abroad, the two leading parties, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, have never looked as different from each other as they pretend at home. There was an attempt at breaking the mould when the Progressive Democrats (PD) left the mainstream to set up on their own, but the new party never quite took off: it became an adjunct to the existing system. Last week's general election need never have come about, had it not been for quarrels between politicians of the old school, which includes some of the PDs. Nevertheless, in spite of the political shortcomings, Ireland continues to adapt. Anglo-Irish relations have improved immeasurably, despite - and perhaps partly because of - the problems in the north. Membership of the European Community has increased Ireland's self-confidence no end. The country still has formidable economic difficulties, many of which stem from its peripheral geographical position. There is the more immediate question of whether the punt can maintain its position in the exchange rate mechanism without realignment. The election results suggest that Ireland would welcome a new voice in its politics. That wish should now be reflected in the negotiations on a new coalition. Fianna Fail needs a rest. Fine Gael is still the second party, but has missed its opportunity. Mr Spring should seek to head a coalition of Labour, Fine Gael and PDs.</p>

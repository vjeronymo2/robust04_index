			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Sex complaint forces resignations Three male foreign-exchange dealers have resigned from the London branch of Goldman Sachs, the blue-chip US investment bank, following complaints of sexual harassment by a female colleague. Sources at the bank said the dealers were asked to leave after their secretary complained to a superior that they had made distasteful suggestions when she had asked their advice on how to go about getting a promotion. A spokesman for the bank declined to comment on the circumstances of the men's departure but said the bank had a strict policy on conduct which it expected its employees to follow. Individuals who were repeatedly seen to breach this code would be asked to do 'the appropriate thing', he said. The high proportion of men on trading floors has tended to expose women, especially support staff, to sexual discrimination and harassment in the past. However, Goldman's action reflects a growing intolerance among senior management towards this kind of behaviour. In line with US working practices, many banks in the City regularly remind staff that sexual harassment will not be tolerated. Some firms even go so far as to give examples of what constitutes sexual harassment, such as remarks like 'Oh honey, you look nice today'. Some have also set up telephone hotlines so that employees can anonymously register their complaints, which will then be investigated. In spite of this progress, women working in the City say the 'glass ceiling' impeding their promotion still exists.</p>

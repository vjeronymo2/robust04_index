			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Massacre Seeds in Israel"] </F>   [Text] The massacre that was heinously perpetrated against  Palestinians praying peacefully in Hebron's Haram al-Ibrahimi  yesterday is on the scale of the Feb.6 Sarajevo bombing that led  NATO and the U.N. to move finally to curb the criminal  activities of the Bosnian Serbs. As such, mere condemnation of  the ugly crime will not do. The international community has to  show resolve and vision in this part of the world too. But  first it has to agree on the folly of keeping Jewish settlers in  the midst of the Arab communities in the occupied territories.  By placing Jewish zealots literally on the back of the  Palestinians, the Israeli governments, past and present, have  become accomplices in the latest manifestation of hatred against  Arabs.    There is every possibility that the massacre will draw  violent reactions by the Palestinians, which would add to the  cycle of violence, undermining in the process the entire peace  effort. While a halt to Arab-Israeli negotiations should not be  brought about by any violent act, regardless of how outrageous  and wherever it comes from, the Israeli government nevertheless  is duty-bound to take a number of immediate measures to help  heal the deep wounds that yesterday's ugly massacre has  inflicted on Arab and Muslim hearts and other human beings  everywhere. The Israeli authorities should not content  themselves with a thorough investigation of how the alleged  killer got into the mosque and was able "single-handedly" to  murder so many people at once. Israeli also has to release  details of the truth of what happened and to reveal the full  extent of any plot that may have well been hatched by more than  the "lone" man in "mental crisis" who fired the shots.    But beyond that, the Labour-led government of Yitzhaq Rabin  has to outlaw extremist groups among the settlers and has to  begin today the process of disarming them in a prelude to taking  all neo-colonialists inside the "green line." Those settlers  who want to leave the occupied territories have to be encouraged  to do so. Prime Minister Rabin cannot procrastinate on this for  tactical or any other reasons; and certainly those fanatic Jews  who live with their arms and destructive ideology in Arab cities  and towns, like Hebron, have to be evicted right away.    There will be many questions on how the "lone" settler got  into the mosque fully armed, started and continued shooting for  several long minutes, without the Israeli army coming to the  rescue of the helpless victims. There will be other questions  on how the Israeli authorities provided or failed to provide  timely medical assistance to the wounded, why they rejected all  pleas for lifting the curfew against Hebron and troops went on  to kill 10 more Palestinians on the streets of the occupied  territories shortly after the massacre.    The settlers cannot be allowed to go on the rampage in Arab  towns and villages, erect barricades and block roads, humiliate  young and elderly Arabs under the eyes and nose of the Israeli  Army. If this situation continues to prevail, the cycle of  violence will continue and can ultimately derail the whole peace  process, unless of course the Rabin government acts firmly and  fast to save the historic reconciliation that was started in  Washington on Sept. 13.    The seeds of yesterday's massacre were planted long ago when  the Israelis brought in the settlers, the majority of whom are  fanatics and religious zealots, armed them and in many cases  unleashed them against the people of the West Bank and Gaza.  The laxity and the carrot-only policy which the Israeli  security forces have been pursuing with the settlers was bound  to result in the kind of lawlessness and extremist acts that we  witnessed yesterday.    Everything now depends on the way the Israeli government  handles the aftermath of the gross and terrorist act at Haram  al-Ibrahimi. The international community can help heal the  wounds, but only if it brings pressure to bear on the Israelis  to do what is right.</p>

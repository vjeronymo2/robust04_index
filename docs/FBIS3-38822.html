			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by </F> correspondent Quentin Dickinson in Brussels on 7 February --  recorded]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Alain Juppe was not entirely  satisfied with the outcome of the talks. He spoke to our  reporter, Quentin Dickinson:    [Juppe] I would have liked the word ultimatum to figure in  the communique, but so as not to be negative I would say that it  is implied. It will be up to us in the North Atlantic Council  to ensure that this resolution does not get bogged down and fade  away.    [Dickinson] Do you believe Dr. Karadzic's statements to be  purely tactical?    [Juppe] Well, we are used to so many statements, to so many  meaningless cease-fires, that we cannot be satisfied with good  intentions. It is true that Mr. Karadzic, probably realizing  that the limits of horror were overstepped, is now speaking of  demilitarizing Sarajevo. Well I tell him: You are on, do it.  The best proof of his intentions would be to withdraw the heavy  artillery around Sarajevo which is capable of shelling the city.  If these artillery pieces are pulled back about 25 or 30 km,  then what happened on Saturday in the Sarajevo market will no  longer be possible. This would be far better proof of good  intentions than a signature at the bottom of a document. So  many signatures have proved worthless.</p>

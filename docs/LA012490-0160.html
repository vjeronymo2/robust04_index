			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> JACKSON'S CHIMP LIVES  </P> <P> There's no truth to the rumors that Michael Jackson's chimpanzee Bubbles has  died, Jackson's publicist announced, and "when Bubbles heard about his demise  he went bananas."  </P> <P> "Like Mark Twain, his death is grossly exaggerated and he's alive and doing  well," publicist Lee Solters said Tuesday.  </P> <P> A fire in Jackson's Santa Barbara menagerie last month destroyed a giraffe  barn, but the animals were evacuated safely. Jackson's private zoo includes  ostriches, llamas and boa constrictors.  </P></p>

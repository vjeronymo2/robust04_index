			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / A clash of values on the Ark Royal: Nicholas Woodsworth joins the aircraft carrier in the Adriatic and finds a subtle, non-violent conflict taking place on board My grandfather, an Englishman from the lower edge of the middle class, spent most of his life trying to escape insecurity and the limitations of his background. He had a good deal of imagination but little business acumen and the results, almost without exception, were spectacularly unsuccessful. But at the end of his life there was one part of his professional career that he looked back to with great pride and satisfaction. It had nothing to do with escapist ventures in far-flung places. On the contrary, it lay close to the heart of the British social and institutional traditions he was trying to run away from. With the threat of hostilities in the late 1930s, my grandfather became a naval reserve officer and served at sea with the Royal Navy throughout the war. I was not impressed when, on holiday visits between bouts of boarding school, my grandfather extolled the merits of the Royal Navy. He spoke of an ideal of duty, of the value of common endeavour, of comradeship, of jobs well done; I could only see regimentation, blind obedience, and a hierarchically tribal organisation. It all sounded too much like the strict and old-fashioned school I had so happily come away from. Since that time I had thought little of my grandfather's views on life afloat until, not long ago, I found myself aboard the Ark Royal, cruising the Adriatic. I had initially been interested in the Bosnian conflict itself, and Britain's contribution to the UN-sponsored 'deny-flight' programme in Bosnian air space. Much of it is executed from the flight deck of the aircraft carrier Ark Royal, the largest and perhaps best-known ship in the Royal Navy. But the more I clambered about the Ark's decks and stairways and looked in on life in her messes, the more I became aware of the existence of another sort of conflict. It is subtler and non-violent but, for all that, crucial to the future of the Royal Navy. It is the struggle between new principles of business and the old principles of duty my grandfather so respected. The Ark Royal is like a small town. There is a bakery and a post office, a laundry and a hospital, a police station and a cobbler's. Here, in addition to a vast range of specialised professional activities, one finds most of the normal goings-on of daily life. I had spent periods at sea before on non-military boats, and knew the feeling that makes each ship a little world unto itself. What astonished me on the Ark Royal, and what would be found wholly inconceivable in civilian life, is that all this activity, all these wills, are directed towards one final end. From the swabbing of its immaculately kept decks to the operation of ultra-sophisticated sonar equipment, life aboard the Ark Royal is above all an endeavour of co-ordination. Millions of pounds worth of technology not withstanding, the Ark Royal is a precision machine of 1,200 human parts. The final objective on an aircraft carrier, of course, is the execution of successful air missions, and I spent time on the grey-painted 'island' overlooking the Ark Royal's flight deck. From here I could watch the take off and recovery of aircraft - up to 80 movements a day on a runway just 600 feet long - of the ship's Sea King helicopter and Sea Harrier combat jet squadrons. To my eye there was something insect-like about it all - the way the helicopters came hovering in beside the Ark Royal, then, sideslipping, settled like dragon flies on a floating stick; the way, after landing, these same aircraft folded their propellers back like so many delicate pairs of wings; the angry buzzing of a Sea Harrier as it shot off the deck, circled once or twice, then disappeared into the sky; the helmets and visors, globular and reflective like the eyes of a fly, worn by combat pilots as they climbed into their craft. But insects operate from instinct. What this vision did not include was the human factor - the training, the hours of repetition and practice that everyone aboard goes through to achieve the degree of professionalism required. And flight operations are only the end product. Below, on nine windowless decks sandwiched between the flight deck and the ship's keel, are the hundreds of men, and now women - there are 110 Wrens aboard - who, with the same professionalism in their own particular field make the whole thing work. Pilots, marine engineers, aircraft mechanics, caterers, weapons systems operators, stokers, communications specialists - I found the workings of community aboard the Ark Royal extraordinary to behold. All are so dependent on each other, all have lives with demands so much more stringent than those in our own civilian lives of negotiation and compromise that I began to understand, for the first time, the sense of comradeship and service that is the essential ingredient of a happy ship. Everyone I talked to aboard subscribed, in his or her own way, to these old ethics. Even the young. When on the flight deck I asked 27-year-old Lt Ivan Hamilton what it felt like to fly a helicopter, his eyes lit up with the sheer joy and excitement of it; but he also stressed the need among pilots, the most individual of Navy men, for a 'pack-animal mentality'. Caroline Redwood, an aircraft mechanic barely in her 20s, told me she could never go back to civilian secretarial work - there were few satisfactions. In the pubby, clubby atmosphere of the wardroom, where officers in the coloured cummerbunds of their squadrons had gathered for drinks before dinner, Lt Commander Jerry Betteridge put it more succinctly. 'We feel a sense of belonging to a special society,' he told me. 'Things have changed: officers and ratings are better educated, more specialised now, and the sense of mindless obedience has disappeared. But we hold on to our old Navy traditions and ideals. If we let them go, we would lose the concept on which we base all our behaviour and efficiency - our pride of service.' The world is changing so much that such ideals risk obliteration none the less. The cold war of my youth and my grandfather's old age is over. In strategic terms the collapse of Communism has wholly altered the Royal Navy's situation. It now finds itself in a state similar to that following the defeat of Napoleon in 1815: its longtime adversary gone and its traditional role vanished, it is casting about for alternative roles. After 1815 some of the Navy's resources were directed, as they are today in Bosnia, to a humanitarian cause - the eradication of the slave trade. Most, however, went to maintaining the Navy as the keeper of a worldwide and highly profitable Pax Britannica. But with British power eroded abroad and an economy ailing at home, the Royal Navy has no such role to play today. With demands from other ministries, the 'peace dividend' has only further justified continuing cuts in defence budgets. Following the Falkland Islands conflict the Royal Navy had 60 destroyers and frigates and 70,000 staff; today there are 40 such vessels and 55,000 staff. Despite government promises on redundancy levels, shock waves roll through the Royal Navy with each new leak from the Ministry of Defence - the current defence cost study, due out shortly, is expected to result in a further 8,000 Navy redundancies and many other cuts. Recent policy has also gone a long way in changing the manner in which the Navy is run. New management techniques, new systems of accountability, open tendering, private contracting, the elimination of excess capacity - these and other initiatives designed for cost-effectiveness make the Royal Navy look as much an organisation stripped down for competitive business as for combat. Officers on the Ark pride themselves that the sea-borne air power they provide off the coast of the former Yugoslavia is the most effective expression of British government policy possible: from neutral waters they assure a military offensive presence, demonstrate a political will, and give a promise of protection to British ground troops, all at a minimum cost and minimum level of engagement. And they are right - what neater tool of British policy could there be? At the same time, however, officers and staff feel they are not getting much in return. The new ethos of rational business management, they say, not only risks turning the Royal Navy into an ineffective force; it also threatens to remove the public service ethic which lies at the very heart of the Navy. This is a sentiment that runs from the bottom of the ship to the top, from stokers I talked to deep in the ship's innards to officers taking tea and rock buns in the wardroom. Certainly the captain, Terry Loughran, in an immaculate white uniform on the Ark Royal's bridge, has fears for the Royal Navy's future. 'Enormous strains are being put on us by new management techniques,' he told me. 'We expect a man to be prepared to lay down his life for us, yet we turn round without the slightest hesitation and make him redundant. We take great pride in service. It would be frustrating to produce a shoddy, second-rate job, but stress and great uncertainty is very much there and can lead to just that.' All this could be avoided, he said, if instead of managing the navy like an unprofitable business, it were seen for what he believes it to be - an investment with huge but unquantifiable returns. 'You cannot apply business principles to an organisation whose earnings are invisible. Our product is intangible. Cost-cutting has got to the stage where we have lost sight even of business principles. In a real business we would have a 10-year plan. The MoD has a 10-year plan and rips it up every year and starts again. We are now at the cut-off point where inefficiencies outweigh the benefits of cost-saving.' Greater influence in world affairs, research and development that brings Britain export earnings, the protection of economic resources at sea, job provision, the power to deal effectively with the crises that are becoming a regular part of life in the post-communist world - all these, Captain Loughran told me, are the invisible earnings of an efficient Royal Navy. I am no more pro-military than I was as a schoolboy. But if the Royal Navy has a future in invisible earnings it also has one in peace-keeping. My ramblings about the Ark Royal brought me two things: a realisation that a navy is only as good as the politicians who control it, and a reconciliation with my grandfather. What would he think, I wonder, of today's Royal Navy? As someone with both old navy values and a vast experience in business failure, I imagine he would be alarmed.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Snack Factory takes ruthless line with deviants ONLY 40 miles from Bensons Crisps lies one of its main competitors, which is already exploiting state-of-the art production techniques. The Snack Factory, part of the privately-held Anan Hayle Saeed Group, claims to be the most efficient snack producer in Europe, writes Catherine Milton. 'The management team had all worked in crisps and snacks before, and we strongly believed we could do things more efficiently, given facilities designed with modern technology rather than bolting new machines on to old,' said Mr Geoff Marsden, Snack Factory's managing director. Based in Skelmersdale, Lancashire, the factory flanks the M58 motorway. It cost Pounds 21m and started operating in 1990. It is generating pre-tax profits of about Pounds 2m on annual turnover of Pounds 28m, all from sales to supermarkets. In 11 minutes it can turn muddy potatoes into crisps with computers enforcing tight specifications at every step. Not every crisp makes it through the computer checks and tests. The raw materials themselves may be rejected if tests show that more than 2.5 per cent of a load is mud rather than vegetable. Once in the factory the potatoes are automatically washed in recycled water, cut, and passed through a 'Sizer Halver' to standardise crisp dimensions. Starch is recovered from effluent and sold on to other users. The larger of two cookers can handle 2,500kg of potatoes an hour, responding to temperature and load requirements which change between customer preference and season. A US-made computer-controlled high speed video optical sorter scrutinises every crisp, 'recognises' deviants and then 'orders' them blown off the production line. Moisture and oil content are continually monitored by scanners to prevent soggy-crisp syndrome. Even flavour is checked automatically by a machine which gives instant salt readings to indicate flavour levels. The crisps are conveyed around the factory on a specially gentle vibrating auto-feed system to prevent fractures. Surviving crisps are fed into Japanese-made Ishida weighing machines, which drop the proper weight of crisps into tubes of plastic packaging. These are then sealed and severed to form the packets of crisps. Mr Marsden said: 'Starting from scratch you have the opportunity to develop your own culture because you are not bringing working practices from other organisations.'</p>

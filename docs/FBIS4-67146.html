			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Money `Laundering' in Bolivia"] </F>   [Text] Whether we like it or not, the laundering of  dollars, national currency, or any foreign currency is not a  crime in Bolivia. To be a crime it would have to be  specifically described as "antijuridical conduct" either in the  Penal Code or in a law such as the frightful and now repudiated  Law 1008. Oddly enough, neither those in the U.S. Embassy nor  their Bolivian counterparts who implement draconian measures  included such conduct in that law, and therefore it is not  characterized as a crime.    Perhaps the reason for this is the fact that the  "laundering," which is also called "whitewashing," is impossible  to keep under control in a financial and monetary system like  ours, where there are no restrictions for converting our  currency, or where no question is asked about who makes deposits  or withdrawals in bank accounts for any type of currency. The  other ways of finding out (through legal means, and not through  intimidation, blackmail, or physical or psychological torture)  if a transaction is voluntarily linked to a crime are also  impossible. For example, how can you incriminate the apostolic  vicariate in a Santa Cruz Province that 10 years ago sold a  cattle ranch in its ownership to an individual who is now being  accused of drug trafficking?    There are many examples, and the introduction of controls to  prevent the undesirable laundering can do nothing more than  obstruct the normal flow of financial operations. What Law 1008  in reality establishes is the investigation of wealth, and in  this way trace whether an individual accumulated wealth through  illegal activities such as drug trafficking. This should be  extended to other individuals to find out whether there were  cases of embezzlement or corruption in the public administration.</p>

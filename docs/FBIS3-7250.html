A comparison of the above photograph taken in 1986, with one  taken in 1990--see page 15--shows that a large amount of  construction work has taken place at a "radiological laboratory"  at Yongbyon, which US sources say hides a clandestine factory  for the plutonium needed to make nuclear bombs.    The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)--which has so  far refused to use commercial satellite pictures to verify  whether countries are obeying safeguards under the nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty--has triggered an international crisis  with North Korea by accepting US spy images as evidence that the  country has an illegal nuclear programme.    North Korea has stopped co-operating with the IAEA and said  yesterday it would regard the imposition of sanctions over the  nuclear programme as a "declaration of war".    "People have almost no idea what civil satellites can do,"  said Dr Bhupendra Jasani, the researcher who analysed the  satellite images. "They are now 20 times better than even a few  years ago and can show an object half a metre across." Military  spy satellites used by the US and Russia can show objects as  small as 20cm.    Previously unpublished satellite photographs of a secret  nuclear reprocessing facility in North Korea, where  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors were  recently blocked as they attempted to take radioactive samples,  have provided evidence that the country has an active nuclear  bomb programme.    The commercially available photographs which contrast work  on  the site in 1986 and 1990 (see photograph, right  [black-and-white reproduction of 1990 photo]), have been  obtained by the Independent. They have been enhanced by  computer and analysed by the Department of War Studies at King's  College, London, and show that a facility near Yongbyon could  not possibly be the experimental nuclear reactor dating from  1965 and a new reactor under construction, as the North Koreans  claim.    The evidence of these photographs coupled with powerful US  satellite pictures of the site, which remain secret, and IAEA  analysis appears to confirm that the country can produce the  bomb. "It is probable that North Korea has enough plutonium to  manufacture a bomb," said Patricia Lewis of Vertic, the  London-based arms control treaty verification organisation.  "The issue now is whether they have the know-how to miniaturise  a bomb that could be delivered by rocket and threaten Japan as  well as South Korea."    Senior diplomatic sources at the United Nations Security  Council in New York fear that the crisis with the North Korean  regime could quickly get out of control.    "With more than one million men under arms and 10,000  artillery pieces and rocket launchers almost within striking  distance of Seoul we do not want to provoke a psychopathic  response," one official said yesterday as the Council met to  hear a report from the Director of the IAEA, Hans Blix.    Comparison of enhanced images dating from 1986 (shown on the  front page) with another photograph taken in 1990, provides  prima facie evidence that North Korea is engaged in a full-scale  nuclear bomb programme in violation of the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty, nuclear arms experts say.    The IAEA inpspectors also found circumstantial evidence that  North Korea is engaged in a clandestine nuclear bomb programme  on their recent visit. "They saw evidence of continuing  construction work at the so-called radiological laboratory but  they could not verify whether or not they were making  plutonium," said IAEA spokesman David Kydd.    US spy satellite photographs shown in secrecy to the IAEA  prompted the recent inspection of the site. North Korea's  reaction to the inspection now threatens to become an  international crisis, with the UN Security Council preparing to  slap sanctlons on Korea if it does not co-operate.    Those images show that a "radiological laboratory" at the  same site is in fact a single-storey building constructed up top  of a plutonium reprocessing facility buried deep underground,  according to nuclear weapons experts.    North Korea has angrily rejected US evidence on the grounds  that it was provided by "the enemy".    More evidence was found from analysing nuclear fuel  processed  at other North Korean sites that far more enriched uranium has  been processed into potential bomb-making material than the  authorities admit to.    By computer enhancement of satellite photographs, Dr  Bhupendra Jasani, a senior research fellow at King's College,  has been able to show that there are no electricity transmission  lines coming in or out of the site of a reactor due to come on  line next year.    There are no anti-aircraft, gun or missile sites around  Yongbyon, but by enlarging the photographs Dr Jasani has  identified three military airfields as well as a large  ammunition storage site around the facility.</p>

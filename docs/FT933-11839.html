			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Pearson to spin off oil, china interests PEARSON, the conglomerate which owns the Financial Times, is to make two of its divisions into independent public companies as part of its plan to concentrate on the media and entertainment. Royal Doulton, the group's fine china division, is to be demerged from Pearson, probably before the end of this year. The shares, which will be listed on the London Stock Exchange, will be given to Pearson shareholders. Pearson will also sell a majority stake in Camco, its US oilfield equipment and services division, through a public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. Pearson said yesterday it would keep a minority stake in Camco 'for a limited period'. The sale is expected in the first half of next year. Last year the two businesses accounted for 30 per cent of Pearson's Pounds 1.6bn sales and about 7 per cent of the group's operating profit of Pounds 156m. Pearson has said for some time that new investments would be in the fields of information, education and entertainment. Lord Blakenham, Pearson's chairman and chief executive, said: 'We believe that concentrating most of our resources now on appropriate sectors in the media industry will benefit shareholders.' Pearson said it was holding on to Lazard Partners, its merchant banking interest, because it was profitable and absorbed neither capital nor management time. The initial reaction to the Pearson move was positive and the company's share price rose by more than 40p before closing up 27p on the day at 467p. Mr Derek Terrington, media analyst at stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson, yesterday welcomed the strategy in principle but said he thought Pearson's shares were still overvalued and that more profit-taking was likely. The announcement came a day after it became clear that Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation had beaten Pearson to control of Star TV, the Asian satellite venture which broadcasts to 38 Asian countries. Yesterday Mr Murdoch took the opportunity of the higher share price to sell 16.48m Pearson shares through Goldman Sachs at 464p. The stake represented News Corp's last block of shares in Pearson that are not covered by convertible arrangements. Lord Blakenham said the proceeds from the sale of Camco would go towards investments in the media on an international basis. Mr Frank Barlow, managing director of Pearson, which recently completed a Pounds 99m acquisition of Thames Television, said he would not rule out the purchase of US television stations. Pearson said it planned to maintain its total net dividend at 12p this year. Spotlight on media, Page 19</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, June 2, IRNA -- Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali  Akbar Velayati here Wednesday [1 June] said that the non-aligned  countries have traditionally demanded a time-bound framework,  including a target date for removal and destruction of the  entire stockpile of nuclear weapons.    Velayati, here for the 11th session of the Non-Aligned  Movement (NAM) ministerial meeting, made the remark in his  address to the NAM session on te issue of disarmament.    The issue of security assurances for non-nuclear weapon  states is the second major point, Velayati said.    The non-aligned countries should insist that the  Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) be finalized before the NPT  review conference and that it should be comprehensive,  verifiable, non-discriminatory and devoid of any  exceptionalities. How to deal with the existing nuclear test  sites also remains as an important task, he said.    In this respect, added Velayati, the non-aligned countries  also welcome the decision of the [UN] General Assembly to start  negotiations on a treaty banning the production of fissile  materials for weapon purpose.    On the chemical weapons convention, he said that the  non-aligned members of the Chemical Weapon Convention (CWC) need  to consolidate their efforts to make certain that their views  and positions on issues ranging from definition of chemical  weapons and modalities of challenge inspection to the problem of  technological assistance and peaceful use as well as their fair  share in the organisation are met before ratification and  entering into force of the convention.    As for biological weaapons, Velayati said that what may be  at  stake is the health requirements of the developing countries as  significant parts of the pharmaceutical industry, including  serum and vaccine production, will be affected by discussions  due to take place at the special conference in September this  year.    Touching on the issue of transparency in armament, the  Iranian foreign minister said debate continues on the scope and  expansion of the register.    "It is realized that regional arrangements is an essential  ingredient for a complete register and, therefore, for the  success of transparency in armament. This may also open the way  for the reduction of conventional weapons both at regional and  global levels to the eventual point of ensuring only the minimum  security requirements of each state."</p>

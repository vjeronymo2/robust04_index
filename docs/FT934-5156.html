			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Penalties for excess baggage: The Airbus consortium must restructure and rationalise if it is to compete with US airline manufacturers European dreams of taking on the world in commercial aerospace can fly, as Airbus has shown over the past 23 years. Yesterday, the European consortium celebrated one of its biggest coups against Boeing when it delivered the first of 50 Airbus A320 aircraft to United Airlines, one of its US rival's most prized customers. But for all the pomp and ceremony at the handover, anxiety is growing among Airbus partners that their success in building high-technology airliners may have engendered a corporate dinosaur. Mr Jean Pierson, the outspoken Airbus chief executive, sounded warning bells last month with one of the provocative throwaway phrases he likes to toss off between puffs at a Gitane cigarette. The Airbus system had now reached its 'genetic limits', he said, and without change it was in danger of losing out to its American competition. 'Success is not eternal; unless we work on it we won't be able to meet the new challenges facing our industry,' added a close adviser. Attempts to rationalise the consortium have failed to bring about significant change, largely because of political squabbling and industrial rivalries between the partners and their governments. But faced with the deepest postwar recession in the industry and growing competition from Boeing, the world's biggest aircraft manufacturer, time is running out for Airbus. Like Boeing, Airbus has been hit by the prolonged slump in civil aviation and the financial difficulties of many customers. It has been forced to cut its production rate from 157 aircraft last year to 142 this year. Airbus now expects output to drop to 138 aircraft both next year and in 1995. The consortium does not expect any significant recovery in new aircraft orders until 1995 or 1996. Although it still has a backlog of 701 aircraft, so far this year it has won only 30 new orders and suffered 59 cancellations. By comparison, Boeing has won 225 new orders this year and faced 214 aircraft cancellations. All four Airbus shareholders - Aerospatiale of France (37.9 per cent), Deutsche Aerospace (37.9 per cent), British Aerospace (20 per cent) and Casa of Spain (4.2 per cent) - acknowledge that their business partnership set up two decades ago under the structure of a French Groupement d'Interet Economique (GIE) has now served its purpose. Simply put, the commercial success of Airbus, whose sales reached Dollars 8bn last year, is in danger of being undermined by the group's own corporate structure and complex work-sharing production system based in four countries. 'Airbus has worked well for a long time,' said the head of one of the four partner companies. 'We must not forget that Airbus has now taken 30 per cent of the world market, makes technologically advanced aircraft and has kept the pressure on Boeing.' For Airbus, he added, the risk was that, without change, success could quickly turn into decline, as had happened to McDonnell Douglas. 'McDonnell Douglas was the clear number two after Boeing, but it did not invest sufficiently in building up a competitive product range and improving its production system. With only 10 per cent of the market, it has now been overtaken by Airbus,' he explained. All the partners recognise the challenge for Airbus is to transform what was initially a job and wealth creation consortium to compete against the dominance of the US manufacturers into an independent company, mature enough to rationalise and restructure, take hard political and social decisions, and stand on its own two corporate feet. Under the French collaborative GIE system, the role of Airbus is to co-ordinate the production and design of aircraft and market the product range. It has no obligation to publish annual accounts; and a lack of financial transparency in a system where the shareholders are the main suppliers has made it almost impossible to calculate Airbus costs. The partners and their respective governments diagnosed the trouble four years ago, when they set up a committee to recommend improvements in the Airbus system to make it more responsive to market forces. It led to a streamlining of the management and the appointment of a financial comptroller. But it stopped short of proposing the evolution of Airbus from a GIE into a public limited company. Since that report, Airbus officials concede little significant progress has been made to overhaul the consortium. 'There has been a lot of thought but little action to date,' one admitted. Some improvement has been achieved by focusing all final assembly and internal aircraft fitting to individual customer specifications for new Airbus programmes on one site rather than in two different countries. In the past, Airbus aircraft were assembled in Toulouse, flown to Hamburg for cabin fitting and flown back to Toulouse for delivery to customers. Now all A330 and A340 widebody aircraft are assembled and fitted in Toulouse, while the A321 narrowbody aircraft is completed in Hamburg. A degree of competitive tendering on new aircraft programmes has also been introduced, but it has been restricted to competition between the four partners. For the first time, the consortium has also been able to tap financial markets to secure financing to develop the A321 and A319, new derivatives of the 150-seat A320. These limited adjustments have hardly begun to address the scale of productivity improvements Airbus must make to keep up with Boeing, the partners agree. In the beginning, Boeing was complacent about the competitive threat posed by Airbus. But when the European consortium started making significant inroads in the US market with big orders from old Boeing customers such as Northwest and United, Boeing reacted on several fronts. It pressed the Washington administration to campaign against European government subsidies for Airbus, which led to last year's compromise trade agreement between Europe and the US on direct and indirect subsidies for new civil aircraft programmes. It launched a new 400-seat widebody twin-engine aircraft, the 777, to defend its dominant position at the top end of the market. Most significantly, it launched an aggressive long-term cost reduction and productivity programme with a strong customer focus to remain number one in the business. Boeing's target is to reduce costs by 25-30 per cent and halve its aircraft production cycle times by 1998. It already produces aircraft faster than Airbus. It takes Boeing about 12 months to complete a 737, while Airbus takes 15 months to build an A320, which competes directly against the 737. 'Today we can live with this three-month gap, but we will be at a competitive disadvantage if Boeing achieves its aim to produce a 737 in only six months by 1998,' said a senior Airbus official. Reducing cycle times improves productivity and bears directly on costs. 'The benefits of the modern technology we offer on our aircraft would be eaten up by the cost attraction of a cheaper aircraft,' he added. The partners believe Boeing will now fix industry targets and Airbus will have to keep up. 'This will lead us eventually to change the structure, but simply turning Airbus into a limited company is no substitute for getting your processes right,' said Mr Richard Lapthorne, BAe's financial director. Standing on the Airbus stand at the recent Dubai air show, Mr Pierson rattled off a list of inefficiencies in the system: too much bureaucracy and too long decision times; too much duplication in research and development and in many production tasks; political pressures reflecting different national priorities of some partners and their governments; difficulties in rationalising the overall process because of differing labour and social regulations in the partner countries; the lack of financial flexibility to raise funds in the market and support aircraft sales because decisions have to be adopted unanimously by all four partners. The convoluted system of how independent component manufacturers supply parts to Airbus is a classic example of inefficiency, says Mr Pierson. The UK Lucas Aerospace group supplies about 15 different components for Airbus aircraft. But none go directly to Airbus. Instead, some parts are manufactured at Lucas plants in the UK, sent to the German partner for partial fitting, then back to the UK to BAe at Chester for assembly on the wing sets BAe builds for Airbus, before the completed wings are shipped out to Toulouse for final aircraft assembly. Other Lucas parts are made at the company's French subsidiary but also have to go via Germany before finding their way back to France. 'We would clearly prefer to supply direct to Airbus,' says Mr Frank Turner, Lucas Aerospace's managing director. 'You get a much better price, delivery and service the closer a component manufacturer is to his ultimate customer,' he explains. In the US, by contrast, Boeing now sends a truck once a week to Lucas's Jamestown, North Dakota, facility to pick up aircraft cargo hold components and systems for just-in-time assembly in Seattle. While paying lip service to the need to rationalise Airbus's production process and give the consortium an integrated company structure to control costs and become more responsive to market forces, the partners, for different reasons, are reluctant to take the plunge. 'The questions the partners should now be asking is whether it makes sense to have 10 manufacturing plants scattered around Europe and whether they are European enough to accept that production should be concentrated on the most cost efficient sites and perhaps, for some tasks, outside Europe,' said a senior executive of one of the partner companies. BAe has long campaigned for an Airbus public limited company but, as a French official pointed out, the UK partner has been as reluctant as the others to dig deep into his pocket to address the capital funding problems of setting up an independent company. Aerospatiale has come round to the idea of establishing an independent structure for Airbus, but it is also under pressure from its government not to rock the boat with any restructuring which could provoke the sort of social backlash caused by the recent Air France job cut proposals. However, it is Deutsche Aerospace (DASA) which appears to be the biggest obstacle to any change. German ambitions to become a leader in the European aerospace industry have caused considerable ill feeling in the consortium. Other partners were angered by DASA's efforts to co-operate with Boeing on a very large aircraft project and its takeover this year of the Dutch Fokker regional jet manufacturer to strengthen its claim to lead all Airbus narrowbody programmes. DASA has also been forced to launch a sweeping rationalisation programme under pressure from its parent, Daimler Benz, itself in the throes of deep restructuring. 'At present the Germans are simply refusing any change to the Airbus structure,' said a senior executive in one of the other partner companies. 'And when we eventually all finally agree to change, it is important that no single partner should try to seize this situation to reinforce his position,' he warned. Although the timetable for turning Airbus into a public limited company is more uncertain than ever, the partners believe they can make a start by improving the efficiency of the existing system. For example, they are considering establishing an asset management organisation within Airbus to help finance and place used aircraft in the market. The restructuring and consolidation of other parts of the European commercial aircraft industry could also provide an incentive for broader rationalisation at Airbus. Aerospatiale and BAe have been holding intense talks to try to merge their loss-making turbopropeller businesses into a joint company. If negotiations succeed, it could help Aerospatiale transfer its turboprop activities from Toulouse to concentrate all operations there on Airbus assembly. Ultimately, the test will be whether the partners are prepared to let Airbus fly loose with its own independent identity. In many respects, Airbus's reputation has outstripped that of its partners, although they still regard Airbus as one of their subsidiaries. 'Unless you can actively form a company and genuinely run it for the sake of its businesses and not for the sake of its shareholders, you'll always be second class to a company managed uniformly like Boeing,' said another Airbus insider. But prospects for such radical reform, at this stage, appear slim. The collapse last week of the ambitious Alcazar project by four European airlines (SAS, KLM, Swissair and Austrian Airlines) to merge their operations is a stark reminder of how easy it is for the foundations of European collaboration to crumble like a Tower of Babel.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT: THE BIG FIGHT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Orders, cancellations and deliveries               1988    1989    1990    1991    1992    1993*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Orders       1,058   1,833   1,236     482     458     209 Cancelled        9      36      58     143     138     262 Net intake   1,049   1,797   1,178     339     320     -53 Deliveries     511     506     570     822     789     490 Changes       +538  +1,291    +608    -483    -469    -543  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BACKLOG BY MANUFACTURER  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            Backlog     Per cent     Value (Dollars Bn)    Per cent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Boeing       1,259         54.7      87.5                     56.9 Airbus         701         30.4      50.8                     33.0 MDC            217          9.4      12.8                      8.3 Others         127          4.6       2.9                      1.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total        2,304        100.0     154.0                    100.0  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

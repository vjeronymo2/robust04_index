			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of Danish Banking and Finance (6): Funds for starters  -Venture Capital The speciality of Mr Michael Mathiesen, a young Danish venture capitalist, is making young companies grow, and despite his youth - he is only 34 - he already has several successes to his name, writes Hilary Barnes. In terms of the capital available, Mr Mathiesen's operation is minute, but he thinks that the size of the capital available is less important than the concept of venture capital which he is introducing to Denmark, arguing that many venture capital companies have not been a success because their starting point has been wrong. Mr Mathiesen began his career when, not yet out of business school (which he never completed), he founded a company, Dataco, in 1985 to produce a local area network gadget, which enabled firms to network computers made by different manufacture. In 1990 Dataco was sold for DKr400m, with a sizeable proportion of the proceeds going to Mr Mathiesen. He subsequently set up a venture capital company 2M Invest. Among 2M Invest's other owners are the large, trade-union controlled pension fund, the LD Fund, and the Association of Danish Engineers' Pension Fund. The object of 2M Invest is to provide seed-funding to new companies, but before he set the company up Mr Mathiesen first took a close look at how venture funding works in the US and why it does not work well in much of Europe. The problem with European venture capital companies is very often that they do not know enough about the industries in which they are investing, he says. Second, the venture capital companies often have large sums of money available, but limited management resources. A gap develops between the venture capitalists and the companies they are supposed to be nurturing, with the venture capital managements trying to keep an eye on far too many companies. The fact that the venture capital companies - and it applies with even greater emphasis to pension funds - often have very large sums of money available also means that they do not have time or resources to invest in small companies, so seed-funding of promising new companies becomes a neglected area. With 2M Invest, Mr Mathiesen aims to overcome these problems. The company only invests in companies in the information technology industry 'because that is what we know about.' Moreover, its managers 'all bear the scars of industrial experience, otherwise the companies do not respect us'. The portfolio, currently four companies, will be limited to 10 or 12 companies, so that each manager is supervising the progress of only three or four companies and there is time to do more than just look at the financial data. 'We blame other venture capital companies for not being close enough to the companies, so we must be,' he said. Other criteria for 2M Invest's investment are that the target company must own or partly own its technology; the technology must have a global appeal; and must be on the brink of a rapid growth in sales. 2M Invest expects to take companies from the start-up phase to a turnover of Dollars 30m-40m, at which point they would become the target for acquisitions or go public. The companies in its portfolio now include three Danish and one American. The Danish companies are: Scanview, which manufactures image setters and scanners for the graphics industry. It was founded in 1990. Turnover last year was about DKr100, and budgeted turnover for 1994 is DKr175m. Mr Mathiesen sees Scanview as a candidate for a Nasdaq listing in a year or two. Hypercom is a Danish-British company set up in 1992 to produce and develop software and hardware for multimedia broadcasting, a company which, Mr Mathiesen believes has 'gigantic potential'. Hypercom is providing the software for a new service by which CNN will distribute Reuter financial news, using a teletext application enabling the news to be received on a personal computer. Exatec was founded in 1987 and has a turnover of DKr280m. The company is part trading company in electronic components, part development company with a team of design engineers who develop special components for applications by electronics companies. A turnover of around DKr600m within three years is predicted by Mr Mathiesen. The American company, RadioMail, is a joint venture between its American founder, Mr Geoffrey Goodfellow, Motorola and 2M Invest. RadioMail provides the software for a wireless-based electronic mail system. Using a pocket computer and a two-way wireless device, which come in a zip-up case about the size of an airport paperback, users in America can send and receive messages and documents from anywhere to anywhere at any time. The first RadioMail service base in Europe will be opened soon in the Netherlands. RadioMail won the Mobile Advance of the Year prize at the San Jose, California, Mobile '94 exhibition in March. With only 35 employees to date, RadioMail, says Mr Mathiesen, has an exciting future. Finally, through a second investment company, Eastern Business Investments, Mr Mathiesen last year set up a company in St Petersburg, Russia. It manufactures metal components for export to western Europe, with the sales and marketing function taking place from Copenhagen. The Russian company was opened just a year ago, and the Russian production and Danish marketing concept is working, said Mr Mathiesen. 'The company is beginning to fly,' he says.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Fudge and mudge alive and kicking: Alison Smith watches the party's internal struggle for credibility THE bird that represents the Liberal Democrats has this week in Harrogate been allowed out of its pre-election cage to fly freely around the conference hall. It will be back on its perch before the next election, but made the most of its freedom at this gathering. Had the conference been immediately before an election, the discussion of prostitution would have been stifled; a wider range of speakers would have been paraded in front of the cameras; and the man who urged: 'Let us go forward as trendsetters' would surely have been dissuaded from wearing a cosy, patterned cardigan as he did so. There was a change in Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, too. For him a pre-election conference would have been one long photo-opportunity, and he would not have made the slip of an unduly sharp tone in response to Mr David Alton's impending departure from the party over its policy on abortion. That issue was a classic example of the party grassroots seizing its chance to debate subjects which, however important, are peripheral to mainstream politics. At times this has led to self-parody: discussing cruelty to animals and holding nine separate votes while the UK economy goes through its most turbulent 24 hours in recent years is no way to solve the party's credibility problem. The activists remain unmoved by the evident irritation of some of the party's MPs at such antics. The document prepared by the policy committee and hailed by Mr Ashdown as charting the way forward to the next election manifesto, escaped the ignominy of being sent back to the drawing board by just 13 votes, and may be unrecognisable when it next sees the light of day. The conference also threw out policy proposals to bring franchising of services and stations to British Rail; and heavily qualified the party managers' commitment to the market while underlining the party's commitment to full employment. It was not all bad news for the leadership, however. One new feature was the co-operation between the parliamentary party and the Association of Liberal Democrat Councillors (ALDC) to ensure that Wednesday's strategy debate did not end in a debacle. The blandly worded motion's acceptance of dialogue outside the party - although not the promotion of such dialogue - together with comforting clauses about the commitment to community politics owed much to a proposal from the ALDC. It seemed a far cry from the call that went out from the SDP to end the 'fudge and mudge' of British politics. The alliance with the ALDC is worth a great deal to the leadership, especially as only 20 members of the party are in the House of Commons. While the 3,500 Liberal Democrat councillors very rarely make national headlines, they are, some MPs believe, at least as influential within the party as their representatives at Westminster. The deal between the two groups got the party through the conference, although failed to hide the divide between those who believe co-operation with Labour is needed, and those who believe it is the last thing that is needed. Liberal Democrat activists can seem given to idealism rather than realism, but it was Ms Clare Brooks, a veteran Liberal activist and councillor, who came the closest to summing up accurately the position on dialogue and deals. 'At the end of the day, the parliamentary party will do whatever they want to do,' she said. They will do so when they know what it is. At present, the party that prides itself on facing up to the difficult questions confronting the UK seems not to have faced up to its own future.</p>

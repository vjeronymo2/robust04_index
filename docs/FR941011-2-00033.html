			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS intends to enter into an agreement with the SCS to serve as the administrative intermediary for the habitat restoration program. A discussion of the rationale for choosing the SCS as the intermediary for this program can be found in the September 7, 1994, notice of the proposed program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SCS will enter into agreements with the appropriate state conversation agency, conversation commission, or association of conservation districts, which, in turn, will develop: A grant solicitation process, including guidelines for making a grant application; a grant application review process; deadlines for grant applications; and a monitoring and evaluation process. Each state conservation agency, conservation commission, or association of conservation districts will develop agreements with state employment departments to establish a program to determine the eligibility of commercial fishermen according to the criteria described elsewhere in this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While it is NMFS' intention to make financial assistance available as soon as possible, it should be noted that, due to weather, habitat considerations, and the need for project review, planning, and implementing, it is unlikely that many fishermen will start receiving wages in this program prior to April 1, 1995. Every effort to expedite the program will be made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Data Collection Jobs Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS has chosen the PSMFC as the administrative intermediary for the data jobs program in the three affected states. NMFS has selected the PSMFC as the administrative intermediary because PSMFC goals, objectives, and organizational structure coincide largely with the implementation needs of this program. The rationale for choosing the PSMFC as the intermediary for this program is discussed in the September 7, 1994, notice of the proposed program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The data collection program will provide jobs associated with collecting information or performing tasks that will be of use to scientists and fishery managers. Under this program, eligible commercial fishermen, both tribal and non-tribal, will be hired on a first-come, first-served basis, at a ``living wage,'' up to $10&hyph;15 per hour, to perform various tasks by contractors associated with approved projects. Examples of these tasks include collecting tissue samples for genetic research, measuring parameters of the ocean environment (temperature, upwelling, etc.), performing baseline surveys of habitat, participating in test fisheries to determine ocean fish distribution, and assisting hatchery technicians in collecting information or in improving hatchery operations. Commercial fishing vessels may also be chartered to do research. For some tasks, as with the habitat restoration program, training of fishermen will be required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposals will be competitively solicited by the administrative intermediary from states, tribes, academia, and industry or conservation organizations for projects to be considered under this data collection jobs program. These proposals will be ranked according to criteria established in section IV of this notice. To ensure that this program complements the habitat restoration program and does not duplicate other Federal assistance programs, representatives from NMFS and SCS will be members of this review panel. Priority will be given to projects that provide the greatest benefits to displaced fishermen; address the sustainability or rebuilding of anadromous species, especially threatened or endangered salmon stocks; address Federal, Pacific Fishery Management Council, PSMFC, or state fishery research needs; are based on sound scientific methodology; and have low administrative costs. Applicants must demonstrate ability to manage and account for Federal funds. Matching funds or cost sharing are not required, but may be taken into consideration during the final selection process. The timing of the actual employment of fishermen will depend on the planning and proposal selection process, as well as the best seasons in which to undertake research. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Eligibility Criteria <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of the habitat restoration and data collection programs under NEAP, job applicants must meet all of the following eligibility criteria to receive assistance: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The applicant must show an uninsured loss. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. In the base year (1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, or 1990) used by the applicant in determining loss, the applicant must have earned at least 50 percent of gross income from the commercial fishery. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

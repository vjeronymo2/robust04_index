Ryabchikova; place  and date not given: "New People Should Come to Leadership"]    [Excerpts] [Ryabchikova] Why did you decide to run for  president as an independent candidate?    [Yermakov] Because I am convinced that only an independent  candidate stands a good chance of becoming a popular president.  This would also expand the basis for a prospective program and  its adjustments, making it genuinely centrist -- I have centrist  convictions -- and extracting whatever is good from the programs  of different parties.    Besides, if we talk about the need to form a coalition  government, a president coming from a party will find that to be  a much more difficult task. Instead of common sense or  compromise, this president would be steered by the party as to  what decision to make or who to nominate to this or that post.  I have long realized the correctness of Stalin's slogan:  Personnel are fundamental.    Finally, it is my deep conviction that a reform-minded  president must feel the support of all people, and of one party  only.    [Ryabchikova] But the people now seem to be concerned only  with their dropping standard of living. Could we live at least  a little bit better?    [Yermakov] In my opinion, we have approached a line which is  very dangerous to cross. People cannot even feed themselves  properly. Yes, we could live better, but our perestroyka  transformed everything into some kind of agony. We set out to  mess up everything in sight without thinking about where we are  headed. Everyone is to blame for this, especially communists.  As a rank-and-file Communist Party member, I too am guilty.  However, I am not ashamed of belonging to the Communist Party,  which, by the way, I have not abandoned to this very day.  [passage omitted]    One should not again lie to people -- there is no turning  back. But we all must admit that the process of economic  stabilization and trying to get out of the crisis by ourselves  is very much delayed in the Crimea. The peninsula has followed  the lead of Ukraine's unpredictable policies lacking any sense  of direction. This has led to extremely bad consequences.    [Ryabchikova] What do you think about the idea of a Crimean  state?    [Yermakov] We have declared that the Crimea is a state and  have written this into the Crimean Constitution. Our statehood,  however, has to be defended and consolidated. Whether or not  Kiev wants it, the Crimea has proclaimed itself an independent  state. Without leaving Ukraine. One should reckon with this  fact. Or else... everything has its limits, you know.    [Ryabchikova] What do you think about the Sevastopol issue?    [Yermakov] At present, the city of Sevastopol has the rights  and responsibilities of an oblast. In fact, it is a little  oblast. A strange situation has taken shape -- as it is directly  subordinated to Kiev, the city is and at the same time is not in  the Crimea. I believe that it should not be separated from the  Crimea. We should eventually form a common entity. The time has  come to unite. First of all, this would strengthen the Crimean  state -- one out of every five Crimean residents lives in that  city. It also has vast intellectual potential -- its five  research institutes used to work for the entire Soviet Union --  as well as economic potential. Finally, it is the chief Black  Sea Fleet base.    [Ryabchikova] Will this task require calling a referendum,  do  you think?    [Yermakov] I believe we can do without a referendum. It  would be enough to conduct a public opinion poll, and based on  its results, have the Sevastopol City Council adopt a  resolution. After that, the council along with the Crimean  Supreme Soviet would request that the Ukrainian Supreme Council  recognize our unification. This is our inalienable right.  [passage omitted]    [Ryabchikova] How would you assess the activities of the  Crimean Supreme Soviet?    [Yermakov] Unfortunately, our sessions have looked more like  political rallies, focusing on trifle matters and neglecting  serious economic problems. No offense meant, but the present  deputies are not capable of delivering any changes at all. New  people should come to the Crimean leadership -- those who know  their way through the dangerous thicket of the market jungle and  can survive under new conditions. [passage omitted]    [Ryabchikova] How should we begin our reforms?    [Yermakov] Without a stable monetary system, it is  impossible  to boost the economy and introduce the market pricing system.  To mend the financial system, we should devise a program  intended to encourage production and stabilize the credit and  financial system. We must determine the status of the Crimean  National Bank with the possible transition to payment  settlements conducted in Russian hard-currency rubles. This  would immediately balance the supply and demand relations in the  market and ease strains on society.    [Ryabchikova] How is your program different from the  programs  of other candidates for Crimean president?    [Yermakov] Let me present three main points, the  implementation of which is completely different. First, we  stand for a confederation of all former Soviet republics in one  economic commonwealth based on a common military and political  doctrine and the Commonwealth Armed Forces, which would consist  of small national armies. This commonwealth would be free from  internal borders and customs houses with the common ruble zone  and energy sources. This would solve the issue of the Black Sea  Fleet, dual citizenship, raw material supplies, components for  Crimean enterprises, etc. [passage omitted]    [Ryabchikova] How do you think the Black Sea Fleet issue  could be resolved?    [Yermakov] No one doubts that the fleet should not be  divided. This, however, is a kind of triple problem consisting  of three elements -- Sevastopol, the Crimea, and the fleet. If  you settle only one of these elements, leaving the other two  unaddressed, the problem as a whole will remain unresolved.    All those commissions are only games conducted by  politicians. I have more than enough of participating in them,  and am convinced that no commission will ever resolve anything.  It will take a forcible decision on the part of both states:  "It is going to be this way, and that's that." We should not  be afraid of this.</p>

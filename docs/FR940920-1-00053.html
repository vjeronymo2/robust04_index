			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA does not believe that addition of the filtration and analysis step will change the achievable Hg emission rates for MWC's and MWI's. Because of the significant amount of chlorine in MWC and MWI flue gas, most of the Hg in these flue gases occurs as water-soluble ionic Hg. As a result, use of Method 29 collects most of the Hg in these flue gases on the filter and in the HNO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> /H <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> impingers, with the remainder collected in the KMnO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> /H <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 4  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> impingers.

For those pollutants for which CEMS are not available (i.e., HCl, Hg, Cd, Pb, PM, and dioxins/furans), the proposed guidelines would require that stack test methods be used on an annual basis to determine compliance. Progress continues to be made on the development of new and improved CEMS. The EPA requests comment on the availability of CEMS to replace stack testing for any of the pollutants listed above. The EPA specifically requests comment on the availability, precision, accuracy, and cost of CEMS for HCl and Hg. Based on the information received, the EPA will reconsider CEMS requirements and may increase the number of pollutants monitored by CEMS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed standards would require owners and operators of all affected facilities to submit notifications of construction or reconstruction, date of anticipated startup, and anticipated date of demonstration of the continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) (if applicable), as required under &sect;60.7 of subpart A of part 60.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NSPS promulgated on February 11, 1991 include reporting and recordkeeping requirements for MWC acid gases, MWC metals (PM and opacity), MWC organics (dioxins/furan), MWC operating practices, and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . These reporting and recordkeeping requirements are summarized in the previous  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice (56 FR 5488, February 11, 1991). Under today's proposed standards, these same reporting and recordkeeping requirements would apply to MWC's at both small and large plants with the following four exceptions: (1) Dioxin/furan emissions would be recorded and reported either in terms of dioxin/furan TEQ or as total mass of dioxins/furans; (2) monitoring and reporting of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> emissions would not be required for small plants because NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> control is not applicable; (3) if MWC's at small plants have met the criteria allowing them to conduct compliance tests for dioxin/furans, PM, or HCl every third year, they would submit a simplified report for years when a full compliance test was not required; and (4) both small and large MWC plants would be required to report the results of annual method 9 opacity tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reporting and recordkeeping requirements in the proposed NSPS are necessary to inform enforcement personnel of the compliance status of new MWC's that begin operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the records would provide the data and information necessary to ensure continued compliance of these MWC's with the proposed regulation. At the same time, these requirements would not impose an unreasonable burden on MWC owners or operators. All required records and all quarterly and annual reports must be maintained for 5 years following the date of such records or submittal of such reports. All information contained in the records must be open to the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recordkeeping and reporting requirements are being proposed in today's NSPS for Cd, Pb, and Hg. After the initial performance test has been completed, the proposed standard would require the submission of annual compliance reports for Cd, Pb, and Hg for MWC's at both small and large plants. However, if MWC's at small plants have met the criteria allowing them to conduct compliance tests for Cd, Pb, or Hg every third year, they would submit a simplified annual report for years in which a full compliance test was not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed NSPS would require that certain types of records be maintained. If an activated carbon injection system is used for Hg control, MWC plants would be required to keep records of the quantity of activated carbon used for each 8-hour period of MWC operation. These records would provide documentation that these systems continue to be operated properly between compliance tests. The proposed NSPS would also require the submittal of initial and annual compliance reports for fly ash/bottom ash fugitive emissions testing for MWC's at both small and large MWC plants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, today's proposal would require that the siting analysis, materials separation plan, and summary of response to public comment be submitted to the State. Refer to section V.D of this preamble for a discussion of the proposed reporting requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> V. Rationale for the Proposed Standards for Siting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section presents the EPA's rationale for establishing the proposed siting requirements, including a siting analysis, a materials separation plan, and public meetings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Overview  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under authority of section 129 of the Act, the EPA is proposing siting requirements for new MWC's. As proposed, the siting requirements include three major components: (1) A siting analysis, (2) a materials separation plan, and (3) public meetings with responses to public comments. These siting requirements would apply only to MWC units at MWC facilities with aggregate capacities to combust greater than 35 Mg/day of MSW, for which the initial application for a construction permit under 40 CFR part 51, subpart I, or part 52 is submitted after the date of promulgation of the final rule. These siting requirements would not apply to existing MWC's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

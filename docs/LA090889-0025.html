			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WEEKENDER: MEXICAN FIESTA WILL LET VISITORS 'SEE HISTORY AND PARTICIPATE IN  IT.'  </P> <P> The South Bay will revisit its Spanish and Mexican heritage Sunday.  </P> <P> In Carson, the occasion will be a free Mexican Independence Day celebration at  Dolphin Park, 21205 S. Water St., from noon to 6 p.m. "We want to give people a  sample of the culture of the Mexican heritage," said Glenn Salas, park  director, who said the fiesta -- now in its 12th year -- has been growing  steadily and drew 1,500 people last year.  </P> <P> Across the South Bay, a remnant of history, a 150-year old adobe ranch home,  will be in the spotlight during the annual free Centinela Adobe Fiesta, where  people are encouraged to wear sombreros, mantillas and shawls to help turn back  the clock to rancho days.  </P> <P> "We want people to see history, to participate in the way it used to be," said  Christina Machado Essex, fiesta chairman and great-great-granddaughter of  Ignacio Machado, who built the adobe in the early 1830s, raising corn and  cultivating 6,000 grapevines on his ranch.  </P> <P> The fiesta will be from 2 to 5 p.m. Sunday at the adobe, 7634 Midfield Ave., on  the Westchester-Inglewood boundary.  </P> <P> The Carson celebration marks "el 16 de septiembre," the day in 1810 that Father  Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla urged the peasants of Mexico to revolt against three  centuries of Spanish Colonial rule. Although it took 11 years to defeat Spain,  the day of the priest's exhortation is regarded as the birth of independent  Mexico.  </P> <P> Entertainment at the park will be, as Salas puts it, "all Mexican" -- from  colorfully costumed folkloric dancers drawing their music and dances from  various Mexican states to popular Latino music played by the Sabor band.  </P> <P> The headliner is Mari Jimenez, a Mexican-born singer of ranchero music,  Mexico's equivalent of country-Western, who will be joined by a mariachi group.  </P> <P> Sports will be almost as visible as music and dancing at the celebration, with  a boxing exhibition and youth soccer tournament on tap.  </P> <P> Visitors will be able to enjoy carnival games, buy a variety of arts and crafts  and munch on Mexican foods -- that is, if they don't bring their own family  picnics.  </P> <P> Salas said teen-agers will have an area all to themselves at the fiesta,  complete with dancing to a live DJ, and contests -- ice-cream eating, tortilla  tossing and dancing.  </P> <P> The park director said a Mexican-themed celebration is a natural for Carson,  which not only has a large Latino population of its own, but draws people from  Wilmington and the harbor area.  </P> <P> "It's just been getting bigger and bigger," he said.  </P> <P> Folkloric dancing and music also will be a highlight at the Centinela Adobe  Festival, where the youthful 10-member Danzes de Tierra will perform dances of  Northern Mexico and Veracruz state in front of the tree-shaded adobe.  </P> <P> "We really enjoy dancing for this group because these people are really into  history," said group leader Yolanda Hernandez.  </P> <P> Gladys Waddingham, a founder of the Historical Society of Centinela Valley,  which maintains the adobe, said the fiesta was started in 1972 as a way of  bringing the community closer to its heritage. The adobe is known as the  birthplace of Inglewood.  </P> <P> After its construction by Machado, the place had a variety of owners, the most  famous being Daniel Freeman, who bought the house and its surrounding 25,000  acres for $140,000 in gold in 1885. He later turned 11,000 acres into a  settlement that grew into the city of Inglewood.  </P> <P> Sunday's fiesta will give people a chance to pretend it's the old days,  according to Essex. They'll be able to make butter on an old hand-operated  churn and grind coffee on an antique grinder. There will be demonstrations of  porcelain-doll painting, lace making and spinning. Women will make tortillas by  hand, and Mexican pan dulce will be on sale.  </P> <P> Such special historical exhibits as Indian artifacts and quilts will be  presented, and the permanent attractions of the adobe, with its thick walls and  low ceilings, will be on view. Among them are furniture, musical instruments,  portraits, dolls, leather hatboxes and the bric-a-brac of decades.  </P> <P> Visitors will be able to tour the two other buildings on the adobe grounds. One  is a research center, decorated in Victorian paneling and decorative glass  taken from the demolished Daniel Freeman Mansion, and housing a variety of  displays and historic photos. The second building is the former Freeman land  office, a circular wooden structure with a wide veranda and artifacts of  Freeman's land development and other business activities.  </P> <P> Said Essex: "We want people to see history, see the way it was, and to  participate in it. We may be able to go to the moon, but we still need to be  involved in our history." Gerald Faris  </P></p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Names urge Lloyd'sto reform EGMs THE Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents more than 9,000 Names - individuals whose assets support the market - yesterday called for changes in the organisation of extraordinary meetings. Mr Neil Shaw, the association's chairman who is also chief executive of Tate &amp; Lyle, described the present system - requiring 100 Names' signatures - as 'ludicrous'. Mr Shaw said at least 1,000 signatures should be the minimum. Lloyd's, which is under pressure to implement its business plan, has already organised one meeting at the request of supporters of Mr Claud Gurney, a critic of the market's administrators. It could soon face calls for another meeting by supporters of Mr Richard Astor, a lawyer campaigning for loss-making Names. 'We believe it is in the members' interest to reserve the expensive and time-consuming process of an EGM for genuinely critical issues that affect the whole membership of Lloyd's,' said Mr Shaw. Lloyd's said extraordinary meetings were expensive but the market had to be careful about 'disenfranchising people who have genuine grievances'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In his regular Friday news conference, UN Special  Representative Dr. Aldo Ajello has described as closed the issue  on the opening of assembly areas, now that 49 assembly areas are  available. Radio Mozambique Journalist Emilio Manhique reports:    [Begin Manhique recording] Moreover, Aldo Ajello presented a  brief report on the outcome of investigations into allegations  that the government was training 1,000 soldiers in area two,  Nampula Province, and the discovery of an arms cache in  Inhamizua, Beira. Ajello said the allegation that the government  was training soldiers was a misunderstanding and noted that the  government had requested -- in conformity with the cease-fire  rules -- to use the area as a transit center for its troops and  was duly authorized by the commission; and because of this there  is no violation.    He added that at present 600 soldiers are confined in the  area and are scheduled to leave for Angoche and Namialo assembly  areas within the next 10 days.    The Cease-Fire Commission has decided that as of now the use  of transit centers must be subjected to a number of rules --  namely, the center cannot accommodate more than 150 people for  more than 10 days. The centers may have 48 permanent members to  grant logistical assistance and other tasks.    On the second allegation concerning the arms cache in  Inhamizua, Beira, Ajello said the commission sent to the area to  investigate the issue interviewed witnesses who confirmed the  existence of weapons in the area. The witnesses said the  weapons were carried by the police. Ajello said when the police  were approached on the issue, they said they had no authority to  speak with the investigation team, an attitude which Ajello  described as correct. Thus, in conformity with the rules, the  issue was transferred to the National Commission for Police  Affairs, Compol.    Commenting briefly on the two issues, the UN special  representative in Mozambique urged the two sides to adhere to  regular ways of dealing with these problems before leveling  accusations in the press. He noted that this environment does  not help create a climate of trust since it poisons the  atmosphere. Ajello said he expects the sides to learn a lesson  from this issue.    Concerning the investigation into the alleged sexual abuse  of  children by UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] children,  Ajello said the investigation is complete and by the end of next  week a report on the issue will be presented. On the issue of  the appointment of two advisers, who will work with the UN  representative in Mozambique, Ajello said he expects much from  Oscar Monteiro and Andre Thomashausen, who will assist him in  all legal issues related to the implementation of the General  Peace Accord, particularly in building up trust between the  sides.    On General Mateus Ngonhamo's allegation that General Lelio  Goncalves is an office general, Ajello said it was not polite of  Ngonhamo to have attacked him after he left the country. He  said he has great admiration for Goncalves, whom he described as  an excellent officer. Ajello said one of Goncalves' great  qualities was to do his job, adding that he did not also try to  become a political leader and did not make any statement before  his departure. Ajello, who views Ngonhamo as an excellent  general, suggested that he should do the same, because, quote,  politics is not his job, unquote. [end recording]</p>

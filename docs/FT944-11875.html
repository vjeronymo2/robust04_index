			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / MMM chief targets UK for pyramid sales schemes Mr Sergei Mavrodi, chairman of the MMM financial company whose rise and fall this year made him the symbol of freewheeling Russian capitalism, said yesterday that he would offer British investors the chance to buy into his notorious pyramid schemes. 'The tickets (share coupons) are now being printed. We really mean to do it. I could operate successfully in Britain, and you will see that for yourself soon,' he told a press conference yesterday. Mr Mavrodi has found a large role for himself in the new Russia. He won fame with MMM, which promised, and initially paid, gains to a claimed 10m customers in a crumbling scheme that made him a folk hero. From the beginning of the year MMM promised, and to many delivered, wealth through the purchase of shares - whose value rose from Rbs1,600 in February to Rbs115,000 by July. But the 'shares' were quoted on no exchange, invested in nothing and rose by fiat of MMM and Mr Mavrodi. MMM seemed to have no means of making money other than the constant selling of its rapidly-rising shares. After government warnings on its solvency, it admitted its virtual collapse on July 29, telling investors it had nearly run out of cash and offering them 950 roubles (US40 cents) per share. Jailed in September on still-pending charges of tax evasion, Mr Mavrodi nevertheless won a by-election in the Moscow suburb of Mytishchi on Sunday. He had the support of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democrats - which he called social democrats until corrected. There was an angry response by several thousand shareholders outside his offices earlier this week when MMM announced that the shares would not be redeemed until the beginning of next year, but he remains in the moon-promising business. 'There is no need to panic,' he said. 'In two months I will put MMM in order and then the shareholders will gain once more. Look, you only have to go to our selling points to see the thousands of people queueing up to buy the new shares - more than ever before.' His first task as a parliamentarian, he said, is to heal MMM. Mr Mavrodi is vague on what he stands for: 'I will appeal to deputies from all factions . . . I haven't defined my politics yet.' A light-hearted question on whether or not he planned to run for the presidency of his country drew a thoughtful response. 'It will be a heavy burden to bear,' he said.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Alliance Resources Dollars 0.38m in loss In its first set of results since reconstruction proposals were put to shareholders last June, Alliance Resources, the oil and gas exploration and production company, reported pre-tax losses of Dollars 381,000 (Pounds 261,000) for the six months to October 31. For the year to April 30 1993 there were losses of Dollars 1.63m. The reduced deficit reflected a cut in administrative expenses to Dollars 407,000 (Dollars 1.54m for 12 months), a fall in net interest costs to Dollars 62,000 (Dollars 198,000) and a small increase in production. Turnover was Dollars 461,000 (Dollars 631,000). Losses per share were 0.01p (0.09p). The June proposals comprised the acquisition of Manx Petroleum, the acquisition of a further 14.25 per cent in the Valentine field, a Pounds 2.8m rights issue and placing together with a capital reconstruction and the appointment of two non-executive directors, Mr James Prior as chairman and Lord Torrington. In addition, the company's listing was restored in July and the reorganisation plan for its Alliance Resources (USA) subsidiary was approved by the US Bankruptcy Court. Mr Prior said the changes did not have a material effect on the results.</p>

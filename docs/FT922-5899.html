			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / International Bonds: Strong support for French franc sector from investors UNDERWRITING firms were unable to resist bringing new Eurobond issues in Canadian dollars and French francs yesterday, despite sluggish market conditions ahead of a public holiday in most of continental Europe today. BP America, the US subsidiary of the UK oil group, launched a CDollars 150m 10-year deal, lead managed by Credit Suisse First Boston. The 9 1/2 per cent bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of par, where the yield was 80 basis points more than Canadian government paper. The yield was seen as tight by participants in the deal. A syndicate official noted BP has a Canadian dollar issue maturing in 1999 which trades at a yield spread of 110 basis points over government paper. In addition, BP's Aa3 credit rating from Moody's, the US credit rating agency, is under review for possible downgrade. This may discourage some institutional investors from buying the bonds. Against this, the lead manager said retail buyers would step in to take paper issued by a well-known and well-liked borrower. The bonds were held at the fixed reoffer price throughout the day. The French franc sector continues to find strong support from international investors. French bonds yield around 60 basis points more than D-Mark paper, with little or no additional risk since the currencies are linked within the European exchange rate mechanism. Yesterday, Credit Commercial de France, the state-backed financial institution, launched a FFr1.5bn eight-year issue lead managed by its own capital markets division. The 9 per cent bonds were re-offered at 99.34, where the yield was 58 basis points more than French government paper of the same maturity. This was seen as fair value by participants in the deal and the strong underlying tone of the market ensured smooth placement. Elsewhere, Banco di Roma launched a Dollars 200m five-year floating-rate note issue, lead managed by Sanwa International. The paper pays 25 basis points above the London interbank offered rate, seen as reasonable by firms participating in the deal. The issue is the latest in a spate of dollar FRN issues following months - perhaps years - of inactivity. Recent borrowers include Banesto, SBAB, Sumitomo Bank and City of Stockholm. Bankers said investors were now attracted into floating-rate paper as a hedge against US interest rates, which may have bottomed out at medium to long-dated maturities. Meanwhile, financial institutions prefer to take this form of funding as a natural match for floating-rate assets. Warburg Soditic, the lead manager, has declared due for immediate repayment two Swiss franc bond issues by Mountleigh, the UK property developer which went into receivership on Monday. A SFr100m straight bond maturing in June and a SFr125m convertible issue due 1997 were called yesterday. Another SFr150m straight bond issue was already due for redemption yesterday. The firm has cancelled a bondholders meeting scheduled for June 10, at which the financial condition of Mountleigh was to be discussed. Bond holders will have to wait for receivers to liquidate Mountleigh's assets before any repayments will be made.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Ciampi wins confidence vote MR Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the former governor of the Bank of Italy, last night won a parliamentary vote of confidence in his new role as head of the country's 52nd post-war government. His firm commitment to carry out electoral reform before the summer muted opposition and paved the way for a large number of abstentions. He was backed outright by the outgoing four-party coalition plus the Referendum Movement led by Mr Mario Segni and the Radicals. There were 309 votes in the Chamber of Deputies for Mr Ciampi, 185 abstensions and only 60 against him - the No votes representing the neo-fascist MSI and the hardline communists, Reconstructed Communism. The Network (La Rete), the clean government movement, refused to attend the debate. The new prime minister was frequently reminded during the two-day debate of the difficulties of a non-parliamentarian dealing with parliament and of the fragile majority behind the government. Mr Ciampi's non-political origins in a country where the parties have been disgraced by scandal is a mixed blessing, as shown by the ambiguous feelings among members of parliament. The debate revealed a clear split between parties that want the government to last at least until next year and those pressing for fresh elections directly after new electoral laws are approved. The Christian Democrats and Socialists, the backbone of the majority behind the Ciampi government, insisted there should be no time limit. They fear facing early elections in a state of disarray. By contrast, the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), the Republicans, the populist Lombard League, the Greens, as well as the Referendum Movement, claimed the government's sole task was to comply with the wishes of the electorate as expressed in the April 18 referendum. The referendum introduced a system of majority voting for two thirds of seats in the Senate - the upper house of parliament - the remainder being covered by proportional representation. The latter parties openly threatened to carry out spoiling action should the government try to prolong its life beyond the introduction of electoral reform. Mr Segni, leader of the Referendum Movement, claimed such legislation could be presented to the government in days. He has already drawn up proposals for the Chamber of Deputies similar to those endorsed in the referendum for the Senate. Yesterday, Mr Ciampi, in reply to the debate, assured parliament he staked his prestige on being able to oversee such reform before the summer recess. He also warned that the process of political realignment risked further mutation as a result of the June 6 municipal and regional elections, involving 11m voters.</p>

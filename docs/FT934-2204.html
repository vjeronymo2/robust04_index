			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Management: Facing up to responsibility - In a second article on 3M, Christopher Lorenz describes reactions to its European reorganisation When Stig Eriksson and Peter Williams report that most people are delighted to be given greater responsibility and power, with more independence from their boss, they might seem to be stating the obvious. But the two European managers of 3M, the diversified US multinational, have also found that others 'are uncomfortable, and need to be coached', as Williams puts it. The type of response depends partly on the person's character and experience, but also often on their nationality, adds Eriksson. People from relatively authoritarian cultures such as Germany, France and Italy, tend to be unsettled by being allowed considerable autonomy, and can take longer to get used to it. Eriksson and Williams, who are at the heart of a radical reorganisation of the 21,000-person European operations of 3M, have experienced both types of reaction from their staff this year. The reorganisation, which took effect in January, has transferred most business responsibility from separate country subsidiaries to a network of 19 pan-European divisions - what 3M calls 'European Business Centres'. As a result, many managers in individual countries now report direct to European bosses, often in a different country and several hundred miles away. About a thousand managers have been affected directly. Most of the structural changes have already been made (see FT Management page, November 10). But Eriksson says all sorts of team-building and other 'change processes' are still under way in order to get people 'really to accept cultural diversity, and make it a strength'. With different nationalities now reporting to each other across borders, all sides must work hard at developing their relationship. A number of other 'rough edges', as 3M's top man in Europe, Doug Hanson, calls them, are also having to be smoothed out. Most of 3M's new Euromanagers have reacted positively to the changes, in spite of the heavy travel involved. Their enthusiasm is epitomised by the views of three of them: Fabio Barcellona , a 34-year-old Italian who now shuttles across Europe from his office in Milan; Clare-Noelle Bigay, a 29-year-old Frenchwoman who does the same from near Paris; and Reza Vaziri, a 40-year-old Italian-Swiss who has moved from Switzerland to near Dusseldorf in Germany. He is one of the few to have been relocated. Barcellona , and Bigay work several levels below Eriksson, a Finn who is the Brussels-based managing director of 3M's medical products business, while Vaziri is a couple of levels below Williams, the head of 3M abrasives, located west of London. Barcellona, marketing supervisor for 3M's line of sterilisation products, attributes its 15 per cent sales growth in this recession-torn year mainly to the reorganisation: 'It's given people new motivation, from marketing teams down to the sales forces and dealers - it's contagious'. Bigay agrees, saying the change is already creating such cross-border cohesion that a new product which she is helping launch across Europe this month 'would have taken another year previously, because the countries worked individually'. As an experienced manager, Vaziri was used to operating with a considerable 'power distance' in his native Switzerland, from where he moved late last year to run the German sales and marketing operations of one of 3M's abrasives businesses. His German predecessor in that job reported to a fellow national on the same site as himself. But Vaziri's boss is a Frenchman based near Paris. Vaziri says he is entirely happy with the new arrangement. He talks to his new boss once a week on the phone, and they meet more or less monthly, usually alternating between Dusseldorf and Paris. 'That's actually more often than I saw my boss in Switzerland,' he says. One of the main reasons why 3M has had relatively little trouble putting the reorganisation into practice is that there was a growing consensus at all levels that the previous structure was in need of change. Among the old cross border consultation processes was a widely publicised system called 'European Action Management Teams'. These teams helped plenty of new product ideas to be exploited across borders, but always relatively slowly. Williams says they were more forums for debate than platforms for action. 'It was extremely difficult to get enough knowledge and commitment across frontiers. One had to do things through product directors in Brussels who didn't have full authority to get things done,' adds Eriksson. So giving European tasks to managers in any single country 'was very difficult. They were judged by their local results, so they had to do it like 'church work'  -in their spare time'. Expanding on why the old organisation hampered 3M's responsiveness to the customer, Eriksson says: 'Europe is definitely consolidating, through alliances of customers and of distributors. Dealers are getting together every day in office equipment, pharmaceuticals, health care and other areas.' Yet 'we didn't do a good job of key account management', says Hanson, 'there was no central responsibility'. Williams recalls 3M's difficulties when a large oil company wanted to refurbish 5,000 sites across Europe. 'It was a major problem getting everyone harnessed behind it,' he says. Another problem was that 'we didn't have good control of pricing policy', Hanson adds. One country would go for price rather than volume, and its neighbour for the opposite. 'So distributors complained, and bought across the border.' He says the problem was most important 'for the confusion it created'. As well as being more effective at serving multinational customers and at transferring local skills across borders, the re-organisation is helping 3M get new product ideas into the marketplace much more rapidly. 'These days we expect roll-out times to be cut by 50 per cent,' says Eriksson. Such improvements are coming in spite of the difficulty of redesigning various information systems as fast as the organisation has changed. Hanson's outstanding list of 'rough edges' includes: The need to clarify new procedures following the shift of spending authority from countries to businesses. The development of guidelines for the cross-border harmonisation within businesses of recruitment, remuneration and other personnel practices. These are all relatively clear for sales and marketing jobs but not for staff ones. 'That's an issue we haven't resolved yet,' says Hanson. 'I guess I wasn't forward-thinking enough to see it as a problem.' The development of 'a bit of a silo mentality' within individual European business units, which in some cases is reducing the effectiveness of what 3M calls 'related selling': the sale by one business unit of another's products. 'That was easier to do within individual countries than it is all across Europe,' says Hanson. By no means every part of the organisation is experiencing all these problems. Frederico Gavioli, a 30-year-old Italian, who is part of the pan European 'core team' for biomedical electrodes and has special responsibility for several European product launches, says: 'We're sharing our resources much better than we used to - we no longer duplicate between countries. And everyone here is used to change. To be a 3M person you must live with it.' What about the risk - inherent in any pan-European organisation - of losing touch with national markets? Gavioli and other junior and middle managers say this has been avoided by their retention of national marketing responsibilities alongside their new European ones. As one of them says: 'The key to this is that I still have local customers on the phone every day, as well as people in other countries.'</p>

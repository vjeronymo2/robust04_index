			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Del Monte Foods poised for flotation DEL MONTE Foods Interna-tional, the processed fruit manufacturer, is preparing for a Pounds 450m flotation on the London stock market. The share sale will be one of the biggest non-privatisation flotations for several years. It will make multi-millionaires of the company's four executive directors, who together bought 5 per cent of its shares in a management buy-out in May 1990. DMFI is completely separate from the Del Monte fresh fruit business, which was bought by Polly Peck, the fruit and electronics conglomerate that collapsed in 1990. Polly Peck's administrators are also thought to be planning to float their Del Monte business, although probably in the US. Both companies were for many years part of RJR Nabisco, the US food and tobacco group. When Nabisco was bought by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the US buy-out specialists, in February 1989, Del Monte was sold and broken up. DMFI has exclusive rights to use the Del Monte name for processed foods in most parts of the world except the US. Its biggest market is Italy, where its annual sales are Pounds 80m, followed by the UK, where the turnover is Pounds 70m. While other big buy-outs in the past couple of years have struggled to hit their financial targets, DMFI's profits have grown rapidly. In the year to November 1991, profits before interest and tax rose 24 per cent to Pounds 29.5m, as sales grew 13 per cent to Pounds 252m. 'No business is recession proof,' said Mr Leon Allen, chairman. 'However, we have succeeded in pushing up both the volume of sales, by 10 per cent last year, and in widening margins.' The company is confident of at least maintaining its profit and sales growth. The business is being floated by Charterhouse, the merchant bank whose investment funds own half of DMFI, and Cazenove, the stockbrokers. The share sale is scheduled for the autumn. There will be a London listing although many of the shares will be offered to institutions in Europe. Between Pounds 250m and Pounds 300m of shares will be offered to individuals and institutions, with existing shareholders keeping the rest. Of the shares being sold, about Pounds 200m will be new equity to redeem preference shares and pay off debt.</p>

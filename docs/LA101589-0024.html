			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> HOT TYPE: Every magazine is entitled to have an anniversary issue, even RIP,  which celebrates its third anniversary this month. The new December issue of  the sassy hard-rock bible features a Motley Crue pull-out poster, Serious Rock  Talk with Jon Bon Jovi ("Q: What would you do if you could be invisible for a  day? A: Hang out in a girls' shower. A girls' shower in the locker-room of a  strip club."), features on Metallica, L.A. Guns, Warrant &amp; Tora Tora and  gloriously frank reader mail ("Your cover story on Great White left me feeling  nothing but disgust for the entire band . . . if the only angle they want to  promote is how accessible they are to horny groupies, a sign in the window of  the tour bus would suffice"). . . . And KRS-One, who's out on a 27-city tour  with L.A.'s own Young MC, isn't just doing rap concerts this fall. Both  performers will be giving a series of lectures at local colleges along the way,  in part as a way of encouraging students to join the teaching profession. So  far the duo's lecture schedule includes such lofty institutions as Princeton  and Yale.  </P></p>

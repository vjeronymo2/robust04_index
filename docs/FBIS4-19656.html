			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Portuguese Foreign Minister Durao  Barroso spoke about Bosnia this morning. He said that the  situation of the blue helmets is becoming unacceptable.    [Begin Barroso recording] None of the countries, or those  where public opinion is, shall we say, more shocked by this  situation, has so far advocated sending soldiers to the area to  fight. One thing is troops to fight, another is blue helmets.  The Blue Helmets -- many of them are almost hostages. They are  witnessing massacres. Well, I ask myself whether it is very  useful to have people witnessing massacres. Therefore, if we do  not accept the possibility of massive military intervention,  then we have to seek a political solution. [end recording]    Durao Barroso was speaking after a meeting with the Slovene  foreign minister at Necessidades Palace [Foreign Ministry].  Durao Barroso also said that the success of the elections in  South Africa could be a good start for the pacification of  southern Africa.    [Begin Barroso recording] Contrary to a number of reports  that have been made public which say the Portuguese Government's  position is that the key to the issue lies in South Africa, I  can say this is not true. There is a certain influence, but it  would be an illusion to think that the Angolan problem will be  resolved exclusively in South Africa, without denying,  obviously, the links between the two situations. Of course, if  the situation in South Africa evolves positively, with  stability, with democracy, this can only be a positive factor  for stability in the region, namely in Angola and Mozambique.

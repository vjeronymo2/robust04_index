One shipload of spares has arrived in India, another is  expected this week and a third will come later this month, THE  HINDU said. Indian defence officials could not be immediately  reached for comments.    The arrivals mark "a breakthrough in the jammed supplies  since the disintegration of the Soviet Union," the daily said in  a front- page report. It said military exchanges were also  planned between the two countries.    The Soviet Union supplied India with about 65 percent of its  military hardware until its December 1991 collapse, and the  Indian armed forces, mainly its air force, have suffered spare  parts shortages.    The Hindu report came five days after the Indian army chief,  General B.C. Joshi, said that the Soviet-equipped Indian  military had managed to overcome a supply crunch caused by the  breakup of the former superpower.    He had said that while much of what India was getting from  the Soviet Union could now be obtained locally, "the situation  (in Russia) is slightly better than it was two years ago."    "They don't need the degree of preparedness which they  needed  before the Soviet Union was dismantled," Gen. Joshi had said.  "Russia today really has no threat. So a lot of inventory today  is lying idle. That is available."    THE HINDU said Gen. Joshi would go to the Soviet Union this  month. Russian ships would call at Bombay "in the near future,  while the plans for joint naval exercises are under way.</p>

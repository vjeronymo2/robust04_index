			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> One of three men who kidnaped and buried a bus full of schoolchildren 13 years  ago has been denied a parole for the 10th time. Richard Schoenfeld, 35, who is  serving a life sentence, is still a danger to society, a Board of Prison Terms  panel decided. Schoenfeld was convicted for his role in the Chowchilla  kidnaping of 26 schoolchildren and their driver from the rural San Joaquin  Valley town for $5 million ransom. Schoenfeld, his brother, James, and  Frederick N. Woods commandeered the bus on July 15, 1976, and took it 100 miles  to Livermore. There they shut the victims in a poorly ventilated moving van  buried in a quarry. It took the group 16 hours to dig to safety through the  wood- and earth-covered hole.  </P></p>

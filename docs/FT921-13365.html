			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Letter: Alcan's import plans in the can Sir, Observer's suggestion ('Outside job', January 16) that the new British Alcan Aluminium can recycling plant at Warrington is facing liquidation because it cannot get enough cans is ludicrous. This Pounds 28m investment is designed to meet Britain's aluminium can recycling needs into the next century. It is certainly no secret that we have always planned to import used drinks cans to feed the plant during its first years while the collection infrastructure develops in the UK. Every week we handle a greater volume of used drinks cans from the UK, as more and more people learn that they can not only help the environment, but also make money. The only 'liquidator' at the Warrington plant is the man who operates the melting furnaces. Richard Gaunt, corporate affairs manager, British Alcan Aluminium, Chalfont Park, Gerrards Cross Bucks SL9 0QB</p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> LAND ACTION ON NEW JAIL MAY START SOON  </P> <P> Ventura County officials may begin proceedings next month to condemn 157 acres  near Santa Paula for a new jail, although the issue of contaminated soil on the  property is unresolved.  </P> <P> The property is valued at $2.6 million, according to an appraisal prepared for  the county by Ventura Appraisal. But it may cost an estimated $500,000 to  finish cleaning up soil contamination caused by leaking gasoline and oil tanks,  said Arthur Goulet, county director of public works.  </P> <P> The county has offered $2.6 million which was rejected by landowners Michael R.  and Nancy A. Brucker. The two sides will continue to negotiate, Goulet said.  </P> <P> "The contamination is the real touchy part," he said. "It complicates the  transaction."  </P> <P> Last July the Board of Supervisors picked the site at California 126 and Todd  Road for a new jail from among five spots. On Tuesday the supervisors are  expected to schedule a public hearing Dec. 4 to authorize the condemnation.  </P> <P> The first phase of the jail is expected to be constructed in about three years.  It will cover 15 acres and house 752 inmates. The cost is estimated at $51  million, with state funding covering $31 million and rest coming from county  funds. Ultimately, the entire complex will house 2,306 inmates and cover 40 to  45 acres.  </P> <P> The site is now a lemon orchard. At one time four aboveground oil tanks on the  property stored fuel to operate 2,000 smudge pots. In addition, about 15  underground gasoline tanks were located there to fuel wind machines, which are  used to help regulate temperatures in the orchard.  </P> <P> All the tanks have been removed and the cleanup has been going on the last  three years, said Ted England, attorney for the Bruckers who bought the  property a little more than a year ago. The soil has been detoxified mainly by  stockpiling it and letting it air out, he said.  </P> <P> The cleanup has cost more than $1 million, England said, and the remaining work  will cost less than $500,000. He said "there is a substantial difference"  between the county's offer and the Bruckers' selling price, which he didn't  disclose. JANE HULSE  </P></p>

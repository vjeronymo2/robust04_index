			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN WATCH;  </P> <P> A GOOD ISSUE, BUT THE WRONG MAN  </P> <P> Because Dianne Feinstein and Pete Wilson both are instinctual political  moderates, few genuine differences over issues have emerged in their  gubernatorial campaign.  </P> <P> However, as she demonstrated in the Democratic primary, Feinstein has a shrewd  sense of the electorate's anxieties and an ability to make her opponent their  focus.  </P> <P> In that race, she managed to link women's apprehension about reproductive  rights to John Van de Kamp's personal reservations about abortion. Now, she has  sensed the voters' anger over the savings and loan debacle. As a result, her  campaign is attempting to imply that Wilson is particularly culpable in the  matter because he received unusually large contributions from S&amp;L  interests.  </P> <P> Neither point is supported by facts. A recent Common Cause report said that  Wilson had received more money, $243,000, from thrift-related contributors than  any other senator. It did not point out that during the period analyzed, Wilson  ran for office twice, while many of his colleagues had run only once. Moreover,  his funds were reported as direct contributions, while S&amp;L gifts to his  colleagues often were disguised. For example, Alan Cranston, who ran only once  during the period, is listed by Common Cause has having received only $143,700.  No mention is made of the $1 million he got for a voter registration drive.  </P> <P> Finally, there is no evidence that Wilson, whose S&amp;L contributions account  for less than 1% of his total campaign funding, ever intervened on behalf of  the thrifts.  </P></p>

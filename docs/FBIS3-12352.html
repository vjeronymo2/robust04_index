			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Voice of Lebanon correspondent George Shahin reports  form the scene of the explosion:    [Shahin] We are reporting to you from the scene of the  explosion in the Zuq Musbih area, where Army, Internal Security  forces, and Civil Defense units, along with other security  agencies have cordoned off the area. Throngs of citizens have  assembled on the highways and roads amid a heavy traffic jam.  According to the information announced by the interior minister  a short while ago, nine people were killed and a number of  others injured in the blast. He declared that the church and the  worshipers inside it have escaped a horrible massacre because  not all the explosive charges planted in the church went off.    Interior Minister Bisharah Mirhij inspected the scene of the  explosion a short while ago, accompanied by Interior Ministry  Director General Sami Shu'ayb and Central Security Secretary  Lieutenant Colonel Fadl Dahir. Deputy Rushayd al-Khazin has  just arrived at the scene.    The manifestations of destruction were evident as Minister  Mirhij was speaking to reporters. Mirhjij said:    [Begin Mirhij recording]: If they think that they can (?tear  apart) the homeland by bombing a church and killing innocent  people, we tell them that the church and all places of worship  are [words indistinct]. They will not be able to destroy  churches, mosques, or other places of worship in Lebanon. These  places are deeply valued in the hearts of our people and in our  land. This crime, no matter what its effect, will absolutely  not affect our domestic situation or the internal peace that we  all want. Our stand and that of our people's are the same: We  will secure internal unity, social peace, and stand shoulder to  shoulder in one line to defend Lebanon and our democratic system:    [Reporter] What is the latest death toll?    [Mirhij] A huge explosion occurred in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque  in occupied Palestine. That crime left dozens dead. There are  those who seek to destabilize our society from within. We say  that our society is stronger than (?these attempts).    [Reporter] [Question indistinct]?    [Mirhij] There must be [words indistinct], but this is not  the proper time to determine this issue.    [Reporter] Mr. Minister, having been briefed by the security  agencies on the effects of the explosion, what is the latest  death toll?    [Mirhij] We are not yet sure of the number of dead, but I  believe there are nine dead.    [Reporter] [Question indistinct]?    [Mirhij] The explosive charge was designed to cause a big  massacre, but God's care, [words indistinct] some charges went  off but not all. Had all the explosive charges gone off, the  result would have been devastating.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] explosive charges?    [Mirhij] We have not delved into details. This is the task  of the security forces. [end recording]    [Shahin] The security forces are conducting investigations  inside the church. Reporters have been forbidden to enter the  church for security reasons. They will be allowed in later  after the initial investigations. Destruction and devastation  are evident inside and outside the church. There are no doors  or windows. Cars parked nearby have been damaged, along with  homes. The church is located in the Zuq Musbih area and there is  heavy traffic on the highway. The Internal Security Forces are  trying to facilitate traffic.</p>

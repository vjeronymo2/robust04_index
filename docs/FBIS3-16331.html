			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs says that  all the most important political and economic interests of  Lithuania were included in the draft Lithuanian-Polish treaty.    The statement issued yesterday notes that discussions  concerning the Lithuanian-Polish treaty on friendly relations  and good-neighborly cooperation, which is due to be signed,  often acquire the nature of unilateral accusations.    The concern by the Ministry of Foreign affairs was caused by  a statement issued by a group of Kaunas City Council deputies  which categorically demands that the text of the draft treaty be  made public and even points out which concepts should be  included into the text of the draft treaty.    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the negotiations  with Poland were proceeding according to the principles of  international law and practice and according to the decision of  1992 adopted by the government of Lithuania, which says that  information about negotiations with foreign countries up until  the signing of the agreement is a state secret of the Republic  of Lithuania.    The Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejects any such  pressure as an attempt to influence the course of negotiations  and to complicate mutual relations of the two states. As is  known, in a democratic country confidence in the quality of work  of the diplomatic service is tested and verified during the  ratification of the signed treaty in parliament.</p>

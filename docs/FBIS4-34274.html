			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salete Sobreira] </F>   [Text] The Federal Supreme Court [STF] has upheld a legal  provision that prohibits both political parties and candidates  from accepting donations for electoral campaigning from trade  unions and similar organizations.    Paragraph 6 of Article 45 of the law prohibits candidates  and  parties from receiving, whether directly or indirectly, any  donation in money or in any other form that could be translated  into money -- including any kind of advertisement -- from unions  or similar organizations.    By a vote of six to three, the STF thus turned down a  petition filed by the Workers Party to have the above law  declared unconstitutional. Justice Sepulveda Pertence, who  heard the case, voted with the minority. He believes that  unlike unions, associations could make donations because they do  not collect mandatory dues and contributions from their members.    Justice Neri da Silveira, who voted down the PT petition,  said that the ban also affects associations, in order to prevent  powerful economic organizations from committing excesses. The  STF has ruled that the law will stand, but that it will be  incumbent upon the Superior Electoral Court to rule on the case  of PT presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is  facing charges for having used a sound truck from the  metalworkers union of the ABC region [Sao Paulo industrial belt]  in his electoral campaign.</p>

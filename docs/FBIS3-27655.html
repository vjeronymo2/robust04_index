			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, 24 Feb (XINHUA) -- Speaking in  self-defense in the Legislative Council [Legco] this afternoon,  Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten repeated his hackneyed remarks  about his so- called "disbelief" that China would start a new  kitchen in 1997, without recognizing the political model  practiced unilaterally by the British Hong Kong authorities.  Earlier, veteran British legislator Du Ye Xien [Elsie Tu]  refuted this absurd argument in Legco, citing remarks made by  the British foreign secretary two and a half years ago.  [sentence as received]    In a motion filed with Legco requesting the postponement of  a  debate about Patten's plan, Du Ye Xien said: "Transferring  sovereignty and implementing the Basic Law in Hong Kong in 1997  are a very solemn affair for China. China's establishment of  the Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee  of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, as well as  remarks about starting a so-called new kitchen, are all  preparations for this major event."    She pointed out: "Of course, some people say that if the  British Government's political model is established in 1995, the  Chinese Government will not dare replace it in 1997. To those  who believe this, I would like to quote British Foreign  Secretary Hurd's remarks to the British House of Commons on 16  February 1990. It was only some 30 months between the time he  made such remarks and the time he abruptly changed course to  support Mr. Patten's political reform draft bill. The remarks  went like this: `People who believe that in 1997, the Chinese  Government will accept all that we are currently doing are  divorced from reality.' These remarks really came from Mr.  Hurd."    After repeating the above remarks by Hurd, Du Ye Xien said:  "Let us use Mr. Hurd's remarks for verification purposes. Are  his current actions and the government he represents divorced  from reality? Who in Hong Kong will be so naive as to think  that China will allow this British model to continue after 1997?  The Chinese Government has repeatedly said in unequivocal terms  that this is a matter of national dignity."</p>

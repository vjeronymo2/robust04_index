			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad, April 12, IRNA -- The speaker of Iran's  parliament told a group of Pakistani Shiite and Sunni ulama here  Tuesday that what has terrified global arrogance and the U.S. in  particular today is the spread of Islamism in Muslim countries.    The speaker, Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri also said  the enemies of Islam were seriously concerned about the revival  of Islamic movements in the remotest parts of the world and even  in Europe.    He said the utterance of the word, Allah and the phrase  Allaho Akbar (There is no god but Allah) is considered an  offense by the global arrogance and that any body who abides by  Islamic laws will be the target of U.S. propaganda ad military  attacks.    "It is for this very reason that we now see enemies of Islam  committing crimes against Muslims including women and children  in every part of Islamic lands," he said.    Nateq-Nuri also warned that the U.S. was trying to prevent  Muslims from getting united and engage them in internal problems  in a bid to contain the spread of Islam.    "Muslims should seriously avoid discord, settle their  differences by themselves and not allow foreigners to interfere  in their internal affairs," he advised.    The unity between Shiites and Sunnis has been materialized  in  Iran for years, he said, adding "we appeal to world Muslims to  follow the pattern of unity and sincerity between their Shiite  and Sunni brothers in Iran."    Addressing Pakistani ulama, the Majlis speaker said the  zealot Islamic groups who sow discord among Muslims are  certainly against their interests.</p>

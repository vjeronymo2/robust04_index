The leadership was briefed at the meeting on a number of  contacts that took place during the last few days with the  envoys of the U.S. Administration, the Russian leadership, the  Israeli Government, and the Norwegian Government to the  Palestinian leadership.    An authoritative Palestinian source stated that the  Palestinian stance, which has affirmed the need to take urgent  and necessary measures to protect the Palestinian people in the  occupied territories following the massacre of the al-Ibrahimi  Mosque in Hebron, and to take radical steps to uproot Israeli  terrorism, was reiterated to the envoys.    The source added that the PLO, while reiterating its  commitment to the peace process and its aims, would like to  stress the need for urgent action in order that such a process  would regain its dynamism and credibility, and in order to  create suitable opportunities for making the Declaration of  Principles, signed between the PLO and the Israeli Government,  successful as soon as possible.    The source added that the contacts and meetings, which were  held with both the U.S. and Israeli sides, have not produced any  real progress that will help in overcoming the hurdles facing  the peace process, because of Israel's determination not to take  effective and real measures, particularly in Hebron and  elsewhere, its insistence on only taking a number of superficial  and routine steps and bypassing the stance of the international  community, which is being supported by a large part of Israeli  public opinion, and on the need to take effective measures to  put an end to the terrorist activities of the Israeli settlers,  a matter that was also recently boosted by the agreement between  Rabin and the SHAS Party.    The source added that the PLO stressed that the task of the  peace process was to insure security for all. That was why the  Palestinian people and all the forces that supported peace in  the region were doubtful about the seriousness and credibility  of the process in light of the grave threat to the security of  the Palestinian people, as a result of the presence of hotbeds  of Israeli terrorism in the settlement areas in the occupied  territories, and the lack of international protection for the  Palestinian people under occupation.    The source said that the PLO stressed that it was impossible  to overlook the Hebron massacre, its causes, effects and  lessons, and that the Israeli Government, which bore full  responsibility for the massacre, had encouraged the stepping up  of campaigns of repression and killing against the sons of our  people after the massacre, and attempted to ignore the fact that  the massacre was the outcome of the settlement-based and  expansionist ideological structures, and was not the action of  an individual or individuals.    The official source stressed that while refusing to divert  its attention from the core of the matter and the massacre, the  PLO emphasized its rejection of any pressures and attempts to  compromise on the implementation of the necessary requirements  for the protection of the sons of the Palestinian people.    The source stressed that while calling on the sons of the  Palestinian people to consolidate the unity of ranks, the PLO  affirmed that it would continue to work at all levels to insure  the security, stability, and protection of the Palestinian  people in the framework of any move toward achieving a just and  comprehensive peace.    The leadership continues to follow up the situation with all  the concerned parties and at all levels.</p>

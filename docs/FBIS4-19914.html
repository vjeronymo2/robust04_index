			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed MTH/MAR: "Last Blue Helmets Have Left </F> Kigali"]    [Text] Mwanza, 19 Apr (BELGA) -- The last 300 Belgian Blue  Helmets in Rwanda left Kigali and arrived Tuesday evening [19  April] in Mwanza, Tanzania, where they boarded Hercules C-130  transport planes bound for Belgium.    The evacuation operation ran without a hitch. All the  Belgian Blue Helmets are safe and sound.    According to initial information, the evacuation operation  was supposed to be conducted by road, but in the end the Blue  Helmets opted for an evacuation by air. The possibility of a  land evacuation was apparently a decoy.    So, for the Belgian troops the Rwandan episode came to an  end  with the Tuesday evening, when the last C-130 departed for  Brussels.    Meanwhile, violent fighting is continuing in the Rwandan  capital of Kigali. The Rwandan Armed Forces have launched a  counterattack, while the Rwandan Patriotic Front is trying to  encircle them. Furthermore, more massacres are occurring in  Byumba, in northern Kigali.</p>

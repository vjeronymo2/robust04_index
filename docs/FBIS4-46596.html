			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Captain First Rank (Retired) Ilya Kolton, </F> candidate of technical sciences: "Military Secret: Evidence  Will Surface -- Top Secret Documents on the Status of Russian  Naval Submarines"]    [Text] It is not the first time that this theme has been  raised in the press. A whole host of articles in various mass  media sources have been devoted to the catastrophic situation in  the Russian Navy and its level of combat effectiveness. The  article by Captain First (Retired) Ilya Kolton is the  culmination of this long history, which reveals not only the  criminal negligence on the part of the Navy leadership in the  matter of ensuring the combat effectiveness of Russian nuclear  submarines, but also the monstrous bureaucratic red tape at all  levels of power today.  <H5>  In Place of an Epigraph: </H5>   If a wily and perfidious leadership, showing no  consideration  for the well-being of the fatherland, wanted, for its own gain,  to reduce our Navy to the point of possible annihilation, even  it could not place it in a position any more contemptuous or any  more impotent than the one in which it is today.    Vasiliy Golovnin (1776-1831), Russian seafarer, participant  in an around-the-world voyage, and, from 1823 onward, chief  naval quartermaster.    The use in the 1950's of nuclear-powered devices on  submarines by the United States and the USSR allowed them to  conduct lengthy secret operations under water. It is this which  predetermined their role as a nuclear missile carrier and became  a component (the naval one) of strategic offensive arms.  However, by the end of the 1960's, this key combat asset had  been lost by our nuclear-powered submarines. The main reason --  the unacceptable, if not criminal, negligence on the part of  certain home-grown scientists, designers, and the Navy  leadership -- that is, all those who preside over naval  shipbuilding -- in respect of the problem of reducing the  underwater noise levels of nuclear-powered submarines, their  main detection factor.    On the other hand, the United States and the countries of  NATO, applying the principle of complex acoustic design to their  nuclear-powered submarines, which meant according absolute  priority to the underwater noise level over all other combat  characteristics (speed, depth of submergence, and so on),  reduced the noise levels of their nuclear-powered submarines  tens of times over and thus improved their detection range  hundreds of times over [povisili v sotni raz dalnost vzaimnogo  obnaruzheniya]. They developed a whole series of models of  torpedoes and mines with acoustic self-guidance systems, plus a  whole range of other important measures was implemented  pertaining to combat our submarines on the basis of their high  noise level.    As for us, knowing, as we did, from intelligence reports the  direction in which the United States' submarine strategy was  developing, we stuck with the old principles of submarine  building expounded back in 1742 by Yefim Nikonov, who was the  first person to create a "hidden vessel" and test its  submergence and navigability under water in the River Neva.    Our guys, failing to alter the philosophy of submarine  building since that time, as if out of bloody-mindedness  continued to design noisy submarines. Breaching laws and the  methodology of testing, they fraudulently supplied and continue  to supply the fleet -- with the consent of the naval commander  in chief -- with unbattleworthy floating targets which are both  unreliable and dangerous to use. In this way, the combat  efficacy of the Navy has been brought to the level of the absurd.    We did not want a sensation on this subject in the open  press. There was, after all, a real possibility of resolving  this problem on a bilateral basis without humiliating the  military-industrial complex, the Navy, and those who served and  serve it faithfully. Indeed, 1990 even saw the conclusion of  just such an alliance with Admiral F. Novoselov, deputy naval  commander in chief for shipbuilding and weaponry, and we  supported nuclear-powered submarine projects, but, clearly, this  move did not fit into V. Chernavin's plans. So we were forced  to enter into open discussion with V. Chernavin in the press, at  times making use of officially classified information which, in  point of fact, was really being kept secret from our only own  people.    After this, we made repeated appeals to all state  authorities, including the newfangled Russian Security Council  (Yu. Sokolov, V. Rubanov, V. Manilov, Yu. Nazarkin, B. Ilin),  with a single request: That we might be given a chance in their  presence to defend the truth in honorable battle. However, even  for these people, directly answerable under the Law "On  Security" for the country's defense capability, this venture was  unsuitable. Nobody from among the state officials noticed our  pointed, revealing articles in newspapers and magazines, giving  the impression that they had never read them. But then came the  "first sign" which we had been patiently awaiting -- V.  Chernavin's article in PRAVDA 9 February this year entitled  "Paper Boats in the Sea of Life." The former navy commander in  chief came down angrily on the conclusion that "our nuclear  submarines, the basis of the Navy's nuclear might and a  component of the strategic nuclear forces, are a sham. They are  merely a maneuver to show that our country does still have a  combat capable fleet. We go to sea, churn up the waters in the  ocean, but this is as effective as beating the air.  Missile-armed submarines cannot in principle bear any combat  significance or effect any combat service.... The Americans are  hundreds of times superior in terms of detection range. The  upshot is that they, secretly tracking our missile-armed  submarines from the first to the last moment they are at sea,  stick with them, as if they had a dog on a lead...."    In the article V. Chernavin described this, albeit bitter,  truth as a "monstrous lie." But it is this bitter truth which  has been communicated in the open press and in dispatches to the  CPSU Central Committee and the USSR KGB since as far back as  1974 not only by me, a mere mechanical engineer who, in V.  Chernavin's words, is unfit to discuss the problems of naval  strategy, but also by admirals and top nuclear-powered vessel  commanders with a conscience and a feeling of responsibility  toward their people.    Incidentally, while V. Chernavin was floundering emotively  in  the airy "strategy" of conducting underwater warfare, submarine  experts in the United States condensed actual underwater  strategy to ensuring the secrecy of the actions of their own  submarine forces, which was sufficient for our submarine forces  to find themselves in the role of a blind and deaf boxer  striving to win a fight against the invisible man.    Unlike V. Chernavin, Fleet Admirals G. Yegorov and N.  Smirnov, Admiral N. Amelko, Vice Admirals R. Golosov, V.  Kruglyakov, and Ye. Chernov, Captains First Rank A. Alekseyev,  Yu. Beketov, A. Gorbachev, V. Zhukovskiy, V. Zaznobin, V.  Loboshinskiy, G. Melkov, A. Khraptovich, and many others,  bravely sought to extricate our submarine forces from this  humiliating position, and to ward off the unprecedented damage  being inflicted on the Navy, society, and the state as a result  of huge accidents and catastrophes involving weaponry and  military hardware. But in vain. They were prevented by V.  Chernavin. They were distanced from vital naval affairs.  Unfortunately, it is an old Russian custom that such people are  needed only at times of war and extreme difficulty. K. Simonov  put it well in a poem entitled "Aleksandr Suvorov": "In  peacetime, we are like estranged sons, but in wartime we are all  brothers together!" In times of peace, the people leading the  dance are people like V. Chernavin. You didn't have to be a  great strategist to organize the 1987 "spectacular" -- the naval  operation described by him in the article "Paper Boats in the  Sea of Life," which, in his words, "...seriously worried the  Pentagon and prompted questions of a highly pertinent nature in  the U.S. Congress...."    It is clear to the submarine engineer and the schoolboy  alike  that this naval operation was designed to disinform. Judge for  yourself. Five missile-armed submarines were earmarked to take  turns carrying out alert duty at sea for one year. To fulfill  the prescribed task, which was part of a plan to use on a rota  basis one missile-armed submarine at a time, the naval commander  in chief sent all five to sea at once. The question arises:  How will the naval commander in chief carry out the task of  defending Russia and the CIS countries from the sea for the  other 80 percent of the year if the division's annual sortie  quota for missile-armed submarines, and unreliable ones at that,  is completely used up?    Let's cite a few excerpts from documents testifying to this  very real state of affairs.    Top Secret: From a letter from Academician A.P. Aleksandrov  and Fleet Admiral G.M. Yegorov to the USSR president:    "As practice has shown, over recent decades every one of our  missile-armed strategic submarines has been under constant and  clandestine surveillance affording a high level of readiness to  destroy them on order, which leaves no grounds to believe it  possible that the task of Russia's defense, even in restricted  coastal regions of military action, can be effected."    Thus, in his article, V. Chernavin tries to mislead the  public, and first and foremost the Russian Federation Security  Council, by mentioning the apparently high combat potential of  our naval strategic nuclear system: "The success of this  operation meant a great deal in terms of my international  prestige too. NATO strategists had to be aware, with the  departure of the former commander in chief, Admiral of the  Soviet Fleet S.G. Gorshkov, who did so much to bring our ships  out into the expanses of the world ocean, that not only does his  successor not intend to surrendering the positions acquired, but  will play a new, more profound and more acute game..."    The gravity of this stance is not only that V. Chernavin is  concerned about his prestige in the United States and his own  country all at once, but also fact that, to the detriment of the  country's defense capabilityity, he takes the urgency out of the  problem of the struggle to increase the combat efficiency of the  actions of our submarines.    Top Secret: From Security Ministry files (N. Golushko) to  Russian Federation General Prosecutor V. Stepankov.    "The crux of the problem resides in the fact that the  elaboration of areas of development of hydroacoustic complexes  and self-guidance systems for underwater weaponry, appraisal of  the effectiveness and principles of a decision on new designs  for nuclear submarines, the elaboration of comprehensive  programs for antisubmarine warfare, and, finally, the actual  planning of combat operations involving calculations of the  optimum force configuration, is directly linked with the need to  have a precise knowledge of the characteristics of the noise  levels of our own submarines and those of a probable opponent.  Any distortion of information in this sphere will cause  tremendous damage both in the matter of developing weapons and  military hardware for the Navy and also in that of planning its  combat activity and, ultimately, the country's defense  capability."    To this day, V. Chernavin's objections to the introduction  of  proposals opening the way to ratifying START II without damaging  the country's defense capability do not add up and dispel doubts  about the objectivity of our conclusions on the point of this  "acticity" by V. Chernavin. After all, these proposals remove  the deficiencies of the naval component of START II in the  shortest possible space of time and with minimum material  outlay. They were supported by the submarine engineers of the  Northern and Pacific Fleets, scientists, and designers, and they  were substantiated by the results of interdepartmental  reconstructions and tactical exercises in the period from 1982  through 1986. The experience gained was analyzed by the  departments, and in 1985 it was approved at the Navy  Military-Technical Council and recommended for introduction on  nuclear submarines. However, through the efforts of the Navy  commander in chief, everything sunk into oblivion.    Top Secret: From Security Ministry files (N. Golushko) to  Russian Federation General Prosecutor V. Stepankov.    "At the same time, it should be noted that Navy Commander in  Chief V.N. Chernavin, who, since as far back as 1974, has had a  negative attitude toward these proposals for reasons known only  to himself, through his 1987 directive declined to introduce  them owing to their low effectiveness and potential danger in  questions of nuclear submarine survivability...." (This refers  to the introduction of proposals guaranteeing the secrecy of the  actions of nuclear submarines -- I.K)    Furthermore, in a bid to please V. Chernavin, the USSR  Defense Ministry Inspectorate for the Nuclear Safety of Nuclear  Installations defined these proposals as potentially dangerous.  In the experts' view, the conclusion drawn by the inspectorate  (Vice Admiral N. Bisovka) was "highly unconvincing,  contradictory, and, in point of fact, aimed at discrediting the  proposals."    Meanwhile, V. Chernavin was speaking out indignantly during  the 1993 election campaign ("Civic Union") in respect of "the  country's decrepit defense," and he felt no responsibility for  the collapse of the Navy, in which, back in the pre-perestroyka  era, he had played an active part.    Both the loss of strategic parity at sea and the possibility  of restoring it with minimum outlay in the shortest possible  space of time, to which V. Chernavin objected so strongly, were  subsequently repeatedly borne out by Academician A.P.  Aleksandrov and Fleet Admiral G.M. Yegorov in letters to the  USSR president and USSR defense minister, in a comprehensive  survey by the Russian Federation Security Ministry sent to the  Russian Federation general prosecutor, in a letter from Fleet  Admiral G.M. Yegorov and a group of admirals and naval officers  to Marshal of Aviation Ye.I. Shaposhnikov, and in an article  entitled "Road to Tsushima" (LITERATURNAYA GAZETA, 01.09.92).    The USSR KGB, the USSR Prosecutor's Office, and the Russian  Federation Prosecutor's Office also made repeated appeals for  this problem and the Navy's proposals to be examined by the  highest authorities.    Top Secret: From a letter from Deputy General Prosecutor N.  Shakleyin to Vice Premier G. Khizha.    "...Expressing alarm on the subject of the circumstances  listed, Kolton raises the question of imposing order in the  matter of supplying the Navy with ships and weaponry, abolishing  erroneous decisions by administrative organs, and also calling  guilty officials to account....    "...The repeated incidence of accepting into the effective  strength of the Navy ships and vessels with imperfections and  defects is confirmed also by materials at the disposal of the  prosecutor's oversight body.... An evaluation of information  cited concerning the military-technical policy conducted in  recent years, as well as the technical level and combat  readiness of the Navy, goes beyond the bounds of the competence  of the bodies of the Prosecutor's Office. At the same time,  leaving these questions unattended may lead to serious  consequences....    "...The former USSR Prosecutor's Office submitted an appeal  on this score to the USSR Cabinet of Ministers 23 July 1991, and  to the chairman of the Interrepublic Economic Committee 20  November 1991, but with no result...."    This request was also heard repeatedly in appeals by  ordinary  citizens to B.N. Yeltsin and other officials -- R. Khasbulatov,  G. Burbulis, A. Rutskoy, Yu. Skokov, Yu. Petrov, N. Trubin, V.  Stepankov, V. Panichev, V. Barannikov, S. Stepashin, A.  Piskunov, V. Ochirov, L. Sharin, A. Lapygin, A. Kotenkov, I.  Shalatonov, P. Grachev, and others.    However, all the appeals were examined merely in a cursory  manner, with unfounded negative conclusions, or else they were  not examined at all. One hazy area is the fact that a large  section of state officials, including some from the Russian  Security Council who are directly responsible for the country's  security, shied away in panic not only from a decision but even  from familiarizing themselves with this problem, as if they  feared getting burned, and immediately forwarded the documents  for conclusion by the main culprits: Fleet Admiral V.  Chernavin, general designer I. Spaskiy, Academician  Gaponov-Grekhov, and others. Once there, this issue was  resolved one-sidedly, tendentiously, and with blatant falsehood  and cynicism, refuting the positive results of reconstructions  and tactical exercises, the experience of testing and using  Naval ships -- that is, the truth. You do not have to look far  for examples.    Here before us is the conclusion of Academicians I. Spasskiy  (USSR Supreme Soviet deputy from the "Red Hundred") and S.  Kovalev (both, incidentally, heroes of socialist labor, the  latter twice over), two of the most authoritative general  designers in the military-industrial complex, prepared by them  in 1985 for my report to the Navy commander in chief on  supplying the Navy's combat complement with non-combatworthy  submarines. Under the stamp "Top Secret," the two academicians  expound what is actually not secret information:    "...For the first time in many years of work developing  submarines we have run up against the fact of representatives of  the apparatus of the Navy Standing Commission for State  Acceptance issuing a document which is unprecedented in terms of  lack of objectivity, incompetence, and crudeness. We hope that  the appearance of this document is an accident determined purely  by subjective factors.... I. Kolton's statement that the  efficiency of the actions of the U.S. Navy's nuclear submarines  is incommensurably higher than ours is unfounded and  tendentious.... Statements by the author such as 'industry, with  the consent of the Naval Main Directorate for Components Supply,  is setting norms for noise levels which lower the requirements  of the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers'  are a gross lie insulting to the collectives of the bureaus and  the construction plants. They also discredit the work of the  author's colleagues who accepted these nuclear submarines, and  of the Navy command, which is apparently ignorant about the  level of secrecy of the actions of our nuclear submarines....  Considering the aforestated, designers at the Central Design  Bureau deem unacceptable the practice of the appearance of  documents of this ilk, as they harm the great and complex work  to reduce the noise levels of nuclear submarines which is  constantly being done by the shipbuilding industry."    It seems appropriate to remind these academicians of an old  saying: "Jupiter, you are angry -- that means you are not  right." And indeed, both academicians lied. They lied. And  seven years later, the very same I. Spasskiy was forced to  admit to MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI correspondent Yu. Teplyakov (no. 48  1992) that: "Our submarines are dozens of times less efficient  than the Americans' in terms of noise levels. At high speeds,  they are defenseless...." But even in admitting part of the  truth, the academician nevertheless continued to lie. Why is it  only at high speeds that they are defenseless? They are  defenseless at low speeds, at which a missile-carrier's main  task has to be carried out.    Considering our distorted system for weapons and military  hardware supplies, it is possible to some extent to sympathize  with these academicians. But what can be our attitude toward  statesmen who should monitor and control this process? I will  cite an example. In September, for the purposes of checking the  activity of the USSR KGB, including in respect of the  aforementioned problems of the Navy, B. Yeltsin appointed a  commission under the leadership of S. Stepashin, and I got the  chance to expound my view to this commission.    The documents submitted by me contained substantiated proof  that the USSR KGB leadership, upon receiving objective  information acquired with great difficulty by their  subordinates, presented it for specific ends to the higher  authorities in the interests of lobby groups in a mode  transformed as required by them.    At that time S. Stepashin and his commission (A. Kotenkov  and  I. Shalatonov) successfully, and over a long period of time, hid  the problem of the Navy's combat effectiveness from the Russian  Federation president. It could not have been otherwise, if the  president failed to react to the crime of the century. Again,  my repeated appeals afterwards to S. Stepashin and A. Piskunov  had no effect, as the documents were returned to me, and they  ignored the instructions of the Seventh Congress of People's  Deputies, at which I had appealed on this issue.    It is an interesting fact that people who have concealed the  Navy's ills have made steady advances in the service and have  risen in the ranks in a way that even D. Yakubovskiy never  dreamed of. For example, A. Kotenko and I. Shalatonov, patrons  of the military-industrial complex and of V. Chernavin,  dilettantes who displayed no special qualities at all, made  breathtaking strides in the space of a year in terms of ranks  and posts. Furthermore, Rear Admiral I. Shalatonov, chief of  the defense, security, and internal affairs department of the  State Legal Administration under the president, is acting in an  utterly strange way, as a provocateur. He intercepted a letter I  sent to B.N. Yeltsin (the eighth to go unanswered) on problems  of the country's defense capability and safeguarding the  security of military activity! He has been beating about the  bush for a year now and, apparently, has no intention at all of  reporting it to the head of state (although he swore to do so).  Moreover, the secret document I gave to him for signing,  exposing the military-industrial mafia, has not come back.  Evidently, he has hidden it from the president, together with  other documents relating to questions of the country's defense  capability and the security of military service. The very  people who had a profound grasp of these problems, that is, Yu.  Boldyrev, V. Bakatin, and A. Alekseyev, people prepared to  expose the military-industrial mafia, were removed from their  posts.    Top Secret: From a Security Ministry (N. Golushko) report to  Russian Federation General Prosecutor V. Stepankov.    "Competent specialists note that all the evaluations made by  the Mavy, military-industrial complex, and scientists in  response to appeals to the authorities by A.P. Aleksandrov, G.M.  Yegorov, and I.B. Kolton during the 1988-1990 period, as a rule  grossly distort and frequently falsify positive results obtained  in trials and tactical exercises in the 1982-1986 period, and  are intended in the main to confirm the invalid decision made  earlier by navy Commander in Chief V. Chernavin, set out in the  1987 directive.    "At the same time, specialists believe that the results of  interdepartmental trials and tactical exercises and combat  practice makr it possible to draw the valid conclusion that  there is an urgent need to present proposals primarily for  tactical situations where their positive properties could have a  significant impact on making the combat use of the Navy more  effective.    "Specialists believe that the solution of this key naval  problem in this way would fully meet the demands of the new  defensive doctrine and conform to the principle of reasonable  defense sufficiency."    V. Chernavin, acutely aware of the impending danger, was  always able to duck responsibility and had the ability to "make  himself scarce," to use the colloquial expression.    This ability of his was strikingly manifested during the  incidents involving the loss of the nuclear-powered  missile-armed craft in 1986 and the nuclear-powered submarine  "Komsomolets" in 1989 and in the 1991 political crisis. But he  did manage to do something for himself: He organized some  jingoistic pamphlets singing his praises, and a six-part movie  is being shot in the United States on our nuclear fleet. And  who is the chief hero of it? You guessed.    The activities of V. Chernavin and his "pals" seem extremely  conservative to us: the way they seek close contacts with the  military-industrial complex and impede any positive process in  the Navy if the introduction of its results runs the risk of  dissatisfaction on the part of or loss of contacts with "useful  people" who helped them up the ladder of power. A poor outlook,  to be frank. V. Chernavin, with his talents, reminds one of the  story of General Kuropatkin, who was appointed commander in  chief of the Manchurian Army by Nicholas II. The general was  honest with the emperor, telling him that the lot had fallen  upon him precisely because Russia was so desperately short of  talented cadres.    Modern-day Admiral of the Fleet V. Chernavin is incapable of  thinking in this way. Having left the grand office of commander  in chief of the Navy, V. Chernavin is compensating for the loss  in the area of public "recognition" of his talents. He is an  honorary member of the "Sharkhan Stars" [name as transliterated]  international union of submariners in the United States and a  member of the union's journal's editorial collegium in the FRG;  he is a respected figure in the Russian Federation president's  team and in the Russian Government -- director (for the moment)  and member of the collegium of the State Maritime History and  Culture Center. He is also president of the "Okeanotekhnika"  association; he is president of the union of navy submariners;  he is a member of the board of the Naval Aviation Check  Investment Fund...    When one analyzes this story, the inevitable question  arises:  Who is calling the tune? The military-industrial mafia,  extracting credits for dangerous, third-rate projects that  reduce to naught not only the the country's defensive  capability, but its economy as well? Will our rulers heed the  people's cri de coeur on this occasion, heed the truth about the  Navy on the eve of its 300th anniversary celebrations?</p>

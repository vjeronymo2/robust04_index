			<p>Operation   Hours   <F P=102> 94FE0402C Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 26 Jan 94  p 5 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0402C </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] On 25 January the AIST announced that ``HYCOL,'' a  Japanese-made coal gasification test furnace, had reached 1,000  hours of continuous operation. HYCOL is a new furnace that the  New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization  (NEDO) set up as a part of the New Sunshine Project at the  Coal-Utilizing Hydrogen Production Research Association's  operations laboratory in Sodegaura City, Chiba Prefecture. The  furnace, which first went into operation on 14 December 1993,  attained the record 1,000 hours of continuous operation that  indicates good prospects for its practical application.    The new furnace processes 50 tons of coal per day to make  90,000 cubic meters of gas. The gas is 32% hydrogen,  59%  carbon monoxide, and 9% carbon dioxide. The gas  efficiency,  which indicates how much coal energy is taken out as gas energy,  is 75%. There are good prospects that with future  improvements  the furnace's efficiency can reach 78%.    Coal gasification furnaces, which produce fuel gas from  coal,  are attracting attention as a technology for using coal, an  abundant resource, for low-polluting, high-efficiency electric  power generation by means of fuel cells and the like. However,  long-term continuous operation of coal gasification furnaces has  been difficult because ash contained within the coal sticks to  the furnace. That weak point of coal gasification furnaces was  solved in the new furnace: the ash in the coal is turned into  glass-like molten ash (slag) that is removed from the furnace.    A coal gasification furnace produces hydrogen gas and carbon  monoxide from coal by mixing coal particles with a small amount  of oxygen and then incompletely burning that mixture to break  the carbon-hydrogen bonds and the carbon-carbon bonds that keep  coal solid. The new furnace gasifies coal at a higher rate  because of the special way the coal particles circle around the  furnace. In addition, the new furnace has a feature that was  contrived independently in Japan: burners that bring the coal  particles and oxygen into the furnace are attached to the top  and bottom of the furnace.    Coal gasification furnace technologies, such as those based  on Texaco's method, Shell's method, and Dow's method, were  developed overseas long before. In comparison, though, the AIST  thinks that the HYCOL is superior to existing technologies in  terms of gasification efficiency and the range of types of coal  that it can handle. The AIST will continue on with research to  make the furnace practical.</p>

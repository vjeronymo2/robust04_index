			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 60 handlers of Idaho-Eastern Oregon potatoes that are subject to regulation under the order, and approximately 2,000 producers in the production area. In addition, at least 75 importers of Irish potatoes are subject to import regulations and will be affected by this rule. Small agricultural service firms, which include handlers of Idaho-Eastern Oregon potatoes, have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. A majority of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. The majority of the importers of potatoes may also be classified as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule amends paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of &sect;945.341 Handling regulation of the order's rules and regulations, and is based on a unanimous recommendation made by the Idaho-Eastern Oregon Potato Committee (committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the order, at its June 7, 1994, public meeting. The committee's recommended revision is authorized pursuant to &sect;&sect;945.51 and 945.52 of the order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Quality assurance is very important to the Idaho-Eastern Oregon potato industry. Providing the public with acceptable quality produce which is appealing to the consumer on a consistent basis is necessary to maintain buyer confidence in the marketplace. The committee reports that potato size is important to buyers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For several decades, the minimum size requirement for all varieties of Idaho-Oregon potatoes, except round reds, has been 2 inches in diameter, or 4 ounces in weight. However, the committee reports that the industry has been losing its share of the potato market, because the market in recent years has been demanding potatoes larger than this minimum size. Consumers now expect some baker size potatoes in the packages they buy. In spite of an industry campaign to encourage handlers to voluntarily ship larger potatoes, a number of handlers have continued to ship potatoes that barely meet the minimum size requirement, depressing the price for other potatoes. These potatoes are generally shipped in consumer packs (e.g., 5- or 10-pound bags) or in 100-pound sacks for later repackaging into consumer packs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These shipments have resulted in disappointment by buyers and consumers in recent years, hurting the quality image of Idaho-Eastern Oregon potatoes, reducing repeat purchases and overall sales volume, and resulting in declines in prices, which has hurt the overall sales volume.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Clarke rules out bugging inquiry MR KENNETH CLARKE yesterday ridiculed Labour calls for an investigation into allegations that the security services had eavesdropped on members of the royal family. He said there was not a 'shred' of evidence to support them. The home secretary responded witheringly to demands from Mr Tony Blair for an 'urgent investigation', accusing his Labour opposite number of being a 'tabloid politician'. It was 'absolutely absurd' for MPs to be 'taking up this kind of nonsense at the behest of the tabloid newspapers'. He would investigate claims that the moon was made of green cheese if Labour could find a crumb of evidence to support that theory. Mr Blair said that either the transcripts circulating were forgeries, 'in which case there has almost certainly been a serious offence of criminal fraud', or they were genuine, 'in which case a gross intrusion of privacy by illegal means' had taken place. Cabinet ministers agreed yesterday to proceed in the next session of parliament with legislation to put MI6 on a statutory basis. Restrictions are also expected on media bugging devices and telephoto lenses and trespass on private property. But the government has not so far decided whether to bow to pressure from MPs and agree to the setting up of a special scrutiny committee for MI5 and MI6.</p>

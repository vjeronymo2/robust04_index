			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The amendment to 7 CFR part 1413 set forth in this proposed rule does not contain information collections that require clearance by the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. 35.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Comments are requested with respect to this proposed rule and such comments shall be considered in developing the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In accordance with section 107B of the 1949 Act, an ARP is required to be implemented for the 1995 wheat crop if it is determined that the total supply of wheat would otherwise be excessive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Land diversion payments also may be made to producers if needed to adjust the total national acreage of wheat to desirable goals. A paid land diversion program is not considered because, given the allowed ARP percentages, it is not needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If an ARP is announced, the reduction shall be achieved by applying a uniform percentage reduction to the acreage base for the farm. In making such a determination, the number of acres placed into the agricultural resources conservation program established under subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, must be taken into consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Producers who knowingly produce wheat in excess of the permitted acreage for the farm plus any wheat acreage planted in accordance with the flexibility provisions provided by section 504 of the 1949 Act are ineligible for loans and purchases and all payments with respect to that crop on the farm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If an ARP for the 1995 crop is in effect, the program must be announced no later than June 1, 1994. Adjustments in the announced program may be made if it is determined that there has been a significant change in the total supply of wheat since the program was first announced. These adjustments must be made no later than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> July 31, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 107B of the 1949 Act, not less than 60 days before the program is announced for a crop of wheat, proposals for public comment on various program options for the crop of wheat are required to be set forth. Each option must be accompanied by an analysis that includes the estimated planted acreage, production, domestic and export use, ending stocks, season average producer price, program participation rate, and cost to the Federal Government that would likely result from each option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining the 1995 Wheat ARP, the Secretary will choose a specific ARP percentage from within a range established by the estimated ending stocks-to-use (S/U) ratio for the 1994/95 wheat marketing year. If it is estimated that the 1994/95 S/U in percentage terms will be_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) More than 40 percent, the ARP shall not be less than 10 percent nor more than 20 percent; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Equal to or less than 40 percent, the ARP may not be more than 0 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The S/U for the 1994/95 marketing year at 24.0 percent is estimated to be well below 40 percent. Based on this estimate, the 1995 ARP may be not more than 15 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, section 1104 of the Agricultural Reconciliation Act of 1990 provides that the acreage reduction factor for the 1995 crop of wheat may not be less than 5 percent. This provision does not apply if the beginning stocks of soybeans for the 1991/92 marketing year are less than 325 million bushels or if the estimated S/U for the 1994 wheat crop is less than 34 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current estimate of soybean stocks on September 1, 1991, is 329 million bushels. The estimated S/U for the 1994/95 wheat crop is 24.0 percent. Thus, under current supply and use estimates for soybeans and wheat, the minimum 5-percent-ARP provision is not applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1995 ARP options considered are:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=2 --> Option 1. 0-percent ARP <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Option 2. 5-percent ARP <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Option 3. 10-percent ARP  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

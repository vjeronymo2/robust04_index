			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Go-ahead given for new taxes in Brazil THE Brazilian government has won its first round in the battle to introduce a long-awaited fiscal reform, with the approval by a congressional commission of a project to bring in new taxes. After a month of negotiations over a government proposal, the all-party commission finally reached consensus late on Wednesday night on introducing new taxes on financial transactions (including 0.25 per cent on all cheques), corporate assets and fuel, to raise an estimated Dollars 9.5bn (Pounds 6.3bn). They also agreed on setting up special tribunals and lifting banking secrecy for suspected tax evaders. The project allows for state companies to be declared bankrupt. The reform is crucial to help cover a Dollars 13bn hole in next year's budget and allow re-establishment of talks with the International Monetary Fund over a new accord. Tax revenues have fallen 25 per cent in real terms over the past two years and evasion this year is estimated at Dollars 35bn. The project must now go to Congress, where it needs to be approved by votes in the lower and upper houses. Mr Roberto Freire, leader of the government in Congress, said yesterday: 'The commission's approval gives us the conditions to find a consensus in Congress.' The financial markets reacted positively to the news, with the main Sao Paulo index closing 2.7 per cent higher. Meanwhile, the Brazilian Senate commission on foreign debt yesterday approved the text of a Dollars 44bn (Pounds 28.9bn) debt agreement with commercial creditors. Approval of the agreement, reached in July and finalised in September, had been held up by the ousting of President Fernando Collor and objections to the text by left-wing senators. Delays caused the price of Brazilian debt on the secondary markets to fall to less than 27 cents this week. The 27-member commission voted by an absolute majority to approve the text, although four senators recommended a delay for further studies on Brazil's capacity to pay. It goes to the plenary for approval. Senator Jose Fogaca, rapporteur of the commission, said: 'Today's vote. . is an important step towards Brazil's full re-entry into the international financial community and should encourage new flows of foreign capital.' However, a New York-based debt trader said he did not expect the price to rise much 'because of the general lack of good news out of Brazil'. There is considerable doubt over the future of the agreement. The new economic team cancelled talks with the International Monetary Fund over the Dollars 2.1bn accord signed in January, which has lapsed because of the country's failure to meet targets.</p>

This action is necessary to reduce the likelihood that one sector of the Alaska trawl fleet will preempt others for a share of the Pacific halibut bycatch limit established for vessels using trawl gear in the GOA, and provide greater opportunity to harvest available groundfish under halibut bycatch restrictions in both the GOA and BSAI fisheries. This action is intended to further the objectives of the fishery management plans for the groundfish fisheries off Alaska. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by May 31, 1994 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments may be sent to Ronald J.

The FMPs were prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). Regulations authorized under the FMP that pertain to the U.S. groundfish fisheries appear at 50 CFR parts 672 and 675.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At its September 1993 meeting, the Council requested NMFS to prepare a rulemaking that would implement several management measures that are intended to prevent some GOA trawl fisheries from taking an unnecessarily large share of the halibut bycatch limit relative to other groundfish trawl fisheries. This results in the attainment of the halibut bycatch cap before some groundfish total allowable catches (TACs) have been taken, causing a closure of trawling operations in the GOA even though the full groundfish harvest amount has not been taken in some fisheries. These measures were presented to the Council in September 1993 by GOA and BSAI trawl industry representatives as an alternative to FMP amendments under consideration by the Council that would establish a super-exclusive registration program for vessels participating in the GOA and BSAI groundfish fisheries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three measures were proposed to address the preemption of one trawl fishery sector by another:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

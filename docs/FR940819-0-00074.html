			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The definition of ``escort vessel'' has been revised in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to reflect the fact that a variety of vessel types can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perform escort services other than just the ``towing vessels''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cited in the statute. Furthermore, a vessel that may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suitable for escorting a particular tanker under certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transit conditions may not be suitable for escorting other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tankers, or even the same tanker under other conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The necessary elements of an escort vessel are that: it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dedicated exclusively to the tanker for the duration of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transit; and it is properly equipped for its intended role  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in an emergency response (pushing, towing, etc.). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second element means that it is not necessary for the escort  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessels to have duplicative capabilities. For example, one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> escorting vessel does not have to be outfitted with towing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gear if another escorting vessel is adequately outfitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``laden'' replaces the NPRM's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of ``transporting oil in bulk'' because it is more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> precise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``single hull tanker'' has been added,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> although it still maintains the same vessel applicability as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed in the NPRM: any tanker that is not double-hulled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Definitions of ``tanker owner or operator'' and ``tanker  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> master'' have been added. They distinguish a shoreside owner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or management organization (that has overall operational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control of the tanker), including a demise (bareboat)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charterer, from a tanker's master (who is the licensed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> onboard person in charge of the tanker).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NPRM's definition of ``static bollard pull'' has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deleted because it is not used in the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 4. Responsibilities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NPRM originally made the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tanker master responsible for selecting the escort vessels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Six comments were received on this issue, and all of them  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally expressed the opinion that the tanker master  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should not be responsible for selecting or deciding escort  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessel suitability. Some comments argued that the tanker  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> master may not be sufficiently familiar with the local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waters, weather conditions or other navigational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerations to select the best escort vessels; these are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some of the reasons why pilots are embarked when any vessel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enters a port. Some comments also argued that escort vessel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selections might be made by the tanker's shoreside  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management company, putting the tanker master under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerable pressure to accept whatever vessels have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dispatched.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard generally agrees that proper selection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of escort vessels requires some specialized knowledge and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pre-planning which might be beyond the abilities of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tanker master to accomplish. Such knowledge might have to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be developed from tanker-specific maneuvering and control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> studies. Also, tanker owners or operators may wish to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contractual arrangements with escort vessel operators to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure appropriate vessels are available at favorable rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the resources to conduct studies or make contractual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreements are controlled by the tanker's owners or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators (shoreside management), it is more appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that they should be ultimately responsible for the escort  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessel selection and providing the tanker master with any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specialized information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, &sect;168.10 makes the tanker owners or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators responsible for escort vessel selection and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informing the tanker master of the performance capabilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the escort vessels. The master is responsible for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating the tanker within those performance capabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations do not preclude owners or operators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from authorizing masters or other agents to make selections,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> although the tanker owners or operators will have to furnish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the necessary technical information for proper escort vessel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 5. Applicable vessels. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  OPA 90 specifically targets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> single hull tank ships of more than 5,000 gross tons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (GT) (5,000 GT corresponds to approximately 10,000 deadweight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tons (DWT), which is the tonnage measurement more commonly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied to tankers). The NPRM proposed to include tankers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with only double bottoms or double sides but exclude double  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hulled tankers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eight comments to the NPRM addressed the issue of hull  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design (i.e. single hull, double hull, double bottom, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> double sides). Most of these comments stated that double  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hulls should not be excluded from the escort requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two comments did agree with the double hull exclusion,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another comment also agreed with the double hull exclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and stated that double bottom tankers should also be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excluded. One comment suggested that the escort  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements should apply to all tankers over 5,000 GT,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (regardless of construction) and another comment suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that they should apply to all vessels carrying oil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (regardless of construction or size). One comment suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that all single-hulled oil tankers should be included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether laden or unladen. The Coast Guard is of the opinion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that Congress did not intend for tankers that meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OPA 90 double hull design requirements to be escorted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the originally-proposed hull design standard has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not been revised: double hull tankers are excluded, but all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other single hull, double bottom, and double side tankers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eleven comments addressed size limits for applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tankers, suggesting either to raise the gross tonnage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threshold (thereby excluding some tankers greater than 5,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GT) or require escorts for only those tankers carrying more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than a particular quantity of oil. One comment pointed out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that smaller tankers are less of a threat to the environment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than larger ones, and therefore should not have to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> escorted. Two of the comments support the proposed size  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. OPA 90 specifically includes tankers down to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5,000 GT; therefore, the proposed size limit has not been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four comments were received which advocated excluding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those tankers with twin screw propulsion systems, on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grounds that a simultaneous failure of both propulsion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems was unlikely. OPA 90 requires tankers that are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> double-hulled to be escorted, regardless of propulsion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, &sect;168.20 makes the regulations applicable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all U.S. and foreign-flag single hull tankers of more than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5,000 GT, including tankers with only double bottoms or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> double sides, or double hull tankers that do not meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dimensional standards of 33 CFR 157.10d (which are the OPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 90 double hull standards). The regulations do not apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tankers less than 5,000 GT or tank barges of any size.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 6. Applicable cargoes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NPRM proposed to include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``oil'' cargoes, without distinguishing between petroleum and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-petroleum (i.e., animal or vegetable) oils. Six  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments indicated that tankers carrying animal and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vegetable oils should be excluded from the escort  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. One comment went on to say that if these oils  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are included, then the ruling would have a detrimental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic impact on his small business. The issue of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring escorts for tankers carrying only animal and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vegetable oils, and other non-petroleum oils, warrants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further consideration. This will be addressed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ongoing rulemaking (CGD 91&hyph;202a) which concerns other U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waters where an escort may be required and other criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for defining the vessels that should be escorted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, &sect;168.30 of this rule applies only to petroleum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oils (MARPOL Annex I), which are listed in 46 CFR Table  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30.25&hyph;1 as pollution category I cargoes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

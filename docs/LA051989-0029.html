			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> BRADLEY'S LAWYERS FOCUS ON ROLE OF S&amp;L IN INVESTMENTS  </P> <P> As Mayor Tom Bradley's lawyers sort through his tangled financial records, they  are attempting to determine what role Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn. and its  vice chairman, Abraham Spiegel, may have played in the mayor's personal  investment activities, The Times has learned.  </P> <P> A source close to the mayor said Spiegel's office served as a conduit of  information between Bradley and one of his stockbrokers. Another source  identified the brokerage firm as Shearson Lehman Hutton.  </P> <P> As recently as January, 1987, Spiegel's office corresponded with Bradley  concerning the mayor's investment portfolio, the source close to the mayor  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suggests Possible Advice  </P> <P> This suggests that Spiegel may have provided Bradley with advice on personal  investments just as his son, Columbia Chairman Thomas Spiegel, has acknowledged  advising Assistant House Majority Leader Tony Coelho (D-Merced). Thomas Spiegel  has said he recommended and helped finance an unusual purchase for Coelho of a  $100,000 "junk bond" issued by Drexel Burnham Lambert.  </P> <P> The Beverly Hills savings and loan and its top officers are being investigated  in connection with Drexel's indicted junk bond king, Michael Milken.  </P> <P> The Times reported Thursday that records of Bradley's investments with Drexel  have been subpoenaed by the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan. The demand for  the records is believed to be part of a broader inquiry by prosecutors into  Drexel's relations with several politicians.  </P> <P> Columbia and Thomas Spiegel are under investigation by the U.S. attorney's  office in Manhattan in connection with the allegedly illegal activities of  Milken and Drexel. Thomas Spiegel said in an interview this week that he  offered investment advice to a few public officials, whom he did not name.  </P> <P> Abraham Spiegel has provided advice to at least one other Los Angeles elected  official besides Bradley. County Supervisor Mike Antonovich said he purchased  Columbia stock after it was recommended to him by Abraham Spiegel.  </P> <P> The source close to Bradley said Abraham Spiegel's office served as a conduit  to the mayor on his investment in Columbia. It is not known if other stocks  were involved.  </P> <P> The relationship between Abraham Spiegel and Bradley regarding investments is  among the subjects being reviewed by the mayor's lawyers, said Mark Fabiani,  Bradley's legal counsel at City Hall.  </P> <P> Asked specifically whether Abraham Spiegel may have passed any investment  advice onto Bradley, Fabiani said: "That's part of the information being  assembled." He would not provide any further details about how the lawyers are  piecing together the mayor's financial transactions.  </P> <P> Columbia spokeswoman Lenore Hatch said Thursday that Abraham Spiegel was out of  the country and unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> '20-Year Relationship'  </P> <P> "Abraham Spiegel has had a 20-year relationship with the mayor," Hatch said.  "We don't believe that anything inappropriate has been done. Beyond that, we  can make no comment about the relationship."  </P> <P> Steven Faigen, a Shearson spokesman, said the firm does not comment on its  customers "out of respect for people's privacy."  </P> <P> On Thursday, Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo said the council's  Governmental Operations Committee is considering expanding its review of  Bradley's financial affairs to include his relations with Drexel.  </P> <P> The committee has already held two sessions dealing with City Atty. James K.  Hahn's investigation into fees paid to Bradley by Far East National Bank and  Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn., both of which had dealings with the  city. That investigation is expected to last several months.  </P> <P> "The central question in all these matters is: Did the mayor use his capacity  as mayor to benefit himself personally?" Woo said in an interview. "The  disclosures about Drexel Burnham relate back to that central question."  </P> <P> Bradley refused Thursday to discuss his investments or the subpoena of his  records.  </P> <P> "You've known for a long time that I have not taken any questions dealing with  the inquiries that the city attorney and others are now engaged in," Bradley  told reporters after a National League of Cities meeting on gang problems.  "When that's over, I'll be glad to talk about it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> First Purchase in 1979  </P> <P> Bradley first purchased Columbia Savings stock in 1979 and then obtained more  stock in the thrift in 1984, according to his financial disclosure forms. In  1986, he reported that his investment in Columbia exceeded $100,000 in value.  After the stock market crash of October, 1987, Bradley reported in his most  recent filings that he owned between $10,000 and $100,000 of Columbia stock.  </P> <P> Bradley reports having a loan of at least $10,000 from Columbia Savings, and  his longtime special assistant, William Elkins, has reported earning more than  $10,000 annually in outside income as a Columbia director. Elkins also holds  between $10,000 and $100,000 in Columbia stock.  </P> <P> The Spiegel family, Columbia and its employees have contributed $53,130 to  Bradley's political campaigns since 1983, records show.  </P> <P> The mayor and Abraham Spiegel have enjoyed a close personal relationship since  Bradley was a city councilman in the 1960s.  </P> <P> Spiegel has been Bradley's "point man" in the Jewish community that is such an  important part of his political and fund-raising base, said one Democrat, who  is influential in Westside Jewish politics.  </P> <P> "Abe Spiegel has taken Tom Bradley by the hand to all sorts of Jewish events I  have been at," the source said.  </P> <P> Spiegel accompanied Bradley on a 1985 trade mission to Jerusalem, where Spiegel  announced a $1.5-million donation to the Yad Vashem memorial for Jewish  children killed in the holocaust. Bradley and Spiegel returned to Jerusalem in  1987 to attend the dedication ceremony of the memorial.  </P> <P> Bradley tentatively planned to join Spiegel on his current trip to Israel but  backed out "some weeks ago," said Bill Chandler, the mayor's spokesman.  Chandler said he characterized as mere speculation any suggestion that the  mayor canceled his trip because of his sudden political troubles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plays Pivotal Role  </P> <P> In 1985, Spiegel was among several influential business leaders who played a  pivotal role in persuading Bradley to reverse his opposition to Occidental  Petroleum Corp.'s plan to drill for oil off Pacific Palisades.  </P> <P> In Antonovich's case, the advice from Spiegel led the supervisor to purchase  common stock in Columbia Savings in 1985.  </P> <P> "I asked him for some good investments, and I ended up investing in Columbia,"  Antonovich said.  </P> <P> In 1982, Antonovich named Spiegel, whom he described as a longtime friend, as  his representative to the county Board of Retirement.  </P> <P> According to his statement of economic interests, Antonovich purchased between  $10,001 and $100,000 of Columbia Savings &amp; Loan stock on May 31, 1985 and  acquired more later.  </P> <P> Over the next two years, Antonovich sold his Columbia stock because the trades  turned out to be "poor long-term investments."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Frank Clifford, Cathleen Decker, Tom Furlong, Victor Merina  and Dean Murphy contributed to this story.  </P></p>

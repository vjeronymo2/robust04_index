			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / US banks win victory in fight to boost powers US BANKS yesterday won a victory in their battle to offer a broader range of financial services when the Supreme Court refused to review a key appeals court ruling allowing some banks to market insurance. The Supreme Court decided to let stand a ruling that allowed Citicorp, New York-based banking group, to continue to exploit Delaware state law by selling insurance policies through its Delaware unit. Insurance agents have been battling to close the Delaware loophole through this legal challenge and by efforts to include a ban on insurance sales in last year's banking bill. 'Obviously our legal options have now been exhausted. The only arena that is left is the legislative arena,' said Mr Bob Rusbuldt of the Independent Insurance Agents of America, which had brought the case against Citicorp. The loophole has illustrated the tug of war over the US financial services industry in recent years, as banking regulators have used state and federal law to expand the services that may be offered by banks. The 1990 state law allowed banks to enter the insurance business through locally chartered subsidiaries, an opportunity taken by Citicorp and Bankers Trust. Last year's banking legislation blocked Delaware from allowing insurance underwriting, but left open the right to sell policies. A similar loophole in federal law has been used by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to allow federally chartered banks based in towns with fewer than 5,000 inhabitants to sell insurance in their home states. The Office of Thrift Supervision, meanwhile, last month announced an expansion of the right for savings and loans institutions in its jurisdiction to open branches outside their home states - just weeks after Congress had decided against similar interstate branching powers for banks. Many bankers believe that this approach, rather than another bid for a comprehensive banking reform bill, is their best tactic for winning new privileges. Citicorp management changes, Page 17</p>

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / International Company News: Montedison's L1,679bn loss stuns investors MONTEDISON, the Italian chemicals group controlled by the troubled Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company, yesterday stunned shareholders by announcing that group losses for 1992 were L1,679bn (Dollars 1.1bn). Last night, Ferfin announced a revised group loss of L1,667bn for 1992, compared with the previously-disclosed L1,519bn deficit. The rise from Montedison's previously-announced L1,244bn loss was caused by a newly-discovered L320bn loss at a little-known subsidiary, Financing and Investments NV, controlled by the group's Montedison International Holding subsidiary. Mr Carlo Sama, the outgoing managing director, told the annual meeting it was not clear when, where or how the loss had been incurred, nor how big the final liability would be. He implied the loss, which had only just been discovered, went back some time. Price Waterhouse, Montedison's accountants, are continuing investigations. The company was unable to explain why the mysterious additional loss had resulted in different adjustments to parent company and group results. While parent company losses were revised upwards by L320bn to L724bn, group losses were raised by L435bn. The difference triggered speculation that other parts of Montedison might have been involved and the parent company figure excluded minority interests. Montedison's revised accounts also included a new L500m provision in connection with allegations against Mr Giuseppe Garofano, a former Ferruzzi and Montedison executive, in Italy's political corruption scandal. Mr Garofano disappeared earlier this year after magistrates called on him to explain a L250m donation to the Christian Democrat party. He claimed the money had been a personal contribution. Mr Sama said that although group operating earnings had improved, Montedison lost L655.9bn at parent company level in the first five months. Shareholders approved the appointment of a new, smaller board, with Mr Guido Rossi as chairman and Mr Enrico Bondi as managing director. As expected, Mr Arturo Ferruzzi, son of the late Mr Serafino Ferruzzi, the group's founder, stepped down as chairman. The new board reflected the wishes of the five Italian creditor banks which have taken effective control of the Ferruzzi empire. The Ferruzzi family retains some representation on the board, reduced to five from 22 members. Mrs Alessandra Ferruzzi, youngest of the founder's three daughters and wife of Mr Sama, has a seat, as does Mr Ariberto Mignoli, the Ferruzzis' lawyer. Mr Sama is stepping down as deputy chairman and managing director. Shares in Ferfin and Montedison were suspended yesterday pending the announcement of the revised losses.</p>

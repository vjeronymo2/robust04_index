			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> 'TIRED' BAKKERS GO TO RETREAT HOUSE  </P> <P> Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker have moved into a retreat for "tired" ministers and  will broadcast their religious television show from the 29-acre compound, the  retreat's director said today.  </P> <P> "Temporarily, they're staying with us," said Duane Starr at the Lake George  Ministries Retreat. "Three weeks, a couple weeks, a week. They're looking to  relocate. This is just short-term, in between."  </P> <P> Starr said the retreat caters to clergymen who suffer burnout and need a place  to recuperate.  </P> <P> "It's for ministers who are tired, ministers who are fatigued and need a place  to rest and relax and get away from their people just so they can get  rejuvenated," Starr said.  </P> <P> "It's not necessarily that they've been in trouble, not necessarily that they  are going to be in trouble, but that they need a place to rest."  </P></p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rises against D-Mark THE DOLLAR strengthened against the D-Mark yesterday, spurred by speculators, rumours and the increasing perception that the Federal Reserve would not cut rates, writes Peggy Hollinger. The US unit jumped almost two pfennigs against the D-Mark in the morning, before Mr Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, spoke to US bankers. Although he left his options open for a further rate reduction, Mr Greenspan said he felt existing actions would be sufficient to prompt recovery. The economic pay-off should come soon, he added. Bolstering his statement, Washington-based consultancy Johnson and Smick issued its own view that the Fed would not cut rates in the near term. The dollar closed in London up two pfennigs at DM1.5905. The DM1.59 rate was seen as a key support level. In New York it finished at DM1.5955. The dollar is expected to trade within a fairly narrow range while the market waits for the next significant economic data from the US. Retail sales for January, to be published tomorrow, are expected to be flat. Dollar sentiment was also boosted by talk that the Bank of Switzerland would not prevent a sharp fall in the Swiss franc. Although the bank denied the rumours, the damage had been done and the US currency strengthened from SFr1.4040 to close at SFr1.4240 in London. The yen weakened against the dollar in line with the D-Mark's fall. At one stage, the Japanese unit hit Y127.50 against the dollar - close to the level at which the Fed and the Bank of Japan intervened last month. But the rate fell back to Y126.85, just 15 basis points above Monday's close. It rose in New York to Y127.48. A senior trader said there had been 'good interest' in dollar for yen trade from Japanese banks. Sterling also took some heat from a stronger dollar, falling in London from Dollars 1.8260 to Dollars 1.8015. However, within the European exchange rate mechanism, the pound appeared undeterred by speculation of a rate cut in the UK. It weakened only slightly against the D-Mark, from DM2.8675 to DM2.8650. 'The powers that be would be encouraged by sterling's performance against a background of rumoured rate cuts,' said one dealer. Paradoxically, when the Bank of England signalled that it would not cut yesterday, sterling actually fell 20 to 30 points, the dealer added. Rumours were rife during the day that the Spanish and British central banks would simultaneously cut rates at some stage. The peseta's lead within the ERM is keeping sterling pressed against the limit of its allowed divergence from the central ecu rate. The pound ended at Pta 180.68/78, virtually brushing the ERM floor of Pta 180.59. Spanish inflation figures are to be published tomorrow, which could offer the opportunity of a rate cut in Spain.</p>

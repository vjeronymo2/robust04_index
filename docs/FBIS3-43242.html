			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [SAPA PR wire service issued by the African National </F> Congress]    [Text] ANC Press Statement on the Attack    on the Heidelberg Restaurant, Cape Town    The attack on innocent civilians in the crowded Heidelberg  restaurant in Cape Town must stand condemned by all who value  democracy, peace and freedom in South Africa.    The loss of innocent life in such a cold-blooded manner is a  grave indictment on our society.    Such acts of naked terrorism serve only the interests of  those who want to destabilise negotiations and prevent free and  fair elections.    As with all such attacks, whether they occur in the East  Rand  townships, in Natal or in the Cape, they must be immediately  investigated and the perpetrators brought to book.    It is regrettable that there seems to be a different  response  when such attacks occur in townships as compared with those that  occur where whites are victims. In townships, when taverns or  homes are attacked, it is attributed to "black on black"  violence or party political rivalry, and virtually dismissed as  routine. We commend the police for their high-level response to  this criminal act, and would like to see the same level and  intensity of response in the other instances of violence that  claim so many lives daily.    We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families of the  three women and a man, as yet unnamed, who lost their lives. We  wish the injured a speedy recovery.    The ANC will continue to do all in its power to bring an end  to violence.  Issued by: the Department of Information and Publicity, P.O.

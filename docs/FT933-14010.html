			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Community care system reviewed THE government's care in the community policy was failing 'only a small minority' of mentally ill patients, junior health minister Baroness Cumberlege insisted yesterday. Lord Harris of Greenwich (Lib Dem) said there had been three killings and a number of rapes, and claimed care in the community was not working. But Lady Cumberlege replied: 'In the generality of cases it is working well.' She said Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, was considering the case for new legal powers and would be announcing her conclusions in the autumn.</p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Call to remove A Shaw chairman The directors of Arthur Shaw &amp; Company, the USM-quoted builders' materials group, have received a notice convening an extraordinary general meeting to propose the removal from the board of Mr Gordon Pearson, the chairman, and the appointment of Mr Ian Tickler and Mr Donald Crammond. The notice was issued by two accounts in the name of Grange Nominees in respect of a holding of 1.17m shares, or 13.4 per cent, which the directors understand represents the Tickler family interests. Certain other shareholders are thought to have indicated their support. The combined total of all these interests represents more than 49 per cent of Shaw's equity. Talks between the directors, Mr Tickler and Granville &amp; Co, acting as adviser for the 49 per cent interest, failed to reach a negotiated settlement on the differences between the parties and the Tickler family interests declined to withdraw the notice. Shareholders will be notified of the meeting in due course.</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Alcan cut cheers aluminium market Alcan of Canada last night announced immediate cuts to its world-wide primary aluminium output totalling 156,000 tonnes. The move came ahead of meetings in Brussels next week between trade representatives from leading aluminium-producing countries who are expected to agree terms for production cuts of up to 2m a year to stem the growing oversupply of the metal. Analysts welcomed Alcan's initiative. 'This should have a very positive impact, particularly as a gesture of goodwill ahead of the Brussels' meetings,' said Mr Stewart Spector who produces the Spector Report on the aluminium industry. Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, an affiliate of the Jardine Fleming group, said: 'This is a great opening shot by the North American producers. It shows that they will not be bluffing at next week's talks. I feel we will get a resolution in Brussels.' Alcan's announcement came well after the market had closed but it pushed up the price of aluminium for delivery on the London Metal Exchange in three months, which had closed at Dollars 1,166.50 a tonne, to Dollars 1,172 in very late trading. The Brussels meetings, scheduled for next Tuesday and Wednesday but which might go on longer if necessary, will concentrate on how the cuts should be shared between Russia and the rest of the world. If no agreement is reached, US producers are likely immediately to make anti-dumping charges against the Russian industry. A sudden surge in Russian exports to the rest of the world following a collapse in domestic demand is widely blamed for the aluminium surplus which has driven down prices recently to all-time lows. Taking part in the talks with Russia will be Australia, Canada, the European Union, Norway, and the US. Last month in Washington they agreed that annual cuts of between 1.5m and 2m tonnes were needed to bring the market into balance in addition to the 1m tonnes closed by western producers last year. Mr Spector estimates that a 2m-tonne cut would bring balance in 6 months, 1m in 18 months. There is still the possibility that next week's talks might not go smoothly because the US wants Russia to take 1m tonnes of the cuts whereas the EU suggests 500,000 tonnes would be a reasonable level. If agreement can be reached, governments must then attempt to persuade their domestic producers to share the cuts. Some industry observers suggest that politicians in Moscow will have difficulty persuading smelter managers in remote parts of Russia to reduce output. Also the western governments intend to invite other leading producing regions such as Brazil, the Gulf States and Venezuela to share the pain if cuts are agreed. Monitoring and control of the production-cut scheme, which will last at least 18 months, is likely to be by the International Primary Aluminium Institute. Alcan said the latest cuts were in addition to 102,000 tonnes temporarily shut in 1991 and 1992 and would take its operating rate down to 85 per cent of capacity. Cuts would be made through potline closures, non-replacement of pot linings and amperage reductions. The biggest, of 60,000 tonnes a year, would be at its plant at Sebree, Kentucky. Others were in the UK, Brazil and Canada. About 200-300 jobs would be lost.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] France was the only European Union country at a  session of the EU Council not to support the package of  agreements reached by Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin and  Deputy Chairman of the EU Commission Leon Brittan on May 2 in  Moscow.    Deputy Head of the Russian Foreign Economic Relations  Department for Multilateral Cooperation Maksim Medvedkov told  Interfax that to adopt the package, approved by all other EU  members on May 16, would make the prospect of the Agreement on  Partnership and Cooperation between the Russian Federation and  the European Union being initialled and then signed in June or  July a reality.    The Shokhin-Brittan agreements concerned ways to settle the  two most burning issues in Russian economic relations with the  EU: the conditions for the activity of foreign banks in Russia  and trade regulations for substances used in the nuclear  industry, particularly uranium, which has become a true  stumbling block.    Medvedkov said that France was afraid that Russian uranium  exports would deliver a blow to its own nuclear fuel exports to  EU countries. He said he doubted that France had any other  reason to veto the Shokhin-Brittan deal or the signing of the  partnership and cooperation agreement itself.    He said France was simply making the latest in a series of  attempts to tailor the regulations governing uranium sales to  its own requirements but without providing so much as a hint of  an argument in defense of its position.    "France's fears are economically groundless and are more  abstract in character," Medvedkov commented. Paris was  concerned, for example, that Russia would try to inundate Europe  with its uranium at some future date and alter the existing  market. "That assumption too is unfounded, since EU restrictions  on the export of fissile substances exist, and there are other  Euroatom rules which are binding for Russia," he said.    Russia and France will discuss this complex issue and other  difficulties associated with the signing of the Agreement on  Partnership and Cooperation between Russia and the EU during the  current visit by French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe to Moscow.</p>

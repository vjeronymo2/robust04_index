			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PRO BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> CAN OREGON AFFORD TO BATTLE NBA'S NINJA LAWYERS?  </P> <P> The next crashing sound that will be heard in the Pacific Northwest will be a  bunch of lumberjacks being brought to their knees by the NBA Ninja Lawyers.  </P> <P> It will not be a pretty sight -- column after column of Ninja Lawyers filing  lawsuits that will seek more money than the Oregon state treasury will produce  in the next millennium.  </P> <P> NBA Commissioner David Stern has promised legal action that will prevent the  Oregon State Lottery from allowing betting on NBA games, and, to use a phrase  not currently popular in the NBA office, it is a safe bet the commissioner will  ask for enough money to dam the Columbia River.  </P> <P> The strategy will be so simple that it is tempting to ridicule those who have  not anticipated it, but that, of course, would be in bad taste.  </P> <P> Oregon State Lottery officials say their very popular NFL lottery has produced  $5.5 million this season with $1.9 million of that going to the very worthwhile  cause and reason for which the lottery was created -- athletic programs at  seven Oregon colleges.  </P> <P> But that is a very small return on something as radical as legalized betting.  The NBA simply will force Oregon officials into the courtroom, and legal fees  obviously will be large. At what point will the average Oregon lumberjack  figure it is not worth it to fight a legal battle that could cost more than the  $3.5 million officials project will be produced by the NBA lottery?  </P> <P> What if legal fees threaten to increase taxes? Oregon voters have been  reluctant to approve any tax increase, which is one of the reasons the lottery  exists. The original plan to aid state college athletic programs was to add a  one cent tax to beer and cigarettes, but voters rejected that proposal. Too  expensive. So the lottery was instituted. Some things are sacred in Oregon --  particular reasonably priced beer and smokes.  </P> <P> The NBA will do a lot of posturing, saying that by spending a large amount of  money, it has marketed the game and made it popular and that it is illegal for  Oregon to profit from the NBA's investment. And that may be true.  </P> <P> Oregon will counter by pointing out the NBA is not bothered by the high rollers  gambling on NBA games in Nevada, and has never instituted legal action to  prevent that type of gambling. And that is a legitimate point.  </P> <P> But the real issue of whether Oregon has a right to sponsor a lottery that  allows betting on NBA games probably will not be addressed because the simple  fact is the NBA is determined to make it unprofitable for Oregon citizens to  bet on NBA games. The Ninja Lawyers are poised, ready to attack. It will not be  a pretty sight.  </P> <P> Rocket Coach Don Chaney is not happy with Sleepy Floyd, who continues to pout  about Chaney's decision to switch him from point guard to shooting guard. Floyd  played so poorly (two of nine from the field, four points, six rebounds, four  turnovers) in the Rockets' 99-94 loss to the Nets last week there were some  suggestions in Houston that he went in the tank to make the Rockets look bad  against Net Coach Bill Fitch, who was fired by the Rockets two seasons ago.  Floyd's only comment when talking about the situation: "I'm a point guard."  </P> <P> That irritated Chaney, who said, "If you put a guy into the lineup and tell him  to play center, he should play it hard. I don't want to hear this stuff about  how you belong in another spot. This is a golden opportunity. Most guys would  love to be in a position where they can just go in and shoot the ball."  </P> <P> Chaney has made it clear that when Mitchell Wiggins, who is on the injured list  with a sprained knee ligament, returns in the next four to six weeks, Floyd  will return to backup shooting guard. The Rockets probably would be willing to  trade Floyd. But he is an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season and,  because of his poor play, his trade value is down.  </P> <P> Celtic center Robert Parish offered the first backhanded compliment Patrick  Ewing has received this season. "He's improved," Parish said. "He's got a lot  more confidence. But he's shooting every other time down the court. So of  course his numbers are going to be better."  </P> <P> It seems Parish has missed the point. Not only is Ewing shooting more, but he's  also converting 56 percent. Parish probably would like to see Eddie Lee Wilkins  shoot more often, but it doesn't seem that would be the best way for the Knicks  to win. Of course, Parish probably isn't that interested in devising a plan to  help the Knicks win.  </P> <P> Rumors have begun in Sacramento that King Coach Jerry Reynolds may be replaced.  Gregg Lukenbill, one of the owners, said that is absurd at this point. The  Kings have been battered by injuries, most notably to Pervis Ellison and Ralph  Sampson. Lukenbill said those two need to recover. "We can't even form a  judgment about what kind of team we've got until we get Ralph and Pervis back,"  Lukenbill said. "Even then, it would take 15 games or so." Fifteen games?  Reynolds has to be pleased with that overwhelming vote of confidence.  </P> <P> It has become popular for players to wear those nylon shorts under game shorts,  and, technically, the reason is the shorts keep hamstring muscles warm. But  that is not the only reason. Some players say they wear them to be fashionable.  Maverick forward Adrian Dantley says he accepts neither reason. "The only  reason guys wear them is because they have a fat butt or their thighs aren't  real toned," Dantley said. "Rick Mahorn used to wear them in Detroit because he  hoped it would compress his rear end a little. It's just like a lady wearing a  girdle."  </P></p>

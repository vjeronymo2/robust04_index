The state of emergency was initially introduced in January  1993 and covers, in particular, the Shuroabad, Pyandzh, Shaartuz  regions and the city of Khorog, the administrative centre of the  Gorno-Badakhshan region.    According to the parliamentary decree, the state of  emergency  was prolonged for the sake of "stabilisation of the political  situation in the above-mentioned areas, safety of residents  living there, as well as in connection with incessant armed  provocations on the Tajik-Afghan border".</p>

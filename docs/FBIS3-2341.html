Before this, the area had already set records for  constructing a 24-km highway within a year and two world-level  bridges within five years.    Jointly invested by Japan's Hitachi Ltd, a Shanghai company  in the sector and a Chinese investment company, the Shanghai  Hitachi Appliances Co. Ltd, aims to introduce advanced  compressors from Hitachi to give a push to the domestic industry.    According to Shen Jianfang, two modern workshops with a  total  floor space of over 10,000 sq m, have been erected in the  Jinqiao Export Processing Zone.    He said that the project is listed among the state-level  high- tech projects and is planned to be built into China's  biggest production center in the industry, with an annual  capacity of 1.4 million compressors and an output value of 1.6  billion yuan.    He attributed the high efficiency to the urgent demand on  the  domestic market. In 1992 over 1.57 million air-conditioners  were sold, while only 300,000 compressors were produced.    The project introduced highly automated equipment from  Japan,  the United States and Germany.    Tested by Japanese quality supervisors, the products have  overtaken those from its counterparts in Southeast Asian  countries which were also launched by Hitachi, Shen said.</p>

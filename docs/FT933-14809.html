			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Indians storm US factory FARMERS yesterday tore down the administrative block of the Cargill Seeds factory at Siravara in the southern Indian state of Karnataka because they believe the US multinational's operations in India are depriving them of their livelihood, Police arrested 50 activists of the powerful Karnataka Farmers' Association after they attacked the Cargill building. Mr M D Nanjundaswamy, member of the Karnataka legislative assembly and president of the association, said similar attacks would be launched on multinationals trying to patent seeds and plants used by Indians for centuries. The farmers plan to step up their campaign to protect the interests of small farmers who feel threatened by efforts to tighten patent laws in developing countries as part of a move to conclude the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Families under pressure: Italy's big companies are being forced to undergo rapid change The spectacular collapse of the Ferruzzi empire marks a turning point in the evolution of Italy's big family companies. It has turned a cruel spotlight on the running of large family groups, making them appear an endangered species. The Ferruzzi affair is a warning that, unless these large groups undergo a sea change in management attitudes and business practices, they may not survive in their present form. There are only a handful of families with companies in the big league - the Agnellis at Fiat, Pirelli, Berlusconi's Fininvest and De Benedetti's Olivetti. Arguably Ferruzzi has been the slowest to adapt to fast-changing economic conditions. Olivetti and Pirelli have been forced to restructure; Fiat is now aware of the challenges even if not the answers; Silvio Berlusconi seems ready to pull in his horns and look for outside shareholders. But the reasons for Ferruzzi's serious difficulties are not exclusive to the group, and the lessons are more general. The Ferruzzi family's fate raises questions of company size rather than the durability of Italian capitalists. It is not that Italians are poor entrepreneurs - there is a mass of literature on how small businessmen have produced and sold the right products. And Italy is home to the oldest industrial company in the world, Beretta. Just as the banks were moving in to take over Ferruzzi, Mr Guiseppe Beretta died, aged 87, heir to the small arms manufacturer which was making swords under that name when Columbus discovered America. One problem is that in the passage from small to large company the habits and mentality of running a small operation continue to be applied - paternalism, mistrust of outsiders, loyalty to family, short-term borrowing. When companies reach a certain size, some owners' ambitions seem to be influenced by an irresistible desire to imitate the Medicis or Viscontis of old. Did the Ferruzzis need to possess the most expensive basketball players in Europe? Did they need a newspaper, Rome's Il Messaggero, or a television channel. Was it necessary to spend L150bn (Pounds 66m) sponsoring a challenge in the America's Cup? On balance-sheet and business considerations, No. But, when judged against Ferruzzi's peers and public image, it was natural. The Agnellis, De Benedetti and Berlusconi all have substantial media interests. Agnelli owns Juventus football team, and Berlusconi has Milan. This suggests that a traditional part of running a big company in Italy includes the cost - and the distraction - of playing a protagonistic role in society and politics. Few are keen to risk getting on the wrong side of large companies, given their mix of political connections and media control. The result is that these companies' problems are sometimes understated or glossed over. Comment in annual reports often amounts to self-aggrandisement. A second important trap for family-run companies, as they have grown, has been their control of management. Usually, family attention to company affairs is episodic, and often distracts professional managers. The managers, in turn, often lack proper authority and are sometimes afraid to report accurately up the chain of command. Alternatively, in a group such as Fiat, top professional management has power but middle management has little delegated responsibility. When things go wrong, the corrective mechanisms are often inadequate. The Ferruzzi family, now in the second generation, had been ambivalent on whether it wanted merely to own the group or manage it as well. Mr Raul Gardini (married to one of the three Ferruzzi sisters) ran the group for 12 years and gave it its current shape; but he left in a row in 1991. The family then chose a professional manager, Mr Giuseppe Garafono (now wanted on corruption charges), later opting to run things themselves with questionable managerial back-up. The Ferruzzi family's difficulties come as both the rules of business and the climate in which it operates are changing fast. The frequently incestuous link between businessmen and politicians that ensured protection and mutual favours, and which many big private sector companies exploited, is being eroded by the wave of corruption scandals. Arguably, Ferruzzi could hush things up or avoid humiliations in the past because the politicians could be relied upon - in some instances at least - to exert the necessary pressure. It would have been unthinkable a year ago that Milan magistrates would step in and warn the stock exchange, the rescuing banks and the Ferruzzi family that they had better be on their best behaviour.</p>

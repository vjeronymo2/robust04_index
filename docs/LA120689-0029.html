			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S &amp; L, PARENT FIRM REPORTEDLY GAVE STATE GOP $95,000  </P> <P> Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan and its parent company contributed $95,000 in "soft  money" to the California Republican Party during the last election, even as the  Irvine thrift was piling up $2 billion in federally insured losses, according  to a study released Tuesday.  </P> <P> The contributions constituted an act of political bipartisanship by the parent  firm, American Continental Corp., which previously had contributed $85,000 to  the California Democratic Party in 1986 at the request of Sen. Alan Cranston  (D-Calif.).  </P> <P> Soft money is a term used to describe contributions to state and local  political activities, such as voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives,  that are not subject to the contribution limits contained in federal election  law.  </P> <P> At the time the money was contributed to the state GOP, American Continental  Chairman Charles H. Keating Jr. was battling with state and federal officials  for permission to continue the risky investment practices that eventually led  to Lincoln's collapse. The administrations in both Washington and Sacramento  are Republican.  </P> <P> An Arizona Republican, Keating has stated that he expected his political  contributions to win him influence with government policy-makers. At least  three members of Congress have returned Keating's donations since Lincoln was  seized by the federal government last April.  </P> <P> Keating's contributions to the California GOP were disclosed in a new survey of  soft-money donations in nine states by the Center for Responsive Politics.  </P> <P> The Center for Responsive Politics found that the California GOP took in $5.8  million and the state Democratic Party received $4.4 million in 1988 -- making  them the two biggest single recipients of soft money in the survey.  </P> <P> Critics contend that soft money contributions have become a back-door way for  corporations and unions to continue giving to federal campaigns after their  political action committees have already donated the maximum amounts permitted  under federal law.  </P> <P> It is not known precisely how much soft money was raised in 1988. But the  national Republican and Democratic parties estimated that they distributed more  than $40 million in soft money and the center found evidence of at least $28  million spent in nine key states in the presidential contest between George  Bush and Michael S. Dukakis.  </P> <P> While federal election laws prohibit individuals and corporate political action  committees from making contributions in excess of $2,000, the center found that  more than 100 corporations and individuals made soft-money donations in nine  key states. In California, seven people contributed at least $100,000 each, and  82 gave $20,000 or more.  </P> <P> Among the big contributors to the California GOP were Marvin Davis of Los  Angeles, head of an oil, communications and investment firm, who gave $110,000;  Atlantic Richfield, $139,500, and the William Lyon Co., an Orange County  builder in Newport Beach, $127,500.  </P> <P> "As this study shows, Keating isn't the only businessman in America wielding  influence through political contributions," said center director Ellen Miller.  "This study shows scores of other major givers -- the Keatings of tomorrow."  </P> <P> According to the study, American Continental contributed $90,000 in soft money  to the state GOP in the 1988 election cycle, all but $10,000 of it in the final  days before the November election.  </P> <P> Lincoln made a separate $5,000 donation in May, 1987, about the time that  federal regulators in San Francisco were recommending that the high-flying  thrift be seized by the government.  </P> <P> In fact, the study, which was based on state records, may underestimate the  actual amount of soft money that Keating and his affiliated companies  contributed to California Republican causes in the 1988 election cycle.  </P> <P> In recent testimony before a California Assembly committee hearing, Karl  Samuelian, Gov. George Deukmejian's fund-raiser, testified that Keating gave  $100,000 to the party's Team 100 fund in 1988.  </P> <P> Samuelian said the contributions included $75,000 by American Continental to  the California GOP, $20,000 to a fund known as the Presidential Trust and  $5,000 made at a so-called Victory '88 fund-raising event.  </P> <P> State records do not disclose whether these funds came directly from corporate  revenues or from individual donations made by employees of Keating's companies.  Although federal law prohibits direct corporate contributions to candidates,  critics have alleged that Keating paid "bonuses" to his employees from  corporate funds with the expectation they would pass the money along to  candidates for federal office.  </P> <P> A similar study of 1986 election cycle giving by the center uncovered the  $85,000 contribution that Cranston solicited from Keating for the California  Democratic Party. In addition, the senator persuaded Keating to give about  $35,000 to his 1986 reelection campaign and $850,000 to voter registration  groups supported by Cranston.  </P> <P> In a related development, the New York Times reported today that federal law  enforcement authorities are investigating the voter registration groups to  determine whether employees were instructed to register more Democrats than  Republicans. Employees for one of the groups have alleged that such  instructions were issued, a charge denied by the organization.  </P> <P> The New York Times reported that the FBI is interested in the voter  registration groups because of the large amounts of money flowing to them from  major donors, including Keating and his associates. The newspaper quoted  anonymous officials as saying that California banking regulators sent documents  to the FBI last July involving three groups.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, it was announced that the Forum Institute, one of the  Cranston-supported groups that received hundreds of thousands of dollars from  Keating, will suspend operations Jan. 1. Cruz Reynoso, a former California  Supreme Court justice and member of the institute's board, said recent  publicity had made it difficult for the group to raise money.  </P></p>

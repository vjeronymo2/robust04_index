			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava May 19 (CTK) -- The European Pact of  Stability, or the Balladur Plan, is acceptable for Slovakia in  its proposed form, Igor Liska from the Foreign Ministry told CTK  today. The acceptability of the working version of the pact was  also confirmed by Slovak Ambassador to Geneva Jan Kubis who had  led the Slovak delegation to the talks on the pact. The pact  has also been supported by Premier Jozef Moravcik during his  visit to France this week.    Kubis said that the latest version of the document ruling  out  border changes suited Slovakia. Of late voices could be heard  in Hungary urging a revision of the Slovak-Hungarian border to  the benefit of Hungary. A strong Hungarian minority lives in  southern Slovakia.    Slovakia has also welcomed the deletion of that part of the  text which bound Slovakia and Hungary to conclude an inter-state  treaty under the auspices of the European Union.    Bratislava sticks to the civic principle on ethnic  minorities, which means that it would not recognise minorities'  collective rights. Collective rights for ethnic minorities are  also rejected by most Western countries. The Czech Republic  rejects the principle as well.    Kubis said on Wednesday [18 May] that the Czech and Slovak  Republics had not coordinated their policies on the pact,  because the Czech Republic unlike Slovakia did not have any  minority problems. Kubis also pointed out Slovak diplomacy's  effort to broaden the pact's goals to embrace economic,  environmental and cross-border cooperation as well.</p>

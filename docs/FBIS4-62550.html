			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Grigoriy Arslanov and Pavel </F> Spriin]    [Text] Beijing, 14 May -- The first official visit to China  by a Russian Federation legislative body--the Russian State  Duma--is under way. Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the Russian Duma,  is heading the visit. The Russian delegation arrived in Beijing  at the invitation of the Standing Committee of the National  People's Congress. The visit is being carried out within the  framework of the accords on the development of all-round ties  between the two neighboring states--reached during the visit to  China by Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin in December  1992.    In an interview with the ITAR-TASS correspondent at Shoudu  airport, Rybkin said: "The purpose of the visit by the  delegation from the State Duma is to promote the development of  good relations at the executive level, as well as to promote  legislative authority in the two great neighbors. Everything  must be done to strengthen constructive cooperation between the  State Duma and the Federation Council of Russia and the National  People's Congress. There is enormous potential for cooperation  between the two friendly states."    The representative delegation of the State Duma will hold  talks with (?Qiao Shi), chairman of the Standing Committee of  the National People's Congress, and will familiarize itself with  the law-making work of the PRC's supreme body of state authority  in conditions of the transition to the market, while Chinese  economic reform is in progress.    It is expected that the Russian delegation, the members of  which include representatives of practically all parliamentary  factions, will be received by President Jiang Zemin and Li  (?Lanquing), deputy premier of the PRC State Council.    The delegation is scheduled to make a trip to Shanghai, as  well as to the special economic zone at Shenzhen, in southern  China. That is the site of an experimental laboratory for  Chinese reforms and the policy of openness. The itinerary  includes meetings and conversations with the heads of the  national congresses of Shanghai and Shenzhen, visits to  industrial and agricultural enterprises, trade and economic  complexes, and familiarization with the work of the local bodies  of state authority.</p>

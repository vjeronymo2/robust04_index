			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Tokyo accuses Washington of violating accord Tokyo has accused the US of violating an air accord by failing to approve a scheduled Japanese airline flight to Hawaii just two days before it was scheduled to go into operation. The US informed Japan Air Lines it was deferring its decision on whether to approve the flight from Sendai, in northeastern Japan, to Honolulu, pending aviation negotiations between the two countries. The move by the US, which came just two days before the flight was scheduled to go into operation, is 'a clear violation of the bilateral agreement,' an official at Japan's transport ministry said yesterday. A 1989 memorandum of understanding between the US and Japan gives carriers of both countries the right to fly from three regional points to destinations in each other's country. 'JAL was merely exercising its legitimate right,' the airline said. Japanese transport ministry officials said the US move stemmed from unhappiness with stalled negotiations over landing rights at Kansai International Airport near Osaka which is scheduled to open later this year. The US has demanded more landing slots at Kansai than Japan is prepared to give, while Japan has been angered by US claims that the bilateral aviation accord allows US carriers unrestricted onward flight rights from US destinations to Japan and from there to a third country. Japanese officials and airlines have claimed that US carriers were abusing their onward flight rights and taking business away from Japanese carriers. 'We intend to tell the US that its move is in breach of international rules,' a transport ministry official said yesterday. 'We find it curious that the US has linked the issue to the aviation talks which have been stalled since last August, largely as a result of US reluctance to carry on with them,' the official said.</p>

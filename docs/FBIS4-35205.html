Following the  meeting he had this to say:    [Begin recording] [Posuvalyuk] I congratulated the  Palestinians in the name of President Yeltsin on this first  fruit of the Oslo, Washington, and Cairo agreements. We highly  appreciate the policies pursued by the PLO and in particular Mr.  Yasir 'Arafat. We also highly appreciate the efforts of all  those who helped the parties take this first step. As  cosponsors of the conference, we must say that we highly  appreciate Yitzhaq Rabin government's policy that made it  possible for the Palestinians to come to Gaza and Jericho.  Russia wants the Palestinians to stick the course of the  negotiating process and band together and avert any internal  disagreements. This is their first opportunity to take  responsibility for their own affairs -- an opportunity that they  should use and then carry on with the peace process.    [Mu'addi] What kind of aid Russia may extend to the  Palestinians?    [Posuvalyuk] The aid President Yeltsin and Yasir 'Arafat  discussed in Moscow is now being considered in earnest in Moscow.    [Mu'addi] Did you pass on a message from the Syrian  president to Mr. Rabin?    [Posuvalyuk] No. I communicated a message from Yeltsin to  Mr. Rabin. [end recording]    Meanwhile, Brig. Gen. Isma'il Jabr, has said that Russia, as  cosponsor of the peace process, is continuing to support the  peace process.    [Begin Jabr recording] We thank the Russian envoy for  visiting Jericho to congratulate us on the launching of the  Palestinian national authority. We thank President Yeltsin and  all the friendly Russian people. In our meeting, both of us  expressed the hope the peace process will continue and that  Russia will lend its full support to the Palestinians and the  peace process. [end recording]</p>

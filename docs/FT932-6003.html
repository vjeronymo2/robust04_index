			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Arts Council faces criticism THE NATIONAL Heritage Department is likely this week to publish findings from a report which it is believed strongly criticises certain aspects of Arts Council activities. The report, by management consultants Price Waterhouse, will be presented to the council on Thursday. The report is believed to have considered how efficiently the Arts Council has served the 10 regional arts boards. Its grant is to be cut by Pounds 5m this year.</p>

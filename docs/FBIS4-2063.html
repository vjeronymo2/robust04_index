			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] Mainland China is spending big bucks in an attempt  to buy diplomatic recognition from countries and bribing them to  switch from Taipei to Peking [Beijing], the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs indicated in a recent report.    The ministry's report based on the mainland's diplomatic  offensive from the period September 1993 to February 1994. It  showed that Peking has written checks for a major amount of  money to tempt the ROC's [Republic of China] diplomatic allies  to switch recognition. Countries included in the list as being  targeted by the mainland were Malawi, the Central African  Republic, Haiti, (?Belize) and Niger. The mainland's money  comes in the form of low interest loans among other things.  Also, Peking is said to be using procurement strategy to gain  influence through the purchase of the countries' goods and  services toward the ROC's allies Costa Rica, Honduras, Paraguay,  and the Dominian Republic. Meanwhile, in the case of countries  which don't maintain official ties with Taipei, Peking block  them from developing friendly relations with Taiwan (?under)  unofficial relations by telling the nations to bear in mind that  there is only one China and that Peking will not tolerate such  relations with Taiwan which it considers as a renegade province.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former Ukrainian prime minister Leonid </F> Kuchma by Albert Nechiporenko; place and date not given:  "Nothing to Choose Between the Languages. Leonid Kuchma on the  Crimea Problem"]    [Text] On the eve of the presidential election in Ukraine,  former premier Leonid Kuchma's ratings are rising rapidly.  Would-be voters are attracted by his program's specific  proposals on most of the problems of concern to Ukrainian  citizens. Including his proposals on the Crimea issue.    [Nechiporenko] Leonid Danilovich, events in and around the  Crimea are threatening to scupper peace in Ukraine. What is  your opinion of the Crimean conflict?    [Kuchma] Many people are trying to present the Crimea's  desire for independence as a consequence of the activity of  pro-Russian political forces in the region. Undoubtedly, such  forces do exist there. But it is an intolerable  oversimplification to reduce everything to a question of how  much effort is put in. After all, the elections for the  president and the Crimean Supreme Council showed that most of  the population support the Crimean leadership's current policy  and its desire to solve its problems independently.    [Nechiporenko] What is the main cause of the increased  tension in the Crimea?    [Kuchma] I am profoundly convinced that the tension over the  peninsula is being fed by the general crisis in Ukraine. We  have to be self-critical enough to declare the two main factors  which are pushing the Crimea away from Ukraine:    The first is the self-destruction of the Ukrainian economy.    The second factor is the politics. If we do not accept  regional bilingualism and if we fail to halt the national  radicalization of history, art, and education, then we will have  some acute conflicts in other parts of Ukraine as well....</p>

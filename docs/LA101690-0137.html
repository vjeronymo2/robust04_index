			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VISITING BRITON PRESSES CASE FOR UNITED EUROPE;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: FORMER PRIME MINISTER EDWARD HEATH TELLS THE WORLD AFFAIRS COUNCIL  THAT COUNTRIES MUST POOL THEIR SOVEREIGNTY. HE PLANS A MISSION TO MIDDLE EAST.  </P> <P> Former British Prime Minister Edward Heath said Monday that a united Europe was  "logical and inevitable . . . the only question is when are we going to be wise  enough to do it?"  </P> <P> Heath, who served as prime minister of Great Britain from 1970 to 1974, spoke  to a gathering of the World Affairs Council of Orange County at the Richard  Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda.  </P> <P> Referring to today's world events, Heath said: "There are distractions in  China, Africa and the Middle East. . . . The main changes are taking place in  the ancient continent of Europe."  </P> <P> Earlier, Heath, 74, told reporters that he would meet with Iraqi President  Saddam Hussein when he makes a humanitarian visit to the Middle East later this  week.  </P> <P> He declined to elaborate on the Middle East crisis beyond saying that he would  hope to free the "suffering and dying" British citizens who are being held  hostage.  </P> <P> The British member of Parliament devoted the major portion of his address to  the prospects of a united Europe.  </P> <P> Heath said European countries must pool their sovereignty.  </P> <P> "Sovereignty is not something you take to the cellar and once a week you go  there with a candle to see if it's still there," Heath said. "It is there to be  used for the benefit of the people. Europe will never again be a continent of  little states fighting each other. It will be governed by supranationality."  </P> <P> Heath was taken on a brief tour of the Nixon Library. He described the facility  as "impressive," saying, "You know how to treat your presidents."  </P> <P> Apart from being an inveterate world traveler, Heath is also a champion  deep-water sailor, author and an internationally active conductor.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, Heath pursued his musical interests when he visited the  Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove. After meeting with the Rev. Robert Schuller,  Heath played the church's organ for about 15 minutes.  </P> <P> His small delegation stood at attention when he broke into "God Save the  Queen."  </P> <P> Heath promised to take up Schuller's offer to return next year and conduct a  concert with the Pacific Symphony, the Pacific Chorale and the Crystal  Cathedral Choir.  </P> <P> After leaving the Crystal Cathedral, Heath headed for Newport Beach, where he  met several Orange County yachtsmen , against whom he had competed in  international sailing events.  </P></p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Wall Street It might be a negative indicator for US equities that the advisory panel of the Wall Street Week television programme is more bullish than ever before. It certainly suggests a degree of caution about the stampede into equities since the discount rate cut on December 20. Could that simply reflect a one-off shift of funds from money market accounts? Or have investors scented the makings of robust recovery? Retail investor enthusiasm for equities in an apparently overvalued market could be interpreted as the final flowering of a bull trend that can be traced back as far as 1974. But according to Mr Bob Farrell of Merrill Lynch, there is a danger of over-simplification. Non-cyclical growth stocks like biotechnology companies do look like peaking out. In contrast, the S &amp; P capital goods index fell 12 per cent between March and mid-December. That sector is now rebounding from an oversold position. There may thus be some way further to go in cyclical stocks - though not necessarily consumer-related ones like cars - even after the general buying frenzy dies away. All of which must be encouraging for European fund managers wondering about adding to their US portfolio before the interest rate differential with Germany narrows and the dollar starts to recover. There are caveats, certainly. One is that the markets may be upset by injudicious fiscal priming in Washington. Another is that recovery may not materialise. Mr Farrell believes it will, though it may not last. The 1990s will see a much more stop-go kind of economy, he says. So investors will have to become used to trading in and out of the market.</p>

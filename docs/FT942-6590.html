			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Tough manager finds himself behind Belgian bars: Brussels is sensitive, and Paris is dismayed When Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of France's Groupe Schneider, was asked last year about the protracted dispute between his electrical engineering group and minority shareholders in two financial subsidiaries in Belgium, he dismissed the prospect of trouble. 'There should not be any unpleasant surprises,' he told Les Echos, the financial daily. After a weekend in Forest prison in Brussels, however, Mr Pineau-Valencienne may be reflecting on those words. Having travelled to Belgium last Thursday to make a statement concerning an investigation triggered by complaints filed by minority shareholders in Cofibel and Cofimines, the two subsidiaries, Mr Pineau-Valencienne found himself charged with fraud and detained in prison. The event has prompted shock and dismay in France. 'We are deeply angered,' said Schneider, which rejected the charges of forgery, use of fraudulent documents, embezzlement and breach of accounting laws. The company said that Mr Pineau-Valencienne had travelled voluntarily to Brussels and had requested a hearing concerning the investigation by Belgian magistrates. A group of leading French industrialists, including Mr Bertrand Collomb, chairman of Lafarge Coppee, and Mr Jean Gandois, head of Pechiney, placed an advertisement in the Journal du Dimanche yesterday pledging support for the Schneider chairman, while the French ambassador to Brussels, who visited Mr Pineau-Valencienne in prison, said that concern about the events had been expressed at the highest level. The reaction in France is partly a reflection of the importance of the group, one of France's 25 biggest companies, with annual sales of about FFr56bn (Pounds 6.5bn). It also reflects the prominence of Mr Pineau-Valencienne, who has forced his way to the top ranks of French industry and has been tipped as a possible successor to Mr Francois Perigot, the head of the Patronat, the French employers' federation. His journey to the top has not been smooth. Since taking the reins at Schneider in 1981, Mr Pineau-Valencienne has gained a reputation as a tough and ambitious manager, and was often at the centre of controversy. Landmarks include the liquidation in 1984 of Creusot-Loire, the group's steelmaking subsidiary, following a test of strength with the Socialist government of the time, from which Mr Pineau-Valencienne was demanding a rescue package. In 1991, Mr Pineau-Valencienne switched his focus to the US, where he launched a hostile bid for Square D, the electrical equipment group. The Dollars 2.23bn (Pounds 1.5bn) bid was the largest launched by a French company in the US. Mr Pineau-Valencienne's ultimate success in the offer, after a protracted legal battle, won him the respect of his peers. He was named businessman of the year by Nouvel Economiste, the French business magazine. The result of his efforts has been the reshaping of the disparate industrial conglomerate he inherited into one of Europe's largest electrical engineering groups. Sales have increased from FFr40bn in the year of his arrival to FFr56bn last year. Profits have also been improving, rising by 33 per cent last year to FFr405m. It is Mr Pineau-Valencienne's strategy of reorganising the group, however, which lies behind his present plight. In November 1992, Schneider launched an offer to buy out minority shareholders in Cofibel and Cofimines, two financial subsidiaries in Belgium, as part of its reorganisation. 'The structure of the company in Belgium was an unimagineable imbroglio,' said the Schneider chairman. Minority shareholders in the two subsidiaries protested against the terms of the offer. In April last year, they filed a complaint with the Belgian legal authorities, claiming that the offer undervalued their shares. They also accused Schneider of mismanagement of its Belgian subsidiaries, criticising the entry of a Swiss-registered company called Fimo into the capital of PB Finance, in which Cofibel had a stake. Reports in the Belgian press claimed that PB Finance through the Swiss company was involved in money laundering, an allegation firmly denied by Schneider. After a protracted dispute, Schneider increased its offer, and an agreement was reached with minority shareholders at the end of last year. Last September, however, in response to the complaints filed by minority shareholders, Belgian investigating magistrates opened the investigation which resulted in Friday's charges. Industry observers said the case also reflected Belgian sensitivity about the power of neighbouring French industry, particularly with respect to minority shareholders. 'There is a fear of economic imperialism,' said one analyst in Paris. He said such fears had been demonstrated in previous cases, citing the 1992 ruling by a Belgian appeal court that Accor, the French hotels group, should increase its offer for Wagons-Lits, the Franco-Belgian travel group, following a claim by Belgian investors. Schneider, however, stressed that the agreement had already been reached concerning the price. 'It is a paradox that this should happen now, after we have resolved the dispute,' said Schneider. It said that attempts were being made to secure the release of Mr Pineau-Valencienne before Wednesday's hearing and that the Belgian authorities had not clarified the reasons behind their charges. What is already clear, however, is that what started as a squabble with minority shareholders has become a great deal more troubling for Mr Pineau-Valencienne.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Tomkins' Pounds 935m bid for RHM secured after first closing date TOMKINS, the conglomerate, has secured its recommended Pounds 935m bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall, the milling, baking and grocery products company. As of the first closing date yesterday, Tomkins either owned shares or had received acceptances in respect of the ordinary offer amounting to over 50 per cent of RHM's ordinary shares. The offer was declared unconditional as to acceptances. With Barclays de Zoete Wedd still counting acceptances, it was unclear last night what proportion of shareholders had accepted the shares and cash ordinary offer, the all cash alternative or the all share alternative. Mr Greg Hutchings, Tomkins chief executive, said he was 'ecstatic' with the outcome. On Wednesday, Tomkins would go into RHM to begin the work that would repay the shareholders for their support. Tomkins is partially paying for RHM via a Pounds 653m rights issue. Shareholders last week paid the first Pounds 384m tranche.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems set out plan for Scots PR THE LIBERAL Democrats yesterday moved to distance themselves from Labour's endorsement of proportional representation for its proposed Scottish parliament, emphasising their preference for the single transferable vote form of PR, David Owen writes. The party also criticised Tory suggestions that Scotland faced a choice between the union and full-blown independence. Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat president (above, left), described the stance as 'a very reckless game'. He suggested that political expediency might have motivated Labour's plumping for the alternative member electoral system of PR. There was concern that Labour's proposals might convert a minority Scottish vote to a permanent Labour majority in Scotland, according to Mr Malcolm Bruce, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader (above, right). The party also differed from Labour in admitting there was a case for reviewing Scottish representation at Westminster 'once a Scottish parliament with the powers we want is up and running'. Under the single transferable vote, the electorate ranks candidates in order of preference - an arrangement favoured by the Liberal Democrats for putting power in the hands of voters as opposed to parties. Under the additional member format, voters cast two votes - one for an individual constituency candidate, as at present, and another for a party. Labour yesterday denied that its motives were impure, saying it preferred the additional member approach because it maintained a constituency link and 'topped up' the present first-past-the-post system.</p>

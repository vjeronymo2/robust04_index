			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Bad times for BAe shares British Aerospace has run into market turbulence over the last year. Its share price was hit last autumn, at the time when former chairman Professor Sir Roland Smith resigned. Continuing predictions by City analysts of provisions that would have to be made against the difficulties of their regional aircraft division, plus another knock from the news that Germany was withdrawing from the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) project, inflicted further damage last week. This week the share price rallied slightly in what one marketmaker described as a 'dead cat bounce'. It started the week on 243p, and ended, after plenty of fluctuation, on 246p.</p>

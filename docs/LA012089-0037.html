			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CALABASAS HOTEL, OFFICE PROJECT TURNED DOWN FOR 3RD TIME  </P> <P> Despite being scaled back by its owners, beautified by its designers and  endorsed by its harshest critics, a proposed $150-million Calabasas hotel and  office project was rebuffed again Thursday by Los Angeles County officials.  </P> <P> Planning commissioners refused for a third time to approve the 67-acre project  planned by Ahmanson Commercial Development Co. for the southeast corner of  Calabasas Road and Parkway Calabasas at the western edge of the San Fernando  Valley.  </P> <P> Commissioners said they want a guarantee that the project will be built in  manageable phases before they allow construction to begin for 12 buildings and  13 parking lots on the last major commercial site in exclusive Calabasas Park.  </P> <P> The project has the backing of the influential Calabasas Park Homeowners Assn.,  which has spent two years negotiating with Ahmanson officials over such things  as height, traffic and preservation of a hilly buffer zone between the project  and nearby homes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Traffic Issues  </P> <P> But three months ago, county planners refused to approve the project until  questions about traffic control were answered.  </P> <P> A month after that, Ahmanson officials returned with the answers about traffic  control -- but were told that commissioners considered the project ugly and  wanted it redesigned and reduced in size.  </P> <P> Ahmanson executives returned Thursday with a new, pared-down design. In it, a  proposed 13th building was dropped and nine proposed six-story buildings were  lowered to five floors each.  </P> <P> Architect William H. Fain, whose other projects include expansion of UC Irvine  and a new 6,000-acre town in Hawaii, promised that the new look would include  "view corridors" from Calabasas Road, extra landscaping and a "less formal,  softened" layout of offices around a proposed 250-room hotel.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Interchange  </P> <P> Ahmanson Vice President William Loadvine pledged that most of the project's  future traffic would be funneled to a new $10-million Parkway Calabasas-Ventura  Freeway interchange to which his firm is contributing $6 million. As a result,  Calabasas' picturesque clapboard Old Town village would remain relatively  unaffected by the project, he predicted.  </P> <P> Planning commissioners, however, said they are still uneasy over the  1.4-million-square-foot project. Although the redesign has trimmed 250,000  square feet from the original proposal, the project's huge size still would  require close coordination between the project's builders and the builders of  the new interchange, commission member Betty Fisher said.  </P> <P> Commissioner Clinton C. Ternstrom -- who previously called the project's design  "somewhat bleak" -- said Ahmanson has made an effort to improve its looks. He  said the commission's decision to delay consideration of the project until Feb.  15 "will give us an opportunity to see the dust settle."  </P> <P> Myra Turek, president of the homeowners association, said her group's support  of the project also hinges on an Ahmanson guarantee that succeeding phases of  construction will not begin if the initial phases cause traffic congestion in  the area.  </P> <P> Between now and Feb. 15, however, "we would not be opposed to them chopping off  more floors from those buildings," Turek said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Residents Moving In  </P> <P> The new delay could cause more headaches for Ahmanson. Residents have begun  moving into a newly completed subdivision of $1-million homes on a hillside  west of the project site, and newcomers are unhappy with the Ahmanson plans,  said home buyer Donna Beebe.  </P> <P> Arlene Spring -- who moved to the new Westridge tract late last year after  living for 17 years in an older Calabasas neighborhood -- said her new  neighbors are eager to preserve "the charm of old Calabasas."  </P> <P> She said her neighbors will ask next month that planners shave Ahmanson's  proposed buildings to three stories.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Bekker: "The Formula for Reform `of </F> the Soviet Academicians' Has Been Analyzed; Gaydar's Experts  Considered It Illusory, Declaratory, and Naive"]    [Text]  <H5>  Resonance </H5>   The Institute of Economics of the Transition Period (IEPP),  which is headed by Yegor Gaydar, has analyzed the joint report  of the Reform Fund that was submitted to President Yeltsin, the  government, and the Federal Assembly. The Reform Fund is  directed by Academician Stanislav Shatalin and the department of  economics of the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences]. IEPP experts  called the plans to improve the economic situation in the  country with the help of the ideas set forth in the report  "purely illusory." Specific proposals of the authors are  frequently contradictory. Thus, a gigantic increase in state  financial investments in the economy is being proposed and,  simultaneously, a significant slowing down in inflation; the  stimulation of labor activity is adjacent to progressive  taxation; the fight against monopolism is right alongside the  creation of huge concerns and financial-industrial groups.  Concerning the main postulate of the academicians about the  decisive role of the state in the transition to a market,  specialists of Mr. Gaydar's institute ascertain "a departure not  only from the level of economic science" in the period of  reform, but "even from the world outlook of the most radical  reformers of the 1960's."    IEPP experts note the outright bias of the authors of the  academic work. This is in reference to the indices of incomes  and wages in October 1993 that are compared not with October  1991, but with December, when advance compensations were paid.  If, however, the indices are compared correctly, then it turns  out that they fell not by a factor of three, but by 30 percent,  and the real incomes of the population were cut by 25 percent.    Institute critics also do not agree with the theses of the  report about the "breaking of the historically established  structure of consumption of the population" and the  "hyperintensity of the flow of the process of stratification of  society"--they are either not confirmed by statistics or they  are poorly reasoned. According to data of the Goskomstat [State  Committee for Statistics], in the last two years the share of  outlays for food in consumer expenditures did not exceed 48  percent, while the report cites 60-70 percent.    Regarding the "state regulation of the subsistence minimum"  proposed by the academicians, the IEPP experts indicate that the  question rests not on the methodology of measuring this  "minimum," but on the financial capabilities of the treasury.  But to the Gaydar experts the term "subsistence minimum" itself  "evokes unpleasant associations with the notorious `assortment  minimum' of the food stores of the epoch of the rayon  organization for trade in food products, which "they preferred  not to mention in the 10 prereform years." The idea of  progressive taxation of incomes also did not meet understanding  among Mr. Gaydar's employees, inasmuch as this would prompt  their concealment, the development of a shadow economy, and the  criminalization of life. As early as 1993, the level of  unaccounted incomes, according to Goskomstat data, amounted to  approximately 15 percent of what was officially taken into  account.    The section on regional and structural policy, in the  opinion  of the analysts of the institute, represents mainly a set of  general propositions. This conclusion of the academicians is  cited as typical: "The adoption of any kind of measures on the  federal level is expedient only in the event that the  implementation of the indicated measures can lead to a definite  load on the regional budget."    As for the structural policy that has been conducted up  until  now by the Russian Government, its shortcomings are, as the  experts think, not a defect of the approach itself, but a  consequence of the objective difficulty of changing the deformed  structure of the national economy.    The IEPP specialists also think that the proposals of the  academicians on the regulation and establishment of fixed prices  will also not stand up under criticism. The experience of  1989-1991 demonstrated that such attempts will lead "to an  intensification of imbalance in all spheres of production and  consumption." The experts are particularly put on guard by that  place in the work of the Reform Fund where the stimulating role  of price proportions and a rational correlation of prices are  proclaimed. Besides the fact that the concept of "rational" is  in principle subjective, practice in the two recent years showed  that the rates of growth of regulated prices are by no means  lower than free prices and, in fact, fixed prices were the  initial impulse for "subsequent inflationary spirals."    According to the comments of the critics, the proposal of  the  teachers of economics concerning the profitability of  enterprises reeks of the same naivete. "At first glance," the  employees of Gaydar's institute write, "the establishment of  limits on profitability should lead to an acceleration of  turnover. But it is most likely of all that enterprises will  take the tested path of escalating costs."    In the concluding part of their analysis, the IEPP experts  dwell on one of the presently most discussed questions--the  restoration of the manageability of the economy. Here they note  the main flaw, from their point of view, of the work of the  academicians--the declatoriness and lack of specific mechanisms  for the implementation of the proposals: "It is absolutely  unclear from the report where the boundary of state interference  will be placed, and how its relations will be built with the  already existing market infrastructure and administrative agents  with their already established stereotypes of market behavior  and independence."</p>

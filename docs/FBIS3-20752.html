			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article under the rubric "People": "Barbara </F> Labuda"]    [Text] The Association for Rights and Freedom, which is  chaired by Barbara Labuda, is opposed to the Sejm ratification  of the concordat [with the Vatican]. A portion of the circle  that has been, until now, well disposed toward Labuda,  criticized her for the statement that those who put the  concordat together "must have been convinced that the church is  the lord of the state." In her opinion, there is no trace of a  partnership between Poland and the Vatican in the document.    Barbara Labuda is 48 years old. She completed the Department  of Romance Philology at Wroclaw University and studied literary  history, sociology, and political science in France for three  years. After her return to Poland, she worked as an assistant at  her alma mater. In 1984, following her earlier forced dismissal  from work, she defended her doctoral dissertation. Beginning in  1976, she was active in KOR [Committee for the Defense of the  Workers], whose ideas she propagated during her stay in France.  She was the organizer of the Workers University [Wszechnica  Pracownicza] and the "Tygiel" discussion club. She also  organized the political club "Freedom, Justice, Independence."  She participated in the work of the NSZZ Solidarity Regional  Strike Committee of Lower Silesia and the TKK (Provisional  Coordinating Committee [part of the Solidarity underground])  throughout Poland. As adviser to the Lower Silesia Solidarity,  she had to go into hiding when martial law was declared. She was  arrested together with Wladyslaw Frasyniuk and was sentenced to  prison for one and a half years. After her release, she  continued to be active in the Solidarity underground. She was  one of the leaders of ROAD [Citizens Movement-Democratic Action,  founded in early 1990, forerunner to the Democratic Union (UD)].  While heading the Parliamentary Women's Group, she initiated the  resolution governing the draft referendum allowing for abortions.    Labuda is married and has one son.</p>

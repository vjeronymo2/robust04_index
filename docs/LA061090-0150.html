			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COVER STORY: VIEWERS CAN SAY SO LONG TO TV'S SUMMER DOLDRUMS  </P> <P> It wasn't long ago that summer brought the dog days of television. Viewers were  bombarded with repeat after repeat of their favorite -- and less than favorite  -- series and were force-fed an array of unsold TV series pilots and inane  comedy-variety shows.  </P> <P> But TV's summer doldrums are over. Or at least tempered, thanks to the savvy  programming of cable, PBS and the fourth network, Fox.  </P> <P> Cable has chosen the summer to offer new series, specials, documentaries and  feature films. PBS' summer schedule is its most ambitious to date and Fox hopes  to increase its ever-growing audience with new programming.  </P> <P> And what about the Big Three networks? Though viewers will be seeing a handful  of new limited series, ABC, CBS and NBC mostly will serve up their traditional  summer menu of reruns.  </P> <P> Here is a selective guide to what's new and interesting on TV this summer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CABLE  </P> <P> HBO &amp; CINEMAX  </P> <P> "We purposely planned our new series for the summer," said Chris Albrecht,  senior vice president of original programming/West Coast.

"But the issue  is, when you have marginal performers -- or shows that are not even marginal,  but failed -- you are going to have extremely low audience numbers.

"We have a lot of important new stuff which is typical of what we  have been doing the last few years. There are plenty of people around during  the summer to watch TV, and we had some slightly offbeat things like 'Alive  From Off Center' and 'P.O.V.,' which we thought might appeal to people who are  looking around in the summer. It was a perfect time to introduce them.

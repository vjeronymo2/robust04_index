			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Colombian Liberal party keeps Congress majority Colombia's voters have chosen former development minister Mr Ernesto Samper as the Liberal party candidate for the presidential election and returned a Liberal majority to Congress, writes Sarita Kendall in Bogota. However, the abstention rate in Sunday's poll, at about 70 per cent, was very high and voting was affected by the guerrilla presence in a number of areas. The former guerrilla movement, M-19, performed poorly, taking a less than 5 per cent of the vote, according to projections. Gainers included Christian movements and independents. Mr Samper said the Liberal party must head the transformation which would restore credibility to Colombian politics.</p>

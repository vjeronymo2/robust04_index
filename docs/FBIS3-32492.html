			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Caracas, 5 Feb (EFE) -- Official sources said on 5  February that the tax reform proposed by the administration of  President Rafael Caldera will include a 20-percent tax on luxury  goods.    The government is bidding to offset a drop in revenues  caused  by the planned elimination of the value-added tax (VAT) that is  levied on all consumers. President Caldera has called the VAT  "an unfair burden on the less fortunate classes."    The VAT, which went into effect in January and later was  temporarily suspended until 28 February, will continue to be  levied on importers and wholesalers. As for consumers, the VAT  will be replaced by a tax on luxury goods.    A tax of 18-20 percent will be levied on a lengthy list of  items that includes cellular telephones, television sets,  motorcycles, planes, helicopters, yachts, jewelry, thoroughbreds  and race horses, fighting bulls, and five-star hotels.    The government already approved a 10-percent reduction in  the  national budget, which according to the original draft amounts  to about 1.5 trillion bolivares (about $15.5 billion), to offset  the impact caused by the partial elimination of the VAT.    This $1.5-billion reduction would basically affect funds  earmarked for nonpriority public works. These works, however,  would not be completely halted, because a system of concessions  would be implemented to promote the direct participation of the  private sector.    If these measures do not suffice to balance fiscal accounts,  which are currently estimated to show a deficit of about 500  billion bolivares (about $5.1 billion) by year's end, the  government would consider the possibility of levying a tax on  banking operations. This tax, which was included in the early  plans by some Caldera advisers, has been postponed for now, but  governmental sources pointed out that it could be implemented by  mid-1994 if the desired results are not achieved by that time  through the initial measures.    At any rate, budget cuts, new taxes, and the partial  elimination of the VAT must all be approved by Congress, where  President Caldera lacks sound support and where it is feared  that he might find strong opposition.</p>

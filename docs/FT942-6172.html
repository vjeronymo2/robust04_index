			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Refunds to BR travellers fall 36% British Rail had to pay about Pounds 4.5m in refunds in 1993-94 under the Passenger's Charter compared with Pounds 7m in 1992-93, in spite of having to meet tougher financial targets. Under the Passenger's Charter, season ticketholders can claim refunds from BR if trains are consistently late or cancelled. BR said: 'There really are no particularly bad lines any more.' The improvement was given only a guarded welcome by the passenger watchdog body, the Central Rail Users Consultative Committee. 'BR has been doing slightly better in terms of punctuality and reliability but some trains are now timetabled to get in later and so they do not trigger the repayments,' it said.</p>

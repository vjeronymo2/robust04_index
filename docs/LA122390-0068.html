			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> CHILDREN'S PLAY, THROUGH THE AGES, SHOWS HUMAN HISTORY IN MINIATURE;  </P> <P> TOYS: THE PLAYTHINGS OF YOUTH BOTH MIRROR AND INFLUENCE PERSONALITY. SOME WHO  BECAME FAMOUS ADULTS NEVER GOT TIRED OF MAKE-BELIEVE.  </P> <P> On Christmas morning, in front of the marble fireplace in the nursery at  Blenheim Palace, 6-year-old Winston Churchill deployed his regiments across the  carpet and set up ambushes behind the chair legs, pretending to whip the French  again at Blenheim as did his famous ancestor, the Duke of Marlborough.  </P> <P> Amused at the child's concentration, his father, Lord Randolph Churchill, asked  him if he would like someday to go into the army.  </P> <P> "I thought it would be splendid to command an army, so I answered YES at once,"  Churchill later wrote in his memoirs. "The toy soldiers turned the current of  my life."  </P> <P> Wilbur and Orville Wright were in grade school in Dayton, Ohio, when an uncle  brought them a Christmas gift from Paris: a flying mechanical toy by Penaud,  the famous French toy maker. After school, the brothers began selling toys of  their own invention to earn pocket money to buy the science books that would  one day lead to flight at Kitty Hawk, N.C.  </P> <P> Young Frank Lloyd Wright erected his first building with Froebel blocks,  introduced by the German educator Friedrich Froebel, who devised the  kindergarten system of learning through play.  </P> <P> The dream world of toys is the serious business of childhood.  </P> <P> And, fortunately for today's multibillion-dollar toy industry, many adults  throughout history never put away childish things.  </P> <P> English Colonists arriving at Roanoke Island in 1585 greeted the Indians with  gifts of knives, glass marbles and dolls. William Penn, when he came to  Philadelphia in 1699, brought with him "Letitia," a doll gorgeously gowned in  velvet and brocade.  </P> <P> Paul Revere, who was a toy maker as well as a silversmith, made drums from nail  kegs and baby rattles from gourds. In addition to playing with kites, Benjamin  Franklin had a profitable sideline turning out "educational playing cards" in  his Philadelphia print shop.  </P> <P> French novelist George Sand presented 120 plays and designed all the costumes  for her puppet theater at Chateau Nohant. Joseph Haydn composed operas for  Prince Nicholas Esterhazy's toy theater. Johann Goethe, the German poet and  playwright, made all the scenery for the puppet theater he gave to his son,  August, for Christmas in 1800. English cabinetmakers Thomas Chippendale and  Thomas Sheraton fashioned elegant doll furniture.  </P> <P> It is not surprising that those who live by their imaginations cling more  steadfastly than others to the fantasies of childhood. Cervantes, Anatole  France, G. K. Chesterton and Robert Louis Stevenson were avid toy collectors.  Lewis Carroll was a steady customer at Creamer's toy shop on London's Regent  Street.  </P> <P> Toys are as old as civilization -- older, if you can envision a brontosaurus  pup playing with a stone as a kitten worries a ball of yarn. Anthropologists  assure us that cavemen played marbles-type games with nuts and dry berries.  </P> <P> Egyptians who died as children were entombed with their beloved toys. The dolls  of early Christians who died young were buried with them in the catacombs.  </P> <P> The Chinese had kites from the 3rd Century BC. In 206 BC, Gen. Han-sin sent up  a kite to gauge the distance between his camp and the palace of Emperor  Wel-Yang Kong.  </P> <P> American clipper ships brought home from China some sensational "new" toys that  were already centuries old: the yo-yo, the merry-go-round and a weighted doll  that was impossible to tip over, named "Daruma" for the monk who introduced  Buddhism to China and whose legs were said to have withered away during nine  years of contemplation.  </P> <P> From the Middle Ages down to the present German toy makers in Nuremberg,  Oberammergau, Berchtesgarden and Sonneberg excelled in imagination,  craftsmanship and merchandising skills. Peddlers with sacks on their backs  carried toys along the medieval trade routes of Europe, down the Brenner Pass  into Italy. Some were women, called "notion nannies," who offered toys along  with their regular wares of pots, pans and thread.  </P> <P> The French were famous for wind-up toys. One French doll could "write perfect  penmanship." Another played a melody on the harmonium, nodding her head as her  fingers flitted over the keys, then stood up to take a bow. Marquis de Vauban,  the French military engineer, devised for the Nuremberg toy makers an army that  could march, shoot, reload and even retreat -- all made of sterling silver.  </P> <P> Marie Antoinette, who loved and collected toys all her life, was shown a doll  in an artist's smock by Henri Jaquez Druz, whose mechanical marvels delighted  the Spanish royal family and who just missed being condemned as diabolical and  burned at the stake during the Inquisition. The artist doll proceeded to sketch  a credible likeness of the French queen as she sat for her portrait.  </P> <P> Alas, Marie Antoinette little realized then that her fate and that of her  husband, Louis XVI, would create a demand for toy guillotines. Goethe asked a  friend to bring him one from Paris.  </P> <P> Grim toys are as enduringly popular as fairy tales. Children in ages past  played with live birds on strings, kept crickets in cages and trained mice to  pull wagons. Puppet shows made ogres of dwarfs, hunchbacks and cripples. Toy  catalogues before World War I featured a music-box Titantic that played "Nearer  My God to Thee" as it sank in the bathtub.  </P> <P> "Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles" swords and nunchakus, a multimillion-dollar hit  in this year's toy market after the success of the movie, have been blamed for  rising playground violence in Australia and are banned from many classrooms.  </P> <P> Clay horses and wooden knights fueled the fervor of the 30,000 boys and girls  who followed Stephen, the French shepherd boy, on the Children's Crusade in  1212. Many lost their lives in that deadly game of trying to free the Holy Land  from the infidel.  </P> <P> War toys were part of the education of a prince. Charles V of France, also  known as Charles the Mad, received a toy cannon for Christmas in 1383. Emperor  Maximilian of the Holy Roman Empire ordered toy knights that could be dislodged  from their horses for his 10-year-old son, Ludwig. Six years later the lad was  unhorsed and killed fighting the Turks. The future Louis XIV received for  Christmas two sterling silver armies, each with a troop strength of 30  regiments of cavalry and infantry.  </P> <P> Then, as now, toy soldiers went to war with the most modern weapons. This year,  G.I. Joe is mounted on the "Hum-Vee," the new Army "jeep" widely deployed with  Operation Desert Shield in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> We think of Toyland as a fantasy world, but the most successful playthings  always reproduced reality as the child knew it. Down through the centuries,  chariots and archers, the stag hunt and farm and forest scenes gave way to  royal carriages, cowboys and Indians, horse-drawn trolleys, Model T Fords, dump  trucks, highway trailers, jet planes, rockets and space shuttles -- and now, a  laptop computer just like Dad's or Mom's.  </P> <P> Toy makers always keep up with the times. A political cartoon poking fun at  Theodore Roosevelt for sparing the life of a bear cub while on a hunting  expedition inspired the Ideal Toy Co. to ask permission to name a stuffed toy  for him. "I don't think my name is worth much to the toy bear cub business, but  you are welcome to use it," the President answered. He underestimated the  timeless appeal of the teddy bear.  </P> <P> Along with the merry melody of the cash box, the dream world of toys has  inspired countless poems, paintings, operas, ballets, plays, movies and pop  songs. Robert Louis Stevenson's nostalgic evocation of his own sickly childhood  is among the nicest:  </P> <P>  'And sometimes for an hour or so  </P> <P>  I watch my leaden soldiers go  </P> <P>  With different uniforms and drills  </P> <P>  Among the bedclothes through the hills.  </P> <P> </P></p>

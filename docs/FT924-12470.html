			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Worries over Yeltsin's path: Influence of conservative forces growing in Moscow A SENIOR Russian government official yesterday told a group of western correspondents he feared that President Boris Yeltsin was under the influence of conservative forces and was signing decrees contradicting the course of economic reform he himself had charted. The official, who is closely associated with the economic reform team brought into government a year ago by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, said at least four ministers were likely to be dropped from the cabinet in favour of conservative figures. He named Mr Andrei Nechaev, the economics minister and Mr Peter Aven, the foreign trade minister, both criticised by Mr Yeltsin in a speech to the Russian parliament two weeks ago for ineffective work. This is the second warning in the past few days issued by senior figures to foreign reporters about the growing strength of a conservative, or reactionary, movement. The first, last Friday evening, was backed by five officials of ministerial or presidential adviser rank, including Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister and Mr Anatoly Chubais, a deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation. Yesterday's warning was made on condition that the official - a deputy minister - was not personally identified. In contrast to the warnings made by the ministerial group, he claimed Mr Yeltsin was going along with pressure to change course, rather than being threatened by it. This view accords with the impression made by Mr Yeltsin in parliament, when he told the government not to rely only on its own ideas for economic reform and dwelt on the many mistakes made by it. The official pointed to Mr Yeltsin's signing yesterday of a decree creating one single joint stock company controlling all of the Russian gas industry. This corporation would, he said, exercise a more direct control over the various gas enterprises than the present state body, Gasprom. The official said the signing of the decree, which could not be confirmed by the president's office last night, ran directly counter to government policy to break the industry into three or four companies. The industry, and other sectors of the crucial energy complex, would pass to the control of industrial managers who would 'exploit the consumers who are not organised as a political force', he said. 'The President is now open to proposals of this kind. Sometimes these proposals come with threats to stop production if they are not carried through.'</p>

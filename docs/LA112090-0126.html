			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> FORECAST FOR WEATHER CLASS SUNNY  </P> <P> After peering at thermometers, a barometer and a wind gauge one recent morning,  Viejo Elementary School sixth-grader Sarah Connor looked into the sky.  </P> <P> "Those are low clouds," the 11-year-old said. "Maybe they're high clouds. I  think it's going to be sunny the rest of the day."  </P> <P> She then went into Principal Richard Campbell's office, called local radio  station KSBR-FM and, with barely a stammer, taped the noon weather report. She  even tossed in a daily weather fact: In 1939, an English rainstorm swept up  frogs from local ponds and dropped them on the town of Trowbridge.  </P> <P> Dr. George Fischbeck hardly could have done better.  </P> <P> Sarah is one of 20 Viejo sixth-graders who, as members of the school's Junior  Meteorologists Club, have been taking turns the past three weeks giving KSBR's  weekday weather reports using the school's newly purchased weather station. It  cost $6,270 and was purchased with a grant from California Education  Initiatives, a coalition of 10 California corporations that funds education  projects.  </P> <P> "The thing the kids like about this is that it is not conceptual; it's not just  reading about science in a dry school book," said teacher David Dunbeck, the  project's adviser. "It's hands-on, real-life science. The added fact that they  get to be on the radio magnifies their excitement."  </P> <P> Campbell said the idea for building the weather station, which is in a corner  of the school's playground, came last year. He said it will be used to teach  all of the school's students about meteorology.  </P> <P> "Every classroom will be getting two weeks of weather instruction," Campbell  said. "They will be learning all aspects of meteorology -- where rain comes  from, what causes the wind, how fronts develop, air pressure.  </P> <P> "Even the kindergartners will receive instruction, at their level," he said.  "Maybe they wouldn't be able to understand air pressure, but they can learn  what causes it to rain."  </P> <P> He said meteorology instruction will begin in January, after the teachers  attend a workshop.  </P> <P> Other students will then be allowed to give the weather reports, with the help  of a Junior Meteorologist.  </P> <P> Dunbeck said that while the students are learning meteorology, they will also  be learning other subjects as well.  </P> <P> "In math, they can learn charts and graphs and percentages," he said. "They  will be reading and writing reports and stories about the weather. For social  studies, they will learn about historical events that were affected by the  weather. Even in art, a teacher could bring in pictures that utilize weather.  </P> <P> "Using the weather is going to heighten their interest in a lot of areas," he  said. "In sales, they would call this a great hook."TERRY SPENCER  </P></p>

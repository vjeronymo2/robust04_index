			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Christian Democratic Assembly leader Eddy Volel,  reacting to the situation prevailing in parliament, said today  that only the president of the Republic has the right to convene  the Chamber of Deputies in extraordinary session. The  Constitution, in Article 101, does not grant the president of  the Chamber any right to convene such a session. Neither does it  authorize him to sit without recess except for emergency cases,  he stated. [passage omitted]    Furthermore, Eddy Volel says he is opposed to the  installation of Emile Jonassaint as president of the Republic  because, he says, it is as unconstitutional as it is a blatant  violation of the 16 December 1990 vote.

			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> PANEL TO STUDY PLANS FOR REDEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> The City Council unanimously voted Monday night to send redevelopment plans for  six parcels to the Planning Commission for review.  </P> <P> With the vote, the project overcame another hurdle, said May Hui, acting  director of developmental services.  </P> <P> The City Council originally established a survey area of six parcels in  October. The parcels, which total 200 acres, include the Buena Park  Mall/Handyman site on La Palma Avenue, Orange County Flood Control near Malvern  Boulevard and Dale Street; the Builder's Square site near Beach Boulevard and  Malvern Boulevard; the Buena Park Drive-In and strawberry fields near Holder  Street and Lincoln Avenue; the southeast corner of Valley View Street and  Orangethorpe Avenue, and the northwest corner of Crescent and Western avenues.  </P> <P> Although it is not known which sites eventually will be included in the final  project, the main goal of the plan is to add improvements and intensify  development at the various sites, Hui said. Some of the items being considered  include adding room for more shop space at established commercial properties  such as the Buena Park Mall and the Handyman site, as well as putting in homes  in residentially zoned areas such as the strawberry fields.  </P> <P> A final decision is not expected for some time, Hui said. "We don't know what  is eventually going to happen," she said.  </P> <P> A series of public hearings is tentatively scheduled for June. The proposal  then goes to the council for a final decision.

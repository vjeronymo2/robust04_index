			<p>BFN     [Text] Bloemfontein May 5 SAPA -- A linguist and rugby fan,  the Orange Free State's new premier Patrick "Terror" Lekota this  week launched his regional leadership with an emphasis on  economic development and racial reconciliation.    A veteran African National Congress leader who served 13  years in prison, Lekota, 45, is believed to enjoy fairly wide  acceptance among whites in the Free State, a region the ANC won  with an electoral landslide. "He is an accepted Freestater. I  think whites trust and respect him," said University of the  Orange Free State [UOFS] political science head, Prof Daan  Wessels.    Lekota tells of his hurt over the lack of understanding  between black and white, and of a deep desire for racial harmony  in the Free State, which he says is the region best suited for  reconciliation.    He speaks English, Afrikaans, Zulu, Sesotho, Tswana and  Xhosa, and wants everyone to learn each other's language to  foster mutual understanding and cross cultural bridges.    Fluent in Afrikaans, he sees "die taal" [Afrikaans] as an  important part of SA [South African] history which should not be  lost.    And he wants the provincial rugby side to win the Curry Cup  at least every five years, hoping his plans to develop the Free  State economy will keep its best players from leaving for  greener pastures. "He is a level headed guy who will be able to  attend to all the different communities in this region," said  Hennie Strydom, professor of international law at UOFS.    A white policeman saluted Lekota this week when he visited  the new provincial legislature in the historic fourth raadsaal,  and the Free State's first black leader was first to complain  about the removal of the busts of SA's former white rulers.    He is said to be embarrassed about the nickname "Terror",  which comes not from a violent past but a schoolteacher who  admired the way he terrorised the defence on the soccer field.    There is no bitterness or embarrassment about time spent in  prison, almost a third of his life, which he describes as a  duty. "I am in prison for the sake of peace for our country," he  once wrote in a letter to his daughter.    Born on 13 August 1948 on a farm near Senekal, the eldest of  seven children, the young Lekota was raised by his grandfather  before moving to Kroonstad aged 11 to join his migrant worker  parents.    He was sent by his father to a Catholic high school in  Matatiele, Transkei, later matriculating at St Francis College  in Durban where he came into contact with influential  anti-apartheid activists like the late Black Consciousness  leader Steve Biko.    He worked as a teacher and court interpreter after school to  raise money for further studies, and with help from the Catholic  Church enrolled in 1971 to study social work at the University  of the North, where he was elected to the students  representative council.    In 1972 Lekota was barred from further study following a  class boycott over the expulsion of an SA Students' Organisation  (SASO) leader, and he returned to Durban to become national  organiser of SASO.    Charged under the Terrorism Act in September 1974 for  organising pro-Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] rallies to  celebrate Mozambican independence, he was sentenced to six years  on Robben Island, his first of several spells in prison and  detention.    Like many Black Consciousness adherents, Lekota's  experiences  with ANC leaders on the island saw him shift towards  non-racialism.    He was released at the end of 1982 and the next year elected  national publicity secretary for the United Democratic Front  [UDF].    Lekota was detained in 1984 before the tricameral  parliamentary elections, which the UDF opposed, and in 1985  charged with high treason for his alleged role in civil  disturbances and rent boycotts in the Vaal Triangle.    The ensuing 42-month Delmas treason trial landed him back on  Robben Island in December 1988, but he returned triumphant a  year later after his 12-year sentence was overturned on appeal.    The unbanning of the ANC in 1990 saw Lekota appointed its  convenor for southern Natal and later that year as northern Free  State organiser.    He was elected to the ANC's National Executive Committee in  July 1991 and subsequently to its National Working Committee  where he headed the Intelligence Department, and the ANC's  elections commission from mid-1992.    Lekota married a Zulu woman, Cynthia Shange, while in  Pretoria Central Prison in 1975, and has four children ranging  from three to 19 years old.</p>

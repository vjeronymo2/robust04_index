			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / People: More team-building at Yamaichi It is no secret that Yamaichi International plans to set up as a gilt-edged market-maker once it gets the official go-ahead from the Bank of England. In the meantime, the Japanese house has been busy buying up the City's gilts talent so that it has a full team in place ready to start business once it gets the green light. The latest addition to its stable is John Shepperd (right), who has been appointed chief economist of the Japanese bank. Shepperd's move strips SG Warburg Securities of its second gilts supremo in less than six months. Earlier this year Nigel Richardson, former sidekick to Shepperd in the gilts research department of Warburgs, joined Yamaichi as head of bond research. During his ten-year stint at Warburgs, Shepperd built up a considerable reputation for himself as one of the market's key oracles. But at Yamaichi, which he joins on July 1, his brief will be wider, concentrating on G7 economies and co-ordinating international economic research. Yamaichi International lost its chief economist - Neil Mackinnon - to Citibank at the end of last year. However, it has lost no time in poaching various City gilts experts. It is understood that Jim Goodey, director of NatWest Capital Markets, will join Yamaichi on the gilts side in mid-May. Philip Tyson, a UK economist at UBS, recently joined as an international economist. Yamaichi clearly wants to move into the UK government bond market at a time when the gilt market expects to see plenty of new issuance in order to meet the PSBR. It seems likely that Yamaichi will get its authorisation from the Bank of England either this summer or autumn once its full team is in place. In the meantime it is scouting for gilt traders and salesmen.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Joao Ligio in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] Progress at the Lusaka peace talks is piecemeal and  with too many breaks. The mediator and the troika of observers  succeeded in having the two sides agreeing to four of the five  [as heard] points of the second document under discussion. The  four points are: general principles on political tolerance,  nondiscriminatory coexistence of all ethnic groups, the  involvement of all Angolans in the process of national  reconciliation regardless of their political, ethnic, and  religious origin, and the adoption by the news media of a  behavior that conforms with patriotism and a unitary state.    This afternoon's plenary session was scheduled to deal with  the only outstanding issue, but it was replaced by separate  consultations because the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola introduced a proposal that the government  delegation rejected outright.</p>

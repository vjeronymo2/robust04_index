			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Akzo Respectable full-year figures from Akzo should not lull the market into a false sense of security. By the time ICI, DSM and the three German chemicals giants have reported, the small rise in profits and maintained dividend is likely to stand out from a miserable crowd. Akzo owes its resilience to a solid pharmaceuticals business, minimal exposure to overcrowded petrochemicals and a more urgent approach to rationalisation than most European rivals. Yet since operating profits were 14 per cent ahead in the first half of the year, the slide in the second half was severe. That does not bode well for the rest of the sector. Neither can Akzo afford to rest on its laurels. European chemicals companies already face high costs compared to their US competition. A stronger dollar may mask the difference, but there is no escaping the long-term need to improve productivity. Equally, the devaluation of sterling, the peseta and the lira places Akzo at a disadvantage in Europe. That will be particularly painful in fibres, the weak link in an otherwise well-balanced portfolio. Having cut the dividend two years ago, Akzo looks something of a safe haven. Given the dire trading outlook, dividend cuts elsewhere should come as no surprise. But the suspicion remains that this prospect is nowhere near priced into the market.</p>

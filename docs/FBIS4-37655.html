			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, June 23, INA -- AL-THAWRAH newspaper of  Baghdad said the natural state that realizes peace and security  to Iraqi Kurds is the state that rejects concepts of the  traitors and agents and commits to Iraq's integrity.    A paper article here today said that events taking place in  north Iraq scoff at the reported cessation of fighting between  the cliques of Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal Talabani. The paper  referred to the ongoing operations of kidnapping, physical  liquidation and the state of panic and fear that had motivated  Kurdish families to evict their homes and villages.    The paper said the tragedy of Kurds in the north where  cliques of Barzani and Talabani were fighting each other, would  continue in their presence, bringing further daily bitter  tortures and catastrophes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, 23 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- An  authoritative Beijing source disclosed that, accompanied by  Central Military Commission Vice Chairman Liu Huaqing, Deng  Xiaoping toured Qingdao, Shandong recently and talked about  three fundamental issues concerning the development of the state.    Deng Xiaoping pointed out that first, except when an  inevitable large-scale war breaks out, the principle of taking  economic development as the center must never change, the policy  of reform and opening up must never change, and the party's  basic line must remain unshakable for 100 years to come.    Second, it is necessary to sum up the lesson of the former  Soviet Union and it is necessary to properly handle the  relationship between the center and the localities.    Third, it is necessary to stick to the CPC's leadership and  the CPC's ruling status must never be shaken. China must not  pursue a multiparty system.    A report carried in Hong Kong WEN WEI PO today said that  Deng  Xiaoping has requested party and government cadres to take note  of upholding these three issues, which have already been relayed  to central high-ranking personalities.</p>

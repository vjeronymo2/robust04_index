			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Briefcase, Q &amp; A: Do pre-nuptial pacts work? YOU SUGGESTED (Briefcase, January 9) that a correspondent would be advised to draw up an agreement defining respective financial rights in a marriage should anything go wrong. I was under the impression that such 'pre-nuptial' agreements (as they are called in the US) are not enforceable in the UK and, while there is nothing illegal about them, they are simply of no use if either party wishes to contest matters. I would appreciate your confirmation that such agreements do, in fact, work. You also say they cannot cover the rights of children. If the answer to my general question is 'yes,' does this mean that any such agreement could still be valid as to financial arrangements between parents, with separate ones having to be made for the children when a marriage dissolves? Or does the mere presence of children invalidate the entire matter? We concur that agreements entered into by the parties before, or during, a marriage are not enforceable in such a way as to oust the jurisdiction of the court to make a property adjustment order on divorce; indeed, the court can set aside any actual disposal under an avoidance of disposal order. However, there is still a purpose in entering into a contract such as we suggested because it is evidence of what the parties wanted to happen, and of their having addressed their minds to the question, at a time when their attitudes were not affected by the matters which will have led to the divorce. It is also not necessarily the case that the court will interfere with the parties' prior arrangements. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Observer: Santer's old boys Securing the presidency of the European Commission was the least of Jacques Santer's problems. Far from being able to craft a fresh team, he looks set to inherit a lot of familiar faces - quite apart from the ticklish matter of adjudicating between member states with some firm ideas regarding the remaining slots to be filled. As many as eight Commissioners could be staying on, some pressing for bigger and better jobs. These would include Manuel Marin, the Spaniard in charge of development policy, and Henning Christophersen, who handles economic and monetary policy. Having been in situ since 1985 and 1986 respectively, they seem to be becoming more-or-less permanent fixtures, alongside German industry commissioner Martin Bangemann. Others likely to remain in town for the new five-year term include Karel Van Miert, in charge of competition policy, Joao Deus de Pinheiro, the laid-back Portuguese commissioner in charge of audiovisual and information policy and Marcelino Oreja, the Spaniard who has just arrived to take over energy and transport. Then of course there is the plum job of chief EU trade negotiator, currently inhabited by Sir Leon Brittan. He must fight the French, who want him out. But, if he hangs on successfully, France would demand the competition or industry portfolios as recompense. EU enlargement complicates the new man's job still further. If all goes to plan, the Santer Commission would increase from 17 to 21 members, but Norway and Sweden only hold their referendums in November, while Santer is supposed to present his team to parliament for vetting in October. If he misses this date, he will hand the newly-emboldened MEPs just the opportunity they need to wade in with their own opinions.</p>

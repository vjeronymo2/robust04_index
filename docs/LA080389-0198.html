			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY HOLDING SEATTLE TEEN, 2 OTHERS IN MOTHER'S DEATH  </P> <P> A 15-year-old Seattle boy who turned himself in to Garden Grove police is one  of three youths suspected in the stabbing death of his mother, Seattle  detectives said today.  </P> <P> Dan Donohoe, a spokesman for the King County prosecutor's office, said the boy  left Seattle after his mother was found dead in her apartment July 26. The  woman, Ange May Reed, had been stabbed in the face and the neck.  </P> <P> The boy called Garden Grove police from a telephone booth at Bolsa Grande High  School about 8:15 p.m. Wednesday and later was arrested, Garden Grove Lt. John  Wood said.  </P> <P> The youth was taken to Orange County Juvenile Hall in Orange, where Seattle  detectives were to pick him up today to face first-degree murder charges in  Seattle, Seattle police spokesman Don Church said.  </P> <P> Donohoe said the boy discussed killing his mother with two friends, one of whom  later carried out the stabbing. Donohoe said the other youth, a juvenile, is  also wanted on suspicion of first-degree murder.  </P> <P> Donohoe said all three of the youths are members of a Seattle-area gang and  fled Washington for California after Reed's death. Seattle police apparently  knew that the boy was heading to Orange County and issued a bulletin alerting  Orange County authorities, Garden Grove Police Lt. Chuck Gibbs said.  </P></p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Japan's industrial production rises by 4.6% in September JAPAN'S industrial production rose 4.6 per cent in September, compared with a month earlier, but Mr Tsutomu Hata, the minister of finance, warned that an expected economic recovery would not be seen until at least early next year. The increase in the seasonally adjusted industrial production index followed a 4.2 per cent fall in August. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) said that the increase last month suggested that the reduction of inventories was nearing completion. However, Miti forecast that industrial production would fall by 2.4 per cent in October and a further 1 per cent in November. The producers' shipment index rose 4.8 per cent in September, reflecting the production increase, while the inventory of finished goods index was down 1.2 per cent cent. Mr Hata said that opposition parties had shown support for an emergency economic package announced in late August, and were not likely to delay the measures at a parliamentary session beginning this week. Japanese executives are concerned that the package will be derailed by debate on the scandals afflicting the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The minister said a decline in personal consumption had caused concern in the government, and Miti figures released yesterday for large retailer sales showed a 2.9 per cent fall in September, compared with a year earlier. Miti said department store sales declined for the seventh consecutive month, while sales at supermakets were lower for the second month in a row. Discussion of the trends in personal consumption also dominated a quarterly gathering of Bank of Japan regional managers, most of whom reported that local residents were buying cheaper goods and delaying large purchases. The three-day meeting, which began yesterday, will be used as an important guide by the bank on the direction of monetary policy.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mile Akmadzic, Herceg-Bosna foreign </F> minister, minister of interrepublican cooperation, and head of  the Bosnian Croat delegation at the Geneva negotiations, by  unidentified correspondent in Geneva on 20 January; from the  "Picture vs Picture" program -- live or recorded]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Dear viewers, our guest this  evening is Mile Akmadzic, minister for interrepublican  cooperation and foreign minister of the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna. Good evening and welcome to our studio from  Geneva.    [Akmadzic] Good evening. Thank you.    [Correspondent] We can say that you were the head of the  Bosnian Croat delegation at the latest round of Geneva  negotiations. In the shade of, let me say, the big signature  between Zagreb and Belgrade yesterday, a slightly smaller, but  no less important signature appeared between Pale [the power  center of the Serb Republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina], so to say,  and Mostar, seeing that offices, that is, representatives'  offices will be opened in those towns by 15 February 1994.  Could you describe that agreement, and what does the phrase  that there are no controversial issues that cannot be solved  through negotiations means? What are these controversial issues?    [Akmadzic] You see, first of all, we are taking into account  the current state of negotiations on the future set-up of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the need for a comprehensive peace in the  region. We are aware of the fact that Europe wants peace, Europe  insists on peace. The EU has sent us a memo, a demarche in  which it demands and claims that after long negotiations the  time has come to reach an agreement on peace. Both the Serb  delegation and us are aware of that, and -- I am speaking about  the Serbs and Croats in Bosnia- Herzegovina -- we held talks and  concluded that it would be good to establish that we favor a  permanent peace and that we are aware of the fact that, at the  moment, our disputes are of such a nature that they do not go  beyond the level that could not be solved by peaceful means.  Therefore, we are in favor of talks, of a solution to all  problems by peaceful means between the two of us, and for a  solution to all problems by peaceful means with the third side,  that is the Bosniak Muslims or the Muslims as they are referred  to in documents.    [Correspondent] Let us still stay on the agreement between  Croats and Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina. What are the disputed  areas? Are they Kupres, Jajce, Posavina? Could you perhaps  mention some other ones in addition to these?    [Akmadzic] I would like to say that the basic thing that we  have not agreed upon yet refers to Posavina [the basin of the  river Sava in Bosnia]. Namely, in our earlier talks, in earlier  conclusions, especially during the talks on the [aircraft  carrier] Invincible and before that, the map that was offered  was not satisfactory for the Croats from Bosnia-Herzegovina. We  put forward new demands in that respect. The Serb side accepted  to discuss our demands and make some concessions. We have not  yet defined how many and what concessions, but we said that they  would be about two percent of the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina in northern Bosnia. [sentence as heard]  Therefore, in that respect, we have reached an agreement in  principle, but we have not yet agreed where exactly the line of  separation would be.    [Correspondent] Talking about Bosnian Posavina, what would  be  the fate of the Serb corridor [between Serbia proper and the  Serb-held areas in western Bosnia and Croatia] in your solution?  Will it be cut? How would Muslim demands for access to the  river Sava fit into that solution?    [Akmadzic] You see, the Muslims have demanded and have now  particularly stressed -- among the disputed towns that they  stress normally as disputed towns between them and Croats on the  one hand and them and Serbs on the other -- Brcko. Therefore,  in that respect, the Serb corridor would have to be cut in that  area, unless the problem is solved in a way satisfactory for  both sides -- the Serb and the Muslim sides, and the Croat side  too; unless it is solved by some technical means -- the earlier  mentioned overpasses and underpasses and such elements that  would enable both sides to have free access. I must say that  this issue has not yet been solved, but I think that, as far as  the Serb side is concerned, they will definitely have free  passage toward, let us say, east [Serbia proper].    [Correspondent] That means that this Croat demand for 2  percent would not threaten the corridor.    [Akmadzic] It need not threaten the corridor. We are not  talking about sovereignty here but about the freedom of passage.  In any case, they will be able to pass through there unhindered.    [Correspondent] Let us remain on the subject of Bosnian  Posavina, an interesting subject because two members of the  Bosnian Posavina assembly were present in Geneva -- Kovacevic  and Stanic -- they took part in the talks as members of the  Sarajevo authorities' delegation. How did this happen and why  did they not attend as members of the Croat delegation?    [Akmadzic] You see, the assembly of the Croat Republic of  Herzeg-Bosna, or to be more precise, the house of deputies of  the Croat Republic of Herzeg-Bosna declared this assembly held  in Bosanska Posavina illegitimate, illegal. However, we are not  bent on aggravating the situation in this case. Two people --  Ivko Stanic and Ante Kovacevic -- showed up in Geneva as the  representatives of the Bosnian Posavina Croats. This is the  second time they were there [in Geneva]. Only now they said  they were also the representatives of the Croats from central  Bosnia in line with a decision made by another assembly....    [Correspondent, interrupting] Which you had attended.    [Akmadzic] Yes, but this assembly did not reach any  decisions  to send them there.    [Correspondent] What was decided?    [Akmadzic] It was verbally concluded at this assembly -- I  am not familiar with the procedure governing written conclusions  -- that two people should go with me to Geneva because it was  already known at that time that I would be a member of the  Bosnian Croat delegation. This was not a matter of dispute. We  brought this up in our talks with the co-chairmen, especially  after these two people -- Stanic and Kovacevic -- held a news  conference in Geneva. The co-chairmen explained that they were  members of the Muslim delegation -- I am using the terminology  they used -- therefore, they were in Geneva as members of the  Muslim, or Bosniak- Muslim, delegation. All I can say is that  such conduct is very damaging to our negotiating position, that  it has an adverse effect on the atmosphere of goodwill. This  especially applies to some of their stands on our legitimacy.  Our delegation in Geneva certainly was legitimate, it was  appointed in a legitimate way, it was approved by the House of  Deputies. Sadly, the fact remains that the Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina became divided over this whole negotiating  process.    [Akmadzic] Let us be precise. I would not call it a  division. These assemblies were also not held in this way,  especially the central-Bosnian one, which I attended. I  attended it precisely because I wanted to see what was happening  and to contact these people. It is, I would say, a meeting of  Croats, not just from central Bosnia but also from other places.  For instance, there were people from Livno, Jajce, from  northern Bosnia who do not belong in central Bosnia. As for  Sarajevo, according to our Bosnia- Herzegovina terminology, it  is questionable whether it is in central Bosnia. We know that  central Bosnia includes the municipalities of Kiseljak, Kresevo,  Busovaca, Vitez, Kakanj, Vares, etc. I think that there is no  rift among the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We are united, we  have a unified stand. These people are living in Zagreb, they  all met, in this sense it is not a bad idea. It is good that  they met to examine the political situation and offer to help as  much as they can. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] In how many places in Bosnia-Herzegovina are  the units of HVO [Croatian Defense Council] and the B-H Army  cooperating.    [Akmadzic] It is difficult to say. In some places they are  cooperating of their own free will and in many places not at  all. For instance, one HVO brigade in Sarajevo -- Kralj Tvrtko  -- was forced to join the B-H Army's 1st Corps without our  permission and without any consultations with us. This brigade  is now still acting under the same name -- Kralj Tvrtko -- but  is under the direct command of the B-H Army's First Corps. This  is contrary to our relations and our earlier agreements.    [Correspondent] Let us now hear Muslim reactions to  yesterday's two agreements. We have Ejup Ganic's statement for  CNN -- which refers to the Zagreb-Belgrade agreement. [passage  omitted]    [Correspondent] We heard Ejup Ganic's statement -- the first  reaction from....[pauses] I would say it is much stronger than  the one by Alija Izetbegovic who was in a way more reserved and  who welcomed the agreement [word indistinct] not to the  detriment of the third party. Have these two agreements really  succeeded in pursuing the idea on the division of Bosnia and in  forcing the Muslims to end the fighting?    [Akmadzic] Let me just confirm what you said. Ganic has  lately been making statements which, I think, may not be  completely in line with what Izetbegovic or Haris Silajdzic have  been saying.    [Correspondent] Which can be part of the strategy?    [Akmadzic] Which can, of course, be part of the strategy. In  any case, I must say that -- as far as the Croat side is  concerned -- there is no division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Until  now, especially during the war, Croats were the ones who most  strongly advocated [a single] Bosnia-Herzegovina, but we think  that Bosnia- Herzegovina can only be what it can be at a given  moment. A union of B-H republics is presently being considered.  You know very well, and all viewers and the general public  know, that we supported the Vance-Owen plan that was against the  division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. At one point there was  discussion of a federation, etc. At present it is a question of  the union of B-H republics -- this is still Bosnia-Herzegovina.  We are supporting this. Not to support this at the present  time -- as Ganic thinks -- would mean a division of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, a disintegration of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We  will do everything in our power to ensure that  Bosnia-Herzegovina remains to exist in whatever form it can.    [Correspondent] Another interesting piece of information  appeared in our press today: That Muslims have been buying  weapons and ammunition from the Serbs for gas-dollars from  Islamic countries. Do you have any information on this?    [Akmadzic] Of course we do not have any concrete data, but  there have been various reports about this. It is a fact that  the Muslim side -- this is what we are called in the  negotiations, the Muslim, Croat, and Serb side -- does not have  any special financial difficulties. They openly say it  themselves. They get aid from Islamic countries. We also know  that the Islamic conference's contact group, that is its core,  has frequent sessions, and that they provide very significant  aid for the Bosniak-Muslim side. We do not know exactly which  countries provide the aid, but it is certain....    [Correspondent, interrupting] A more interesting question  is:  Do they buy weapons from the Serbs?    [Akmadzic] I believe that they buy weapons from the Serbs,  not officially, but we know that various channels and various  interests operate there and they certainly buy weapons from the  Serbs.    [Correspondent] Do such things happen between the Croats and  Serbs?    [Akmadzic] According to our official policy -- of course it  does not, for our interests as regards this are not convergent.  The Muslim and Serb interests are not convergent either. It is  possible that unofficial channels exist. It is, however,  certain that such things do not happen officially.    [Correspondent] In the end -- an important issue: The  international community has increasingly often indicated a  possible withdrawal of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] units,  primarily British and French, from Bosnia-Herzegovina this  spring. What would this mean for Bosnia-Herzegovina and  particularly for the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Akmadzic] We have been openly told in Geneva by the  cochairmen that, if the negotiations were to continue in this  manner, with very poor results or with hardly any result at all,  the war could then last for a long time, until the complete  exhaustion of all the sides in the conflict, until peace is  reached in such a way. It is possible that the international  community is considering the withdrawal of its forces in order  to reach that level of exhaustion as soon as possible. Nothing  has been said or indicated to us as regards this. I believe, if  the talks continue to yield no success, that this [the  withdrawal] can happen and that they will let the war go on  until total exhaustion.    [Correspondent] In that case, what would the fighting be  like, all against all, or some against some? Yesterday, we had  a report by Sky TV that speculates that, in case of the  withdrawal and even if they do not withdraw, the Serb and Croat  units would openly militarily cooperate and fight the Muslims.    [Akmadzic] I would not speak about that, but I would stress  that the Croat side is ready to sign peace with both other  sides, and that we want peace. The war in Bosnia-Herzegovina is  completely contrary to the interests of the Croat people, except  when it is being fought solely to defend it's rights, the right  to equality, the right to Bosnia-Herzegovina, of course together  with the other two peoples. In that case we will defend  ourselves, but we are against resolving problems in  Bosnia-Herzegovina by fighting. You know that at the beginning  of the war we were the first to organize ourself for the defense  of Bosnia-Herzegovina. All of the recent criticism of us is  without any foundation. We will protect our interests, but we  will fight for peace.</p>

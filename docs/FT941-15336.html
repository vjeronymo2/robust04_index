			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Pearson sells more Camco shares Pearson, the UK media group which owns the Financial Times, yesterday realised a further Pounds 8.5m through the disposal of further shares in Camco International, the Houston-based oil services company. Last month Pearson raised Pounds 200m from the flotation on the New York Stock Exchange of 55 per cent of Camco, then a wholly owned subsidiary. The underwriters had a 30-day option to buy a further 8.25 per cent of Camco on the same terms as for the initial offering. Yesterday the options were exercised on 900,000 shares. Pearson now holds a minority interest of 41.4 per cent, which it intends to retain for a limited period.</p>

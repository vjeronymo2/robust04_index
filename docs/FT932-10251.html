			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Letter: The pricing of CDs in the US and the UK Sir, Your editorial 'Bulky prices for compact discs' (May 4) contains a number of factual inaccuracies concerning the pricing of CDs in the US and UK. In this, sadly, it is characteristic of the entire debate around the value of music that has been conducted in the wake of the select committee on national heritage. You assert that prices in Europe are about 40 per cent higher than in North America. Top line CDs commonly retail in the US at Dollars 14.99, and in the UK at Pounds 11.99. Commentators typically fail to allow for the presence of VAT in the UK figure and the exclusion of sales tax in the US, 12 per cent currently in New York state. Even at these prices (many CDs in Britain are priced at Pounds 9.99) the price differential between the US and UK works out at approximately 11 per cent, not 40 per cent. You write that the industry's argument that the cost of supplying CDs in the UK is higher than in the US 'does not ring true'. However, the economies of scale in North America mean that virtually all consumer goods are cheaper in the US because their distribution costs and their development costs can be spread over a market five times the size of the UK. Clothes, food, cars, petrol, cosmetics and books all fall into this category. It costs EMI two-thirds less to manufacture CDs in the US than in the UK precisely because of these volume efficiencies. Moreover, the largest retailing chains in the US maintain a smaller market share than do the largest retailers in Europe. In the UK, the WH Smith Group, Woolworth and HMV combined have a market share of well over 50 per cent. By comparison, the top 10 music retailers in the US have only a 32 per cent market share. As a result, US music retailers' gross margins average around 24 per cent as against a UK figure of 33 per cent. You criticise copyright law for maintaining 'wide differentials in wholesale prices between the US and the UK which are then reflected in retail prices'. The wholesale price differentials are small, and are augmented (rather than reflected) at retail because of larger retail margins in the UK. The right granted to copyright owners to restrict parallel imports is only one of the vital rights granted by UK legislation. It is not a right granted to record companies alone, but also protects artists, composers and music publishers within the music industry, and extends to protect rights owners in other businesses such as book publishing, computer software and pharmaceuticals. All of these businesses invest in the UK and need to secure a return on that investment from UK sales. The desirability of this right in encouraging creativity and risk-taking is recognised not only in the UK but also in many other countries including the USA, Canada and Germany. The Australian authorities, which last year recommended the withdrawal of the parallel importation right in 1994, are now reconsidering their position because recent exchange rate charges have eroded the price differential between Australian records and those in certain foreign markets. Exchange rate fluctuations, resulting from government actions and the machinations of the money markets, are perhaps the key determinants of relative prices. Profit is not a dirty word; the Pounds 2 off the price of CDs advocated by WH Smith would certainly make it a rare one. The last comprehensive survey of the UK record industry was carried out by Coopers &amp; Lybrand and covered 1990. It showed that the average return on sales of British record companies, big and small, was approximately 5 per cent. Acting upon WH Smith's recommendations would plunge most of these record businesses into loss at a stroke, at no cost to WH Smith and its fellow retailers who would retain their margins and expect higher volume. Consumers will not, even in the medium term, benefit from such action. Through the continual pursuing of a policy of price reductions, the American record industry typically operates on wafer-thin margins. The consumer in America has predictably suffered as cost pressures have forced the American industry to reduce their investment in artists and in genres of music. Attempting to understand the complexities of the British record industry and its value to our cultural life and economy has not been placed at a premium throughout this current debate on CD pricing. Let us hope that the select committee and the Office of Fair Trading will study the facts before the rhetoric. I am mindful of the prime minister's recent exhortations to business people, when he urged them 'to keep on exporting and we'll keep on supporting'. The British music industry is the third largest earner of invisible exports for this country, and with the support of the government, EMI and other record companies intend to improve upon their already impressive drive for exports.

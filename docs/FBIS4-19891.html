			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A few minutes ago National Economy Finance  Minister Yeoryios Yennimatas died in the intensive care unit at  Evangelismos Hospital. He was born in Athens in 1939. [passage  omitted]    Yennimatas personally told the Greek people that he was  suffering from cancer. He went to the United States for  treatment and after a few weeks returned to Athens with obvious  hope that he had surpassed the danger. His condition  deteriorated and again he informed the people, this time telling  them that the cancer had affected his liver. His wife, Kakia,  died of cancer a few months ago.</p>

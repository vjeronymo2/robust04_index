			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: Harpener expects sale by summer HARPENER, the German industrial group which made large losses because of its entanglement with Mr Werner Rey, the Swiss financier, is likely to have a new majority shareholder by the summer. Mr Heinz Sippel, the company doctor who is Harpener's chairman, said yesterday that the group was in the final stages of negotiations with a number of potential buyers. The majority of the group's shares are held by Swiss and French banks as collateral for the debts of Omni, Mr Rey's former business empire which went into liquidation last year. Mr Sippel said that advisers to the sale Lazard, Burklin, Kuna &amp; Co, the Frankfurt arm of the Lazards investment bank, and Lazard Brothers of London, were likely to conclude a deal in time for Harpener shareholders' meeting on July 29. As expected, Harpener, which has interests in property, energy and transport, yesterday reported a significant turnround in net profits before extraordinary charges. It made net profits of DM66.3m (Dollars 40.1m) last year compared with a loss of DM95m in 1990. Group indebtedness fell from DM316.7m in the previous year to DM91m at the end of 1991. Extraordinary expenses totalled DM93.7m, marginally down on the previous year's DM95.6m charge. As in 1990, the bulk of the charge related to obligations taken over as a result of the Omni affair. After taking control of Harpener, Mr Rey's Omni used it to buy stakes in a a number of loss-making companies. The largest, and most disastrous purchase was of a large minority stake in International Leisure Group, the collapsed UK leisure group. The total cost to Harpener had reached about DM350m, Mr Sippel said.</p>

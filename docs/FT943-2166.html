			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Finland raises new EU doubts Mr Heikki Haavisto, the Finnish foreign minister, yesterday caused consternation in the government when he suggested the country would quickly be able to renegotiate its entry terms to the European Union if voters reject membership in next month's referendum. By increasing uncertainty over the outcome and importance of the referendum his suggestion is likely to increase tensions between his own Centre party and the pro-EU Conservative party, the main coalition partners in Finland's centre-right government. The Centre party, which leads the coalition, backs membership but it has been anxious not to offend the anti-EU farming community on which it relies for much of its support. Writing in the Social Democratic newspaper, Demari, Mr Haavisto said he believed EU enthusiasm for Nordic membership of the community was sufficiently strong for the two sides to be able to negotiate a new membership package within a year. The general view has been that the Nordic countries would have to wait at least five years before they could re-apply for membership. Last week Mr Esko Aho, the Centre party prime minister, upset the Conservatives and the opposition Social Democrats when he said parliament should wait until after the Swedish referendum before deciding whether to approve the country's membership campaign.</p>

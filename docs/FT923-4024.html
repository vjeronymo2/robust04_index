			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Letter: Root of problem facing Shias in southern Iraq has yet to be addressed, despite no-fly zone Sir, Security Council Resolution 688, based on Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter, is a mandatory resolution. It 'demands that Iraq immediately end . . . the repression of the Iraqi civilian population'. It calls on the United Nations and member states to address humanitarian needs and provides enforcement mechanisms for dealing with internal man-made disasters in Iraq which threaten international peace and security. Recently, your columns have suggested that a plausible explanation for roaring across southern Iraq is missing. The question is not to ask why a no-fly zone is being established at this time, but rather why the UN and the international community are not doing more regarding the human rights situation in Iraq. Since last year, the UN has provided assistance in Iraq on the basis of a memorandum of understanding (MOU). It is clear from the UN's failure to convince Baghdad to extend the MOU that the UN cannot pursue its aims based on such an agreement. An MOU should perhaps never have been proposed, especially as 688 is a legal basis for the UN's humanitarian mandate in Iraq. It is time to enforce 688. It is a clear instruction, requesting the UN's secretary-general to 'use all the resources at his disposal . . . to address urgently the critical needs of the refugees and displaced Iraqi population . . . (and) demands that Iraq co-operate with the secretary-general to these ends'. Failure to carry out the resolution will result in further suffering. In the absence of effective UN action, the allies have chosen not to wait. The no-fly zone is unlikely to deter Saddam Hussein from launching a ground offensive in southern Iraq. What will happen then? The allied aircraft are a short-term solution. The aim is to provide comfort to besieged Shias, but the root of the problem has yet to be addressed.

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / SPD plan to tax high earners A PLAN to raise taxes on Germany's higher earners, and to impose a labour market levy on civil servants and the self-employed, was proposed yesterday by the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) as an alternative 'solidarity pact' with east Germany. The package, formally approved by the party leadership in Bonn, would also include more drastic dismantling of tax allowances, and fewer cuts in social spending, than the alternative plan tabled by the ruling German coalition. Mr Bjorn Engholm, the SPD leader, presented his proposals yesterday as a negotiating package for the government and expressed his belief that the two sides would reach some compromise in the coming months. 'At least we will agree on a partial package,' he said after a press conference in Bonn. 'We need it for the sake of the German economy.' He said that the Social Democrats remained committed to the concept of a 'solidarity pact' to finance recovery in east Germany. Employment has collapsed in the east since unification, along with large parts of the country's former state-owned industry. The SPD also rejected the government's parallel plan for the introduction of a special motorway toll, proposed to help finance the reform of the country's railway system. The party says that such a charge - proposed at between DM300 (Pounds 127.10) and DM400 a year for motorway users - was 'senseless both ecologically, and as a transport policy'. Mr Engholm said the SPD estimated the financing gap for the German government and western Lander, needed to finance subsidies in the east, at DM16bn in 1993, between DM35bn and DM40bn in 1994, and DM110bn in 1995. He said that spending cuts - excluding the most drastic reductions in unemployment benefit and other social payments proposed by the government - would only reach a maximum of DM4bn in the current year. As a result, the introduction of an income tax levy on the better paid, and of a labour market levy on those who do not pay existing unemployment benefit (mainly government servants and the self-employed), was necessary from July 1. Chancellor Helmut Kohl has set his heart against any tax rise before January 1 1995, and his spokesman said yesterday that he saw no sign of a change. However both sides agree that negotiations between their positions are necessary, and Mr Engholm and Mr Kohl - regardless of what their colleagues may say in public - both appear committed to that process.</p>

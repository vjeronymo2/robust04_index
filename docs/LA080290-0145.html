			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: LA VERNE;  </P> <P> HOUSING SUIT PUT ON HOLD  </P> <P> A legal dispute between Lewis Homes of California and the city will be on hold  until Jan. 8, 1991, under a formal settlement agreement adopted Monday night by  the City Council.  </P> <P> The agreement gives the city time to review a modified housing development plan  Lewis has submitted for a tract in the foothills west of Esperanza Drive and  north of Base Line Road.  </P> <P> The company sued after the city failed to approve an earlier development plan.  </P> <P> Among other changes, Lewis' new plan proposes 186 hillside houses instead of  230, a development area of 61.9 acres instead of 75.4 and 151 acres retained as  open area instead of 137. The plan must still go through Planning Commission  review Wednesday, and a City Council public hearing Nov. 5.  </P></p>

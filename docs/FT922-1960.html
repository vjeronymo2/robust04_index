			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Severn Trent heads the field with Pounds 265m SEVERN TRENT, the Birmingham-based water and sewage company, yesterday announced the biggest profits so far for the privatised water sector. But the company admitted Biffa, the waste management arm acquired last year, would not earn enough to cover its interest charges until next year at the earliest. Severn Trent's shares fell 7p to 375p. The company reported a 6.4 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 265m in the year to March 31, up from Pounds 249m. The increase came from average price rises of 15.2 per cent, held back by falling interest income as the company invested in improved water and sewage quality. Turnover increased to Pounds 822m (Pounds 627m), helped by price rises and an 11-month contribution from Biffa and other non-regulated businesses. Biffa made annualised operating profits of Pounds 12.5m, compared to the Pounds 25m interest bill on its Pounds 212m acquisition price-tag. Mr John Bellak, chairman, said Biffa would continue to dilute earnings this year because of the recession. But he expressed 'no regrets' about the purchase. Operating profits increased 32 per cent to Pounds 261m (Pounds 197m). But interest income fell sharply from Pounds 51.5m to Pounds 4.3m. Capital expenditure increased 48.5 per cent to Pounds 585m. The company went from net cash of Pounds 229m to net borrowings of Pounds 170m during the year, creating gearing of 9 per cent. Mr Bellak said capital spending has now peaked. Earnings increased 5.7 per cent to 68.2p (64.5p). The company is recommending a final dividend of 12.9p (11.7p) for a 19.3p (17.55p) total. At the interim stage, Severn Trent announced a 1.5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 137m (Pounds 135m) on turnover 26 per cent higher at Pounds 395m (Pounds 313m). Debtors increased nearly 50 per cent to Pounds 157.5m (Pounds 108.2m). About half the increase was due to acquisitions while some customers showed a growing reluctance to pay. Staff numbers increased by 300 to 7,400. At Biffa, where the emphasis was towards higher margin business, staff totals fell 180 to 1,836. Three other water companies also reported increases yesterday: Pre-tax profits at Essex Water for the 12 months to end-March were Pounds 18.2m against Pounds 15.7m for the previous 15 months. Turnover was Pounds 61.7m compared with Pounds 68.9m. The comparison are not meaningful because of the change of year-end. The final dividend is 34.3p making a total of 70.9p, payable from earnings per share of 202p. The total dividend and earnings for the previous 15 months were 78.83p and 163p respectively. Suffolk Water turned in pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.2m from turnover of Pounds 14.5m. Again there are no meaningful comparisons because of the change of year-end. Profits for the previous 15 months were Pounds 4m from turnover of Pounds 16.3m. Earnings per share came out at 79p and the final dividend is 21.5p for a 45.1p total. Earnings for the previous 15-month period were 72p and the total dividend was 37.95p. While Brockhampton Holdings, parent company of Portsmouth Water, reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.85m from turnover of Pounds 22m in the year to end-March. This compares with profits of Pounds 2.79m from turnover of Pounds 19.7m last time. Earnings per share increased by 22.7 per cent to 21.1p and a final dividend of 3.3p makes a total for the year of 4.95p. See Lex</p>

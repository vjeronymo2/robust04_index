			<p>BFN     [Text] Zvornik, June 5 (TANJUG) -- Although Bosnian Moslem  forces, assisted by Bosnian Croats and troops of the regular  army of the Republic of Croatia, are continuing attacks on the  territory of the republic of Srpska all Serbian defence  positions are completely stable and Bosnian Serb army troops  will continue to resolutely prevent any violation of the  territory of the republic of Srpska, Bosnian Serb army officials  said on Sunday [5 June].    Armed provocations by Croats are most frequently reported in  the valley of the river Sava in north-eastern Bosnia, said the  sources. The Serb side does not react to provocations but when  the other side launches offensive actions it uses its legitimate  right to self-defence, they said.    Bosnian Serb forces effictively repulsed several Moslem  artillery and infantry attacks in the region of Teslic in the  north-eastern part of Bosnia and one on Mount Ozren. They also  prevented infiltration of a Moslem terrorist group. Serb parts  of Sarajevo, especially Ilijas, again came under fire from  Moslem positions in Sarajevo, said the sources.    The ceasefire agreement for the Sarajevo region is also  being  violated by continuous sniper and small arms fire from the  Moslem part of Sarajevo on the Serb suburb of Nedzarici and from  the central party of the city on Ozren Street, said the Serb  army sources.    Moslem snipers in Sarajevo on Friday severely wounded a  Russian and a French member of the United Nations Protection  Force (UNPROFOR) but UNPROFOR has so far not reacted to the  incident.</p>

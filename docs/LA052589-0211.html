			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> REP. LUKENS DENIES HAVING SEX WITH TEEN  </P> <P> Rep. Donald E. (Buz) Lukens denied having sex with a teen-age girl but did  offer her mother a job during a telephone conversation secretly recorded by the  FBI and police and played for the jury today.  </P> <P> On the tape, played on the fourth day of Lukens' trial on charges of  contributing to the delinquency or unruliness of a minor, Lukens told the  girl's mother that her daughter had been calling, and he asked that she stop.  </P> <P> If convicted of the misdemeanor, the 58-year-old Republican could be sentenced  to six months in jail and fined $1,000.  </P> <P> During the Nov. 11 conversation, Anna Coffman told the congressman that her  17-year-old daughter, Rosie, had confessed to her that she had sex with Lukens  on Nov. 6.  </P> <P> "She was there with Mercedes. What Mercedes and I did was private. Your  daughter had nothing to do with it," Lukens replied, according to the tape.  </P> <P> Mercedes was the name used by Rosie Coffman's friend, Michelle Foster, then 19,  who had invited her to Lukens' apartment that night.  </P> <P> Lukens also asked Anna Coffman whether she was still "interested in the job."  The mother testified earlier that Lukens made her a job offer during a meeting  at a Columbus fast-food restaurant earlier in the day.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Rosie Coffman testified that she had sex with Lukens on the eve of  her 17th birthday and lied to Lukens, telling him she was turning 19 years old.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Hun Sen, second prime minister of Cambodia, in </F> Pailin; date not given -- recorded]    [Summary from poor reception] Now, I wish to speak to the  goal of attacking and controlling Pailin. The Royal Government  of Cambodia [RGC] has no intention whatsoever of continuing the  war. I will support Samdech Krompreah [Norodom Ranariddh] in his  efforts to implement our king's initiative to woo the Khmer  Rouge into settling the problem peacefully. Since all manner of  attempts and all (?discussions) between Samdech Krompreah and  H.E. Khieu Samphan have failed, however, and since the people  and the KRAF [Khmer Royal Armed Forces] have continued to suffer  from further attacks, Samdech Krompreah and I have decided to  launch the attacks to take control of Anlung Veng, Pailin, An  Seh, and other areas. If we do not destroy the bases in Pailin  and Anlung Veng and other places, the Cambodian people can never  live in peace. This is because the Khmer Rouge have used all  those bases to attack them and the KRAF.    I would also like to say that the RGC is duty-bound to  implement Article 1 of the Constitution, which stipulates  clearly that the Kingdom of Cambodia is an indivisible state.  We have the task of controlling Cambodia totally, according to  the Constitution. We have resorted to offensives only after the  talks between Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and the Khmer  Rouge became unproductive. We can no longer let Cambodia remain  divided. According to the Constitution, the royal government  has to control the entire kingdom. Therefore, the attacks on  Anlung Veng, Pailin, or other places do not constitute a  violation of anybody's territory or border. They are the tasks  carried out by the RGC in compliance with the Constitution.  Moreover, our policy is to use military measures to enter into  a political dialogue.    Samdech Krompreah and I are of the same opinion that if the  Khmer Rouge continue to enjoy their military, economic,  political, psychological, and diplomatic support, its leaders  will not soften their political stances, no matter what. So the  attack on Pailin is to isolate the Khmer Rouge and to soften its  political stance while the government leaves the door open for  political dialogue to achieve national reconciliation.    We continue to implement, not just accept, His Majesty's  initiative. The Khmer Rouge has to fulfill the three necessary  tasks while the royal government implements the two others.  First, the Khmer Rouge has to stop firing on and destroying  property; second, it has to surrender its troops to the royal  government; and third, it has to hand over the regions under its  control to the government. As for the government, it should  fulfill two tasks: first, it should agree to include the Khmer  Rouge troops in the KRAF; second, it should allow acceptable  Khmer Rouge personages to hold some ministerial or advisory  posts.    Samdech Krompreah and I are prepared to hold political  discussion with H.E. [His Excellency] Khieu Samphan. The RGC  wants to cease hostilities in compliance with His Majesty's  initiative. Especially on this new year occasion, we want to  have an unconditional and general cease-fire throughout the  Kingdom of Cambodia so as to allow people to enjoy the new year  celebration. The KRAF, police, and people, as well as the Khmer  Rouge troops, all want to be happy on this occasion. If  Democratic Kampuchea agrees to a general cease- fire, the KRAF  have no reason whatsoever to launch attacks. Taking this  opportunity, I would like to appeal, in case the Khmer Rouge  leaders disagree, to the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea  officers and soldiers to lay their arms aside and come in to  enjoy popular games with the people and the KRAF. This is a  very good opportunity for reconciliation.    Now, I want to talk a bit about the plan to develop Pailin.  We have not only attacked and occupied Pailin militarily, but  we should also develop it in line with other regions throughout  the country. We need to transform Pailin into an administrative  region. The RGC plans to request that the National Assembly  authorize the designation of Pailin as a town with a structure  equal to that of a province. The government has already set up  a group of delegates with the duty of organizing this area as a  development zone.    Taking this opportunity, I would like to appeal to the  people  who have been forced out of the Pailin region by the Khmer Rouge  into Thailand or other areas to return. If they return, we will  hand their homes or land back to them. We want to give priority  to those forced by the Khmer Rouge to follow them. When they  return, we will allow them to own homes legally as other people  do.    [Summary from poor reception] I want to talk a bit about  relations with Thailand. Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut,  deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs, presented  this issue to the Kingdom of Thailand on 8 April. As for  myself, I will make an urgent visit to Bangkok on 16 April.  That will be an urgent working visit to solve not only the  Cambodian-Thai border problem at Pailin, but also the issue of  security along the common border. I wish to emphasize that  while I am there, I will not discuss the issue of establishing  the boundary between the two countries because the  Thai-Cambodian border, except for the maritime border, has been  recognized since His Majesty's Sangkum Reas Niyum era. There  have already been maps and proper arrangements. The purpose of  my next trip is to settle the problems between Thailand and  Cambodia concerning the control of the security situation and  the relations of good neighborliness. This is to turn the  common border into a border of peace, friendship, and  cooperation. I will first make clear with the Kingdom of  Thailand that the Khmer Rouge office near the Royal Palace in  Phnom Penh does not mean that Cambodia is separated into two  different countries. Some Thai leaders have said that the Khmer  Rouge has not been outlawed yet because its representatives are  still in Phnom Penh. I would like to underline that legally,  there is only the royal government, which is the result of the  UN-sponsored elections that the royal Thai government has  already recognized. There is no other legitimate force on  Cambodian soil other than the RGC. As for the Khmer Rouge  office in Phnom Penh, it only represents a political liaison  among Cambodians. This issue is purely an internal affair. The  RGC also wants to keep dialogue through the Phnom Penh Khmer  Rouge office with the aim of seeking a political solution.  Nonetheless, we would like to specify to the entire world not  to consider the Khmer Rouge office in Phnom Penh proof of  Cambodia's division into two. This is the first point I want to  clarify to my counterpart in Bangkok.    Second, we want to implement the Cambodian Government  statement that all contracts previously concluded by Thai  companies with the Khmer Rouge will be recognized. I will urge  those companies to do business with the RGC, because the trade  will have a bright future and be legal. The RGC will not  tolerate any violation of Cambodian laws, policy, or economy.    I hope that my statement will not (?upset) the Thai side.  This is done with the intention of settling problems and  avoiding creation of new ones, and is also forewords to Bangkok.  Anyway, we still have a lot of problems to discuss if the visit  is to take place after this new year celebration.</p>

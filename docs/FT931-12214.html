			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Petition against Maxwell cleared A BANKRUPTCY petition against Mr Ian Maxwell can be presented within the next two days, the High Court ruled yesterday. Lawyers acting for the liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, which managed the Mirror Group pension funds, last month won an order for Mr Maxwell to pay Pounds 500,000 interim damages. The bankruptcy petition will not become effective until after Mr Maxwell's appeal against the order early next month.</p>

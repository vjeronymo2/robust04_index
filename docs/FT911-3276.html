			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / UK offers to boost investment in Poland MR John Major, the prime minister, and President Lech Walesa of Poland (pictured right) yesterday signed a joint declaration in which Britain undertook to encourage investment in Poland and expressed its support for Poland's bid to become an associate member of the European Community. The declaration was signed in Downing Street on the second day of Mr Walesa's state visit to Britain and before an hour's talks between the two leaders, described as 'warm and friendly'.

Britain recognised the importance to Poland of increased western investment and would continue to encourage companies to invest there. The UK also promised to consider granting medium-term credits to Poland. In welcoming Poland's negotiations with the EC for associate membership, Britain stressed that the option of full membership should be available when Poland was able to meet the political and economic obligations involved. It was announced earlier that the bank SG Warburg had been chosen to act as consultants to the Polish government for its privatisation of 500 enterprises. The Foreign Office said that it had agreed in principle to finance this arrangement from the British government's five-year Pounds 50m 'Know-How Fund for Poland.' In his speech at the Guildhall, where he was the guest of the Lord Mayor of London, Mr Walesa said Poland had helped to eliminate the barriers which had divided Europe ideologically for 40 years. 'We do not want them replaced by economic barriers.'</p>

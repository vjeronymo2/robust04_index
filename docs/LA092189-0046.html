			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES  </P> <P> La Jolla-based Cytel Corp. has signed a five-year joint research agreement with  Sandoz AG, a Swiss pharmaceutical firm, the companies said Wednesday. The  agreement could generate as much as $30 million to develop drugs against  rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes.  </P> <P> In return for the agreement, privately held Cytel agreed to sell less than 20%  of its outstanding stock to the Swiss firm.  </P> <P> Sandoz and Cytel hope to develop a new class of immunological drugs, called  "auto-immune blockers," to treat rheumatoid arthritis, insulin-dependent  diabetes and other diseases. Auto-immune disease results from the body's  failure to distinguish "self" from "non-self" molecules. The immune system  attacks body tissues as if they were foreign molecules.  </P> <P> The two companies also hope to develop drugs to prevent tissue rejection in  organ transplant patients.  </P> <P> Cytel was formed in 1987 to apply recent advances in immunology to the  development of drugs.  </P></p>

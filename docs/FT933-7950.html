			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee producers pin hopes on export curbs AFRICAN COFFEE producers, who have lost more than Dollars 1bn a year since the collapse of an international export quota system in 1989, hope their fortunes will be revived by an agreement to withhold 20 per cent of their output, which was signed alongside Latin American producers in Kampala yesterday. The accord, due to take effect on October 1, will be open-ended. 'We intend to maintain the retention scheme until we reach our target price,' said Mr Guy-Alain Gauze, the Ivory Coast's coffee minister and chairman of the Kampala meeting. He would not reveal the target price but said stocks would be released slowly on to the market when prices improved. The success of the scheme will depend on world coffee prices rallying high enough to finance the costs of withholding exports. Each country will be responsible for its own retention scheme. The participants agreed to meet in Brasilia on September 23 and 24 to hammer out the details of policing the plan. If the plan succeeds, 10m bags of 60 kg will be withheld from the world market during the 1993-94 crop year. Stocks in importing countries were estimated to stand at over 20m bags last March. Half of the stocks are held in the US, with most of the balance in Europe. The agreement in Kampala was the first to unite coffee producers since the breakdown of the International Coffee Agreement four years ago. It was brought about by dire necessity, as global coffee earnings have fallen to below Dollars 6bn from their peak of Dollars 11bn in the mid-1980s. Even Indonesia, which has shunned commodity pacts in the past, attended the Kampala meeting as an observer. Indonesian delegates said they supported the principle of retaining production. 'For four years the Ivory Coast has been exporting at a loss,' Mr Gauze said. 'We could sustain this state of affairs no longer.' The Ivory Coast is Africa's biggest coffee exporter, despite a steep decline in production, from 284,000 tonnes in 1989-90 to 192,000 tonnes in the 1992-93 season, according to the US Department of Agriculture. The 25 nations of the Inter-Africa Coffee Organisation produce about a fifth of the world's coffee. But the slump in world prices and the costly workings of cumbersome state marketing boards have led a growing number of African coffee farmers to abandon their plantations in search of more profitable cash crops. The continent's 1992-93 production of 1.03m tonnes was 16 per cent lower than the 1989-90 crop. Even before the agreement, African governments were implementing reforms designed to give coffee farmers a better deal. In Kenya, producer of Africa's finest Arabica coffee, farmers have been allowed to keep half their earnings in foreign currency since the beginning of the year. They are no longer forced to market their beans via the state Coffee Board of Kenya. Most of the large coffee estates are now selling their produce directly at the auction houses in Nairobi, cutting the expense of middlemen. Even so, Kenya's coffee production has shrunk from 125,000 tonnes to 83,000 tonnes in five years. Uganda's coffee earnings reached a nadir of Dollars 98m in 1992, compared with average annual revenues of Dollars 300m between 1982 and 1989, according to the Ministry of Finance's budget statement. In a bid to revive the sector, the government abolished export taxes on coffee last year, liberalised producer prices and licensed private traders. Even greater efforts are being expended to diversify exports away from coffee, which still earns 60 per cent of Uganda's hard currency. Some traders are questioning the benefits of the retention scheme for countries like Kenya, whose fine Arabica coffee fetches a hefty premium on the world market. 'Prices this season have reached highs of Dollars 250 for a 50 kilo bag,' says Ms Bridget Carrington, a trader with C. Doorman in Nairobi. 'This is three times the price paid for Colombian or Central American beans.' If prices soar to new heights, Ms Carrington fears world roasters may reduce the proportion of Kenyan coffee in their blends. She believes the retention scheme may have the undesired effect of undermining demand for Kenya's prime produce and depressing exports. It is also unclear how Africa's cash-strapped governments are going to pay for the build up in withheld coffee stocks. Mr Peter Ngategize, the research and development manager of Uganda's Coffee Development Authority, believes the financial costs of the retention scheme should be born by exporters. 'But the government will probably have to shoulder some of the expense,' he says. Private coffee traders are just beginning to establish their business in Uganda and it would be unfair to hit them with huge unforseen costs. Mr Ngategize says the retention agreement will only work if the price gains on the world market offset the cost of withholding stocks. But in Uganda's case, he believes higher prices are only part of the solution. 'Our coffee plantations are old and in poor shape,' he says. 'We have to invest in research and extension services to improve the quality and productivity of our shambas (farms).' Other delegates to the Kampala meeting chose to strike a note of caution. 'Commodity pacts have had a high failure rate in the past,' one participant said. 'The retention scheme is a temporary solution, with problems of sustainability.'</p>

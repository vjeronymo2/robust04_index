			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: JR East blames sluggish railway operations for pre-tax downturn EAST JAPAN Railway, the semi-privatised regional railway group, said sluggish railway operations due to the economic slump caused a marginal fall in interim pre-tax profits. The earnings announcement, JR East's first since its listing on the Tokyo stock exchange last month, reflected rising operating costs amid lower revenues. Pre-tax profits for the first six months to September fell 1.2 per cent to Y73.6bn (Dollars 687.85m) while overall revenue fell 0.6 per cent to Y995.2bn. After-tax profits fell 6.5 per cent to Y38.1bn. The company has not benefited from its stock flotation since the proceeds have gone to JNR Settlement, which holds debts and shares of seven regional companies created in 1987 through the break-up of national operator, Japan National Railways. JR East's half-year revenue from its railway operations eased 0.7 per cent to Y954.8bn, while operating profits fell 3.8 per cent to Y231.7bn. Revenue from its other businesses including real estate leasing and retailing operations, rose 2.1 per cent to Y40.3bn, although operating profits fell 28.7 per cent to Y3bn. For the full year to March, the company expects a 0.2 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y101.2bn on a 0.6 per cent fall in overall revenue to Y1,968.2bn. Meanwhile, securities industry officials yesterday expressed worries over further flotation of state-owned companies following the recent decline in share prices believed to have been triggered by the JR East flotation. The Japanese government wants to float Japan Tobacco, a state-owned tobacco and salt company by the end of next March, and the remaining seven railway groups next fiscal year. Mr Masaru Aratani, chairman of Japan Securities Dealers Association, said that he was cautious over the impact of listing large-capital state owned companies. Mr Aratani said the JR East listing came at a bad time for the sluggish stock market. His comments counter those of Mr Minoru Nagaoka, Tokyo stock market president, who has denied claims the market's decline was caused by JR East.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / City jobs scheme far short of targets Only 16 local people were offered jobs in the City of London during the first year of Local Recruitment Brokerage, a non-profit making company backed by the Bank of England which aims to recruit from neighbouring areas with high unemployment. The target figure for job offers had been 200. 'We were over-ambitious,' said Ms Sharon Collins, the company's managing director, yesterday. A total of 122 job vacancies were advertised through the brokerage by 49 City employers. As many as 620 candidates submitted applications, of whom 115 were interviewed and 16 were offered jobs. But Ms Collins said the placement level had improved substantially over the past six months, with 18 offered jobs out of 250 applicants for 70 posts. 'Local people have not been used to the City's corporate culture,' Ms Collins said. 'Companies are not going to change their attitudes overnight either.' The Brokerage is a partnership between City companies Kleinwort Benson, SG Warburg, KPMG Peat Marwick, the Bank of England and the Corporation of London in alliance with local authorities in Hackney and Islington and the local training and enterprise council. Companies participating in the scheme include Abbey National, KPMG, Midland Bank, Baring Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Royal Insurance. Ms Collins said yesterday that the company had become 'more pro-active' in helping candidates to prepare their job applications and interview techniques. It is also establishing a computerised database of vacancies. Mr Mike Ireland, the Bank of England's community relations director, has replaced Mr Gareth Hughes as the company's chairman.</p>

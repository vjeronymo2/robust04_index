			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Privatised IBA sets up telecoms rival to BT Competition in the hotly contested long-distance telecommunications market intensified yesterday with the launch of a new network by NTL, the privatised transmission arm of the former Independent Broadcasting Authority. NTL said it would undercut existing operators British Telecommunications and Mercury by about 20 per cent. In effect NTL will provide wholesale trunk capacity for existing telecoms operators or large corporate customers. Its network, comprising microwave radio links between all the main population centres, is the second to be launched this week following the start of service by Energis, the telecoms arm of the National Grid. Since NTL was privatised in 1991 in a Pounds 70m deal, Mr John Forrest, then chief executive and now deputy chairman, has made it clear he wanted to expand beyond providing broadcast transmission services and into more broadly based telecommunications. NTL's national telecoms launch follows deals with Vodafone, the UK's largest cellular operator, and Birmingham Cable, a cable TV and telecoms operator, which are using NTL to carry part of their long-distance traffic. Cable companies, which are laying local television and telecoms networks but lack national telecoms links, are NTL's most likely customers. They are keen to force down long-distance carriage rates, and have avoided signing long-term deals with BT or Mercury which would restrict their capacity to move business to lower-cost suppliers. NTL has been developing into a broadly based communications technology and service group. Earlier this year it paid Pounds 6.6m for DTELS, an organisation which specialises in mobile communications for emergency services. The group has also been gaining increasing recognition for its work on digital compression, which allows between eight and 10 channels of television to be squeezed into the capacity normally occupied by one. The group, based at the former IBA research headquarters near Winchester, has a development deal with Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Pace, the consumer electronics group. NTL's digital compression technology is likely to be used as part of plans to launch satellite television systems next year in Asia and Europe. NTL, which was bought by Mercury Asset Management, the fund-management arm of SG Warburg, is expected to float eventually on the London Stock Exchange, although no date has yet been set. NTL claimed that its network - which can be used for voice, data and video links - is the first in the UK to use leading-edge digital transmission technology. Mr John Okas, NTL's telecoms division director, said: 'This is part of our strategic development into UK telecoms.'</p>

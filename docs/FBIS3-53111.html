			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The first day of deliberations between the Israeli  and PLO delegations ended in Taba a short time ago. The two  sides described today's talks as satisfactory. Our  correspondent Netan'el Semrik reports from Taba:    Today was the test of the immense diplomatic effort invested  in the past few weeks in Oslo, Paris, in Cairo which was  ultimately crowned with success. The agenda for the  continuation of the Taba talks was set today. It was decided to  resume the talks tomorrow morning, apparently once again in a  limited forum. In a news conference with dozens of television  and radio crews from all over the world, Nabil Sha'th described  today as a useful day. Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli  delegation, was asked whether it was a positive day:    [Begin recording] [Shahaq] I cannot point to any impressive  progress today, but we exchanged ideas and picked up from where  we left off almost two months ago.    [Unidentified correspondent] Did you set an agenda for the  continuation of the talks?    [Shahaq] We received several papers from the Palestinians  which we will have to peruse, and we agreed on tomorrow's agenda.    [Unidentified correspondent] Are the Cairo understandings  included in the [words indistinct]?    [Shahaq] We continue to talk here on the basis of the Cairo  understandings. [end recording]    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1700 GMT on 10 January  adds: "When asked whether he believes the negotiations will be  completed within three weeks, as Nabil Sha'th stated, Shahaq  replied: We will continue the negotiations for as long as  necessary."]</p>

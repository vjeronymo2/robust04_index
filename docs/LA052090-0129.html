			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OBJECTION TO ARTICLE  </P> <P> I read your article pertaining to the alcohol-driving science fair project that  was disqualified for the Greater San Diego Science and Engineering Fair  (GSDSEF) for failure to meet regulations ("The Science Project That Was Put on  Ice," May 11). I feel your slant was unfair and that the GSDSEF coordinators  made the correct decision.  </P> <P> This project dealt with drugging people! The four drinks given to the subjects  put them well over the legal driving limit, and yet there was no medical  supervision. This is a clear breach of the rules of the GSDSEF, and thus the  project was not allowed to participate.  </P> <P> While you wrote a long article about one student who did not get into the fair,  you never reported the results of the fair itself. Over 800 top science  students from around San Diego and Imperial counties followed the rules and  were allowed to participate. These students deserve recognition. Your choice in  printing this article was nearly as poor as your decision to say nothing about  the results of the fair.  </P> <P> BRETT PARTRIDGE  </P> <P> Eighth Grade  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARAB TEEN REPORTEDLY USED AS SHIELD  </P> <P> Israeli soldiers forced a Palestinian teen-age boy to sit on the front of their  jeep in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday, apparently as a human  shield to prevent attacks by Arab stone-throwers.  </P> <P> The incident was filmed by Visnews, the London-based international television  news agency, and screened for reporters. The footage showed three soldiers  shooting rubber bullets toward stone-throwers in the town center.  </P> <P> The film then showed the troops driving through Ramallah in a jeep with a  Palestinian teen-ager sitting on the jeep's hood, grasping a metal bar and  looking frightened.  </P> <P> Reporters monitoring army radios in the area said they heard a soldier say:  "It's OK now. We have a kid on the front of the jeep. We won't get stoned."  </P> <P> An army spokesman said a soldier has been summoned to a disciplinary hearing in  connection with the incident.  </P></p>

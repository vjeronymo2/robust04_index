The cause of it all is  the contrast between imposed and personal concepts. The specter  of a "second Afghan" now loomed up in the framework of alarmed  reports from the border, now disappeared in the presence of  calm, impoverished Dushanbe.    A flare-up of activity in the spring is as natural as the  changing of the seasons, Colonel Ivan Malevich, chief of the  information service at the headquarters of the Joint  Peacekeeping Forces (KMS), told me. It has always been that way.  They have come out of Afghanistan and continue to come not in  order to sit around in trenches. One does not have to be  clairvoyant to anticipate an invasion as soon as the passes are  opened and the roads dry up. Only one's imagination can predict  what will follow....  <H5>  "I Do Not Capture Transgressors; I Kill Them." </H5>   Colonel Nikolay Malofeyev, chief of the Panj border  detachment, was more to the point in answering this question.  Expressing dismay at the unexpected arrival of the journalist,  he said that he was not giving interviews, that this was  forbidden and he did not want to give any. He was more concerned  by the shortage of personnel and the refusal of new recruits to  go from Russia to Tajikistan in a situation in which the Tajiks  themselves are not burning up with a desire to serve.    Replenishments come through the requisitions of local  military commissariats, who frequently place young citizens of  independent Tajikistan onto busses by force and haul them from  the hamlets and villages to the detachment of Russian border  troops, turning them over, as they are, without equipment or  medical examination. There the young recruits, who sometimes do  not know Russian, take on the appearance of a soldier in a  situation approaching frontline conditions and acquire the  military science of defending their fatherland.    From the legal standpoint it is difficult to say who they  are  -- mercenaries, since they are serving in a foreign army but on  their own territory, or trainees under Russian instructors. They  say that there is a gentlemen's agreement on this matter but not  formalized in a contract. At the outposts they receive the same  pay and provisions as Russian border troops, which is equal to  ten times the minimum wage of the Tajiks. The material  incentives have little effect upon morale, however.    Deserters are apprehended and returned to the bank of the  Panj in the same way. Not all of them, to be sure. Some of them  are still being sought. According to KMS intelligence, the  Tajiks have trouble mastering the skills and are not  distinguished by special valor in the conduct of combat  operations. They account for more than half of the personnel at  some outposts, and the Russian officers can foresee the day when  they will be commanding Tajiks exclusively.    The Panj sector is considered to be under the greatest  pressure. It experiences mortar shellings and penetration  attempts practically every day. Tajik militants and Mojahedin  are concentrated at the juncture of the third and fourth  outposts in the Afghan community of Bagrikul. They have tanks  and artillery. If they wanted to, I was told at headquarters,  they could wipe out any fortification within a half-hour.    They could not get along without the support of the 201st  Division, even though the border troops have acquired Grad  rocket launchers, tanks and armored personnel carriers in recent  months. The main thing is communication and constant control,  which did not exist last summer, when the tragedy occurred at  the 12th outpost of the neighboring Moscow detachment. The  artillerymen keep the Afghan bank constantly in their sights.    Groups of up to 40 men slip through, aware that the border  is  guarded only during the day in the area of the outposts. In the  morning patrols frequently find underground passages for an  electronic signalling facility, which has not been set up over  the entire length of the system by far. If the system has been  activated in the night, they go out at dawn, and then only if  there is gasoline and the vehicles are running. In such cases it  is already too late to demonstrate fire power. One would not  find the violators even with dogs.    "Do they frequently come through during the day?" I asked  Colonel Malofeyev. "They could be refugees."    "No less frequently than at night. Refugees do not come  through here, though. I do not take prisoners. I kill them."  <H5>  It Will Obviously Not Be Necessary to Dye the Helmets </H5>   Vehicles with light-blue tags are one of the prominent  indications of Dushanbe. They are given the right-of-way by  peasants, and elders bow respectfully to them. Decorative work  with a pretension of good intentions was performed in the 201st  Motorized Rifle Division in October of last year, when the CIS  heads announced the creation of the Joint Peacekeeping Forces in  Tajikistan. The commonwealth thus overcame a system of mutual  distrust in a move toward a military alliance. More than 100  staff members from Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrghizia and  Kazakhstan were once again arm in elbow as in former times.    Friendship is one thing, but they all have different zones  of  responsibility. The demarcation is indicated with a heavy  felt-tipped pen on a map on the desk of Boris Pyankov, commander  of the KMS. The allies gather there and hold council. UN  observers from the UNMOT-1 mission sometimes look in in the hope  of hearing the answer to a burning question addressed to them by  Western journalists: What is Russia after in Tajikistan, peace  for peoples or an opportunity to revive the empire?    The generals reply that the KMS is there in accordance with  the UN Charter at the request of the Tajiks to ensure stability  and arrange a dialog. And it would not be a bad thing for the  Security Council to be given such a mandate, since the conflict  here threatens universal peace. In this case, not just the  licence tags but the helmets too could be painted light blue.    The UN members reasonably object that Russia cannot claim a  mandate since Andrey Kozyrev himself has recognized the area as  one of political and military interests. Furthermore, never  before in the history of the world community have the "blue  helmets" guarded the border of a state where an operation is  being conducted. This is the consensus in Tajikistan.    Troops of the country in which they were located have never  yet been among the UN troops engaged in operations to maintain  peace. The peacekeeping forces must separate the sides of the  conflict, not take them on as allies. Whom to separate, though,  and along what line? Dushanbe alone has 4,500 underground  opposition supporters, Kulyab Oblast has around 2000,  Kurgan-Tyube 3,500 and Gornyy Badakhshan 7,000. This totals an  army equaling half of all the power structures.    The situation is truly out of the ordinary. Peres Ballon,  personal representative of the UN Secretary General, said in a  talk with Boris Pyankov that he could advocate through the  Security Council the sending of 300 military observers to  Tajikistan. Head of state Emomali Rakhmonov seemed to agree, but  the commander of the KMS cut him off, saying: Your spies will  not be sitting in my headquarters. Give some status to the UN  and gain access to operational reports. Or, as Pyankov proposes,  we could withdraw 100 kilometers from the border and your troops  could assume control over this zone. Anything but that, Peres  Ballon replied.    In general, it is clear that there is no love lost between  the KMS and the UN. There should be no illusions about this.  Russia and its partners interested in the solidarity of the  Tajik borders will obviously have to count more on the status of  the regional coalition and on the Tajik talks on collective CIS  security.    The KMS presently has 25,000 soldiers. They have at their  disposal modern combat equipment, including aircraft and space  communication stations. An impressive force, equal to the cost  of peacekeeping. Russia has assumed 57 billion of the 65-billion  ruble cost of semiannual expenses. Tajikistan is the poorest  relative in this family.  <H5>  Lesha Gorbatyy Gives the "Green Light" </H5>   An Uzbek battalion of 350 men has taken up the rear area of  the Panj border detachment, covering the southwestern part of  Khatlon Oblast. The population there is half Uzbek, and they  greeted the KMS personnel as their own. The bands of Ali  Bespalov, former director of the motor vehicle directorate at  Shartuz, are located beyond the Amu-Darya. They say that when he  left Afghanistan he took with him a large quantity of stolen  gold, built a home in the area of Mazari-Sharif, deals in drugs  and has more than 200 men under arms. In December of last year  his militants blew up a train on Tajik territory. Uzbeks in the  KMS repelled him, and he has not appeared again.    One would not envy the Kyrghyz. They have one of the most  difficult sectors in the Pamirs. The battalion of 286 men  delayed its departure slightly and was forced to make its way  through snow-filled passes, dragging its weapons with it. The  starving Badakhshan people greeted the defenders well but asked  them not to interfere with the smuggling of drugs from  Afghanistan to the CIS. Lesha Gorbatyy, head of the Mafia in  Iskashim Rayon generously agreed to the presence of the  peacekeeping forces. His caravans of opium and marijuana freely  travel the Khorog-Osh road.    Another problem of the Kyrghyz is that they have no money  and  no food. Badakhshan is in the ruble zone, and you can buy  nothing to go with the local fish there. And the situation with  Russian currency is tight in Tajikistan. There is not enough  even to pay the ministers. Kyrghyz officers in the KMS receive  wages of 2,500 rubles per month, that is true. Nothing is  provided for the soldiers. In the future, I was told by Colonel  Aleksandr Usatenko, Bishhkek's representative, these are  potential bandits. For now, though, they are eating out of the  pot of the Russian border troops.    There are no problems with the Kazakh battalion of the KMS,  because there actually is no such battalion. Saken Zhasuzakov,  Almaty's emissary at the Joint Command headquarters, told me  that it has been formed and is supposedly in waiting at some  railway station. They need only the order. There is no one to  give it, though. The parliament is dissolved and a new one has  not been elected. Nursultan Nazarbayev, who signed the agreement  in Moscow on 24 September, lacks the authority to send the guard  to Khorog, where, incidentally, they are not anticipating it too  greatly, since the GBAO [Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast]  Ismailites spare neither the Muslims nor the Kazakhs.    And then, my partner in the conversation told me, Russia has  its own interests here: uranium, gold, land.... Next year, you  know the Badakhshan people are planning a luxurious celebration  of the 100th anniversary of their joining the Russian empire.  The Kazakhs, however, do not have any special plans for this....  <H5>  Airborne Hussars as a Morale Factor </H5>   Coincidence or not, the day Tajikistan's National Army was  formed falls on the same day as Defenders of the Fatherland Day  in Russia, that is, 23 February. The first anniversary was  celebrated in Dushanbe with a military parade in Ozodi Square.  Tajik soldiers dressed in Russian overcoats marched past the  reviewing stand, tanks rumbled and canonneers fired salutes of  rockets brought from Orenburg. The pirouettes of four Su-25  fighters evoked particular excitement. The air aces were brought  in from Kubinka near Moscow. The "airborne hussars" flew  brilliantly, for which they were thanked by Aleksandr  Shishlyannikov, republic minister of defense. The Dushanbe  people had a good time.    Clearly it is difficult to build an army in a devastated  state within a year. The authorities are more concerned with  strengthening the security committee and the MVD [Ministry of  Internal Affairs]. In numerical strength these two departments  surpass the young Tajik Army four-fold, which, judging from  everything, Russia will have to outfit.    Right now the army constitutes a fairly strange formation.  Around half of the 6,000 men are in the separate Brigade imeni  Fayzali Saidov, established in July 1992 at the very height of  the bloody events as part of the Popular Front. "Bachai Fayzali"  was a companion-in-arms of Sangak Safarov and was killed by the  latter as punishment for pillaging. Sangak himself was done away  with by a guard, to be sure.    The ethics of those days still live. The Fayzali people feed  themselves in Kurgan-Tyube by collecting quit-rent from local  kolkhoz members, most of whom are Uzbeks. Another settling-up  occurred among them a month ago, during which dozens of soldiers  and peasants died. A usual thing, unfortunately. Few take the  killing in Tajikistan over spheres of influence and access to  material benefits as a sign of activeness on the part of the  opposition.    With less basis for relying on Minister of Internal Affairs  Yakug Salimov, who has 20,000 men at his disposal, I was told by  informed people, Rakhmonov sees his support precisely in the  army and the KNB [National Security Committee]. There is a lot  of talk about the procurator's office and investigative agencies  not being particularly zealous in exposing crimes. Nothing is  known at this time, for example, about who killed Lt. Dmitriy  Kuts, a Russian border troop, near a roadside post close to  Kurgan-Tyube.    More than 60 workers with the procurator's office in the  city  of Dushanbe have been discharged in the past three months. The  September law on the surrender of weapons is not being observed.  Kalashnikov semiautomatic rifles are more and more being used as  the final say in sorting out relations with a rival or a  claimant for a lucrative job.    When you speak to the Tajiks about this, they point to  Russia, where detective subjects are sometimes far more drastic.  Nonetheless, they put their trust in its support.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava April 18 (CTK) -- Cooperation between  the Czech and Slovak Armed Forces was discussed during a one-day  visit of Chief of the Czech Army General Staff Major General  Jiri Nekvasil to Slovakia.    In Bratislava, Nekvasil met with Slovak Defence Ministry  State Secretary Andrej Sobol and Slovak Army Commander  Lieutenant General Julius Humaj.    Generals Nekvasil and Humaj confirmed after the talks that  four protocols to an agreement on cooperation between the two  countries' armies were agreed upon so that the Czech and Slovak  Defence Ministers, Antonin Baudys and Pavol Kanis, would be able  to sign the agreement on May 2 in Bratislava.    "There are no obstacles on the way of cooperation," Humaj  said.    The cooperation would primarily concern an exchange of  experience in solving specific problems, for example the army's  logistic support according to the Western model, Nekvasil said.  He mentioned the possibility of joint exercises and joint  armament projects but declined to give details. He admitted,  however, that he liked the new Slovak howitzer Susana.    The Czech and Slovak Armies are predetermined to cooperate  in  building their national defence by similar conditions, identical  problems and tasks and the situation in the region, Humaj said.    "Although we are aiming at integration into European  structures and have adopted the Partnership for Peace programme,  neither the Czech Republic nor Slovakia had their security  guaranteed by any treaty. We therefore rely on our own forces  and ought to build our national defence. In this we are finding  a common tongue and will to cooperate," Humaj said.    He said that the second major task which is awaiting both  armies -- transformation in order to be able to integrate into  NATO -- also requires cooperation and an exchange of experience.    Humaj described as premature considerations about common  armament systems. Given the shortage of finances, the two  armies would concentrate on modernising the current combat  equipment in the near future and only after this would they be  able to develop new systems, he said. He added, however, that  talks on this topic conducted so far were purely informative.</p>

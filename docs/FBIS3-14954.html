			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS correspondent Roman Zadunayskiy] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 1 March -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy has totally  denied all accusations of propagandizing war during questioning  by a military procurator. On Monday evening he was questioned  by a procurator of the Main Military Procuracy, which is  conducting the Zhirinovskiy case. The LDPR [Liberal Democratic  Party of Russia] leader denied that his book, "The Last Dash  South," and other printed or verbal speeches called for war,  combat actions, and the annexation of other states to Russia.    Earlier, on 25 February, Irina Kulikova, vice president of  the Aesthetics Association of the Russian Academy of Sciences,  was summoned to the Main Military Procuracy for questioning.  She is the author of a book on the LDPR leader, "The  Zhirinovskiy Phenomenon," assisted in putting together "The Last  Dash South," and, in the opinion of observers, is a spiritual  mentor of Vladimir Volfovich. Irina Kulikova also denied that  in "The Last Dash South" or other printed or verbal speeches  Zhirinovskiy had called for war or violence.    It was earlier reported that a criminal case had been  instituted under Article 71 of the Russian Criminal Code,  "Propagandizing war in any form," against Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  by the Procurator General's office after numerous requests from  citizens were made to law enforcement bodies and the Central  Electoral Commission in connection with their having seen calls  for war in publications and speeches by the LDPR leader. The  Main Military Procuracy has been charged with conducting the  Zhirinovskiy case.</p>

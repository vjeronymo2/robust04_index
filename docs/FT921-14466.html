			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Incomplete Gulf victory remains irritant to Bush: The war's aftermath, a year after the launch of allied bombing of Baghdad THE FIRST anniversary of Desert Storm ought to be a chance to celebrate a brilliantly executed US battle plan which crushed the bulk of the Iraqi army with minimum allied casualties. But 12 months after the bombs fell on Baghdad, it is clear that the Gulf war was an incomplete victory. President Saddam Hussein remains in power. The Iraqi people starve. The Kurds are all but abandoned. The Iraqi opposition remains divided. President George Bush, who appeared invincible nine months ago, has watched his approval rating nosedive in the face of a recession-hit US economy, restricting his room for manoeuvre overseas. Mr Bush does not face serious political pressure at home to remove Mr Saddam from power; but there is a nagging concern that the defiant Iraqi president (and his nuclear ambitions) amount to a time-bomb in the run-up to the November election. At some point, surely, Mr Bush must defuse the problem or risk detonation. The trick is how to reconcile the desirable end with politically acceptable means. At present, the administration seems more inclined to pursue multilateral pressure through the United Nations rather than unilateral military action which could leave the president open to criticism that he was engaging in foreign adventures to escape difficulties at home. Both Presidents Nixon and Johnson played politics with the Vietnam war during election years. Yet Mr Bush can put up a plausible case for preferring the use of United Nations sanctions to keep the heat on Mr Saddam, rather than renewed US military force. First, UN economic sanctions, while far from 100 per cent effective, create strains within the ruling regime. The frequent purges in Baghdad suggest that at the very least Mr Saddam is being kept off balance. Second, UN inspectors are slowly but surely identifying and destroying the bulk of Mr Saddam's nuclear and unconventional weapons programme. 'It's a long-haul strategy,' says one US official. The advantage is that the UN gives political cover for the US to ratchet up the pressure. In the coming weeks, UN inspectors may begin blowing up buildings dedicated solely or partially to the Iraqi weapons programme. If Iraq seeks to block the inspectors, the risk of escalation is high. The Pentagon has drawn up an extensive list of military targets for air-strikes which would almost certainly be accompanied by French and British warplanes. A second, less transparent policy option is the use of covert action against Mr Saddam. Reports in Washington suggest that Mr Bush has ordered the CIA to assist opposition groups; but US suspicions about the Shias and Turkish suspicions about the Kurds have made large-scale military aid such as the 1980s programmes to help the Angolan and Afghan rebels a non-starter. Last November, after waiting in vain for Arab predictions of Mr Saddam's imminent fall to come true, Mr Bush ordered a review of Iraq policy. The result was a clear recommendation from the Pentagon that military action in support of an opposition or Kurdish/Shia coup was undesirable unless it was supported by Desert Storm-size forces in theatre. The impression, therefore, is that the Bush administration is content to muddle along Micawber-like, hoping that something will turn up. It is not pretty, but the alternatives all appear to be fraught with risk. The one serious practical objection is that the UN inspectors are desperately short of money. Over the past six months, the UN teams have conducted more than 25 inspections, uncovering a welter of information about Iraq's nuclear programme and the willingness of western companies to help Baghdad. The UN inspectors' ultimate aim is to destroy all Iraq's nuclear, chemical, and biological programmes. The cost could amount to Dollars 100m (Pounds 55.8m). The original plan was to finance inspections (and much-needed humanitarian aid) from UN-sanctioned sales of Iraqi oil, but Mr Saddam has so far refused to go to market. And so the familiar game of cat-and-mouse is under way, with Mr Saddam calculating once again that the West will lack the patience to remain engaged. He may be right; but it is a gamble.</p>

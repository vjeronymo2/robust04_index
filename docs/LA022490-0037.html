			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> MOTHERS' PEACE MOVEMENT FOCUS OF 'WOMEN IN WAR'  </P> <P> A sincere idealism runs through the two-part report, "Women in War" (Sunday and  March 4, 8 p.m, on the Arts &amp; Entertainment cable channel) -- an idealism  that tends to project both a sense of hope and an air of simplifying complex  issues. Host Pat Mitchell, of the "Today" show's "Woman to Woman" segment,  voices the idealism, but without the verve and color that a Linda Ellerbee  might bring to the story.  </P> <P> The first "Women in War" program on Sunday covers the turmoils in Northern  Ireland and Israel's West Bank and Gaza Strip; the concluding segment travels  to El Salvador and gang-ravaged streets in the United States. This  juxtaposition places our domestic strife within a broader context of war, while  making the efforts of inner-city mothers to organize and change their  neighborhoods heroic and universal.  </P> <P> That mothers' basic concerns are the same across the globe is surely true; as  leading Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Mikhail-Ashrawi states (and as her  Israeli women allies agree), women have a deep stake in preserving life and  halting war. It is just as doubtless, though, that the intifada, the Northern  Irish "troubles," the Salvadoran civil war and the inner-city battles derive  from horribly complicated circumstances with economic, religious and cultural  sources. Mitchell is mindful of this but, in the end, seems assured that women  can band together against the odds.  </P> <P> Her own report raises doubts about such optimism. Dozens of activist Salvadoran  women have lost their lives demonstrating peacefully. Northern Ireland's  non-violent, mothers-led movement, Peace People, went from Nobel Prize-winning  fame in the mid '70s to virtual dissolution in a few short years. Strife  between Palestinians and Israelis has only accelerated, as it has in America's  ghettos and barrios.  </P> <P> "Women in War" contains many portraits of women who have found power within  themselves in disempowering conditions. Perhaps they are the only hope; one  only wonders if they are enough. ROBERT KOEHLER  </P></p>

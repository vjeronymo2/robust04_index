			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> A Pink Floyd concert in Venice, Italy, turned into a fiasco Saturday night when  police moved in on about 200,000 youths who had packed into St. Mark's Square  and broken through barriers. Eighty people were reportedly hurt. The band  played a 90-minute show from a barge the size of a football field anchored in a  lagoon in front of St. Mark's Square. (Venice has no stadium.) Fans who had  camped out for as long as 14 hours for the free concert crammed into the  Piazzetta, a rectangular extension outside St. Mark's Square before they were  chased away, leaving the group with only an elite local audience in private  boats -- and the claimed 200 million worldwide television audience. During the  TV transmission of the 90-minute show, however, not one of the 15 cameras was  ever aimed at the deserted Piazzetta, empty except for debris. The show's  producer, the state-owned RAI network, and Granada, sold the concert on the  basis of the unusual setting. The group's normal performance was hampered by  orders to keep their amplified sound down to 60 decibels -- a fraction of their  usual volume. This was a last-minute demand from city officials based on  concerns that higher sound levels could damage the historic buildings. Claudia  Puig  </P></p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: BGB reports first consolidated operating profit of DM734m Bankgesellschaft Berlin (BGB) expects to raise its dividend at the end of the year, the board of management said yesterday. The current dividend is DM9. BGB, which was created last January following the merger of Berliner Bank and Landesbank Berlin, reported consolidated operating results of DM734m (Dollars 467.5m) in its first interim results. After taking into account risk provisions totalling DM326m, operating results came out at DM408m. The bank said that the risk provisions were 'very conservative' and were targeted on small and medium-sized companies. BGB's trading activities, following Germany's other leading banks, showed a net loss of DM6m when compared with the consolidated accounts of the former Berliner Bank over the same period last year. However, BGB officials said the comparison with the Berliner Bank was only for 'formal reasons' since no real comparative figures yet exist for the BGB. Administrative costs amounted to DM1.2bn and were largely the result of setting up the group's new organisational structure. The state of Berlin holds a 67.7 per cent stake in BGB, 10 per cent is held by the Gothaer Insurance Group and the remaining 22.3 per cent is held by minority shareholders. Its total equity capital is DM7.8bn. In spite of its trading losses, BGB's main strength appears to be in mortgage banking and real estate. In the merger, BGB absorbed Berliner Hypotheken-und Pfandbriefbank and Braunschweig-Hannoversche Hypothekenbank, both active in the property market. Consolidated business volume totalled DM222bn, compared with the DM71.4bn of the former Berliner Bank group, and credit volume DM155bn, against DM52.8bn over the same period.</p>

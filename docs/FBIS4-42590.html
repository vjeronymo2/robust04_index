			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Israeli Economics and Planning Minister </F> Shim'on Shetrit by Metin Gokce in Ankara on 3 June -- recorded,  in English with superimposed translation into Turkish]    [Text] [Gokce] How do you view the future of economic  relations between Turkey and Israel, two important countries in  the Middle East?    [Shetrit] I believe there are several common aspects. You  are a democratic country; so is Israel. You respect your  religion, but are secular at the same time. We also respect our  religion and we are a secular society. The policies of both  countries are western-oriented. You support the free market  economy based on social justice, and so do we. I believe that  we can cooperate successfully on the basis of these common  characteristics. There is a potential for great cooperation  between our countries. The current volume of bilateral trade of  $250 million is not sufficient. This year's reciprocal tourist  activities will add another $200 million to this figure.  Hundreds of thousands of Israeli tourists are visiting Turkey.  This is an indication of the Israeli people's confidence in  Turkey and in the Turkish economy. I am also very positive on  this matter.    [Gokce] Could you give more details about the areas of  cooperation you mention?    [Shetrit] For example, cooperation can be undertaken in  various areas on the basis of a triangular model to be  established among Turkey, Israel, and the Palestinians within  the framework of the Palestinian autonomy project. I am hopeful  about the trade talks to be held in July. Moreover, I am also  optimistic about the future of bilateral relations.    [Gokce] How do you view the future of the Peace Water  Project?    [Shetrit] There is plenty of water in Turkey. The Middle  East, however, has meager water resources. I am convinced that  your abundant waters will one day reach the region in order to  solve the sensitive water problem in the Middle East.</p>

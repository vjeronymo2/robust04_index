			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Ghana has banned foreign adherents of the Mormon Church and Jehovah's Witnesses  and given their missionaries one week to leave the nation. The government of  Flight Lt. Jerry J. Rawlings, in a statement carried on state-run Accra Radio,  accused the two groups of disturbing public order and threatening Ghana's  sovereignty. Accra Radio said two small, domestic sects, Nyame Sunkwa and Jesus  Christ of Dzorwulu, also were banned. Of Ghana's population of 13 million, 43%  is Christian. The other major group, 32%, adheres to traditional local beliefs.  </P></p>

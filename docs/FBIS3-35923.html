A total of 51.2 per cent of respondents said that the  forthcoming visit by the Russian president to Georgia will have  a positive impact on the improvement of relations between the  two countries, having age-old historical, economic and  humanitarian ties.    Only 37.6 per cent of respondents were skeptical about the  future of Russo-Georgian relations, while 4.7 per cent expect  Russo-Georgian relations to worsen.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- A senior Japanese trade  official said Thursday a revival by U.S. President Bill Clinton  of the so-called "Super 301" provision threatens to shrink world  trade and urged the U.S. Administration to "act sensibly."    Hideaki Kumano, vice minister of international trade and  industry, speaking at a regular press conference, made the  warning following news reports that Clinton is ready to  reinstate the controversial trade law, which would give him  broad authority to impose retaliatory sanctions against Japan  over trade disputes.    "Such a unilateral approach to solving trade disputes will  result in a shrinkage of world trade. From the viewpoint of  GATT rules, a revival would be problematic," Kumano said.    U.S. dailies, including THE NEW YORK TIMES, reported  Wednesday that Clinton has decided to reinstate the "Super 301"  provision of the 1988 trade law by executive order.    "Japan is cautiously watching the U.S. move. The U.S. should  act sensibly," Kumano said.</p>

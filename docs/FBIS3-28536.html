[passage omitted]    Malaysia yesterday agreed ta have the Thai-Malaysia Border  Socio Economic Development Committee conduct the study.  Malaysian Defence Minister Dato Seri Mohammad Najib bin Tun Hayi  Abdul Razak said after yesterday's committee meeting in Bangkok  that the committee would be responsible for the study. [passage  omitted]    A senior Thai military officer said: "Malaysia has not  accepted our proposal, but it has positively responded to it.  It might be a time before a conclusion can be reached on the  topic." The Thais led by Defence Minister Gen Wichit Sukmak also  urged Malaysia to add more ferries to the existing ferry service  at Takbai-Pengkalan Kubor. Both Dato Deri Mohammad Abdul Razak  and Gen Wichit hailed the success of the meeting at which both  sides reviewed the committee's performance and assigned new  tasks.    Gen Wichit said both countries agreed to set a time frame,  likely to be mid-1994, to review some topics which should be  amended to cope with the changing situation because a threat  from the communists (Communist Party of Malaya) had been  eliminated.    Fourth Army Commander Lt-Gen Kitti Rattanachaya, who also  chairs the Thai-Malaysia Regional Border Committee, said  Malaysia had stressed several times that it would not allow  terrorists to use its territory as a base to cause trouble.  During a meeting chaired by supreme commanders from both sides  last October, Malaysia turned down a Thai proposal to class  "separatist movements" as both countries' common enemy, under a  border treaty.    However, during that meeting, Malaysia said it would provide  full cooperation with Thailand to resolve the problem and it  would not allow separatists to take refuge in Malaysia.    "By the middle of this year a second high-level meeting will  be held in Malaysia and then we will know the scope of the  treaty amendment.    "Any amendment will benefit the two countries," said Maj-Gen  Pricha Rungsawan, commander of the General Border Committee's  Office.</p>

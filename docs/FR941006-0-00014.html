			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule retains the provision as proposed. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department would like to clarify that the proposed provision was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not intended to expand the adjustment for higher cost in areas to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those State agencies located  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> within <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the continental United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At this time, there is no data to support adjustments for areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the continental United States. With regard to Puerto Rico,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> although it is potentially eligible for this adjustment under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new provision, it must still demonstrate that it meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requisite requirements set forth in Section 246.16(c)(3)(i)(B). In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular, it must document that economic conditions result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher food costs, and that it has successfully implemented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> voluntary <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  cost containment measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Adjustments for Indian Tribal Organizations (ITOs)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The growth allocation for the Indian Tribal Organizations has traditionally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presented problems due to inadequate data regarding eligibles. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department knows of no data source to resolve this problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, it proposed to give FNS the authority to oversee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiations between one or more ITOs and the geographic State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency or agencies in which the ITO is located. FNS could, acting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> independently or at the request of a State agency, involve affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agencies in an agreement on the temporary or permanent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer of funds. Negotiations could be conducted to shift funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> among these State agencies to better reflect the actual service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being provided by each of the State agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only a few commenters addressed this provision. The commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were generally in favor of the provision but stressed that caution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be used in shifting funds from one State agency to another,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly based on eligibles data that is questionable. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, there may be a misunderstanding that such grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustments will occur without input from all affected State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies. The Department would like to clarify that any grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustments must be agreed upon by all State agencies involved, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by FNS. At no time would any affected State agency be left out of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the negotiation process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, since the proposed rule was published, it has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brought to our attention that negotiations may need to also take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> place between two or more ITOs not just between ITOs and geographic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agencies. The final rule has been modified to reflect this.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In all other respects, it remains as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Commodity Supplemental Food Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commodity Supplemental Food Program's (CSFP) service to low-income women, infants and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children contributes to the Administration's goal of fully funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the WIC Program by the end of fiscal year 1996. The fiscal year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1995 budget request and out year budget targets assume CSFP women,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infants and children participation will equal the authorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> caseload level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In those States where both CSFP and WIC operate, the current rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires the subtraction from the WIC income eligible database of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those participants (based on actual, average CSFP participation in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the prior fiscal year) who are estimated as eligible for the WIC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program, but elect to receive benefits under CSFP. As CSFP is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently authorized to serve, in addition to WIC eligibles, 5 year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> old children and postpartum women from 6 months to 1 year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> postpartum, not all CSFP participants are categorically eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the WIC Program. Therefore, FNS assumes that one-fourth of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children and one-half of the postpartum women participating in CSFP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not eligible for the WIC Program. The balance of CSFP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participants are subtracted from the WIC eligibles estimate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department proposed to make three changes to this deduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the WIC eligibles database. First, it proposed to modify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method for determining the number of CSFP women, infants and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children to subtract from the WIC eligibles database. It proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to base the deduction upon the authorized caseload for CSFP women,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infants and children, rather than actual participation. Second, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed to base the deduction on the CSFP  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> caseload <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  authorized at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the beginning of the caseload cycle of the prior fiscal year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (generally announced on December 1). Finally, it proposed that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment described above for those CSFP participants who are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also categorically eligible for WIC (postpartum women from 6 months  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to 1 year postpartum and 5 year old children) would no longer be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made. The Department believed that utilizing the total CSFP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> caseload level for women, infants and children, rather than actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation, more equitably accounts for the resources provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a State agency to serve the WIC target population under CSFP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These changes were intended to ensure that States that do not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> access to CSFP were not disadvantaged in their access to WIC funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when compared with States that operate both programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

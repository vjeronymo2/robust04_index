			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Observer: Scottish clones Giving Lord Younger the chairmanship of the four main investment trusts in the Murray Johnstone stable may be good for Scotland Inc, but what message does it send to small shareholders? Lord Younger is a decent chap. A former secretary of state for Scotland and Tory party big-wig, he is starting to make his mark in business as chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland. Since quitting politics, he has been acquiring a portfolio, such as directorships of Scottish Equitable Life and Murray Johnstone Holdings itself, that one has come to expect of Scotland's establishment financiers. Murray Johnstone, controlled by the four trusts Lord Younger chairs, does not put its fund managers on the boards of the trusts it manages. So the non-execs can theoretically fire the managers. True, the arguments are tangled because firing the managers would damage the trust's investment in the management company. Even so, having the same chairman and several of the same non-execs sitting on the different trust boards as well as the parent of the fund manager, seems a trifle incestuous especially when investment trusts are trying to sell themselves to small shareholders as independent companies. One investment trust chairmanship should have been quite enough for Lord Younger. Or is it a case of the more the murrayer?</p>

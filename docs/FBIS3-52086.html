Samaniego, retired, the  vice minister of defense, said yesterday that the arrival of  U.S. troops will be senseless if the Paraguayan Armed Forces do  not take part in the "Strong Roads 1994-South" exercises.  Samaniego said that if the Paraguayan troops do not take part  in this military exercise, the Armed Forces will ask the  legislators not to approve the presence of 600 U.S. troops who  will be in charge of building eight schools, one health center,  roads and wells in the San Pedro department area.    The vice minister said: "We must take part in the training  exercise. Otherwise the presence of the U.S. military will be  senseless because the Paraguayan Armed Forces will be mere  spectators while they train."    After stating that the number of U.S. troops (600) that will  take part in the "Strong Roads 1994-South" exercise may raise  suspicion, Samaniego said that the main objective of the U.S.  troops "is not to build schools but to conduct deployment  exercises."    The retired general warned that "if the Paraguayan Armed  Forces are not directly involved in the operation we will have  no control over the U.S. force."    Samaniego stated that this possibility must be taken into  consideration by the legislators who must approve the entrance  of U.S. troops into Paraguayan territory. He added: "I believe  that the legislators will support our position. This is why I  do not believe they will approve the presence of U.S. troops on  those terms."    Samaniego said that the Armed Forces position is to  negotiate  Paraguayan participation in the exercises. He added that if the  U.S. Government rejects this proposal, they will ask the  legislators to reject the presence of U.S. troops.    During the interview, General Samaniego repeatedly insisted  on the need for Paraguayan officers to participate in the  military exercise. He stated: "This should be one of our  prerquisites to allow the entrance of U.S. troops in our  country. We should negotiate so that the Paraguayan Armed  Forces can participate in an integrated manner in the exercise."    Samaniego said that a possible confirmation of the U.S.  refusal to allow the Paraguayan Armed Forces participation in  the task of building schools, roads, etc. will help to increase  the existing mistrust about the true objective of the 600 U.S.  troops that will arrive in the country.    Moreover, Samaniego explained that the U.S. military will  spend more money in the mobilization and transportation of its  troops than in builidng schools and roads. He added: "Of the  $12 million that the operation will demand, construction  constitutes but a small percentage."</p>

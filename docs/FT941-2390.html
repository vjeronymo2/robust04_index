			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / International Company News: SCA buys French packaging group SCA, Sweden's second largest forestry group, plans to buy a 90 per cent stake in Otor Holding, a privately-held French packaging company, in a deal worth up to FFr2bn (Dollars 346m). The move will be partially funded by a SKr1bn share issue to foreign investors. It is the biggest acquisition by a Swedish forestry group on the continent for three years. SCA said the deal would increase its share of the European transport packaging market to 11 per cent from 9 per cent and assist it in its ambition of building a 15 per cent market position. Mr Sverker Martin-Lof, SCA president, said: 'This gives us a strong presence in one of Europe's four big markets and consolidates our position as Europe's leading transport packaging group.' The move comes only months after SCA announced investments of SKr3bn, including a joint venture newsprint plant, based on 100 per cent recycled paper, at Aylesford in southern England. Otor is France's second largest producer of packaging used for transporting goods, with a 12 per cent market share. It produces 360,000 tons a year of corrugated board in six French and two British plants. It also produces 250,000 tons of container board, based on recycled fibre, and its operations include a recycled-paper company. Profits of FFr108m last year, on sales of FFrs1.9bn, are expected to rise to FFr170m in 1994. SCA said the acquisition would bring FFr100m in synergy benefits and improve 1994 earnings after financial items by SKr190m. It will pay an initial FFr1.77bn and up to FFr255m more if Otor's 1994 and 1995 profits exceed last year's. The vendors, Mr Jean-Yves Bacques and family, will subscribe to SKr300m of the share issue, with the balance being placed with international investors. SCA noted it had already tapped its own shareholders with a SKr1.4bn rights issue last year. The group has a reputation for being the least cyclical of the Nordic forestry groups, because of a strong bias towards hygiene products through its Molnlycke unit. Its resilience was apparent last year when it achieved a SKr1.21bn profit after financial items, despite a weak pulp and paper market. This compares with a SKr451m profit a year earlier. The group expects profits to rise to SKr1.7bn - SKr2.2bn this year, helped by an improving pulp and paper market. The dividend is raised to SKr3.40 per share from SKr3.10.</p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Leningrad TV to go independent LENINGRAD said yesterday it was setting up the country's first independent television company after finalising an agreement to turn its relatively uncensored TV station into a joint-stock company. Mr Anatoly Sobchak, mayor of the Soviet Union's second city, said however that only 3 per cent of the stock would be offered to private investors. Leningrad city council would be the majority shareholder, with a 59 per cent stake, while the Soviet broadcasting network would get 33 per cent and 10 per cent would go to the Russian Federation's Information Ministry. With 70m viewers around the country, Leningrad TV has sought to wriggle free from the control of Mr Leonid Kravchenko, the Soviet broadcasting chief who has limited media freedoms in recent months. But it has been equally reluctant to jump into the embrace of Leningrad city council. The new deal appears to be the best possible compromise on offer, after Leningrad TV failed to find alternative sources of capital. Among the company's most popular shows is the current events programme Fifth Wheel, which is highly critical of the country's entrenched Communist party bureaucracy.</p>

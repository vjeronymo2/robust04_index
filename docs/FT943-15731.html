			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (1): The doors are opened wider - Alan Spence and Jon Marks examine what the arrival of Gatt's successor early next year will mean to exporters / The World Trade Organisation The new world trade order to be led from 1995 by the World Trade Organisation promises significantly higher trade flows - if it can avoid becoming bogged down in bureaucracy. The prevailing economic orthodoxy dictates that barriers to free trade constrain growth in developing and industrialised economies. Distortions to the practice of free and fair trade are, in the long run, bad for the producers as well as the purchasers of goods. Ironing out distortions and moving towards a more open trading environment - widely known by its English nickname, the level playing field - should therefore be a priority in creating any new world order. And so it is, with the successful conclusion of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) Uruguay Round promising much for exporters by further opening economies to the rigours of competition. Gatt economists have calculated that the new terms of trade introduced by the Uruguay Round could add some Dollars 755bn to world exports in the period to 2002. The critical question now is how well the WTO - the body which will succeed the Geneva-based Gatt and encompass associated responsibilities after January 1 1995 - can deliver on the Gatt promise to create a more open, prosperous international trade order, without itself adding an extra layer of bureaucracy to the process. The WTO's creation lays the ground for a new, more structured order in world trade. The organisation, for which a headquarters and director-general have yet to be chosen, will police international trade, basing its work on the final act of the Uruguay Round. This document contains 28 agreements to which have been added some 26,000 pages of national tariff and services schedules. The WTO will comprise Gatt and parallel organisations that are responsible for services and intellectual property. Its general council will be responsible to a ministerial conference that will be held every two years. The Uruguay Round introduces a dispute settlement mechanism - described by the Gatt as 'the new teeth of the WTO' - and the general council will, when necessary, arbitrate in disputes through the new disputes settlement body. This should further internationalise the practice and policing of free trade. To ensure this, the WTO will have the power to sanction offenders, including the ordering of compensation payments. Those who refuse to comply will face authorised trade reprisals. Exporters should benefit from a strengthening of the rules and procedures governing trade. For the first time, the trade in farm products, textiles and services are brought under the Gatt disciplines. Service exporters are expected to be among the main beneficiaries of the changes. The Uruguay Round has brought basic fair-trade principles, such as non-discrimination, to the services sector for the first time. The Uruguay Round intellectual property agreement is expected to encourage technology transfer - a critical step in promoting industrialised economies. The further opening of public procurement to international competitive bidding has been calculated to expand contract awards tenfold. The WTO will consolidate these trends at a time when world trade is becoming progressively more liberal. During the seven years it took to negotiate the Uruguay Round, more than 60 countries announced unilateral measures to open their markets. Even so, bilateral disputes are clearly not a thing of the past and profound differences between rich and poor nations over how the international economic order works hold the seeds of problems in the future. At the Uruguay Round signing in Marrakesh on 15 April, this view was clearly expressed by Pranab Mukherjee, the Indian commerce minister. Different levels of development between rich and poor nations, he said, have 'enough latent heat to melt down the most elaborately engineered structures'. In many sectors the WTO promises progress, but there is still much to do: Manufacturing: frontiers are becoming more open, with richer countries agreeing to cut their tariffs by 38 per cent in the period to 2002, from 6.3 per cent to 3.9 per cent. Some 43 per cent of imported industrial products will enter duty free, from around 20 per cent now. Industries that can especially expect to benefit include pharmaceuticals, construction, farm and medical equipment, steel, wood and paper. To aid developing countries, the WTO intends to reduce tariff escalation, allowing industrialising economies to export more processed versions of primary products. But anti-dumping remains a contentious issue. The Uruguay Round failed to impose tighter discipline over what is seen by those criticised for dumping as an instrument of non-tariff protectionism. Textiles and clothing: tariffs are set to be reduced, but exporters complain that most reductions will come at the end of the transition period to 2002. The US and Australia will retain higher tariffs than most of Europe and east Asia. Agriculture: the introduction of tariffs on imports - rather than non-tariff barriers - could afford EU farmers even more protection than at present. Other measures are more positive: under the associated so-called Blair House accord, subsidised dumping is to be limited over six years. This will affect the largest importers of subsidised EU and US cereals, including Russia and China. Also to open are rice markets such as Japan and South Korea, where barriers to farm imports must be converted into monetary tariffs and then reduced by 36 per cent. Tariffs on tropical products - the subject of a furious dispute in the EU over bananas - are to be cut by 40 per cent. The WTO agreement, therefore, offers a great deal of promise. New markets will open. At the Uruguay Round signing in Marrakesh, Tsotomu Hata, the then Japanese deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister said. 'As a result of the Uruguay Round, the Japanese market offers greater opportunities for success by foreign exporters, depending upon their efforts.' If the door to Japan and some other protected markets opens wider, the figures for increased exports given by Gatt experts may not be as over-optimistic as some of the more cautious trade analysts believe. Exporting remains a difficult business, but if the WTO works as planned, bureaucrats may help to make things easier for those at the sharp end - the practitioners - and the face of exporting will be transformed.

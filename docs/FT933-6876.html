			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Observer: Indyscribable job Who is going to replace Andreas Whittam Smith as chief executive of Newspaper Publishing, parent of The Independent and Independent on Sunday? There is some urgency to fill the post since the planned financial restructuring cannot get under way until the new chief executive has had a chance to see what is required. The idea was to have someone on board in a month or so, but, as gossip on Fleet Street has it, this is proving a difficult slot to fill. One senior newspaper executive, who declined an approach, says that it is not at all clear where the duties of the new chief executive will begin and end. The plan is that Whittam Smith, who owns 8 per cent of the business, will concentrate on editing the Independent and reversing the decline in circulation. However, he will remain on the board as deputy chairman. So who will really be in charge of the business - the editor/deputy chairman or the ceo? And what happens if the new ceo finds that the paper's problems are so intractable that they demand a change of editor? Would Whittam Smith dare recommend that the job be offered to someone as strong-willed as Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil, who has been doing his own job for a decade and is said to be desperate for a move? Sounds like headhunters Tyzack are going to have their work cut out if they are to find the right person.</p>

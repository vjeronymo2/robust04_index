			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, April 27 (TASS) -- It is doubtful that the  murder of parliament's lower house member Andrey Ayzderdzis was  connected with his business activities before his election to  parliament. The murder was "more motivated by politics than  crime", Valeriy Khomyakov, consultant of the "new regional  policy" parliamentary group of which the murdered deputy was a  member, said in an iterview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday.    At the same time, he did not preclude a chance that the  lawmaker was killed in connection with his publication of the  list of 266 major criminals of the Russian underworld with their  nicknames. Khomyakov called this publication "a possible  version".    According to the consultant, Ayzderdzis was "out of big  politics" and leaned to right-wing centrists according to his  sympathies.    The lawmaker was in high moods at the group's meeting on  Tuesday when legislators saw him the last time. He did not show  any signs of anxiety, Khomyakov said.    The "New Regional Policy" group at the lower house made a  statement on Wednesday concerning the murder of independent  legislator Ayzderdzis on April 26 who was shot point blank at  the entrance to his house in Moscow's satellite city of Khimki.    The statement says that a new name was added to the bleak  list of contract murders, increasingly committed for political  reasons. A deputy of the supreme body of power was killed for  the first time.    Criminals committed a heinous crime against an individual  which become a common feature in Russia of late. The gaunlet  was again thrown to society, the president, the government and  parliament.    The state, bodies of authority and law enforcement organs  again strikingly displayed their helplessness and flimsiness in  the struggle against crime.    Further passivity and abstention from tough, energetic and  resolute measures aimed at stopping and eradicating crimes and  wrong-doings, puts into growing jeopardy both the life of  individual people and the very existence of Russian statehood,  the document stresses.    The parliamentary group demanded that "the president of the  Russian Federation as guarantor of human rights and freedoms  should use his constitutional powers to the utmost for immediate  and uncompromising work to establish law and order in this  important sphere of our every-day life".    The statement by the group was also signed by lower house  speaker Ivan Rybkin.    Following the return of the lower house's delegation from  the  place of the murder, speaker Rybkin announced a closed session  of the house. Deputies voted at the start of the session that  Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin and heads of law enforcement  bodies of Russia should be present at the meeting.</p>

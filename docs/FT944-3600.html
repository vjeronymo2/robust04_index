			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Test for Jakarta's free trade support Tariff protection for Indonesia's first olefin products plant is emerging as a test case of Indonesia's commitment to free trade. The debate on protection for the petrochemicals plant follows last month's Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation summit hosted by President Suharto, at which he emerged as an enthusiastic supporter of free trade. The Apec declaration, signed by heads of state from 18 governments including the US, agreed to draw up concrete plans in the next year for free trade and investment in the Pacific rim region by 2020. Mr Peter Gontha, a well-connected entrepreneur, has submitted a request to the Indonesian government for tariffs of between 35 and 40 per cent on imports of olefin products, petroleum-based chemicals widely used to manufacture textiles. The tariffs would protect the Chandra Asri plant, due to come on stream next year, from cheaper Singaporean, Malaysian, Japanese and South Korean olefin imports. Mr Gontha argues the protection is necessary because it will take several years before Chandra Asri becomes profitable. However, many economists say protection would undermine President Suharto's commitment to free trade and the government's efforts to liberalise the economy. The issue is further complicated because President Suharto's son, Mr Bambang Trihatmodjo, is a shareholder in the Chandra Asri project. The issue of protection for the plant has become a hotly debated topic among government ministers. Mr Mar'ie Muhammad, Indonesia's minister of finance, has made clear he is not in favour of the proposal. The private sector has also been protesting. P T Teijin Indonesia Fibre, a Japanese synthetic fibres manufacturer, said its competitiveness would be hampered if President Suharto decided to impose import duties as high as 35 per cent or 40 per cent on olefin imports. 'If the government wants to satisfy Chandra Asri, which wants to rake in profits easily, just go ahead. But the government has to be ready if intermediate and downstream industries drop off one after another,' Mr Kikuo Hori, Teijin's president, was quoted as saying. Officials at Teijin are asking the Indonesian government to consider the matter seriously . A hearing on the protection is scheduled for today.</p>

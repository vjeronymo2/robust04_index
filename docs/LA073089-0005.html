			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE RECORD: KARAJAN: IN A CLASS BY HIMSELF  </P> <P> The recent death of conductor Herbert von Karajan ended a recording career that  spanned a full half-century -- exceeded in duration only by that of Leopold  Stokowski. Quantitatively, Karajan was -- and is likely to remain -- in a class  by himself, having made an estimated 800 recordings, with sales of 150 million  copies.  </P> <P> He recorded at least a bit of nearly everything including, forgettably, the  Baroque staples. But while one reads over and over of a primary identification  with the core 19th-Century symphonic repertory of Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert,  Schumann, Tchaikovsky, Bruckner and Richard Strauss, listeners who grew up in  the 1950s associate the name of Karajan above all with opera. It is in that  field that he may well have made his most enduring contributions to  discographic history.  </P> <P> Consider the following mid-1950s trio from EMI/Angel, studio-made with London's  magnificently responsive Philharmonia Orchestra, and now on CD: Verdi's  "Falstaff" (49668, 2 discs) -- Tito Gobbi in the title role -- an  interpretation of such darting lightness, wit and precision as to put all  subsequent recorded efforts (including Karajan's remake, c. 1980, for Philips)  to shame. Then, with Elisabeth Schwarzkopf as prima donna, the first commercial  edition of Richard Strauss' "Ariadne auf Naxos" (69296, 2 CDs), an unbeatable  combination of suavity and sinew. And the dazzlingly bright "Cosi fan Tutte" of  Mozart (with whom Karajan would prove increasingly uncomfortable in coming  years) featuring a dream ensemble including Schwarzkopf, Leopold Simoneau,  Rolando Panerai and Sesto Bruscantini (69635, 3 CDs).  </P> <P> Indispensable too are a couple of souvenirs of live performances: the  shatteringly intense 1956 Berlin "Lucia di Lammermoor," with Callas, di  Stefano, Panerai (available on several different labels), and the white-hot  1962 Salzburg Festival "Trovatore," with Price, Corelli, Simionato and  Bastianini (Price-Less 20791, 2 CDs).  </P> <P> These opera recordings disclose an incisiveness, an ear for dramatic pacing and  just balances that would in subsequent decades give way to an obsessive desire  for thickly textured, rhythmically sluggish washes of sound, irrespective of a  specific score's requirements. This soggy aural picture begins to assert itself  in Karajan's mannered Wagner "Ring," made between 1967 and 1972, now available  on a mass of Deutsche Grammophon CDs.  </P> <P> Better to recall the Karajan of the keen rhythmic edge and crystalline sonority  or, broadly, treatment of the composer as an individual rather than as a  reflection of the conductor's ego. Cherishable examples -- and there are some  from the later years -- include a grand and stormy 1959 Brahms Fourth Symphony,  with the Philharmonia Orchestra (EMI/Angel 69228); the searing 1985 Vienna  Philharmonic Tchaikovsky Fourth Symphony (Deutsche Grammophon 415 348);  hypnotically mysterious Sibelius, the Fourth and Fifth Symphonies, from the  late '70s with the Berlin Phil (EMI/Angel 69244).  </P> <P> To these should be added the somber but unfailingly mobile Berlin '69 Prokofiev  Fifth Symphony (DG 423 216); the sumptuous coupling (on EMI/Angel 69242) of  Hindemith's "Mathis der Maler" Symphony and the Bartok "Music for Strings,  Percussion and Celesta" dating from the late-1950s; and the noble yet taut 1965  Brahms "German Requiem" (DG 427 252), the second of his four recordings of that  work.  </P> <P> With his career so exhaustively documented by the microphones at every stage of  its unfolding, certain scores were done over and over again, giving Karajan the  opportunity to refine the life out of them. To cite the most obvious example,  he recorded the Beethoven symphonies so often -- the entire cycle at least five  times -- that only the most manic comparison shopper is able to keep them  straight, or to care.  </P> <P> The Brahms symphonies approach this sort of death by multiplication as well, as  do select works by Dvorak, Schubert and Richard Strauss.  </P> <P> Karajan achieved some of his finest latter-years work with repertory new to  him. For instance, the Mahler Sixth and Ninth symphonies (DG 415 099 and 417  726, respectively, 2 CDs each), both dating from his last decade and both  combining spontaneity with depth of expression. Remarkable too are the warmth  and vigorousness of his 1979 recordings of the first three Tchaikovsky  symphonies (DG, various packagings).  </P> <P> Karajan was, in his later productions, noted for manipulating singers to  conform to his vision of opera as basically an orchestral form. If he did not  go quite so far with his instrumental soloists, their individuality was  nonetheless more often than not subordinated to his will.  </P> <P> Yet on one occasion he was confronted with talent so intimidating that he had  no choice but to become part of an ensemble, joining Sviatoslav Richter, David  Oistrakh and Mstislav Rostropovitch to create the monumental 1969 version of  Beethoven's Triple Concerto (EMI/Angel 69032).  </P> <P> At other -- equally distant -- times less glamorous associations produced  felicitous results, such as Karajan's DG teaming with the late Christian Ferras  in the violin concertos of Sibelius (419871) and Tchaikovsky (423 224).  </P> <P> And, as further evidence of the humanity suspected to be lurking behind that  parched-leather face, imperiously eyeing us from countless record jackets, try  the Offenbach overtures supermaestro did, ever so lithely and insinuatingly,  with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1981 (DG 400 044).  </P></p>

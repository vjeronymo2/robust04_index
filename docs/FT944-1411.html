			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / International Company News: Bertelsmann seals Ricordi takeover Bertelsmann, the German media and publishing group, is to merge Ricordi, one of the oldest and best-known names in Italian music publishing, with BMG Ariola, its Italian subsidiary. This completes the friendly takeover launched in August. The German group also announced yesterday that BMG Ricordi, as the new company will be known, would seek strategic partners from the retailing sector to help develop Ricordi's chain of music and book stores across Italy. The sum paid by Bertelsmann for a 74.3 per cent stake in Ricordi has never been revealed, but the purchase this summer prompted a bout of patriotic distress in Milan, where the publisher is based. The merged group will have combined sales of more than L350bn (Dollars 214m) and just under 1,000 employees. Established at the beginning of the last century, Ricordi is closely linked with the world-famous opera house of La Scala. In the second half of the 19th century, Ricordi's position as official printer of some of Italy's best-known composers, such as Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti and Verdi gave the publisher a virtual right of veto over the choice of works for La Scala's operatic season. Since then it has diversified into popular music. Mr Arnold Bahlmann, senior vice-president of BMG International, which groups Bertelsmann's music publishing interests, confirmed yesterday that the German company had bought up the minority interests in Ricordi and owned 100 per cent of the parent company, G. Ricordi. However, Mr Bahlmann reassured Italians that after the merger the artistic heritage of Ricordi would be preserved through a separate subsidiary called Casa Ricordi, which would group together the classical sheet music activities of the publisher, and the collections of valuable manuscripts and documents. 'Neither the composers, nor the manuscripts, nor the money are leaving Italy, because we have invested a lot in the country and we want to earn it back,' he said. Apart from Casa Ricordi, BMG Ricordi will concentrate on four core areas  - records, pop music publishing, video and multimedia  - which it hopes will dovetail with Bertelsmann's international publishing and multimedia ambitions. Mr Bahlmann said the group wanted to realise the potential of the 22 Ricordi shops in 15 Italian cities, four of which have been turned into multimedia megastores. He admitted the German group did not have retailing expertise, and was seeking a partner. Negotiations have not begun, but the group had received some expressions of interest.</p>

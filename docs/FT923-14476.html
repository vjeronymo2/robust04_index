			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (32): The walk through the warehouse no longer needed - Case Study / Hayward Promotions / Michael Powell describes how a small children's book distributor is now able to forecast with much greater accuracy the stock levels it should keep. EVEN A relatively small business can benefit from custom additions to standard packages. Hayward Promotions of Park Royal stocks and distributes children's books and story tapes to the toy trade and prominent chain stores. The company, which was set up 10 years ago, uses the Multisoft accounting package on its Elonex machine, running Xenix, and has a turnover of Pounds 1.6m. According to Colin MacMillan, managing director of Hayward, the company recognised that it had a stockholding problem in 1990. The company deals in thousands of titles, and its control and forecasting mechanisms were manual. 'We would walk around the warehouse to see what we had in stock, and act on that. This would cause overstocking of some lines, and stock outs of others. It's very annoying to have an order and not be able to fulfil it.' Publishers only print a certain number of copies of a title, which can sell out very quickly. If the correct number is not ordered, sales can be permanently lost. The company's Multisoft accounting system had a stock ledger, but there were not sufficient analytical capabilities in it to allow Hayward to build accurate forecasts of stock requirements. To solve this difficulty, Mr MacMillan called in an old acquaintance, David Halstead, of software house The Transition. He designed a forecasting system which would be able to use a profile of the company's monthly turnover to show where extra stock would be needed, to cater for cyclical trends and sales patterns. The system would use current turnover for each item and project future turnover based on that. This would enable Hayward to buy in the correct quantities of stock, based on demand. The initial stage of the project was implemented over a period of three months, and showed immediate benefits. Order fulfilment increased to 90 per cent. 'One of the great bonuses for us was the reduction in time that our management had to spend sorting out our mix of stock,' Mr MacMillan says. The program was developed using a C programming language code generator called Fred, from a UK company, Forefront. According to Transition's sales manager, John Burden, C is used for multi-platform support - 'we try to provide standard packages as much as possible, with some bespoke portions where necessary.' The program uses Multisoft's file structures for its data. The development was done on a time and materials basis, bills being presented and paid as it progressed. The total cost was around Pounds 4,000. Transition is now adding demographic analysis of the population of parents throughout the country. This will enable Hayward Promotions' agents to target areas on which to concentrate their sales efforts. 'We can push a button to get data on best sellers and so on, to send to our agents all over the country. 'There are 30,000 children's titles available, and we keep 6,000, so we could not do this by hand. The system tells us what we need,' says Colin MacMillan.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CRITICAL OF FIRM WITH NO PERMIT, GADFLY HAS NO LICENSE FOR HIS OWN  </P> <P> Former Lawndale Planning Commissioner Gary McDonald, a longtime city activist  who last month publicly lambasted a local business for having no building  permits, has operated his development consulting business for almost six months  without a business license.  </P> <P> McDonald's license expired June 30, according to city officials, and he faces  administrative fines and a possible misdemeanor charge.  </P> <P> Asked about his license, McDonald, who has announced his intention to run for  mayor in April, said he will renew it.  </P> <P> "I just forgot," he said. "I more or less put it off."  </P> <P> Mayor Sarann Kruse said McDonald, a longtime political opponent, should be held  accountable for the violation.  </P> <P> "Mr. McDonald is the first one to criticize anyone who makes an honest  mistake," Kruse said, but when McDonald makes a mistake, "he expects everybody  to laugh it off because it's just Gary."  </P> <P> Assistant City Manager Paula Cone said McDonald was sent a notice in May  warning him that his license was about to elapse and another warning a month  after it expired.  </P> <P> Cone said operating a business without a license is a misdemeanor punishable by  a fine of up to $1,000 and six months in jail. She said the city also charges  violators 10% of the cost of the license for every month it is not renewed.  </P> <P> That means the $74 license will now cost McDonald $111.  </P> <P> During a City Council meeting last month, McDonald criticized the operators of  Unified Schools of America because the automotive trade school had performed  construction work on its Lawndale facility without obtaining building permits.  </P> <P> McDonald, who said he saw the construction work during a visit to the school,  charged that it failed to meet city codes and endangered the occupants.  </P> <P> "I was absolutely shocked at what I saw," he told the council.  </P> <P> The school, in the 15000 block of Hawthorne Boulevard, opened its doors in  October, defying a City Council decision to deny the school a business license.  A week later, city officials issued two misdemeanor citations against the  school for operating without a business license. The city has also cited the  school for violations of the Fire and Building codes.  </P> <P> In an interview this week, Councilman Larry Rudolph, a friend and political  ally of McDonald, said many businesses in the city are operating without a  license. "I don't think it's right to single anybody out," he said.  </P> <P> But Rudolph added: "Gary McDonald shouldn't be treated any better or any worse"  than any other violator.  </P> <P> Cone said it is difficult to determine how many businesses in the city are  operating without a license because many owners do not notify the city when  they move out of town or close their businesses.  </P> <P> She said the city usually fines violators but does not normally send inspectors  to determine if a business is operating without a license. If city officials do  learn that a business is in violation, she said, a misdemeanor citation is  issued.  </P> <P> McDonald, an activist who is politically allied with the council majority,  acknowledged that his failure to renew his business license provides fuel for  his political opponents.  </P> <P> "I'm negligent in getting a business license," he said. "But it's not that  earth-shattering."  </P></p>

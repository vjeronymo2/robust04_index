			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN SHOULD DO MORE, D'AMATO SAYS  </P> <P> Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato criticized Japan on Monday as "greedy" and "repugnant"  for not sending more money or troops to the Persian Gulf to join American  forces against Iraq.  </P> <P> "They are acting totally within the character that they usually do," D'Amato, a  New York Republican, said of the Japanese.  </P> <P> "They are motivated by profit, greed and avarice. For them not to step forward  and make a substantial financial contribution to this mission is  unconscionable.  </P> <P> "Theirs is an attitude that I think really is repugnant," D'Amato said of the  Japanese.  </P> <P> Officials at the Japanese Consulate in Washington said their country has  pledged $1 billion in aid, mostly through transporting equipment to Saudi  Arabia. They also said Japan stands ready with further economic help to Egypt,  Jordan and Turkey.  </P> <P> "Instead of criticizing other countries, it is more important to strengthen our  cooperation, and Japan is prepared to cooperate further with the United  States," said spokesman Noriyuki Shikata.  </P></p>

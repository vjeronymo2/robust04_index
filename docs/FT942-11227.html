			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Blagden calls for Pounds 26m to help pay off borrowings Blagden Industries, the steel drum maker hit by recession in continental Europe, yesterday announced a 5-for-9 rights issue to raise almost Pounds 26m net of expenses. The group is proposing to issue up to 25.86m new ordinary shares at 105p a share. The shares closed 2p lower yesterday at 130p. The issue was well flagged at the end of March, when the group passed its final dividend after diving Pounds 10.6m into the red for 1993. The losses, which included Pounds 13.3m of exceptional items and interest of Pounds 3.23m, breached the interest cover covenant with the group's main lender. Part of the proceeds of the rights issue will be used to pay off Pounds 10m of the debt with the main lender, which has conditionally agreed a replacement unsecured facility up to January 1996. Blagden said the rest of the proceeds would go initially towards reducing outstanding bank borrowings across the group. In addition, it is expecting shortly to enter into a formal agreement for the sale of its plastics packaging businesses for Pounds 6.8m. Mr Richard Searle, who became chief executive seven weeks ago, said yesterday that group gearing would fall from above 80 per cent to about 25 per cent following the issue. The strengthening of the balance sheet would put Blagden in a position to finance the strategic development of its chemicals and protective equipment divisions. The group warned that there had been no significant changes in its main markets in the first four months of this year. The rights issue is fully underwritten by NM Rothschild and brokers are Panmure Gordon. COMMENT The rights issue will bring much needed relief from financial pressures, which will give the group breathing space to choose its own route forward. There is plenty of room for better margins in the packaging division - the rest is up to the new chief executive and his team. If they succeed in creating a more balanced company built around the mature steel drum business  -a good cash cow - Blagden could become a much more exciting bet than it has been for some time.</p>

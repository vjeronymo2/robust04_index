			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Dai-Ichi Kangyo cuts forecast DAI-ICHI Kangyo Bank, a leading Japanese bank, halved its interim pre-tax estimates yesterday due to higher-than-expected write-offs for bad loans and a fall in income due to lower profit margins. Other banks, which are due to announce their half-year results at the end of next month, are expected to follow suit, as an increasing number of corporate borrowers are becoming unable to pay back loan interests amid the prolonged economic slump. This is forcing the banks to write off the bad loans. Combined bad loans at 21 leading banks stood at Y12,770bn at the end of last March, and industry analysts expect the figure for end-September to have risen to around Y14,000bn. At the same time, revenues at the banks have been squeezed by a slump in lending. For the first six months to September, the outstanding balance of loans at 11 leading commercial banks fell by 0.5 per cent to Y222,300bn, its first fall on record. DKB halved its pre-tax profit for the first half to September from its original forecast, to total Y20bn (Dollars 184m), down 56.8 per cent from the year-ago figure. Ordinary income for the first six months is expected to fall 17.2 per cent to Y1,290bn, instead of Y1,300bn. The bank's after-tax profits are expected to fall 44.8 per cent to Y16bn instead of the earlier forecasted Y24bn. For the full year to March, DKB expects pre-tax profits to plunge 62.1 per cent to Y40bn on a 15.3 per cent fall in ordinary income to Y2,500bn. After-tax profits are projected to decline 39.6 per cent to Y32bn.</p>

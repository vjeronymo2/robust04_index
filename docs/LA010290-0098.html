			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHAMIR RETREATS, ENDING CRISIS;  </P> <P> WON'T FIRE SCIENCE MINISTER  </P> <P> Defusing a political crisis that threatened the coalition government, Prime  Minister Yitzhak Shamir today canceled his decision to fire Science Minister  Ezer Weizman for alleged contacts with the PLO.  </P> <P> In a political compromise, Weizman agreed to quit the decision-making inner  Cabinet. The announcement came after Shamir summoned Weizman today.  </P> <P> The agreement between Weizman and Shamir ended two days of intense efforts to  save the coalition of the conservative Likud bloc that Shamir heads and the  center-left Labor Party of which Weizman is a senior member.  </P> <P> The crisis was the worst to shake a Likud-Labor alliance in six years and  concerned a major issue that has split the nation -- how to resolve Israel's  festering conflict with Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> On Sunday, Shamir gave Weizman written notice that he was fired as of today  because of contacts with the PLO in which Weizman allegedly divulged secret  Israeli strategy that he learned in meetings of the 12-member inner Cabinet.  </P> <P> Weizman told reporters after the five-minute meeting that Shamir had not  confronted him with evidence of the PLO contacts.  </P> <P> "Firstly, the crisis is over. Secondly, all attempts to say I am guilty or not  I don't accept because for me guilt is a matter of being brought to court or  not," Weizman told reporters.  </P> <P> Weizman, 65, a former defense minister who defected from Likud, said Shamir  took back the dismissal letter.  </P> <P> The arrangement was worked out before the meeting and finalized in Shamir's  office "with smiles and a handshake," Weizman said, adding he will go ahead  with a planned trip to Moscow on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Under the compromise, Weizman will remain science minister in the overall,  26-member Cabinet but will no longer sit in sessions of the inner Cabinet,  where government strategy is decided.  </P> <P> Eliakim Rubinstein, the Cabinet secretary and a top Shamir aide, said Shamir  will consider restoring Weizman to the inner Cabinet in 18 months.  </P> <P> "The prime minister stressed to Mr. Weizman the seriousness with which he  viewed all contacts with terrorist organizations, leading them the PLO,"  Rubinstein said.  </P> <P> Labor had demanded that Weizman not be ousted without a chance to see and  respond to evidence against him. Labor leaders were split, however, over how  far to go in defending Weizman, who has openly advocated talks with the PLO  despite government policy against any dealings with the organization.  </P> <P> In Baghdad, Iraq, a Palestine Liberation Organization official said Shamir had  sent a message to PLO leader Yasser Arafat a few months ago on a possible  settlement of the Mideast crisis.  </P> <P> "I wonder why Shamir is making a lot of noise about Weizman's contacts with the  PLO when he and other senior Israeli politicians made similar contacts," said  Bassam Abu Sharif, Arafat's political adviser.  </P> <P> Abu Sharif, who is known to have contacted Israeli officials on behalf of the  PLO, declined to reveal the precise contents of the message or say who was the  intermediary.  </P></p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / German rail sale opposition The Treuhand will today meet in Berlin to stem growing opposition to the sale of Deutsche Waggonbau (DWA), the east German manufacturer of rolling stock. DWA is being sold to Advent International, the US-based venture capital group. The meeting follows sharp criticism from Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, prime minister of Saxony, who yesterday said he would resist any plans by the Treuhand to close one of the plants in his state.</p>

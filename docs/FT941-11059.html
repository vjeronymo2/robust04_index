			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Le Pen stays at the top Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen won re-election at the weekend without opposition as president of France's National Front, but he hit out against a sign of possible restiveness with his 22-year command of the party, by complaining of 'clannish manoeuvrings' for posts on the party's 100-strong central committee, writes David Buchan in Paris. The tough line taken by the Balladur government, in particular its interior minister, Mr Charles Pasqua, has tended to marginalise and silence the NF in recent months. Demonstrators protesting in Paris on Saturday against recent anti-immigration legislation carried a banner reading 'Pasqua copies Le Pen'. However, a recent opinion poll showed 11 per cent support for the NF in this June's Euro-elections, not far off its showing of 12.4 per cent in last March's national parliamentary elections.</p>

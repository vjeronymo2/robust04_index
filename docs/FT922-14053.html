			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / O&amp;Y hits hurdle in plan to pay debt OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the debt- burdened property developer, is struggling to find a buyer for a 36-storey Toronto office building it needs to sell to fund overdue debt obligations. Problems in raising funds from Exchange Tower, which houses O&amp;Y's head office and the Toronto Stock Exchange, mirror a nervousness in financial markets this week over O&amp;Y's inability to meet payments on its CDollars 20bn (Pounds 9.7bn) debt. Share prices of Canadian banks with a large exposure to O&amp;Y, as well as Trizec, the property developer in which O&amp;Y has a 35 per cent interest, fell to their lowest in a year in Toronto yesterday. In addition, an O&amp;Y spokesman confirmed the company had failed to make interest payments on a USDollars 800m (Pounds 458.3m) Eurobond secured by one of the buildings in Manhattan's World Financial Centre. Last week, O&amp;Y failed to make a principal payment on a CDollars 450m loan to finance construction of Toronto's 68-storey Scotia Plaza. A Toronto property financier said yesterday O&amp;Y has been involved in 'a fair bit of activity' to line up a Canadian or foreign buyer for Exchange Tower. O&amp;Y has been trying to sell Exchange Tower to raise funds to redeem a CDollars 300m commercial paper programme secured by the building. About CDollars 150m to CDollars 200m of the paper is still outstanding. No payments have been made in recent weeks. The company last week redeemed principal plus accrued interest on a second CP programme following the receipt of funds from the sale of its controlling interest in Interprovincial PipeLine of Calgary. Among the options for Exchange Tower are a takeover by some O&amp;Y bank lenders until another buyer can be found, and a sale-leaseback arrangement under which O&amp;Y would regain ownership once its financial condition improves. The search for a buyer is complicated by the steep fall in Toronto property prices in the past two years. One property analyst said any pension fund or bank which bought Exchange Tower at a depressed price faced having to write down the value of its other property holdings. He said only a handful of Canadian institutions had the resources to buy Exchange Tower, while foreign investors were more interested in cheaper buildings in US cities such as Houston and Dallas.

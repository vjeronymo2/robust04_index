			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Brussels wants to stop UK social policy opt-out The European Commission wants to end Britain's social policy opt-out after 1996, it emerged yesterday. In a confidential document sent to member governments on the working of the social protocol agreed at Maastricht two years ago, the commission makes clear the British opt-out must not be allowed to continue indefinitely. 'The commission firmly believes the conference of representatives of the governments of the EU's member states to be convened in 1996 must find a way to return to a single legal basis for community action in the social field,' it argues. British ministers see the opt-out as a lasting achievement that will improve the country's competitiveness by keeping down labour costs. They believe they are winning the argument inside the EU on the need for a more flexible European labour market through less regulation of social affairs. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, yesterday criticised the commission's efforts to press for a shorter working week or job-sharing as answers to European unemployment. 'These are not viable long-term solutions,' he told a meeting of European business leaders. 'If high employment could be brought about by short working hours than Europe would have no unemployment at all'. Mr Davies said European workers already worked fewer hours a year than their American or Japanese counterparts and many of the proposals on job sharing would merely add to employer costs and increase not reduce unemployment. He also denounced the commission's determination to introduce European-wide works councils for large companies with plants in more than one member state. It was inconceivable this could contribute to competitiveness or generating employment.</p>

			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Finnish PM tries to calm debate on EC entry FINLAND'S centre-right coalition is to publish a document today setting out the arguments for and against joining the European Community. However, Mr Esko Aho, the country's prime minister, is urging his own Centre party not to take an early public stance on whether Finland should apply. His appeal reflects a split inside the party over the issue. The government's document, which ministers hope will stimulate a national public debate, is to be discussed in parliament on Monday, but the government is not expected to make a decision until next month at the earliest, and possibly not until the spring. What that decision is will depend largely on the attitude of the Centre party, which is the largest in Mr Aho's four-party coalition. Centre has won support in urban areas but its traditional power base remains central and northern Finland where it reflects the interests of farmers, many of whom remain hostile to, or sceptical about, the EC. Mr Aho had appeared in recent months to be moving towards support for an EC application. The Conservatives - the second largest party in his coalition - want an early government declaration in support of EC entry, as have the main opposition Social Democrats. Finland's main employers' associations and national trade union organisations are also backing EC membership. Registered unemployment in Finland rose to 9.8 per cent in November, for a total of 243,000 people. This is the highest jobless total ever recorded in the country.</p>

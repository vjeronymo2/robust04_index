			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: Reichmanns sell secret stake in NY development CANADA'S Reichmann family has sold a secret stake in New York's World Financial Centre, acknowledging a hitherto undisclosed partnership between themselves and a company controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family. Evidence of the Reichmann-Bronfman partnership in a company called Battery Park Holdings (BPH), which owns 35 per cent of the 7.6m sq ft World Financial Centre, has sparked a furore in Canada and the US. Authorities in Canada are investigating whether the investment by Carena Developments, a Bronfman-controlled property holding company, in BPH, violated stock exchange disclosure requirements. The investment is worth USDollars 120m. Another Bronfman company, Hees International Bancorp, provided a loan to finance the Reichmanns' purchase of their 50 per cent stake in BPH. Creditors of Olympia &amp; York, the Reichmann-owned real estate developer which is under bankruptcy protection in Canada and the UK, have responded angrily to the disclosure of the Reichmanns' stake in BPH. The creditors have gone to considerable lengths to probe the extent of the Reichmanns' business interests in order to generate as much cash as possible for O&amp;Y. Carena said yesterday the Reichmanns had sold their 50 per cent stake in BPH to Mr Richard Shiff, a Toronto property investor. Terms were not disclosed, but the company which holds Mr Shiff's stake in BPH still owes Dollars 120m to Hees. Carena continues to own the other half of BPH. The Reichmanns' only previously-announced link to the Bronfmans was the shareholdings of O&amp;Y and Carena in Trizec, North America's biggest publicly-traded real estate developer. O&amp;Y's Trizec stake was reduced from 36 per cent to 25 per cent earlier this year as a result of a share issue. Mr Robert Harding, Hees's chief operating officer, insisted yesterday: 'We've done the right thing throughout.' He said Hees's and Carena's dealings with the Reichmanns were subject to the same confidentiality requirements as a banking relationship. Carena earlier hoped that its investment in the World Financial Centre would facilitate a restructuring of Trizec's complex ownership. Discussions on this restructuring have been suspended since O&amp;Y's financial problems surfaced. O&amp;Y's shares in Trizec form part of the collateral on its CDollars 13.5bn (USDollars 10.8bn) debt.</p>

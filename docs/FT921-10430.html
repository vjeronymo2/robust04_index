			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / International Company News: WPPSS bond suit gains ground THE long-running bondholder suit involving Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) has moved a step closer to resolution. A federal appeals court has approved a settlement which would pay around Dollars 800m to investors who purchased certain WPPSS bonds over a decade ago. The settlement, if finally upheld, would represent the largest successful investor suit brought in the US. The investors involved bought bonds sold to help finance the construction of two nuclear power plants in the north-western US. The plants were commissioned in 1976 but abandoned in 1982 after cost overruns. Default on the Dollars 2.25bn bond issue followed in 1983. The bondholders' lawsuits, which were first filed over a decade ago, alleged fraud and securities law violations by WPPSS, its directors, and cities and utilities which participated in the project. The settlement was reached in 1988, but legal wranglings between the various interested parties has prevented any payout. The appeals court ruling threw out challenges to the settlement from one bondholder grouping and from some post-default investors. If and when the settlement is paid out, the 20,000 people who bought bonds between 1977 and 1983 are unlikely to share in the full Dollars 800m. Some money will be set aside for investors who bought bonds after 1983, while the class-action lawyers have asked for over Dollars 100m in fees. This figure has been cut by one judge to nearer Dollars 40m, but the matter is also under appeal.</p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / The ERM: EC economies, the opportunities and risks - Germany In the words of Mr Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, the weekend shakeout offers a 'breathing space'. That will allow Bonn and the Bundesbank to concentrate on the country's most intractable problems: the inter-related issues of the control of public spending and inflation, writes Christopher Parkes. On balance any further loss of competitiveness due to the D-Mark's appreciating against currencies in its main customer countries - notably France - is expected to be short-lived and relatively unimportant. What is important is that manufacturing industry, largely re-equipped during the late eighties and the unification boom, is well-armed to respond more quickly than competitors to any upturn in demand. But unemployment will probably continue to rise as industry counters recession and its built-in structural problems. The weekend decisions removed the need to support weak ERM currencies, one source of distortion in German money supply. According to the central bank's calculations, above-target growth in M3 is a sure indicator of a future increase in inflation, expected to average 4 per cent this year and 3.5 in 1994. The biggest danger to money supply is state borrowing to fill gaps in government budgets caused mainly by the need for transfers to support the eastern Lander. The government is committed to federal spending cuts of DM25bn (Pounds 9.7bn) next year, and while the Bundesbank is reluctant to increase the pressure publicly, it is clear that even more rigorous and longer-term consolidation is necessary. Bonn has a chance to concentrate on the main domestic task in hand, unhampered by the monetary and political constraints of the EMS. The Bundesbank, aware of the temptations to governmental largesse in the run-up to next year's federal and state elections, will not hesitate to punish any wavering by tightening monetary policy.</p>

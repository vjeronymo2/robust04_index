			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: P&amp;G, Unilever soap wars leave market spinning - Consumers have yet to pick a winner as P&amp;G launches a new detergent Under harsh artificial sunlight, deep inside Procter &amp; Gamble's laundry laboratory in Brussels, there seems no doubt: Ariel Futur, P&amp;G's ripost in the Great European Soap War, and launched today in the UK, is superior to Unilever's Persil and Omo Power detergents, famous for their textile-damaging side-effects. Be it blood, oil, or other nasty, staining substances, Ariel Futur, cleans best, claim P&amp;G staff. But the reality of the Pounds 6bn (Dollars 9.5bn) marketplace, they acknowledge, is more complicated than life in the laboratory. Consumers, bombarded by claims and counter-claims by the two companies, are confused. Unilever launched its Power products this spring, hailing them as a leap forward as significant for detergents as transistors were for electronics. P&amp;G hit back with assertions that Power damaged clothes, and showed tattered underwear to prove it. Independent arbiters failed to settle the dispute: consumer associations in some countries slammed Unilever's new detergent, while others endorsed it. Both sides claim they have increased the market shares of their ranges of detergents during the summer. But Unilever admits that Persil and Omo Power sales have fallen after every bout of bad publicity, and have had to be rebuilt through extensive promotions and advertising. Into this bruising world of no-holds barred marketing, P&amp;G is launching Ariel Futur (as spelt on Continental packaging; it is called Future for the British). Futur 'represents a considerable technological advance in washing powders', says P&amp;G. With its manganese catalyst 'accelerator' in Power, Unilever 'stuck a rocket motor on a Ford Cortina. The detergent can't take the power', a P&amp;G spokesman said during the Power furore this summer. 'With Futur, we've redesigned the car from the wheel nuts up.' More enzymes have been added to improve stain removal and an inhibitor helps prevent dyes transferring from one garment to another in the wash. A new bleach and water softener complete the formula. It incorporates 11 new technologies and has taken five years to devise. About 25 per cent less soap powder is needed per wash compared with existing detergents, reducing packaging by 30 per cent. Unilever makes similar claims for its Power detergents. To substantiate its in-house findings, P&amp;G commissioned three independent, anonymous test institutes to compare Futur with Omo Power. Overall, Futur was better than Power at removing food, body soil, general soil and grease stains but worse at cleaning drink stains. But close reading of the results shows that the competing powders are more evenly matched, making it hard for consumers to decide which one is superior in the kitchen, rather than ideal laboratory conditions. Taking a wide range of stains, one institute scored 14 'wins' for Futur over Power, six draws where neither was better and two losses to Power. The other two institutes scored 11-5-2 and 14-11-2 respectively. 'Power is about the best of competing products,' a P&amp;G executive acknowledges, but its Achilles heel is the catalyst. P&amp;G says despite lower concentrations of the catalyst in the current version of Power, it is still attacking a wide range of dyes. Unilever says all detergents damage textiles and Power's adverse effects will only become apparent outside the normal lifespan of a garment. Meanwhile, it is searching for a way to stop the catalyst reacting badly with some dyes. Futur was launched in its first market, Germany, some six weeks ago. Officially launched in the UK today, it will not hit shop shelves until January, accompanied by a Pounds 7m television advertising campaign. P&amp;G promises no knocking copy. Nevertheless, Unilever is bracing itself for further bloody encounters.</p>

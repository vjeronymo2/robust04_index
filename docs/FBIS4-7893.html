			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 4 (BTA) -- A Turkish parliamentary  delegation, led by the President of the Turkish Grand National  Assembly Husamettin Cindoruk, arrived on a three-day official  visit here today. The delegation includes MP's of the Social  Democratic Populist Party, the Welfare Party, the True Path  Party and the Motherland Party. "This is the first visit of a  head of the Turkish Parliament in the last 20 years and it is an  indication of good neighbourly relations," Aleksandur Yordanov,  chairman of the Bulgarian National Assembly, said welcoming the  Turkish guests.    Late in the afternoon, the Turkish MP's conferred with Mr.  Yordanov. "We share similar views on all issues with the  exception of the commitment of Turkish troops to the UN  peace-keeping forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina," Mr. Cindoruk  said after the meeting. According to him, it is not a case of  differences of opinion but rather of the interpretations of the  United Nations' decision. "We respect the Bulgarian position  (on non-involvement of the Balkan countries in the  Yugoconflict)," the president of the Turkish Parliament said.  "The blue helmets going to Bosnia are not Turkish troops but  troops of the United Nations," Mr. Cindoruk argues. According  to the chairman of the Bulgarian Parliament Aleksandur Yordanov,  instead of resolving the problem, the presence of Turkish blue  helmets in Bosnia and Herzegovina would cause further escalation  of the tensions based on historical experience in this region.    "Both Bulgaria and Turkey see the promotion of their  commercial and economic relations mainly within Black Sea  Economic Cooperation, together with other countries in the  region like Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Greece," Mr. Yordanov  said after the meeting. He explained Bulgaria's stand on  Turkey's active efforts to accelerate the formation of a  parliamentary assembly of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation.  "Bulgaria believes such a parliamentary body could only be  instituted on the basis of a well-developed economic  cooperation," Mr. Yordanov said. According to him, there are  some other forums for parliamentary contacts, like the Council  of Europe and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe. Mr. Cindoruk sees no obstacles to the development of  Bulgarian-Turkish economic relations.    Aleksandur Yordanov raised with his Turkish counterpart the  problem about Bulgarian immovable property in Istanbul: The  Bulgarian Church, hospital and school.    Mr. Cindoruk conferred today with Foreign Minister Stanislav  Daskalov. They agreed that bilateral relations are making  positive progress and discussed the possibilities for their  further promotion in various fields, the Foreign Ministry press  centre said. Mr. Cindoruk and Mr. Daskalov were unanimous about  the need to strengthen Balkan stability by peaceful means.  Black Sea Economic Cooperation was also discussed during the  meeting.</p>

			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Hanson expects UK and US acquisitions LORD HANSON, chairman of the Anglo-US conglomerate that bears his name, yesterday said the group planned to build its core businesses through acquisitions that were more likely in the US and UK than in mainland Europe. 'Bargains will continue to arise both here and in the US', he said in London. Hanson has recently said it is keen to build and expand seven core businesses. In the US they are Peabody Coal; Cavenham Forest; Beazer USA; Grove Industries; and SCM Chemicals. In the UK they are Imperial Tobacco; and building products groups, including ARC and London Brick. Quoting from a private speech he gave to the Worshipful Company of Actuaries on Thursday, he said: 'The days of Hanson's growth through acquisition are not over. It's the timing which counts. At present disposing of small peripheral businesses and adding new ones to our core companies is probably right.' While the conglomerate is still looking at the possibility of buying businesses in Europe he warned: 'There are drawbacks which prompt my strong belief in the priority of our present trans-Atlantic companies. There are untold legal . . . financial and union problems in direct corporate investment in the EC . . . which require a cautious approach. Look at France. The country's road system paralysed by farmers and truckers. Corporation tax in Germany, after eastern European surcharge and local income tax . . . could be as high as 65 per cent - double the UK rate.' He added: 'I believe the recoveries in the economies of the United States and the UK which were expected to take place by the end of 1992 are more likely to be delayed until the end of 1993 and a lot of companies . . . that just managed to hang in there last year are now in worse trouble . . . they're saying 'Well, we would like Hanson's help'.' He warned the actuaries that corporate governance has been 'somewhat overworked of late'. He said: 'Changes won't take place by loading the board with non-executive directors. Their role is not apart . . . as watchdogs; it's part of the single board. How often do companies need watchdogs? What they need are hound-dogs who will help the company hunt down its targets.'</p>

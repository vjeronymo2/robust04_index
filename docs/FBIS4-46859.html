			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Olga Akulova report: "Are We Going To Live Better?"] </F>   [Text] The third all-Russia seminar-conference on the  "Experience and Future Prospects of the Exercise of Powers by  the Russian Federation Components in the Interests of the  Regions' Social Development" has taken place under the auspices  of the Russian Federation Government.    The resolution of social questions depends directly on the  state of the economy. While the fall in production, mutual  nonpayments, and delays in paying wages and pensions continue,  the situation in the social sphere will remain tense. However,  positive changes have also been noted recently. First of all,  as Russian Federation Minister of Labor G.G. Melikyan noted at  the conference, inflation rates have successfully been brought  down: In recent months they were 20-30 percent, but in April 6  percent. Some rise in the population's standard of living has  been noted: Last year prices increased by a factor of 7.5 and  incomes by a factor of 8.5. Within outgoings the proportion  taken up by food is not increasing, meaning that people have  stopped spending all their money on produce and have begun to  acquire some material goods as well. Restrictions on demand have  begun to take effect, the market is filling up, and trade stocks  have increased by one-third. All this is encouraging -- prices  will not increase. But, as many of the conference's  participants said, the important thing is that there has been a  structural advance, from the industrial to the social level.  Questions of the provision of essential needs are becoming a  priority.    In spite of the difficulties involved in financing social  programs, all possible measures are being taken in the regions  to support the most vulnerable groups in society -- pensioners,  large families and families with absent parents, invalids, and  persons unable to withstand economic difficulties on their own.    The regional administrative organs' influence over the  implementation of social policy has increased. Many oblasts  have developed and are implementing their own programs for the  social protection of the population. In the Komi Republic three  programs -- "Childhood," "Health," and "Care" -- are being  successfully implemented. In Ulyanovsk Oblast non-production  construction projects are being carried out vigorously -- 19  schools have been built, many kilometers of asphalt roads have  been laid, and many villages have been provided with water  supplies. The oblast has succeded in becoming completely  self-sufficient in sugar, vegetable oil, and potatoes, which  will make it possible to curb price increases.    The conference participants analyzed the experience of  organs  of executive power in the provinces -- for this the speakers  presented interesting information and also discussed the  difficulties and problems involved in implementing state social  guarantees. It was decided to place the emphasis in this work  on the regions on the condition that there is serious support at  the federal level.    Yu.F. Yarov, deputy chairman of the Russian Federation  Government, L.F. Bezlepkina, minister of social protection, V.V.  Barchuk, chairman of the Russian Pension Fund, Ye.F. Lakhova,  chairman of the Russian Federation President's Commission on  Questions of Women, the Family, and Demography, and leaders of  departments ensuring that social policy is carried out in this  country participated in the conference's work.</p>

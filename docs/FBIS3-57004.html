The statement also stresses that the presidential  elections pose no contradiction to Ukraine's laws and  constitution and are held in full compliance with the law "On  division of powers between the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine."  In the Republicans' opinion, this was also confirmed by  Ukraine's Ministry of Justice in reply to a query whether  Sevastopol had the right to take part in these elections.    The Sevastopol branch of the RPK said that the measures  taken  by the government and president of Ukraine to restrict Crimea's  powers and the rights of the people of the autonomous republic  may become the last straw which will spark off a big fire. If  the Crimean people, who will be electing their president, see  the expression of their will ignored, "we will have to appeal to  the world community, specifically, to the United Nations," the  statement says.</p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRANIFF CANCELS ALL FLIGHTS, LAYS OFF MOST OF WORKERS  </P> <P> Braniff Inc. laid off most of its remaining 1,800 employees Tuesday, hours  after it canceled all flights.  </P> <P> Thomas J. Voltz, Braniff marketing vice president, said the troubled airline  would attempt to reorganize as a charter carrier with 300 to 500 employees. The  carrier also continued to explore other options, including selling itself.  </P> <P> Cash-starved Braniff filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors Sept.  28 and reduced its flight schedule by more than 80% from hubs in Orlando, Fla.,  and Kansas City, Mo. The troubled airline had slashed most fares to $99 to  attract passengers, but without success.  </P> <P> It wasn't clear whether Braniff would succeed as a charter airline. "It's  something that might be viable," Voltz said. "We are really now assessing how  viable it is."  </P> <P> Orlando-based Braniff currently operates charter flights for two National  Football League teams, the Kansas City Chiefs and the New Orleans Saints. Voltz  said those flights would continue.  </P> <P> Though Braniff's stock is traded over the counter, most of its shares are held  by an investment partnership headed by Jeffrey Chodorow, a Philadelphia real  estate investor who also owns a large stake in a doll manufacturer. Chodorow  purchased the airline from hotel magnate Jay A. Pritzker, who rescued it from  an earlier bankruptcy in 1984.  </P> <P> Braniff filed for its latest bankruptcy after the investment firm of Drexel  Burnham Lambert was unable to raise $100 million in debt and equity to save the  cash-squeezed airline. Drexel had come to Braniff's aid in April by raising an  initial $100 million in high-risk junk bonds, priced to yield a whopping 16.9%.  </P> <P> Investment firms that bought Braniff debt from Drexel are now among the  airline's biggest unsecured creditors. Court documents show that American  Capital Fidelity Corp., a Century City investment firm controlled by  millionaire William Belzberg, bought $7.5 million of the notes, and Century  Institutional Investors, a firm with close ties to ex-Drexel investment banker  Michael Milken, bought $2.5 million in debt for one of its customers.  </P> <P> Another Drexel customer, Columbia Savings &amp; Loan in Beverly Hills, loaned  Braniff $15.8 million shortly before the airline sought bankruptcy protection.  Persons familiar with that transaction said the secured loan was arranged by  Drexel.  </P> <P> Braniff has hired the New York investment firm of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. to  explore its options, including a possible sale. Joel Shapiro, one of Braniff's  bankruptcy attorneys, said Merrill Lynch has been approached by two investors  who he would not identify.  </P> <P> Persons familiar with Braniff's problems said the two investors were Kansas  City businessmen spearheading separate efforts to buy the airline. The possible  buyers were said to be John Latchow, a prominent retired stockbroker for  Shearson Lehman Hutton, and Farhad Azima, a former chairman of two airlines  that have entered bankruptcy proceedings, Global International of Kansas City  and Capitol Air of Smyrna, Tenn.  </P> <P> Neither could be reached for comment Tuesday.  </P> <P> Any sale or reorganization of Braniff must be approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy  Court in Orlando, where the case is filed.  </P> <P> Airline industry analysts said Braniff has few assets that it can sell to raise  cash since most of its planes are leased, and airport flight-time slots in  Kansas City are not in great demand. Braniff's biggest potential asset is  delivery positions for 21 fuel-efficient Airbus Industrie A-320 aircraft, but  Braniff's ownership of the positions is in dispute.  </P> <P> The seller of the aircraft, GPA Group, contends that it no longer is obligated  to sell the planes to Braniff and is looking for a new buyer for the A-320s. A  bankruptcy court hearing on the dispute is set for Friday, and the outcome is  important to Braniff.  </P> <P> Though a decision against the airline wouldn't necessarily affect its plans to  operate a charter business, "it would affect the amount of cash we have and our  ability to pay debt," Voltz said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Southwest, Continental and Eastern airlines said they would accept  Braniff ticket-holders on a standby basis. Braniff advised ticket-holders to  call (800) 282-5586 for refund information.  </P></p>

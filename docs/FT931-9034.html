			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Cautious opening to the new account A WEEK to be featured by a heavy list of economic and corporate news opened with a UK stock market firm but drifting uneasily amid continuing uncertainty over sterling and domestic interest rates. Coolness in the London market was not helped by Wall Street's closure for President's Day and by caution ahead of important presentations to Congress this week by President Clinton and by Mr Alan Greenspan, head of the US Federal Reserve. UK market indices were also restrained by weakness in the oil issues, where lack of US interest was compounded by lower crude prices and uncertain progress at the Opec talks. One of the few bright spots was the firmness of some Far Eastern stocks in response to a turn for the better in the Hong Kong market. It was also the first day of the new two-week trading account in the equity market and share prices opened easier in thin trading. With sterling still weak in early deals and investors heeding Friday's rejection of interest rate optimism by Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, there appeared little to go for in equities. Also unsettling were the latest reports from Westminster, although worries over the government's handling of the Maastricht debate lessened after denials that it had considered ignoring the outcome of the parliamentary vote on an amendment to the Treaty. However, the stock market picked up, largely on the back of renewed interest in the second line issues. By late morning, the FT-SE 100 Index was 11.7 ahead but, although support for the second rankers was maintained, the absence of a lead from Wall Street took the heart out of the blue chips. Lloyds Bank was a dull spot as profits were taken in the wake of Friday's sparkling results and dividend announcement. At the final reading, the gain on the FT-SE 100 had been trimmed to 2.9 for a close of 2,845.9. However, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index remained 16.2 up at 3,022.5, and non-Footsie stocks increased to around 72 per cent their percentage of the day's Seaq total of 516.2m shares. On Friday, Seaq trading of 830.2m shares was worth a healthy Pounds 1.49bn in terms of retail business, fully sustaining the substantially improved volume trend in London equities. Strategists took the view that the stock market had stood up well, in view of the weakness in oils and ex-dividend markdowns in prices for some leading blue chips. The activity in the smaller stocks made up for poor turnover in the blue chips, many of which struggled to return sub-average daily volume figures. In addition to the developments this week in the US, the London market faces important data on the progress of the domestic economy, ranging from the latest survey of distributive trades by members of the Confederation of British Industry, due today, to the January statistics on UK unemployment and money supply, expected on Thursday. At Nikko, Mr Peter Thorne believes that the unemployment figures could show a further rise, 'sufficiently large' to renew speculation of another base rate cut, in spite of last week's firm rejection of such plans by the UK chancellor. But the stock market was also keeping a close eye on the foreign exchange markets, mindful of the pressures that a run on the pound could impose on any decision on interest rates.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc Rorer share buy-back RHONE-POULENC Rorer, the pharmaceuticals unit of France's largest chemicals group, plans to buy up to 5m of its own shares, worth Dollars 236m at yesterday's opening price. The move, intended to support RPR's flagging share price and obtain cheap capital for an employee benefits trust, is routine in the US. It is unusual in France, though Rhone-Poulenc, RPR's parent, did announce it was buying RPR shares last month. Yesterday's operation will lift RPR's earnings per share by reducing the number of shares outstanding, said the group. RPR's share price had fallen by roughly 20 per cent over the past nine months, said Mr Patrick Langlois, chief financial officer. This was in line with a general fall in US drug companies' shares, which were hit by investors' fears over the Clinton administration's plans to cut healthcare spending plus a general shift of interest to industrial companies likely to benefit more than pharmaceuticals from the US economic revival. 'The whole sector is undervalued. We think that RPR has significant potential not recognised in the share price,' he said. RPR will buy the shares, which amount to 3.6 per cent of its 138.3m shares in issue, in the open market over an unspecified period starting now. Last month, Rhone-Poulenc bought an extra 2.05 per cent of its subsidiary, now 68.68 per cent owned by the state-controlled chemicals group. Rhone-Poulenc said it wanted to show confidence in RPR at a time when RPR's share price did not reflect its full potential. The shares being bought by RPR will go into an employee trust to finance a range of benefits such as savings and stock plans, pensions and healthcare. Over time, the trust will be free to allocate or sell the shares. Cap Gemini Sogeti, Europe's largest provider of computer services, yesterday announced that it would offer Pounds 137m (Dollars 196m) to buy out the remaining 30 per cent minority stake in Hoskyns, its UK subsidiary. CGS bought 69.3 per cent of Hoskyns, which manages companies' computer systems, in 1990 and undertook at the time to offer to buy out the rest before mid-March 1993. Minority investors are being offered 469p per share, slightly more than the most recent market price of 462p. CGS paid Pounds 199m, or 330p per share, for control of Hoskyns in 1990.</p>

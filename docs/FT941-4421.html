			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Major urged to act in 'lies' row Lord Callaghan yesterday wrote to the prime minister asking that Mr William Waldegrave withdraw his 'false allegation' that he (Lord Callaghan) had lied to the Commons over devaluation when he was chancellor in 1967. Mr Waldegrave, the minister for public service and science, refused to back down from his original comments that Lord Callaghan had given the House a misleading answer. But in a letter to the former Labour prime minister he says that the exceptional circumstances justified the answer. Lord Callaghan said in a rely to Mr Waldegrave: 'That is simply not good enough.' He wants the minister to clear his name, and told him: 'You have allowed the impression to grow that my answers were lies. They were not. 'Under intense questioning in an excited House, my answers show that I consistently stood my ground, that I would make no statement and give no information to MPs about sterling.' Downing Street said the prime minister would consider Lord Callaghan's correspondence. It was made clear, however, that Mr Major was unlikely to say anything different from Mr Waldegrave. The dispute arose when Mr Waldegrave told the Commons Treasury and civil service committee earlier this week that there were specific occasions - such as the 1967 devaluation - when ministers could tell untruths to the Commons. During prime minister's questions Mr John Smith, Labour leader, used the issue of whether ministers should always tell the truth to criticise the government for its 'blatant deception practised at the last election' in raising taxes after promising to cut them.</p>

			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HINTS FROM HELOISE: THANKSGIVING IS ALSO A TIME FOR EXCHANGING PRESENTS  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I would like to share an idea I used last year for a family  get-together over the Thanksgiving holiday.  </P> <P> Since all the family would be together during Thanksgiving but not Christmas, I  thought of having a "turkey tree" with a nice gift for everyone underneath.  </P> <P> I made it from a medium-sized tree branch. I placed the bare branch upright in  a coffee can, then weighted it down with rocks and sand and put the coffee can  in a beautiful wicker basket.  </P> <P> Decorating the turkey tree was the fun part, just as it is with a Christmas  tree. I applied ribbon bows, cross-stitch turkey and Thanksgiving-motif  ornaments and maple leaves throughout the branches. At the base I placed a  large table-top turkey decoration and set out all the presents underneath. The  tree and presents fit nicely on a buffet table top.  </P> <P> After a delicious Thanksgiving dinner we shared our gifts, and it was a most  enjoyable day. Remember, you can't always gather on Christmas so make a special  day when your family is lucky enough to be with loved ones.  </P> <P>  -- MIMI, San Antonio  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Last year you had a recipe for a peachy substitute for cranberry  sauce for Thanksgiving dinner. My family does not like cranberries and I would  like to make this peach sauce that I think will go well with the turkey dinner.  </P> <P>  -- MS. M., Staten Island, N.Y.  </P> <P> DEAR MS. M: The sauce you are referring to is called jelled peach sauce, and it  is a great alternative to cranberry sauce with the Thanksgiving dinner.  </P> <P> You will need: one large can of peaches, one-half cup of sugar, one-half  teaspoon of nutmeg and one box of lemon gelatin.  </P> <P> Drain the canned peaches, saving the syrup. Puree the peaches in the blender.  To the drained peach syrup, add enough water to make one cup of liquid. Pour  into a sauce pan and add the sugar and nutmeg. Bring mixture to a boil and let  it boil for about one minute.  </P> <P> Next empty the box of gelatin into a bowl and stir in the hot liquid mixture  until the gelatin is dissolved. Add pureed peaches and pour into a mold. Chill  until set.  </P> <P> For those who are watching their weight or must limit their sugar intake,  substitute diet gelatin and peaches in light syrup or omit the sugar.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: For children who like to snap the wishbone of a chicken or turkey  carcass, a few seconds in the microwave will dry it out immediately.  </P> <P> This is a lot quicker than placing the wishbone on the windowsill and waiting  three days for it to dry.  </P> <P>  -- Katherine, Ventura, Calif.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: When a stick of butter or margarine is removed from the wrapper,  measuring a tablespoon can become guesswork.  </P> <P> A hint I found helpful is to score the stick at each marking before removing  the wrapper. Afterwards, measuring is still accurate.  </P> <P>  -- L. N., Winston-Salem, N.C.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: In order to take advantage of special offers that demand proof of  purchase (UPC symbol, the bar code), I have started cutting out the bar code of  most empty food packages before throwing them out. I then write the name of the  product on the back and store them all in an envelope until needed.  </P> <P> This saves me time when a special offer is announced and all I have to do is  look up the correct one.  </P> <P>  -- CHARLOTTE, Staten Island, N.Y.  </P></p>

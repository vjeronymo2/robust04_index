			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / 'Forward looking' US monetary policy urged THE US Federal Reserve should be prepared to ease monetary policy further if the economic recovery expected this spring fails to materialise, Mr Michael Boskin, the White House chief economic adviser, indicated in a briefing yesterday. Releasing the 1992 Economic Report of the president, he said monetary policy had to be 'forward looking'. He said the Fed had been surprised by the sluggishness of monetary aggregates in the face of repeated cuts in interest rates. In congressional testimony on Tuesday, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said he would not rule out further interest rate cuts if the economy failed to improve. But he hoped the existing stimulus would be sufficient. The Fed met this week to discuss monetary targets for 1992. Some private sector economists, including Mr Martin Feldstein, a Harvard professor and economic adviser in the Reagan White House, have urged the Fed to raise its monetary target this year. This would probably require further cuts in interest rates. Mr Boskin acknowledged that the Bush administration had not yet gained control of the budget deficit. There was 'still a huge gaping hole in the budget', he said, referring to this year's expected shortfall of Dollars 400bn - a record 6.7 per cent of gross domestic product. He said the best way to reduce the deficit in the medium-term would be to restrain growth of spending on entitlement programmes such as health care for the elderly. This would free resources for private sector investment. Mr Boskin defended the administration's claim that stimulatory measures in the budget would raise annual GDP growth 0.4 percentage points in coming years. He said this reflected 'confidence effects' as well as the incentive effect of measures such as the proposed cut in capital gains taxes and temporary investment allowances for companies.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Directors want company law changes COMPANY LAW should be amended to reflect modern trends in corporate governance, according to a Mori survey of senior directors published yesterday. More than four fifths would approve of amendments to require listed companies to establish a remuneration committee to approve executives' pay, wholly or mainly comprised of non-executives. Three quarters would support a change in the law to oblige listed companies to establish audit committees of non-executive directors responsible for liaising with auditors. The findings come in a poll of 200 chief executives and non-executive directors commissioned by executive search companies Executive Interim Management and Egon Zehnder International. More than 90 per cent of non-executives and 87 per cent of chief executives agreed that the law should be changed to require companies to disclose the salary and performance-related emoluments of the chairman and highest-paid director. Nearly a third said no such remuneration committee existed in their own company. Half did not have a non-executive audit committee with the proposed powers. Two thirds approved of the Cadbury report, which includes a code of best practice to which companies will have to refer in annual reports from this summer under Stock Exchange rules. But two thirds disagreed with nominations committees with a majority of non-executive directors to select future appointments. Two thirds of non-executives said they were approached personally by the chairman and a quarter already knew the chairman or chief executive.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Commission to probe mosque murders As Israel appointed a five-member commission to investigate Friday's massacre at Hebron's Cave of the Patriarchs, the Israeli army yesterday released an interim report acknowledging security failures, but rejecting Palestinian claims Israeli soldiers contributed to the death toll, David Horovitz reports. The investigation found Dr Baruch Goldstein fired 111 bullets into the rows of kneeling worshippers. His Galil rifle was recovered, and all the shells collected inside the mosque were found to have been fired from it. The interim investigation, carried out by the army's central command, established that five soldiers were on duty when Goldstein, a radical Jewish settler, slipped into the building. Four other soldiers supposed to have been on duty had over-slept. Poor siting of closed-circuit TV cameras enabled Goldstein to make his way into the mosque, crowded with about 400 Moslem worshippers, without being seen. On the basis of this finding, Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin told the Knesset (parliament) yesterday that eye-witness claims of Israeli soldiers killing Palestinians inside the mosque were 'nonsense'. The army estimated Goldstein sprayed bullets for 60-90 seconds. The senior officer on duty said he had tried to enter the mosque to intervene, but found one entrance blocked; when he reached a second, he was pushed back by fleeing Palestinians.</p>

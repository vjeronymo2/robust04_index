			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MEDITERRANEAN SUMMIT;  </P> <P> LAST SUMMIT AT SEA LED TO ATLANTIC CHARTER  </P> <P> The last time an American President met at sea with a world-renowned foreign  leader was in August, 1941, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt conferred with  British Prime Minister Winston Churchill aboard a British warship in Placenta  Bay, Newfoundland, Canada.  </P> <P> The three-day meeting, which ended Aug. 12, was held during Britain's darkest  hours in World War II. It also came four months before the United States  entered the conflict, but the discussions left little doubt that America would  soon be involved.  </P> <P> The shipboard conference's most notable achievement was a joint proclamation  setting down "certain common principles" of Britain and the United States in  what became known as the Atlantic Charter. Among its eight points were an  affirmation of the right to self-determination, a vow that the United States  and Britain would seek no new territory or territorial changes without the  consent of the people involved, rejection of the use of force to settle  conflicts, free trade and joint economic development.  </P> <P> The charter's main impact was as a morale-booster for democratic nations at a  time of pessimism and discouragement. Endorsed by other democratic states, it  became one of the building blocks in the creation of the United Nations.  </P> <P> Roosevelt and Churchill had brought their senior military advisers to the  shipboard conference. And although the United States was still formally  neutral, the meeting gave the British and American staffs an opportunity to  meet and develop contacts that would become useful after the United States  entered the war.  </P></p>

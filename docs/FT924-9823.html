			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Democrat sweeps into Oval Office MR BILL CLINTON, the 46-year-old governor of Arkansas, last night completed an improbable 15-month odyssey and became the first Democrat in 16 years to win the US presidency. President George Bush, conceding defeat, promised that his administration would work closely with Mr Clinton's team to ensure a smooth transition of power. 'There is important work to be done . . . so we will get behind this new president and wish him well,' a clearly deflated Mr Bush told supporters at his campaign headquarters in Texas. By 11pm on the east coast, the television networks projected that Mr Clinton had won the midwestern state of Ohio, giving him more than the 270 votes in the electoral college needed to become the country's 42nd president. Moments later it was announced that he had swept through the west coast, transforming an already impressive win into a landslide comparable to that achieved by the man he despatched from the White House last night, Mr Bush. His great triumph was built steadily all evening. He destroyed the Republican base in the industrial north, won everything going from New York on upwards, and divided the last great Republican bastion, the deep south. His sweep of California, the Pacific northwest and Hawaii meant, according to television projections, that Mr Clinton had carried 31 states with 362 electoral college votes, to only eight for Mr Bush with a meagre 64 electoral votes. Still unresolved were close contests in Mr Bush's adopted home, Texas, and Florida. Mr Ross Perot, the independent candidate, carried no states but was scoring about 15 per cent of the popular vote. With about one third of the nation's precincts reporting, Mr Clinton had about 45 per cent of the vote to Mr Bush's 40 per cent, a gap that was expected to widen with the impact of the west coast. Mr Clinton went for an evening run in Little Rock and admitted that it 'looked good.' Mr Ron Brown, the elated chairman of the Democratic Party, pronounced that the country could not stand four more years of Mr Bush and had voted overwhelmingly for 'a new kind of Democrat'. Early returns from Congress confirmed the inevitable, that the new Democratic president would be working with an overwhelmingly Democratic legislature. The only noteable Democratic casualty in the Senate was Terry Sanford in North Carolina. It appeared, with several races outstanding, that the Democrats were about to gain one or two seats in the upper house. Women scored some impressive victories. Ms Carol Mosely Braun, the Democrat from Illinois, became the first black woman ever elected to the US Senate. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer were returned to the Senate from California and Ms Patty Murray carried the state of Washington. Mr Clinton put together his majority with a rush when the northeastern and midwestern states began to report. Within minutes of the polls closing at 8pm, eastern time, the networks announced that he had won Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Jersey, Missouri, Maryland and Connecticut, all of which Mr Bush had taken four years ago. Only in Ohio were the two leading candidates running neck and neck. Mr Clinton's southern breakthrough was first evident in Georgia and then in Kentucky. He easily won his native Arkansas and Tennessee, home of the next vice-president, Senator Al Gore. Even Mr Bush's adopted home state of Texas was thought too close to call, as were Florida, Louisiana and North Carolina. The president was able to hold on to South Carolina and Virginia. Mr Clinton also walked away with the northeast. New York and Massachusetts were no surprise, but Maine, where Mr Bush has a holiday home, Vermont and New Hampshire have been solid Republican territory for years. Vermont, for example, has voted for a Democrat only once since 1860. He even cracked a singular Republican monolith in the southwestern states, by carrying Colorado and New Mexico, and was running Mr Bush close in Arizona and Wyoming. Mr Bush's early consolations were few and far between. He did hold on to Indiana, vice-president Dan Quayle's home state, but by nothing like the 60-40 per cent margin in 1988. His victories in Virginia, Oklahoma and South Carolina were slim in comparison with four years ago. Even in Indiana, according to the centralised network exit poll service, voters found Senator Gore more qualified than Mr Quayle by a 52-37 per cent margin. Exit poll trends, mostly from the eastern and central parts of the country, suggested that voters, who apparently turned out in greater numbers than in any recent election, were much more influenced by the issues stressed by Mr Clinton and, to an extent, Mr Perot than by Mr Bush. Some 43 per cent thought the economy and jobs were the major issues in the election, followed by the budget deficit (23 per cent) and health care (21 per cent). Eight out of 10 of those surveyed had a pessimistic view of the economy and 67 per cent disapproved of the president's management of it. Of the central messages of the two main candidates, 37 per cent thought that the ability to bring about change was an essential quality in a candidate, while only 14 per cent rated honesty and untrustworthiness as most important. In fact more people felt Mr Bush had not told the truth over Iran-Contra than did Mr Clinton on the draft. Only 8 per cent rated foreign policy experience as top of their list. Mr Clinton also seems to have profited immensely from the gender gap.

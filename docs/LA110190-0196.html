			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> PERFORMANCES: AN OPINIONATED GUIDE  </P> <P> THURSDAY  </P> <P> * Tom Ball &amp; Kenny Sultan (The Grill, 1279 Coast Village Road, Montecito,  969-5969) All the yuppies and all the acoustic blues you can stand.  </P> <P> * Leo Downey Band (The Ketch, 514 State St., Santa Barbara, 564-3231) All  original rock by a guy who doesn't have a shirt with sleeves in his entire  closet.  </P> <P> The women, apparently, love that sort of stuff.  </P> <P> FRIDAY  </P> <P> * Ambrosia, Hollander (Ventura Theatre, 26 S. Chestnut St., Ventura, 648-1888)  The headliners are so lightweight they have to wear steel shoes, lest gravity  take over. Hollander is a local trio of corporate-style rockers.  </P> <P> * Lion I's (Charlie's, 362 California St., Ventura, 648-6688) Local reggae  rockers who know about keeping the dance floor packed. Even those sea gulls on  the pier (the ones too stupid to find the dump) will be dancing.  </P> <P> * Sonic Youth (Campbell Hall, UCSB) They're young; they're loud; they're from  New York -- here they are.  </P> <P> SATURDAY  </P> <P> * Tim Buley Band (Charlie's) Rockin' blues on the beach.  </P> <P> * Chris Isaak, The Havalinas (Ventura Theatre) Isaak, with one of the best  voices in rock, is Roy Orbison reincarnated in Liberace's suit.  </P> <P> MONDAY  </P> <P> * Blues For Breakfast (Alexander's, 1050 Schooner Drive, Ventura, 658-2000)  This week's Blue Monday presentation features guitarist Randy Rich from Mojo  Hand.  </P> <P> TUESDAY  </P> <P> * Expression, Ariel (Charlie's) Gnarly, original guitar rock and new-wave pop  rock, respectively.  </P> <P> WEDNESDAY  </P> <P> * Mojo Hand (Hungry Hunter, 487 N. Moorpark Road, Thousand Oaks, 497-3925) The  best blues band in Thousand Oaks (if not the county) will play through  Saturday.  </P> <P> * Michael On Fire (Hornblower's, 1559 Spinnaker Drive, Ventura, 644-2041)  Exceptional rock, folk, blues, what-the-heck, featuring all original tunes plus  a guitarist in the Texas Guitar Hall of Fame. Don't miss this one.  </P> <P> * Official Resistance (Charlie's) Hard rockers from Santa Barbara with enough  tattoos to reshoot "The Illustrated Man." BILL LOCEY  </P></p>

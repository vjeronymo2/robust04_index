			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Labour attacks Tory tax 'hypocrisy' Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, yesterday accused the prime minister of 'hypocrisy and deceit' by scheduling 20 separate tax rises for the next two years in spite of his party's general election pledge not to raise taxation. In the first assault of the new year on the government's economic policy, Mr Brown outlined what he described as 'the hidden Tory tax calendar' at the heart of the past two Budgets. Citing weekend remarks by Mr John Major that the Tory party had no instinct for tax rises, Mr Brown suggested that, from April this year, there would be a tax rise every month until the end of 1994. This would, he claimed, amount to an increase of Pounds 1,330 in tax for the typical family over the next two years. It was 'an extraordinary political own goal and an act of hypocrisy, broken promises and deceit unrivalled in the history of taxation,' Mr Brown said. He said the tax rises would hit the very groups in society which the Conservatives had pledged at the last general election to protect from tax increases. In many cases, he said, the increases would be larger than those the Tories had suggested would be introduced by a Labour government. For example, he said, a clinical nurse earning Pounds 13,250 would pay an extra Pounds 791 in tax. In contrast, a Conservative general election campaign advertisement had alleged that the extra burden under Labour would be Pounds 479. He also said that someone earning Pounds 15,000 a year would pay an extra Pounds 811 under the proposed tax rises while the Conservatives had claimed that, under Labour, the total tax rise would have been Pounds 647.</p>

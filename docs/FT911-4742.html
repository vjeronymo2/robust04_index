			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Technology: Barley chews the fat Most people do not eat barley - they drink it in beer or whiskey. But David and Victor Lewis, who run an independent research and development operation for food products and processes called Byron Agricultural, of Sydney, intend to change that. Waxy barley - so called because it has opaque waxy-looking grains - may be just what the fibre-conscious, cholesterol-cutting public wants. The barley contains high levels of beta-glucan, a soluble fibre which has been shown to help reduce cholesterol levels. David Lewis has developed a process for making expanded products (like puffed wheat and rice) from waxy cereals. Rex Oram, a plant breeder at Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), provided Lewis with waxy barley to try out his process. One type worked well and they named it Waxiro. Kellogg Australia entered into a deal with CSIRO and Lewis to use the grain in its cereal products. 'The key thing is that Waxiro is high in soluble fibre, as high as oat bran,' says Geoff Houldsworth, Kellogg's product R&amp;D manager. 'But this is a whole grain. It is much nicer to eat a whole grain than bran.' Kellogg made a barley oat bran-flake known as Balance, although the marketing still focuses on the oat content. The flake product is relatively easy to make because the whole grain and bran bind together easily. Waxiro also has a relatively low fat content - 1 per cent compared with 9 per cent for oats, and is cheaper than oat bran. An interesting aspect of the technology is the use of enzymes. 'We've found we can get unique effects on crispness and texture of grains by using enzymes at very low moisture content,' says David Lewis. The method is a straight-line process, not a batch process, and uses similar enzymes to those which convert the starch in barley to malt. This is what makes the flakes light, he says, and allows them to be made with whole grain products.</p>

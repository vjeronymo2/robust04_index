Important for Victors and  Vanquished To Understand Its Implications. Particularly Those  for Whom Spring Holds an Election Campaign"]    [Text] The main sensation in the recent elections is  deemed to be the success of Zhirinovskiy's party, something that  came as a surprise to many people. Lively discussion of the  political, social, psychological, and even psychiatric reasons  for and possible consequences of the resultant apportionment of  votes is continuing. Many articles mention in passing the  special features of a particular bloc's propaganda campaign.  This is generally said to be a secondary factor with no  decisive effect on the election results. That is true to some  extent, but nonetheless for the main participants in the  election race, had they taken a different approach to the  election campaign, the results could have been appreciably  different from those we have now.    There is no point in analyzing the features of the election  campaign conducted by all 13 movements, parties, and blocs. The  overwhelming majority of these campaigns' organizers displayed  professional feebleness. The results generally reflect not only  the political amorphousness and featurelessness of these  formations, but also their leaders' inability to competently  plan and organize what Americans call the election race.    The fact that V.V. Zhirinovskiy conducted his campaign the  most professionally played an important role in his success.    The leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR]  had strict targets for his propaganda. He was perfectly well  aware on whom he could rely, clearly understood what worries his  future voters, and deliberately put forward arguments that were  understandable and appealing to the dregs of society [lyumpeny]  (with or without a higher education) who form the backbone of  his electorate.    Efficient orchestration of the campaign played a  considerable  role. Each of Vladimir Volfovich's speeches was devoted to a  single issue alone. This enabled him to outline in a thorough  and at the same time very specific manner ways of resolving all  the problems that really worry people.    The choice of topics for the speeches created a certain  amount of intrigue and ensured the momentum of the campaign.  Anyone who started listening to Zhirinovskiy's passionate  monologues could not wait for the followup, particularly when  the subject of the next speech was not announced in advance.  The propaganda campaign followed a rising curve, and,  evidently, all its reserves were not depleted. The LDPR leader,  with his inherent modesty, said after the elections that had the  campaign lasted another 10 days he would have gotten 70 percent  of the vote. Needless to say, that is an exaggeration, but  other opportunities for the LDPR to enlarge its electorate did  exist. The point is that Zhirinovskiy very skillfully and  purposefully drew broader and broader population groups into his  orbit. It is not after all only among hoboes that you find  people who like simple solutions to complex problems.    All these and many other means of conducting political  (primarily election) campaigns are well known to campaign  specialists and political managers, of which there are fairly  large numbers in countries with a developed democracy, but which  still have virtually no representation in our country taking its  first steps down the road to democratization.    Zhirinovskiy's advisers may not be very experienced  managers. Otherwise it is difficult to account for the  occasions which deflated his campaign. Video clips, inevitably  prepared by other people, often strayed from the general  strategy, proved protracted, and detracted from the exuberant,  energetic rhythm of the campaign. Appearances on air by members  of the leader's entourage were even worse -- their image was in  sharp contrast with that of Zhirinovskiy himself and would have  been more suitable for featureless political groups incapable of  making any impression on the voters.    Zhirinovskiy's irresponsibility and happy-go-lucky style  that  were pointed out by all his critics may quite well have been  just a skillful election ploy. The nature of the LDPR leader's  behavior will almost certainly change after the elections, and  the stunned country will see a fairly respectable, restrained  legislator who has forgotten most of his fantastic election  outbursts and, bit by bit, is assembling the political baggage  for his next electoral surge. The voters who have come to love  this understandable, accessible politician will willingly  forgive him certain departures from election promises in the  realization that this is the cost of the struggle and  circumstances sometimes make it necessary to switch to gradual  actions.    The election campaign of the "Russia's Choice" bloc was  conducted at a far lower professional level. One of the main  principles necessary for success seems to have been infringed.  In planning the bloc's campaign its organizers were unable to  work out a fundamental strategy that should have laid down all  the tactical methods and been the cornerstone of all campaign  events. The bloc's leading politicians made vigorous use of  something which was not available to virtually all their  adversaries, to wit -- their not inconsiderable experience of  implementing the reforms and the government's definite  achievements. This strong argument could have been the basis of  their strategy, but in order for that to be so it should have  been exploited consistently throughout the campaign.    Generally speaking the campaign propaganda material was  glaringly at variance with this fundamental idea. The exception  being only the brilliant monologues by E. Pamfilova, the  speeches by A. Chubays at the end of the campaign, and also  certain (by no means all!) recordings of Ye. Gaydar's speeches.  Viewers were most often shown a lyrical video clip with a cute  kid and an appealing hound that had no connection with the  presumed strategy. The election campaign lacked purpose,  integrity, and a single ideological core. Virtually all the  pieces were good in themselves, but put together the entire  thing lacked punch. Nor did any of the "Russia's Choice"  posters, without exception, in the slightest degree accord with  any unified strategic line. Elegant views accompanied by the  bloc's emblem were as feeble in backing up its leaders'  arguments as pop concerts against the backdrop of the selfsame  emblem. The only poster which in some way accorded with the  main idea was executed extremely badly. It carried a picture of  Ye.T. Gaydar in a somewhat affected pose, and the text could  equally have been interpreted both for and against the bloc.    You get the impression that the bloc campaign organizers did  not entirely know whom they were addressing. The bloc's staunch  supporters and adversaries did not need this kind of  campaigning, while for the waverers totally different approaches  were needed.    There is reason to think that a considerable proportion of  the supporters of democratic reforms, lulled by the cheery  forecasts of an inevitable victory for "Russia's Choice," did  not turn out to vote. That is the direct result of the campaign  organizers' basic incompetence. Any professional manager knows  that during the last few days before an election the main effort  should be focused on persuading your supporters to turn out  without fail.    At some point, roughly a week before the election, the  LDPR's  growing superiority began to emerge clearly. An emergency  adjustment to strategy was needed. One main adversary had  emerged from among the 12. Had the main attack been focused in  that direction, the gap could have been closed and some of the  waverers -- those at least who, having voted for Zhirinovskiy,  have now been frightened by the results -- drawn away from the  LDPR. Many people would have changed their decision had  everything now being said about Zhirinovskiy been said then in a  fairly cogent and serious way -- during the last few days before  the election. There was no sign of any effort to do this.    The results indicate that inadequate use of the factor of  the real fascist danger was also made during the formation of  the coalition of democratic forces. For all their  uncompromising arrogance, all the democratic blocs are now  resolutely dissociating themselves from the LDPR. Consequently,  attempts to pool efforts should have been more persistent prior  to the election rather than now when little can be changed.    It is easy to work out how many Duma seats the democrats  lost  owing to their disunity if you examine the election results in  single-seat districts. As far as I know, in one of these  districts alone -- namely Universitetskiy District No. 201 -- a  serious attempt was made to avoid splitting the democrat vote.  A primary election procedure was formulated here and  coordinated with local democratic organizations, making it  possible to select a single candidate from democratic  associations and focus all efforts on supporting him. This was  the first time such primary elections have been held in Russia.  They were a success and attracted a large turnout. An  experienced political manager from the United States, who was  present during the primary elections as an observer, voiced a  high opinion of their procedure and organization. It is deeply  regrettable that the republic leaders of all democratic  associations without exception did not back this initiative.  The upshot was that candidates from all three democratic blocs  vied with one another and an independent candidate, who was  seeking election with the help of simple forgery, was close to  success. Fortunately everything turned out OK and the Russian  Movement for Democratic Reforms candidate was elected, but in  many districts the fragmented democrats helped their opponents  win.    It should be emphasized that under these conditions it was  impossible to qualitatively affect the course of the campaign  and radically alter the result thereof during the voting on  federal lists. Underlying social and political factors played a  decisive role, but the quantitative indicators could have been  different. After all, we now calculate in hundredths of a  percent.    So, what is to be done?    The two years' lifespan allotted for the new parliament is a  short period. Serious politicians, above all reformers from  "Russia's Choice," must learn from their defeat. As well as  carrying out an in-depth analysis of the reasons for this defeat  they must immediately start preparing for the next elections.    To this end they must, in particular, begin the immediate  professional training of party organizers capable of competently  planning and conducting a national or regional campaign. It is  also necessary urgently to organize the training of professional  political managers capable of conducting local campaigns on the  instructions of party organizers or individual candidates,  primarily in single-seat districts. Methodological material  must be based on two sources: on our already fairly extensive  experience and on foreign experience adapted to fit Russian  conditions.    No one could have expected our country to move smoothly and  triumphally to a democratic way of life. There will be more  victories and defeats on this difficult road. We must draw the  correct conclusions from the palpable defeat suffered by the  reformers 12 December and start working intensively. That is  the guarantee of future success!</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCKHEED CHAIRMAN VOWS CONCESSIONS;  </P> <P> TAKEOVER BID: PRESSURE FROM BIG SHAREHOLDERS PROMPTS OFFER IN MOVE TO BLOCK  ATTACK ON BOARD.  </P> <P> Lockheed Corp. Chairman Daniel Tellep, bowing to pressure from his big  shareholders, promised today at the aerospace company's annual meeting to make  major concessions to them in the future.  </P> <P> The concessions came at the behest of big pension funds and other institutional  shareholders, many of whom defected to the side of Harold Simmons, the Texas  investor who bought 19% of Lockheed and wants to oust the company's current  board and replace them with his nominees.  </P> <P> Results of voting at the meeting, taking place in a vast hangar, won't be known  for at least a week.  </P> <P> Tellep said that he met with 70 institutions during the proxy contest over the  last two weeks and that he considered this his "baptism by fire and a highly  valuable experience."  </P> <P> "We believe in shareholder democracy," he said, offering the following  concessions to prove it:  </P> <P>  -- If there is significant support, as expected, for a resolution that voting  by shareholders be confidential, Lockheed will develop such a procedure to be  used in the future.  </P> <P>  -- A provision to opt out of the strict anti-takeover provisions of law in  Delaware, where Lockheed is incorporated. Tellep said even if that provision  does not pass but there is a "significant" minority vote for it, he will  recommend that the Lockheed board support an amendment at the next meeting to  have Lockheed opt out of those provisions.  </P> <P>  -- A promise that after the meeting he will ask for a list of shareholder  representatives to Lockheed's 15-member board and will select up to three  directors from that list. He earlier offered to select only one.  </P> <P>  -- An offer to meet regularly with representatives of Simmons' NL Industries  Inc. to discuss the future of Lockheed. "We hope the foregoing will provide  recognition of our commitment to shareholder democracy," he said.  </P> <P> Also at the meeting, the president of NL Industries, J. Landis Martin, said  again he believes that Simmons could better focus Lockheed on its core  businesses -- aeronautics, space and missiles.  </P> <P> "We believe Lockheed must return to its roots," Martin said.  </P> <P> Simmons says Lockheed, with a recent history of sagging earnings and  underestimating costs of developing new programs, must insist on better profits  at its non-core businesses or sell them off.  </P> <P> The company portrays him as a corporate raider intent on personal profit, with  no knowledge of how to run Lockheed, the nation's sixth-largest defense  contractor with 1989 sales of $9.9 billion.  </P> <P> Simmons, who has lost $100 million on his $530-million investment in Lockheed,  insists that he can better focus the company on profiting from its core  businesses and pull up the share price for all investors.  </P></p>

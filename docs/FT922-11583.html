			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (28): The wind-up value matters, too - Income shares / Confusion arises because these shares are in three categories. Be sure you know which you are buying THE INCOME shares of investment trusts have been highly popular in recent years. The prospect of a high yield, especially when such shares are held within the tax-free confines of a personal equity plan, has prompted many private investors to buy them. But income shares are more complex than might be assumed; and some experts wonder whether all investors have known precisely what they were buying. Income shares are one of the core elements of a split-capital investment trust. Most income shares will receive all the revenue of the trust; in some cases, there are stepped preference shares, which have a prior claim on revenue. What may cause investor confusion, however, is the repayment value of the shares when the trust is wound up. There are essentially three types of income share. First, there are those where the repayment value of the shares is fixed at maturity. In the initial years of the trust's life, the trading price of the shares may rise well above this maturity value, because of the attractions of the high income. But as the maturity date approaches, the trading price will steadily decline towards the repayment value. In late March, for example, the trading price of M&amp;G Second Dual Income shares was 170p; the 1997 redemption value was 50p. The danger for private investors is that they may be lured by the high yield into buying such shares at the peak price. They will then find, to their cost, that the capital value of the shares will steadily deteriorate. The second kind of income share is designed to have a repayment value of virtually nil. In this way, they resemble an annuity, a financial instrument which converts capital into income. Again, unwary investors may be attracted by the high income without realising that they face a capital loss. The third type of income share is normally called the geared, or ordinary, income share. This type is normally linked with zero-coupon preference shares (see facing page) in a two-class split-capital trust. Investors in such shares will be entitled to the assets of the trust after the zeros have been repaid. Thus, the repayment value is highly dependent on the extent to which the managers can grow the trust's assets. If growth is slow, or non-existent, the geared income shares may prove worthless on maturity. If the managers perform well, however, investors could enjoy substantial capital growth. Calculation of the 'yield' on such shares depends on an assumption of an asset growth rate which is highly subjective. For example, in late March, County NatWest was quoting a gross redemption yield of 27.8 per cent on the Jove Income shares - provided the assets could grow at 7.5 per cent a year. What is clear from all this is that private investors should make sure that they receive advice from a good stockbroker before plunging into this market. Income shares are not immune to the age-old principle that high rewards are associated with high risk. There is also the general worry about whether the 1990s will be as favourable to the income concept as were the 1980s. As a class, split-capital trusts have tended to purchase high-yielding stocks, as a means of maximising their appeal to income-seeking shareholders. In late March, County NatWest figures showed the average yield on split-capital trusts to be 6.45 per cent, compared with 3.85 per cent across the whole of the investment trust sector. The high-yield strategy brought both income and capital growth in the 1980s. Dividend pay-outs had been restricted in the 1970s, and corporate profits had slumped as a proportion of gross domestic product. As the UK emerged from the early 1980s recession, profits grew substantially and the takeover boom persuaded directors to increase dividends in order to retain shareholders' loyalty. Now that Britain has joined the Exchange Rate Mechanism, economic and corporate profit growth may be much slower in the 1990s. Part of the reason for the 1980s profit revival was that the pound fell steadily in value, with a resulting increase in both margins and orders for exporters. This 'devaluation effect' cannot be achieved within the confines of the ERM. Dividend cover (the amount by which pay-outs are covered by profits) has reached quite low levels in historical terms. In spite of the recession, many companies fought hard to maintain their dividends in the early 1992 results season; but that may prove to have been at the expense of limiting the prospects for dividend growth in later years. All this may mean that dividend growth for income shareholders will also be limited. Particularly, this could be the case in respect of those trusts with a stepped-preference class of share, which has an initial (and growing) claim on the income stream. And if asset growth is much lower in the 1990s, those with geared income shares may have to reduce their expectations for capital returns. In the short term, investors who have locked away income shares on a double-digit yield within a Pep may feel they are sitting pretty. But there are long-term worries that they should not ignore.</p>

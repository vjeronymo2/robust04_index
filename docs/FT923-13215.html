			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Arts: Erasure oddly - pirouetting cygnets. On-stage processes an electronic swan driven by a man in a fluffy white boa and spangly trews. No, not the latest flight of fancy by English National Opera but a rather sedate entrance by Andy Bell, the voice of Erasure. Erasure are the tabloid version of Pet Shop Boys, a camp duo (the gnome-like Vince Clarke looks after the music) who have been worthily successful with albums that knit up-front lyrics ('A little respect') with disco rhythms, and a commitment to stage spectaculars which thrill the mass market and even get approving nods from the gay community. At the Hammersmith Odeon for the next week, there is a traditional non-stop variety show. The Pet Shop Boys have similar ambitions, but while their performances look as if they have been modelled on some contemporary Belgian dance theatre troupe, Erasure seem inspired by the late night revues put on at the Gargoyle, or one of those extinct night clubs that catered for Arabs. The eight dancers stream on in costumes ranging from red plastic to lycra bikinis: and how glad you are to see them. Without the business, the charms of Andy Bell, a Gazza figure without the footballer's wit, would quickly pall. Bell is my sticking point about the show. I admire a man who performs happily wearing Y-fronts. I liked his sturdy voice. I was almost touched when he slipped on red shoes to sing 'Over the rainbow', but could he not manage one witty remark, one less-than-oafish expression. This apart, Erasure offers one of the best musical tickets in town. Their Abba parody, which has taken them to the top of the charts, is rather tossed away on stage, but there are entertaining cameos. Clarke, who hides his gadgetry inside some kind of mobile farm cart, is intriguing with his poker face and occasional desires to dress as Mae West; the dancers show classical points; the backing singers are identical twins from Mauritius, an obvious plus. The most successful sequence is a lively cowboy number, when Bell, wearing a tinsely blue outfit designed to show off his bottom, rouses the crowd by singing 'Stand by your man'. Fun, but somehow predictable. The audience was packed with happy bopping kids rather than gays, which suggests that Erasure is more committed to pop success than taking camp into yet more outrageous territory.</p>

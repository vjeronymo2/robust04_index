			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a report from the Pailin battlefield,  Ritthi, the commander and many officers and soldiers of the  puppet 6th Division, routed in battle, have fled into Thai  territory.    1. On 12 April, we attacked the enemy troops west of Pailin  and at Boeng Pralit, thus blocking the stretches of road within  the perimeter of Pailin to the northern, southern, and eastern  parts. We smashed the invading forces into bits and launched  infantry attacks and shelling on their general command post at  Boeng Pralit, killing or wounding many of them. Many others  fled in disarray.    2. These escapees are 6th Division commander Ritthi and 60  officers and soldiers. Many of them were wounded. Having been  constantly attacked and pressured by the National Army of  Democratic Kampuchea, they fled into Thai territory.    On 12 April, they fled in great alarm onto Thai soil,  carrying weapons but wearing only shorts. The local people  crowded around this General (Ritthi), because it is strange to  see this general in such a position in spite of the earlier  propaganda by the Phnom Penh ringleaders and some Western  foreigners claiming that Pailin was under Phnom Penh control.</p>

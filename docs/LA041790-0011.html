			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HERE'S AN IDEA TO FOOL WITH, AL;  </P> <P> RAIDERS: A STADIUM THAT TAKES TO THE HIGH SEAS BEARING THE PIRATE LOGO COULD  SEEK TRIBUTE UP AND DOWN THE COAST.  </P> <P> Think a minute, Al. You may be able to save that Oakland deal yet. Why not  propose a joint venture to build a floating stadium? Oakland has always been  innovative. And this way the city can profit from your insatiable wanderlust.  </P> <P> Al wants Oakland, in effect, to pay for a second stadium. So, why not build a  new one that will give the city a big return on its investment.  </P> <P> With a floating stadium, Al and Oakland could collect subsidies from more than  16 waterside towns in the Bay Area in one season alone. But Al's never been  limited by geography or tradition. Bluebeard had the islands of the Caribbean  to raid. Oakland and Al could have all the coastal cities of California -- and  perhaps Portland thrown in, too.  </P> <P> And this approach wouldn't require any changes in that one constant of the  Raider's persona -- the pirate logo. In fact, it would be even more  appropriate. The problem, hitherto, has been how to pillage more than one city.  </P> <P> With a suitably powered floater, Al could motor along and, in one season, be  subsidized not only by Oakland but also Los Angeles, Monterey and Santa Barbara  -- anybody with a waterfront. Why not continue his negotiating pattern and take  money home from both ends of California?  </P> <P> In an age when the entire identity of a community seems to be formed by sports  teams, why not let other cities in on the splendid prospect of hosting one?  This version of the Ark of the Raiders would not be lost, but rather  ubiquitous.  </P> <P> The National Football League talks of expanding the game to Europe and Japan.  The stadium could motor on over to Osaka for a game or two in August, then load  up with Toyotas to be dropped off in Hawaii. In Honolulu, it could board  pineapples and tourists and slush back on to its home base in California.  </P> <P> Stadiums look like boats anyhow. Best of all, they really need to act like  boats -- most float on watery lowland soil. Like boats, they should be able to  rotate so that inept wide receivers and outfielders will never have the excuse  of the sun getting in their eyes.  </P> <P> There already are examples of large-scale floating structures, the most obvious  being dry docks. They look like sports facilities; all we need to do is round  off the shape a bit to fit football's needs.  </P> <P> And, how exciting it would be for the spectators to do a wave. The stadium  would move in tandem.  </P></p>

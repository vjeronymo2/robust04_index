The fee requirements remain in effect through 1998, and apply to the assessment years 1994&hyph;95 through 1998&hyph;99. The final rule establishes the procedures for paying and administering the required annual maintenance and location fees, puts into regulation the statute's mandatory payment deadlines and its mandatory provision that failure to pay the fees on time constitutes abandonment of the claim or site, amends the recording and assessment work regulations to conform to the requirements of the Act, and establishes procedures by which small miners may obtain a waiver from payment of the maintenance fee. The final rule also implements the new location and recording requirements for mining claims located on Stockraising Homestead Act lands. These requirements are contained in the Act of April 16, 1993 (107 Stat. 60). It also removes obsolete or expired provisions, and consolidates provisions that are still in force and effect in the regulations concerning location and entry of mining claims and sites on coal bearing lands, National Park System units, the King Range Conservation Area, and Indian reservations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  August 30, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Any suggestions or inquiries should be sent to: Director (660), Mail Stop 501, Bureau of Land Management, 1849 C Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20240. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Frank Bruno or Roger Haskins at (202) 452&hyph;0350. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  A proposed rule amending certain sections of the regulations at 43 CFR parts 3720, 3730, 3800, 3810, 3820, 3830, and 3850 was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  on May 11, 1994 (59 FR 24572). There were 25 comments received regarding the proposal. Six comments were received from Bureau of Land Management (BLM) State Offices, 4 comments were received from private attorneys, 3 comments were received from individuals not connected with the mining industry, 3 comments were received from mining claimants, 3 comments were received from mining industry organizations, 1 comment was received from an individual in a mining-related business, 1 comment was received from a county government, 1 comment was received from an environmental group, 1 comment was received from a mining company, 1 comment was received from a Forest Service employee, and 1 comment was received from an individual BLM employee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of the Interior, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(d), for good cause finds that it would not be in the public interest to delay the effective date until 30 days after publication. The deadline for payment of the annual maintenance fee is August 31, 1994. The mining industry needs as much time as possible to comply with the rule, and the BLM State Offices will not be able to accept filing and payments, or to assist the public in other ways, until the rule is effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> General Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule contained several references to the Act of October 5, 1992, which established the mining claim rental fee that has been in effect since the date of its enactment and which will expire on September 30, 1994. For the sake of simplicity, and because (1) The maintenance fee essentially replaces the original rental fee, (2) the rental fee statute will expire on September 30, and (3) any remaining issues regarding the rental fee can be dealt with using the regulations that implemented the October 5, 1992, Act, which were codified in the 1993 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), all references to the 1992 Act have been removed from this final rule, including references to rental fees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comments addressed all aspects of the proposed rule. They were all given careful consideration and are addressed in this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment asked whether the $10 service charge for recording notices of location was being eliminated. The answer is no, because it is required for cost recovery purposes. The service charge requirement is retained in &sect;3833.1&hyph;4(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment expressed uncertainty as to when the new maintenance fee was to be effective. The maintenance fee for existing claims is first due to be filed on or before August 31, 1994, to hold the claim for the 1994&hyph;1995 assessment year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment stated that the maintenance fee should not be subject to increases tied to the consumer price index and that such increases would put the fee out of sight for small miners. The comment further stated that these increases should not apply to those holding 10 or fewer claims. The provision to adjust maintenance fees to reflect changes in the consumer price index is statutory and cannot be changed in this rule. However, it would not affect small miners who file a valid waiver certification statement. Such individuals would not have to pay the maintenance fee, but would continue to perform $100 worth of assessment work as required by the Mining Law of 1872.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment stated that this rule and other unspecified changes in the Mining Law were being done without congressional authorization and are putting the mining industry out of business. The rule is being promulgated and is explicitly required by Section 10106 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (107 Stat. 407), as enacted by Congress. Despite the reduction in active mining claims on Federal lands since $100 fees were first required in the 1992&hyph;93 assessment year, there is no substantial evidence to suggest that the fee is driving the bona fide mining industry out of business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG /FTAG --></p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Bail for two senior Nissan UK men THE DEPUTY chairman of Nissan UK and the company's former finance director, who are accused of cheating the Inland Revenue of corporation tax, were remanded on bail until May 20 by magistrates in Worthing, West Sussex, yesterday. Mr Michael Hunt, deputy chairman and assistant managing director, is charged with dishonestly arranging for falsely inflated invoices and for the submission of accounts in which Nissan UK's net pre-tax profits were understated by about Pounds 100m. Mr Hunt and Mr Frank Shannon, former finance director, each face a similar charge in which the alleged understatement of profits was about Pounds 50m for an earlier period. A separate case in which Mr Shannon and two of the company's financial advisers are alleged to have conspired to cheat the Revenue over stock relief claims was adjourned until April 23 when a date will be fixed for a hearing for committal to crown court.</p>

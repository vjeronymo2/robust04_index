			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn, May 2 (XINHUA) -- PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat  said today that he believed the agreement on Palestinian  self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho could be signed on  Wednesday [4 May].    'Arafat made the remarks at a press conference at the  headquarters of Daimler-Benz A.G. in Stuttgart, Germany.    Commenting on the planned signing of the self-rule agreement  in Cairo Wednesday, the PLO leader said, "where there is will  there is a way."    But he cautioned that one person cannot dance a tango and  the  success also depends on the other party.    He said his talks with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  in Cairo tomorrow will be devoted to solving "some problems" and  he hoped the meeting could "remove obstacles."    Asked when he would return to Jerusalem, Jericho or Gaza,  'Arafat said this will depend on when Israel withdraws its  troops from the occupied territories.    Israeli Army should have been pulled out of Gaza and the  Jericho area before April 13 in accordance with an original plan.    'Arafat arrived in Stuttgart early today on a day-long visit  at the invitation of the German automaker Daimler-Benz A.G. He  met with company president Edzard Reuter on cooperation between  Palestine and Germany. He also conferred with Erwin Teufel,  minister-president of Baden- Wurttemberg.</p>

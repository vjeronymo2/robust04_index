			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: European equities London was not the only equity market in holiday mood yesterday. But the strength of European bourses is not a one-day wonder. While relatively thin trading volumes played a part, Frankfurt had already risen by 5 per cent and Paris by more than 10 per cent from troughs at the end of June. Optimism about the pace of economic recovery - confirmed by yesterday's strong June industrial output figures for western Germany - is the underlying cause. Since most European markets are still below the levels reached early in the year and earnings forecasts are higher, there could be further gains to come. The speed of recovery means that cyclical European companies now look likely to report peak earnings in 1996/97, a full year earlier than anticipated. Sectors valued by investors on multiples of peak earnings - such as chemicals - have shown particularly strong gains as a result. Even so, investors will be looking to half-year results statements for reassurance. Euphoria should also be tempered by the knowledge that upsets in bond or currency markets could again spill over into equities. While US interest rate rises should be less troublesome from now on, problems could arise elsewhere. If bourses continue higher and the dollar starts to strengthen, for example, US fund managers could be tempted to take profits on European shares.</p>

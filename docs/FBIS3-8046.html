Stanislav Devaty told a CESKY DENIK correspondent: "In my  post, I can only congratulate our U.S. colleagues on their great  success. I must say that in all the time I have held this  position, since August 1992, I have not come across a case that  would be even remotely reminiscent of a CIA employee's  defection. As a citizen, I am distressed by the confirmation of  my concerns that even under the new circumstances Russia has not  changed its approach to the objects of its interest. The head  of Russian intelligence, Primakov, recently said that the Czech  Republic's place in Russia's sphere of certain interests does  not mean that Russia conducts activity against the interest or  laws of our country. In view of what has happened, I am not  certain whether this statement of his can be trusted."</p>

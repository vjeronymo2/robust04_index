			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 26 (AFP) -- NATO Thursday [26 May]  officially denied that Secretary General Manfred Woerner, who  missed two North Atlantic Treaty Organisation meetings earlier  this week through illness, was to resign his post.    A spokesman told reporters "the secretary general has not  resigned and has no intention of resigning."    Woerner, 59, whose mandate runs out in 1996, has been  operated on for stomach cancer three times since April 1992, and  in early January he said he had beaten the illness.    However, on January 14 he was operated on for a severe  intestinal blockage and in early May he postponed indefinitely a  visit to the United States.    At the start of the week, Woerner wrote to NATO defence  ministers explaining he would not be able to chair meetings  Tuesday and Wednesday, for medical reasons.    "It was my firm intention to leave the hospital in time to  chair the meetings. Even my doctors were hopeful that this  would be possible.    "However they now advise me that the previous untimely  interruptions of my convalescence had taken their toll and that  another premature return might well damage the chances of a full  recovery," he said in a letter, published by NATO Thursday.    However, while Woerner's post is not due to come up for  another two years, a senior European Commission official  suggested that the question of a possible successor to Woerner  could be linked to the other international posts coming up in  Europe in the next couple of years.    "Without being morbid, one can imagine an agreement on a  global package including Woerner's post, the president of the  European Commission, the secretary general of the Western  European Union and the secretary general of the European Union's  Council of Ministers," the official said, requesting anonymity.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Paper producers win back power A spate of proposed price increases has firmly tilted the balance of power in North American and European pulp and paper markets towards producers. International Paper, the world's biggest paper company, based in Purchase, New York, last week announced plans to cut discounts on coated groundwood paper by about 7 per cent on July 1. The planned price hike coincides with the peak ordering period for mail-order and Christmas catalogues. If implemented, it would be the first increase for this grade of paper in four years. In the newsprint market, US and Canadian producers plan to cut discounts by between 6 per cent and 7 per cent on August 15, the second price increase this year. Sizeable increases are also scheduled for linerboard and corrugating medium, used to make cardboard boxes. The proposed USDollars 40 per ton hike for linerboard is the third - and biggest - since last October. It would bring the price to Dollars 385 per ton, up from Dollars 290 last autumn. In Europe, producers of coated grades made from chemical pulp are pushing for a 10 per cent price rise on top of hikes of 15-20 per cent over the past six months. Producers will not necessarily succeed in pushing through the full increases. Prices of some grades, such as tissue, remain weak. But the size of the planned rises points to a more prolonged tightening in paper markets than most observers expected. 'The situation could continue for a while,' said Mr Mads Asprem, analyst at Morgan Stanley in London. Mr Asprem has backed away from forecasts that pulp prices will turn down this autumn. Mr Ross Hay-Roe, analyst at Equity Research Associates in Vancouver, says that a combination of rising demand and shrinking capacity has brought the North American newsprint market into balance for the first time since 1988. Mr Hay-Roe predicted in his latest market commentary that 'there won't be enough newsprint to go around' if the US economy keeps growing. The shift in bargaining power is illustrated by Fletcher Challenge Canada's decision not to renew a long-term newsprint contract with Times Mirror, publisher of the Los Angeles Times. According to one paper consultant, Times Mirror, which gained a reputation as one of the toughest bargainers among buyers, has yet to find another supplier willing to provide long-term protection against further price increases.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Civil Service pension funds trail Abbey on performance BRITISH Civil Service pensions offer only average benefits when compared with similar plans offered by private-sector employers, a study has shown. The study, conducted by Union Pension Services and sponsored by the GMB general union, found that some banks and financial institutions offer the best benefits available. The study ranked 100 leading pension schemes in Britain by the benefits they offered and the contributions required from employees. It is the first effort to conduct a systemat comparison of private employers' benefits. Among factors taken into account were the size of contributions required from members, statutory increases to benefits, the rate at which members accrue pension rights, and ancillary benefits such as ill-health pensions and discretionary benefits. The top 10 schemes for benefits and contributions were: Abbey National Scheme, ICI Fund, TSB Group Scheme, Legal and General Fund, Burmah Castrol Plan, BBC Scheme, Rothmans Fund, Shell Pension Fund, Woolwich Building Society Fund and Siemans Scheme. The bottom 10 were: Rank Organisation Plan, DRG Pension Fund (Lower Scale), TI Group Scheme (General Section), Massey Ferguson Works, Massey Ferguson Staff, Daily Mail Scheme, Harmsworth Scheme, Philips Pension Fund, NEI (Scale 1) and DRG Pension Fund. Among civil service schemes, which have historically been reputed to offer benefits superior to private-sector schemes, the Universities Scheme achieved the top overall rating of 51 per cent. This compares with the top-rated private-employer scheme, Abbey National, at 104 per cent.

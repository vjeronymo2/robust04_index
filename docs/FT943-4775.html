			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Boddington declines to Pounds 13m Boddington Group, the pubs, hotels, nursing homes and drink distributor, reported pre-tax profits for the 26 weeks to July 3 almost halved at Pounds 13.1m, against Pounds 25.2m which included a gain of Pounds 13m from the sale of its stake in Devenish. However underlying profits grew by 6.4 per cent despite patchy recovery in consumer spending. 'All the economic indicators are set in the right direction,' said Mr Denis Cassidy, chairman, but cautious consumers still needed to justify to themselves 'the need to spend'. Trading profits rose to Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 14.7m) with all four divisions increasing profits. Turnover rose 14 per cent to Pounds 129m (Pounds 113.2m). Its estate of 477 pubs, all in north west England, produced a 4 per cent rise in profits to Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 10.3m) on turnover up 6.5 per cent to Pounds 53.5m (Pounds 50.3m). Managed pubs showed an 12 per cent rise but tenanted profits were down 11.3 per cent on 8.2 per cent fewer pubs. Beer volumes in its regional market fell 3.9 per cent with the fall in the managed pubs limited to 2.1 per cent on a like-for-like basis while tenanted pub volumes fell 4.9 per cent. Liquid Assets, the drinks distributor, lifted profits by only 5.8 per cent to Pounds 3.04m (Pounds 2.87m) despite a 20 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 59m (Pounds 49.2m). Leisure hotels rose 51 per cent to Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 1.13m) on turnover up 30 per cent at Pounds 9.4m (Pounds 7.18m). Healthcare, consisting of 17 nursing homes in the south east of England, reported a 3.4 per cent increase to Pounds 1.66m (Pounds 1.6m) on turnover ahead 10 per cent at Pounds 7.1m (Pounds 6.41m). The interim dividend is lifted to 3.15p (2.86p) from earnings per share of 8.4p (18.5p) or 8.2p (7.6p) excluding property and exceptional items. COMMENT Boddington produced the good results expected from a group which had spotted early the benefits of selling its regional brewery to concentrate on pub retailing. But two weaknesses are apparent, tenanted pubs and drinks wholesaling. It must move faster to switch to higher margin managed pubs and to expand its estate. On the wholesaling side, it has yet to show that volume growth can bring economies of scale. On full-year pre-tax profit forecasts of Pounds 30.5m and eps of 19.4p, the shares are on a prospective multiple of about 15. That is a fair rating until Boddington makes more of its pubs and distribution businesses.</p>

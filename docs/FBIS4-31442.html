			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Serbian General Ratko Mladic by Renzo </F> Cianfanelli in central Bosnia; date not given: "NATO Out of the  Balkans"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Cianfanelli] Strategically the  Serbs, even if numerically in a minority, are the stronger and  have practically attained all their objectives. In Bosnia right  now you control more than 70 percent of the territory. [Bosnian  Serbs leader] Karadzic himself says that he is ready to make  sizable concessions in order to achieve peace. What more  remains? As a military man, how do you view the situation now?    [Mladic] The reply can be read in what Muslim General Rasim  Delic said very recently to the LJILIAN newspaper. I can only  add that, with the very recent creation of the Muslim-Croat  federation, an enormous potential for war has been released  which is turned against us.    [Cianfanelli] Which, specifically?    [Mladic] I am talking of attacks against us. Until a few  days ago there was intense fighting in this same region near the  Zvornik corridor. The Muslims have attacked us several times in  the area of Srbobran, Turbe, and Mount Vlasic. They have also  violated the truce around Bugojno and in the Sarajevo  demilitarized zone.    [Cianfanelli] But there is also news of Serbian troop  movements around the Brcko corridor, where, it is feared, the  next crisis could explode. How is the situation at Brcko?    [Mladic] Stable.    [Cianfanelli] Do you mean that there are no encounters?    [Mladic] On the contrary, every day we are subjected to  provocations from the Muslims with tanks, artillery, and  medium-caliber weapons. The Croats in the meantime are  attacking us from the direction of Orasje, and to the south of  Brcko they are involved in joint actions, which we are opposing.    [Cianfanelli] At Sarajevo General Delic told us that you  want  to enlarge the Brcko corridor from three to ten kilometers. Is  this true?    [Mladic] We have not moved in the corridor since 28 June  1992.    [Cianfanelli] Are you then ready to sign a truce with Delic  which would be respected by both parties?    [Mladic] I am not interested in a truce with Delic. When we  got him with his back to the wall at Gorazde, all Delic knew  what to do was to scream for help from the United Nations,  inundating the runways of the NATO airport with rivers of Muslim  tears. His one aim was to force the West to intervene... In  any event, we are ready to negotiate for a political peace on  all territorial disputes which are currently outstanding in  Bosnia. Before Gorazde I was in Sarajevo three times. I  negotiated with General Rose and was ready to negotiate with the  Muslim and Croat commanders. But they did not come. Their aim  was to tie my hands with the negotiations, whilst continuing to  attack me in Gorazde and in central Bosnia.    [Cianfanelli] Excuse me for being frank. From your point of  view Gorazde was not a success. In terms of international  image, the siege was a disaster for you. Think only of the  negative publicity, and the risk of a massive NATO intervention.    [Mladic] There we go, NATO. But do you not see in Italy  either that NATO is looking for an excuse to move its advanced  bases further east, as at Tuzla and Skopje, where they are less  dangerous and less expensive for you?    [Cianfanelli] If you permit me, it is not NATO which is  moving further east. In the Balkans NATO is intervening under  UN mandate. And, if anything, it is the East European countries  who are queuing up to be allowed into NATO.    [Mladic] I do not want to go into politics. But I can say  that in Italy you are not fortunate in having Aviano and Ancona  [NATO bases] on your territory. For you, moving these bases  further east would certainly be an advantage. As to NATO's  intentions, let me insist sincerely. You in Italy are wrong,  and the longer you take in realizing this, the more it will cost  you.    [Cianfanelli] With the same sincerity I can assure you that  in Italy there are at least two generations who think that, if  Italy defeated communism and did not slip into communism, but is  free and, despite everything which needs to be changed, has made  enormous progress, and if also the great fraud of socialism in  the East has collapsed, we owe this to NATO.    [Mladic] How then do you explain, if NATO is not  expansionist, the NATO attack on Gorazde? And the support which  NATO, together with the United Nations, continues to give to the  Muslims and the Croats? No, frankly, I am not convinced.    [Cianfanelli] Thank you for your frankness, which is always  the basis of friendship. You have already said that in Bosnia  there is a need to achieve a political and not a military  solution, but meanwhile the war, with deaths and devastation,  continues. When will there be a political solution?    [Mladic] This does not depend on the Serbian people. It  depends on the gods of war, who, following the disintegration of  Yugoslavia, have not yet reached their objectives in the  Balkans. Unfortunately, for the immediate future, I am not  optimistic.</p>

Net inflow last year was 8.91 billion dollars, up 28.6  percent from 6.92 billion dollars in 1992 and the highest figure  so far, the central bank said.    The financial sector drew 1.07 billion dollars, down from  2.65 billion dollars in 1992 because of a decline in bank loans,  the private sector attracted 9.88 billion dollars, up from 5.22  billion dollars, and the public sector got 2.04 billion dollars,  up from 950 million dollars, by paying loans in advance.    The sharp rise in the private sector was caused by three  factors: One: Foreign funds to invest in the stock market rose  from 2.06 billion dollars to 5.75 billion dollars, two: Euro  bonds floated by Korean companies soared from 1.8 billion  dollars to 2.93 billion dollars, three: Deposits for export on  deferred payment term jumped from 1.75 billion dollars to 1.81  billion dollars because of a drop in global interest rates and a  rush of shipbuilding orders.    The Korea Development Institute has predicted this year's  inflow at 18 billion dollars and advised the government to take  measures to curb the side-effects.</p>

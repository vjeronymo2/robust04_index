			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: UK markets It is starting to look as though last week's UK rate cut may have been justified after all. Today's retail price figures will give a better indication. But yesterday's disappointing data on industrial production and the Confederation of British Industry's lukewarm retail trends survey suggest the economy might not be in quite such a strong position to withstand April's tax increases. Yesterday's 30 point gain shows the equity market is certainly fired up by the prospect of more base rate cuts. Gilts might be too, if they were not still fretting about how the forthcoming auction will be received amid turbulence on international bond markets. It does not help gilts that sterling is weakening further in the backwash of the dollar's fall against the yen, and on fears that German rate cuts may be further delayed. That will deter foreign investors, which may explain why the Bank of England yesterday set the amount of the auction at only Pounds 2.5bn and the maturity at the lower end of its proposed range. Equities, of course, are helped by a falling exchange rate. The paradox is that at this stage they should be registering some disappointment at the thought that the recovery may be weaker than expected, while gilts should benefit from conditions which encourage rate cuts. If the economic data continues to point in this direction, gilts' current weakness could turn out a buying opportunity, however the auction goes.</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ALHAMBRA;  </P> <P> MAIN STREET ZONING CHANGE  </P> <P> After seeing that the west end of Main Street isn't destined to become an  automobile row after all, the City Council decided Monday to change the zoning  back to general commercial.  </P> <P> Assistant City Manager P. Michael Paules said in a report that the automobile  zoning was established in 1986 when the city's General Plan was revised.  However, Paules said the city has since realized the area is unsuitable for an  auto strip, in part because of the shallowness of the lots.  </P> <P> Paules said the change means businesses other than automobile dealerships will  not have to obtain a conditional-use permit from the city to operate in the  area.  </P></p>

Prior to his departure al-Wuhayyib stated  that the GCC looks forward for the meeting with the U.S. side to  lead to a document which defines the aims of these talks and a  program of action to be realized. He pointed out that the Saudi  minister of trade will be leading the GCC side while the U.S.  secretary of trade will lead the American side.    Al-Wuhayyib added that the GCC secretariat general intends  to  submit the agreement on free trade exchange which was not  accepted before by the U.S. side, but following the endorsement  of the free trade agreement of North America, and reaching an  agreement at the end of the Uruguay round within the GATT  framework, "circumstances may be suitable for the submission of  this proposal by the GCC." He also said that the unified Gulf  delegation will discuss with the American side too the subject  of investment and methods of encouraging it, industrial  cooperation, science and technology and rights of individual  ownership. He said that negotiating with a superpower such as  the United States with a unified Gulf delegation reflects the  cohesion of the GCC member states and reaffirms that progress is  being made along the path of integration.

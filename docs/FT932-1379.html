			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / US deplores 'outrageous' decision BRITAIN and the US yesterday deplored the Nigerian regime's annulment of the elections earlier this month and both said they were reassessing relations with the country. In Washington, the State Department said all aspects of bilateral relations, including US aid and the presence of an ambassador in Lagos, were under review. Using unusually strong language, a spokesman read a prepared statement describing the annulment as 'outrageous', given the elections were considered by independent observers to be 'orderly, fair and free from any serious irregularities'. 'We remain concerned about the continuing repression of the press and of democratic forces,' the statement said. 'The failure of the military regime to respect the will of the Nigerian people will have serious implications for US-Nigerian relations.' The spokesman said that bilateral aid - currently about Dollars 22m a year - was at the top of subjects for review, as might be the Dollars 12m the US is currently providing to finance the Nigerian-led peacekeeping effort in Liberia. US pressure on the international lending institutions may also be expected. Last week Nigeria expelled a US diplomat from Lagos, inducing the US to consider cancelling some exchange programmes. The voiding of the elections in Africa's most populous country casts a cloud over the Clinton administration's efforts to give a higher profile to the continent's problems. This week Mr George Moose, the State Department's divisional chief, has been in Angola, among other countries, seeking to convey the message of greater US engagement. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said the UK would have no option but to reassess relations with Nigeria. A Foreign Office spokesman declined to say whether Britain might withdraw diplomats from Nigeria or downgrade diplomatic relations in some other way. Mr Hurd said the general's decision would increase tensions in the west African state and he urged all parties to 'respond peacefully'.</p>

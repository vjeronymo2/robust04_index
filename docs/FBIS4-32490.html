			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jozsef Rakos: "One Out of Two Ministries"] </F>   [Text] One result of the coalition talks is that two  ministries will be merged. According to the explanation, the  Ministry of International Economic Relations (NGKM) is  unnecessary because the market is unified, and there is not a  domestic and a foreign market. Therefore, it will be dismantled  and most of it will be inherited by the future economics  ministry.    Down to the level of deputy state secretary, the structural  and supervisory system is the same at the two affected  ministries -- the Industry and Trade Ministry (IKM) and the KGKM.    The two administrations were directed by a total of seven  deputy state secretaries but, for example in the IKM, the  National Tourist Office (OIH) was a separate unit and its  chairman had the rank of head of a main department. Similarly,  the Office for European Affairs, headed by an administrative  state secretary, had a special role in the NGKM.    The IKM will be the basis of what is to be called the  economics ministry. In addition to the already mentioned OIH,  it had four major professional areas: industry, energy, trade,  and economics. It seems to be expedient to keep the first three  of these because the fourth organization is almost the same at  the two ministries. They both have economic, finance, control,  statistics, and computer sections.    Although with different tasks and requirements, both  ministries have an organizational unit dealing with foreign  relations, investment, privatization, and joint ventures. In  addition to this, an international integration main department  also operates in the IKM under the leadership of the deputy  secretary of state for trade.    According to the news, the NGKM will see the biggest  changes.  The ministry will actually be divided up between three  ministries. The departments dealing with international finance  and investment policy, and the aid coordination secretariat of  the OECD will be attached to the Finance Ministry. The Foreign  Ministry is also to receive part of the NGKM, namely the network  of the state's trade representations abroad. However, it is  questionable what to do with the regional main departments  because all trade representatives belonged to the main  department of their region. These are most probably to work  within the framework of the newly established economic ministry.    The fate of the Office for European Affairs is the biggest  question. The 50-member organization was established to  coordinate integration into Europe    In all Western European countries, independent ministries or  similar offices were established to help ease the entry to the  European Community. However, actual membership was arranged by  the foreign ministries and, since neither the Hungarian  Socialist Party nor the Alliance of Free Democrats wants to set  up an integration office with a minister without portfolio, this  office will probably also be attached to the Foreign Ministry.</p>

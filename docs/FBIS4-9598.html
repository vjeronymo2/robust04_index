			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 29 (AFP) -- Gorazde is "basically a  ghetto" which can expect "serious health problems" over the  summer as a result of the destruction of the town's sole water  purification plant, an aid worker said Friday [29 April].  Although all the town's population, estimated at more than  50,000 people, had shelter, there was "very serious  overcrowding" with the town's three remaining schools -- two  others were completely destroyed -- used as collective centres,  Ryan Grist, of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), said  after a five-day visit.    There were two sources of good water where people had to  spend long hours queueing: "the problem is not quality but  quantity." Though there was "a lot of destruction" in the town,  Gorazde was "not a Vukovar", the eastern Croatian town that was  almost totally flattened by three months of Serbian shelling in  late 1991. However in the areas reached by the Serb offensive,  "every house was gutted," Grist said.    On Wednesday [27 April], during a visit to the Gorazde, UN  commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina General Sir Michael Rose said  there was "not as much destruction as (he) expected." On  reports that the number of casualties during the three-week  onslaught on the town had been inflated, Grist commented: "There  was complete terror and horror; if I'd been there, I too would  have exaggerated."    Following the first evacuations of the wounded from Gorazde  Monday, UN sources suggested that the numbers of killed and  wounded might have to be revised downwards by as much as two  thirds.    The representative of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees,  Peter Kessler, has consistently defended his organisation's  estimate of more than 700 killed and almost 2,000 wounded. A  Nordic battalion has located "a further 70 to 100 seriously  wounded people in difficult access regions" of Gorazde who he  hoped would be evacuated out of the town Sunday [1 May]. They  were "apparently heavily wounded" and would be transferred to  the city centre Saturday [30 April], he said. Many of those  evacuated to Sarajevo in a three-day operation earlier this week  were seriously affected by infection and malnutrition, Kessler  said. Up to 25 were to be urgently evacuated to France, Ireland  and Denmark Saturday, depending on their condition.    A 14-truck UNHCR convoy carrying 68 tonnes of wheat flour  and  family packages left Belgrade early Friday and was expected to  arrive in Gorazde later in the morning, Kessler said. He added  that following several "administrative delays" imposed by  Bosnian Serbs in eastern Bosnia, his organisation had reminded  them of their obligation to allow unhindered freedom of movement  for humanitarian convoys.</p>

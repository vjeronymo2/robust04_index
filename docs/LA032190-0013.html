			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> SAKAMOTO'S 'NEO GEO' FEELING DISAPPEARS AT PALACE  </P> <P> When composer/actor/pianist Ryuichi Sakamoto was writing portions of the score  of "The Last Emperor," director Bernardo Bertolucci kept telling him to give it  "more feeling."  </P> <P> Bertolucci should have been around for Sakamoto's performance at the Palace on  Monday to offer similar advice.  </P> <P> Sakamoto's eight-piece ensemble devoted most of the program to a reading of the  music from his new album "Beauty." But the energy, subtlety and feeling of the  record virtually disappeared in the cavernous, reverberating sound of the  Palace.  </P> <P> Interesting moments surfaced from time to time: "You Do Me" managed to generate  some rhythmic vigor, and Sakamoto's solo piano work revealed some provocatively  dissonant (if oddly disconnected) harmonic ideas. Three vocalists added piquant  touches of Japanese classical-style singing, especially on "Calling From  Tokyo."  </P> <P> "Rose," however, one of the album's best tracks, wilted in the mushy sound,  with Sakamoto's singing a virtual monotone. And keyboardist/singer Nicky  Holland's efforts to cover the R&amp;B aspects of the music lacked the spirit  and vitality of the album's Jill Jones.  </P> <P> Sakamoto describes his current creative efforts -- a melange of Japanese pop,  American rock, jazz, contemporary classical music, R&amp;B and various  world-music sounds -- as "Neo Geo." Monday's program suggested that he's  managed to get most of the musical elements in place. But Neo Geo still sounds  like a recipe that's light on soul. DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

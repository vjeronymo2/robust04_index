			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Plus signs for negative equity: Alison Smith finds controversy over the effects of the problem While the problem of having a mortgage which is larger than the value of one's home is still casting a shadow over hundreds of thousands of households, the gloom that 'negative equity' has shed over the housing market appears to be lifting somewhat. Two estimates published this week of the extent of negative equity in the third quarter of this year, confirmed the fall during the past 12 months. The Bank of England estimates that 1,096,000 households were in this plight  -a drop of 16 per cent compared with the final three months of last year. A separate assessment by the Woolwich building society, the UK's third largest, put the number of negative equity households at 930,000 - more than 20 per cent lower than the fourth quarter of last year. The UK's largest mortgage lenders agree that they are pleased to see negative equity falling, and that it is not the restriction on the housing market that it was a year or 18 months ago. Against the background of house prices which are no longer tumbling - even if the price increases seem small and fragile - opinions are more divided about how far negative equity is acting as a depressant on the housing market at its current, lower levels. Mr Martin Ellis, chief economist at Woolwich, described its impact as 'removing a rung from the housing ladder', and said it must fall further 'before it stops being a problem'. Many households in that position are those who bought for the first time in the late 1980s, he said, and who might otherwise be expected to move or to have moved already. He also highlighted the constraints on households whose stake in their home is slightly higher than their mortgage, but which would be eaten up by the costs of moving. At the Nationwide build-ing society, Mr David Parry, head of planning, is more sceptical of the impact of the phenomenon. 'There's no real evidence that negative equity is a brake,' he said. 'The real motor in the housing market is always the first-time buyers.' Some economists argue, however, that negative equity has an effect in deterring first-time buyers in particular. The Halifax building society, the UK's largest mortgage lender, pointed out that fear of negative equity from falls in house prices may be a particularly acute problem for first-time buyers because they are most likely to be borrowing the highest proportions of the value of their home. For Abbey National, with its bias in coverage towards the south-east of England, the gradual reduction in negative equity has been particularly important: the region was especially hard hit by the fall in house prices. Even so, Mr Charles Toner, managing director of Abbey's retail operations, played down the importance of negative equity as a factor, compared with the impact of the apparent lack of sustained confidence in economic recovery. 'If it halved again in the next year its impact would become marginal,' Mr Toner said.</p>

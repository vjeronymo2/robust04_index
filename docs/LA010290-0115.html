			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'TANGO' DANCES TO TOP AS BOX OFFICE REBOUNDS  </P> <P> The Christmas box-office blues are over, with most of the season's top movies  enjoying a huge leap in business during the New Year's Day weekend.  </P> <P> "Tango &amp; Cash," Warner's Sylvester Stallone-Kurt Russell buddy movie, moved  up 53% to top the chart with about $10.4 million, according to preliminary  figures released today.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Danny De Vito's black comedy about divorce, "War of the Roses,"  jumped more than 140%, with roughly $10 million worth of tickets sold over the  four-day weekend. And children flocked to see Disney's animated feature, "The  Little Mermaid."  </P> <P> Its early business may have been disappointing -- particularly considering the  critical acclaim surrounding the old-fashioned fairy tale -- but ticket sales  jumped nearly 200% over the weekend to nearly $10 million.  </P> <P> Universal's "Back to the Future II," which opened more than a month ago, also  made a big comeback with more than $8 million in ticket sales, a 100% increase  over the Christmas weekend.

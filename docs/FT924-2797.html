			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / International Company News: Skoda in steel equipment venture SKODA, the Czech motor group controlled by Volkswagen, and Dorries Scharmann, the German engineering company, have set up a DM50m (Dollars 31.40m) joint venture to make heavy steel-cutting equipment at Skoda's base in Pilzen, in the west of the Czech republic. Skoda and Dorries Scharmann currently make similar equipment, and the venture is effectively a takeover of Skoda's current production. Under the agreement, which was signed yesterday, each company will initially control 49 per cent, but, in return for providing the finance, Dorries Scharmann will gain control of the remaining 2 per cent in 1997. That 2 per cent is to be held in escrow. Skoda said the joint venture would 'help stabilise its current position' in the sector and give it access to world markets. The company has been badly hit by falling demand for its products in Czechoslovakia as the impact of economic reforms begins to bite. Skoda is in stalemate with Siemens, the German industrial group on setting up transport and energy joint ventures.</p>

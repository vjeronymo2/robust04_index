			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: IRVINE;  </P> <P> STUDENTS PLAN PROTESTS OVER KILLINGS IN CHINA  </P> <P> Students at UC Irvine plan two demonstrations today to protest the killing of  Chinese students in Beijing.  </P> <P> At noon in UCI's Gateway Plaza, the Republic of China Student Assn. has  scheduled a protest gathering, according to Colleen Bentley-Adler, a university  spokeswoman.  </P> <P> At 8 p.m., also in Gateway Plaza, a candlelight vigil sponsored by several  groups will mourn the deaths of the Chinese students.  </P> <P> UCI has one of the largest Asian-American enrollments in the nation. About 30%  of UCI's 15,800 students this academic year are Asian-Americans, according to  enrollment figures.  </P> <P> The university also has many visiting Chinese professors and students,  Bentley-Adler said. Some of the visitors worried initially about having to  return to mainland China, now reportedly near civil war. But President Bush has  extended the length of time that the Chinese students may stay in this country.  </P> <P> "Still, there are going to be quite a few who feel their situation is in  limbo," Bentley-Adler said. "I think the biggest agony for these visitors from  China is wondering about friends and relatives back there."  </P> <P> She said that some UCI professors who had planned to go to China this summer as  exchange scholars have canceled their plans.  </P> <P> "We also have some professors who planned to go there and would still be going  there, but now they are not being allowed entry by China," Bentley-Adler  explained.  </P></p>

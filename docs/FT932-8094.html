			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / German steel chiefs attack EC LEADERS of the German steel industry expressed indignation and bitterness yesterday at the failure of European steel restructuring policies in the wake of the collapse of Saarstahl, the French-owned steelmaker in the depressed German Saarland. Thyssen, Germany's largest steel manufacturer, condemned the policy of allowing continuing state subsidies to ailing producers, and said the rest of the industry would be threatened if they were allowed to restructure their debts. The steel manufacturers' federation lashed out at the failure of the European Community to curb production at Italy's state-owned Ilva and at CSI in Spain, where the companies' debt burdens far exceed those of Germany's private-sector producers. The industry condemned the policy of interfering in free market competition to protect the weakest manufacturers. The anger of industry leaders was matched by the bitterness of workers at the Saarstahl plant, who blamed Brussels, above all, for the loss of their jobs. Saarstahl filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday night after France's Usinor-Sacilor, which owns 70 per cent of the holding company, decided it could no longer transfer funds to cover estimated monthly losses of DM30m (Pounds 12m). Hopes for an immediate rescue faded as both federal and Saarland authorities said no new subsidies were available. Since Saarstahl first ran into difficulties in 1978, it has received some DM3.7bn in direct subsidies, soft loans and credit guarantees. 'We are the victims of the European Community's inability to devise a coherent steel policy,' said Mr Werner Fries, an official of the works council at the plant. The statement by Thyssen underlined the deep concern at the heart of the German industry over the crisis. The company warned that if both Saarstahl and Klockner-Werke, the other German steelmaker currently seeking a debt write-off with its main creditors, are kept going artificially, it would have 'negative consequences on the rest of theindustry'. Thyssen employs 13,000 just in the manufacture of long products, like steel sections, rods and wire, where EC overcapacity is greatest. David Buchan adds from Paris: Usinor-Sacilor said it would have to take a FFr1.4bn loss in its 1993 accounts, representing its loans to the subsidiary, which would not now be repaid.

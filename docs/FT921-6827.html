			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Addison makes Pounds 14.75m call for AGB Research acquisition ADDISON Consultancy, the market research group, is paying Pounds 14.75m for the main businesses of AGB Research, part of the collapsed Maxwell private empire. The price of the deal was revealed yesterday in a rights issue document designed to pay for the acquisition which will take Addison from sixth to top position in UK market research. Preliminary agreement on the purchase was reached with administrators Arthur Andersen last month. Addison, which trades as Taylor Nelson, will raise approximately Pounds 16.3m net from the rights issue which already has the support of more than 53 per cent of its shareholders. This does not apparently include Lord Hollick's MAI group, which has 24.8 per cent of existing Addison stock. MAI says it intends to sell if the acquisition is completed. Addison is forecasting pre-tax profits of not less than Pounds 1.2m for 1992 before taking the acquisition and rights issue into account. Under the issue holders of ordinary shares will be offered new shares at 12p on a 9-for-4 basis. Mr Tony Cowling will continue as chief executive of the enlarged group and Mr Mike Kirkham and Mr Stephan Buck, both senior AGB executives, will join the Addison board. The rights issue, which is conditional on shareholders' approval, has been underwritten by Robert Fleming, the merchant bank. Mr Cowling said yesterday that the opportunity to acquire AGB represented a very significant step forward for Addison. Trading in the shares of the enlarged group is expected to begin on March 13.</p>

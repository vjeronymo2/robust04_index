			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTLAW GROUP BATTLES ODDS IN HOLLYWOOD PRESERVATION EFFORT;  </P> <P> REDEVELOPMENT: THE ADVISORY PANEL HAS BEEN SUPPLANTED BY ONE WITH OFFICIAL  STATUS BUT CONTINUES TO FUNCTION. DEVELOPERS AREN'T SURE WHICH GROUP TO  APPROACH.  </P> <P> Robert Nudelman can't get enough of Hollywood. The self-employed researcher has  gone to 983 movies during the past three years. His favorite pastime: scanning  the films for scenes shot in Hollywood, especially old buildings on Hollywood  Boulevard.  </P> <P> It is little wonder then that Nudelman, 33, settled in the film capital when he  moved to Los Angeles from Arizona 12 years ago. And, his friends say, it is  little wonder that he is now the driving force behind a scrappy band of  residents and merchants determined to keep the wrecking ball from altering the  face and character of their tattered town.  </P> <P> Doreet Hakman opened her first coffee shop in Hollywood in 1974, a decade after  she and her family fled Romania with two suitcases in tow. The mother of four  now runs the Snow White cafe on Hollywood Boulevard, which dates back to 1937,  when the Walt Disney film of the same name premiered down the street.  </P> <P> Hakman joined Nudelman's crusade because she worries that urban renewal will  uproot the community's poorest residents, including many struggling emigres  following in her footsteps.  </P> <P> Ruth Goulet bought into Hollywood four years ago, leaving her Western Avenue  apartment for a 76-year-old house near the intersection of Hollywood and Vine  Street. A grandmother and nutritionist, Goulet spends her spare time poring  over legal notices about proposed construction projects.  </P> <P> Goulet has joined the others for fear she might lose her home, which could be  taken against her will by the Community Redevelopment Agency.  </P> <P> Nudelman, Hakman and Goulet are members of the Project Area Committee, the  one-time official voice for Hollywood on issues concerning the city of Los  Angeles' 3 1/2-year-old plan to redevelop the community. The $922-million  renewal effort covers 1,100 acres in the core of Hollywood, including Mann's  Chinese Theater, the Sunset-Gower Studios and many of the community's most  historic buildings and neighborhoods.  </P> <P> For the past eight months, the committee has been like a government in exile.  The City Council disbanded the group last May after Hollywood-area Councilman  Michael Woo, a strong advocate of redevelopment, complained that members were  trying to undermine the revitalization effort.  </P> <P> But committee members say they were just trying to protect the people of  Hollywood and its historic buildings from a redevelopment plan bent on  transforming their town into a high-rise jungle of steel and glass with little  regard for the community's "heart and soul." Despite a judge's ruling upholding  the committee's disbanding, 14 of the committee's 25 members continue to meet.  </P> <P> "I remember going through Europe when I was 10 years old," said Nudelman, who  as chairman of the committee works about 40 hours a week on Hollywood matters.  "You see all of those old buildings, and you see how groups had fought to keep  them. Well, we are at a crossroads in Hollywood. We are deciding how much of  Hollywood is going to be left for people to see 20 or 50 years from now."  </P> <P> All of the committee members are volunteers who dig into their pockets to cover  telephone, photocopying, transportation and mailing expenses. The committee  lost its official meeting place last May, so it now convenes in the first-floor  reading room at the Hollywood YWCA. The room is cramped and littered with dusty  paperback books and curled magazines. But it is free.  </P> <P> "We do our work on a shoestring, I am sure you can see that," said Goulet, the  group's second-in-command. "We pass the hat when we remember. If we come up  short, we call around and get some donations."  </P> <P> The committee brings together an odd collection of community activists,  homeowners, renters and merchants, and includes an actor, paralegal,  nutritionist, photographer, housewife, two retirees, two teachers and several  business owners. The 14 holdouts are united by a common disdain for Woo and the  Community Redevelopment Agency, and a shared vision of a Hollywood free of both  of them.  </P> <P> Some committee members, who also belong to a residents group, Save Hollywood  Our Town, have been at odds with the city over the redevelopment plan since it  was adopted by the City Council in 1986. They claim that the plan was crafted  with big-business interests in mind and have been locked in a protracted  lawsuit with the city over whether the plan is legitimate.  </P> <P> The committee opens its meetings to the public, posts its agendas, sends press  releases and forwards recommendations to the Redevelopment Agency. The monthly  agenda routinely lists "CRA reports," even though the agency never sends a  representative. It is important to keep things official, says Nudelman, who  makes the report himself based on what he learns at agency meetings and "just  asking around."  </P> <P> In the past few months, the committee has pushed to save a poor, residential  neighborhood in central Hollywood recently rezoned for industrial use; have  gotten involved in efforts to ensure that the owners of several historic  buildings, including the Paramount and Holly theaters, properly restore their  buildings; and last week voted to oppose a proposed new tax on commercial  property near three planned Metro Rail stations in Hollywood.  </P> <P> The problem is no one is officially listening.  </P> <P> "They may be meeting and discussing redevelopment issues, and that is probably  healthy," said H. Cooke Sunoo, who oversees Hollywood for the Redevelopment  Agency. "The more discussion the better. . . . But if they are purporting to be  advising the agency, they are failing miserably."  </P> <P> Redevelopment Agency officials say they are happy to be working with a new  committee, the 38-member Hollywood Community Advisory Council appointed by Woo  last summer.  </P> <P> The new committee has a decidedly professional image. It meets in the  seventh-floor conference room of the Redevelopment Agency's Sunset Boulevard  offices, where walls are dotted with architectural drawings and renderings, and  windows offer a panoramic view of Hollywood and the hills. Its membership  includes architects, social service experts, corporate executives and community  leaders.  </P> <P> Many of the new committee members are Woo's friends and political supporters.  All of them, Woo says unapologetically, share his enthusiasm for the  redevelopment plan and serve at his discretion.  </P> <P> "The advantage provided here is that it enables me to have a citizens advisory  committee, which I will be able to work closely with," Woo said last year when  announcing the new committee. "And I will be able to find panel members whose  views on transportation or economic development or urban design are compatible  with my own."  </P> <P> At a recent meeting, about a dozen committee members were joined by nine staff  members from the Redevelopment Agency and Woo's office. The agency's  recommended work program for next year will include several suggestions from  the committee, including funding for the historic preservation of homes and  buildings, agency officials said.  </P> <P> "They have helped focus the direction of the agency," said Sunoo. "That is  something the former (committee) had been totally unable to do. They bickered a  great deal about internal procedures and were opposed to things, but didn't  give us any constructive . . . direction."  </P> <P> Nudelman and others say the new group has become a "rubber stamp" for Woo and  the agency (they have dubbed it the "Vichy Project Area Committee"), but its  members say cooperation should not be confused with compliance.  </P> <P> The Project Area Committee members "are good people and they mean well, but  they get involved in a lot of rhetoric and are very pessimistic," said Fares  Wehbe, co-founder of the Hollywood Sentinels neighborhood organization and vice  chairman of the new advisory group. "When we were having problems in our  neighborhood, people said we weren't going to be able to change it. Well, our  neighborhood did change. Rather than complain about the police, we went and  worked with them. I think the same way about the Community Redevelopment  Agency. We need to take an optimistic approach and make sure we use it as a  vehicle to do things for the people who live here."  </P> <P> Nudelman is a fixture at meetings of the new group's planning and design review  committee, where agency officials discuss projects submitted by developers as  well as long-range plans to upgrade Hollywood Boulevard and deal with vexing  traffic problems. Some members of the official group welcome Nudelman and  concede his outlawed committee still plays an important role.  </P> <P> "They have a good sense of what the community is interested in," said architect  and committee member Bruce Sternberg, who lives and works outside of Hollywood.  "I am glad that they are there."  </P> <P> The dual committees have created some confusion in Hollywood, particularly  among developers. Some do not know which committee to court in their quest for  approval of projects. Bewildered, they turn to Woo and the Redevelopment Agency  for guidance. One developer agreed to talk to members of the renegade Project  Area Committee, only to back out at the last minute when he learned they had  been stripped of their official status.  </P> <P> Some members of the new advisory group worry that members of the Project Area  Committee may attempt to thwart their plans for upgrading Hollywood Boulevard,  expected to go to the agency's board of commissioners in the next few months.  </P> <P> The boulevard plan will serve as the blueprint for development, governing  everything from the width of sidewalks to the height of new buildings. The plan  will need various city approvals and require public hearings.  </P> <P> "If we can't get this thing through, it will be very, very dispiriting," said  Barton Myers, an architect on the new group who has consulted extensively with  Nudelman over the past few months to ensure the outlawed committee's  suggestions are not ignored. "The pressure is on everyone."  </P> <P> Woo said he hopes time will heal the wounds.  </P> <P> "There is no way I can compel them to not have meetings," he said about the  Project Area Committee. "I would rather have the (two advisory groups) make  amends somehow. . . . It is disappointing, but on the other hand, life goes  on."  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEXT STEP  </P> <P> Attorneys for the Project Area Committee and the city will appear in court  Wednesday to debate once again whether the Redevelopment Agency is required to  consult with the disbanded group. Superior Court Judge Kurt J. Lewin ruled last  month that the city could break ties with the committee. Committee members are  hopeful the judge will change his mind when he looks at the evidence again.  They contend his ruling was based on erroneous assumptions and a misreading of  the record. Attorneys for the city defend the ruling. If the committee should  lose again, members say they will appeal. But their attorney may recommend that  they incorporate as a nonprofit group, a change that he said would not preclude  them from remaining active in redevelopment issues.  </P></p>

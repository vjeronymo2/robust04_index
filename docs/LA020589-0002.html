			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FICTION IN BRIEF  </P> <P> THE DREAM OF A BEAST by Neil Jordan (Random House: $12.95)  </P> <P> Like "Blue Velvet" and "Parents," two recent films about the domestic 1950s,  this inspired, surrealistic novel reveals the emotional currents swirling  beneath the calm surface of suburban life. But rather than depicting these  feelings as a dark, dangerous underworld best suppressed with a smile, as the  films have done, Jordan, director of the 1986 film "Mona Lisa" and one of  Ireland's preeminent fiction writers, presents them as sources of great energy  and creativity. By relating to our environment more viscerally, Jordan  suggests, we can overcome the alienation that arises from stultifying routine.  </P> <P> The novel begins with portents of change and decay hanging in the air. A heat  wave envelopes the narrator's community and strange blooms begin to grow from  cracks in the pavements, easing their way along the shop fronts and covering  plate-glass windows with "thick, oily, unrecognizable leaves." The mysterious  "changes" begin to transform the narrator as well, who becomes acutely  sensitive to his neighborhood for the first time, noticing "the extraordinary  scent" of its gardens, "moist and heavy, like a thousand autumns, acres of hay  longing to be cut. . . . All the gardens seemed to sing at once, a symmetrical  hum of praise to (the) afternoon." As his sensitivity to the natural world  grows, however, his connection with human society becomes more tenuous; soon,  he loses hold of even language's tether, hearing only the underlying patterns  in cocktail party chatter, from the "soft, conch-like" voice of his wife,  "falling like a wave, as if to protect me," to the hum of a timid friend, like  "an insect beating its wings fiercely, to escape."  </P> <P> The narrator then undergoes a symbolic journey, brilliantly portrayed with  vivid, thoughtful imagery, which ultimately brings him closer to his wife and  daughter than he had been when the "changes" began. His odyssey might be called  a dream, but it is actually more reminiscent of a journey back to childlike  consciousness, where colors, textures and sounds surprise and evoke intense  feelings. The narrator's journey suggests that this state of consciousness can  be far more revelatory than adulthood, an abstract state of mind based on not  being surprised (and thus endangered) by the environment.  </P> <P> Ultimately, then, "The Dream of a Beast" is an eloquent testament to the value  of listening to the poetry of everyday life, something the narrator appreciates  one night as his daughter sleeps in a nearby room: "The house was silent now  but for a rustling of bedclothes somewhere and the tiny hum of Matilde's  breath. I stood on the landing, listening to the new quality of this silence.  Slowly it came to me that silence was not what for years I had supposed it to  be, the absence of sound. It was the absence, I knew now, of the foreground  sounds so the background sounds could be heard. These sounds were like breath  -- like the breath of this house, of the movement of the air inside it, of the  creatures who lived in it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> WIND Stories by Leigh Allison Wilson (William Morrow: $17.95)  </P> <P> Fortunately, the bleakness of so much contemporary American fiction isn't  entirely reflective of the national mood, for in periods of complacency such as  the 1950s and '80s, authors often gravitate toward malcontents, overlooking  those who gain some satisfaction simply from endeavoring to carry on. One  writer who hasn't forgotten these ordinary folk, however, is Leigh Wilson, who  portrays them with admiration in this quiet and sensitive collection.  </P> <P> At moments, underlying anxieties penetrate the calm reserve of Wilson's  characters and their emotions briefly spiral into panic: One woman, for  instance, looks out her window at castles of ice and reflects, "I thought maybe  I was dying." Wilson's characters are also, despite their natural  gregariousness, strangely unable to connect with others; the short story form  seems to make it difficult for Wilson to provide a context for their isolation.  </P> <P> By and large, however, Wilson's protagonists persevere as optimistically as  possible, having achieved a sense of equanimity despite their diminished  expectations. One particularly representative character, for instance, a UPS  truck driver by day and pool player by night, has accepted these "simple  facts": "Maps are flat; cities are not. Obstacles are everywhere, but the good  driver knows where they are and how to avoid them."  </P> <P> </P> <P> TALES OF NATURAL AND UNNATURAL CATASTROPHES by Patricia Highsmith (Atlantic  Monthly: $16.95)  </P> <P> The catastrophes actually are all "unnatural," prompted when Patricia  Highsmith's bizarre, blundering characters attempt to defy nature: the defense  tactics of a high-rise crumble against a crawling army that fumigation can't  kill; the Nuclear Regulatory Commission finds that its hiding place for nuclear  waste isn't so sporting after all; a Japanese whaling ship gets its due after a  day harpooning whales.  </P> <P> While best known as a writer of thrillers, Highsmith, a Texas-born author now  living in Switzerland, is primarily concerned with crafting stories to evoke  the human comedy. Her wry portrayals of human folly sometimes lack sympathy, as  in the tasteless piece "Rent-a-Womb," which trivializes the abortion debate.  But Highsmith condescends wittily and without favor, and so we soon cease to  take offense, enjoying stories we might otherwise have dismissed as prejudiced.  </P> <P> "Mabuti," for example, satirizes the dictator of a small African nation, who  frantically tries to prepare for the arrival of a United Nations delegation,  burning everything from garbage to corpses and trying to transform Government  House, a brothel with "a couple of rooms holding papers with which the country  gained its independence," into a "building like the Parthenon." Everything goes  awry, of course: The city is shrouded in smoke from the burning when the  delegation arrives and the Government house erupts in a conflagration when  Mabuti soldiers try to "properly" cremate people who had died in an elevator.  The U.N. members are less-than-pleased -- so Bomo has them shot.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FROM A DISTANT PLACE by Don Carpenter (North Point Press: $17.95)  </P> <P> A credible depiction of the dark side of a much-heralded American dreamland --  Marin County -- "From a Distant Place" focuses on Jackie Jeminovski, a  45-year-old former stewardess whose emotional stability and mental  self-assurance stem wholly from the perception of others that she "has  arrived." Jackie's image, projected by her trim figure and huge house, is just  that, for her house is both too expensive for her budget and too expansive for  herself (she is divorced and her children are living on their own).  </P> <P> Refreshingly, though, "From a Distant Place" doesn't moralize. An alcoholic,  Jackie avoids any real intimacy; one night, for example, she leaves a room  where she had been talking with two male friends and reemerges wearing only her  high heels. Beaming, she tells her friends "I love you." Instead of offering  portentous judgments about Jackie's blithe, superficial spirit, though,  Carpenter suggests that in some ways it helps her fill the "big empty space"  she feels "between housewife and grandmother" and encourages her to accept  others more readily than she accepts herself. She forgives her 20-year-old son  Derek, for example, when he comes home after being in jail for the first time:  "She did not want to pry the truth out of him. She didn't really care. She felt  too good, just having him back. None of it made any sense anyway. Just like the  rest of her life."  </P> <P> Derek is Carpenter's most intriguing character, as self-critical as his mother  is self-deluding. Once a boy of fragile self-esteem, he cultivates an inner  confidence in the course of these pages that allows him to take a low-status  job in a shoe-store and not "care when former classmates come into the store  and are patronizing. Let them. He would grin and look shy and sell them shoes."  As unconventionally as many of Carpenter's earlier characters, Derek comes of  age after participating in a robbery, emerging from it "if possible even more  confused than before. But at least he knew one thing by now, he could take his  cowardice in his hands sometimes and control it, get past it, and find himself  in a world where nothing mattered but what he wanted."  </P></p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (19): Prices are crucial - George Black examines the 'mobile' market's prospects THE mobile telephone market is one in which the stimulating effect of de-regulation looks almost incontrovertible. But it is less clear whether privatisation is essential for growth. Telephone operators and authorities across Europe are still puzzling over exactly what are the key factors that drive the business. In the UK, deregulation coupled with privatisation created competition and increased the market through price cuts. But in Germany, deregulation without privatisation has been enough to create growth; and in Italy the market has grown at over 30 per cent through price cuts, even in a monopoly situation. In the Scandinavian countries, where mobile phones became very popular earlier than in the rest of Europe, cultural factors may have been as important as political or technological ones. A small population spread across a large area and a high proportion of people with two homes were among possible reasons for the phenomenon. The introduction of new technology seems to have had little to do with market growth so far. UK dealers say that the price is the first question people ask, not whether the system will serve their needs. Mr Alan Harper, business strategy director for Mercury One-2-One, the third company to enter the UK market, said there was no real evidence that digital quality affected buyers much at the moment. Lower tariffs aimed at recruiting domestic subscribers have helped to increase the market in the past year in the UK, Italy and Germany. In the UK, it began with the launch of the Low Price service by Cellnet (British Telecom and Securicor) in November. In five months the market doubled its size to about 1m users, and its growth rate from 40,000 connections a month to 80,000. This helped Cellnet to gain ground on its rival Vodafone; Vodafone now has about 1m customers, Cellnet 800,000. The two companies have been signing up new subscribers in about equal numbers in recent months. Most market forecasts show between 8m and 10m UK users by the year 2000, although Vodafone expects only 5-6m. This is based on the assumptions of expansion mainly on the consumer side, falling entry-level cost and a wider range of consumer-targeted tariffs and services. Margins are beginning to narrow for all the contestants; they may narrow further with the entry next year of a fourth competitor, Microtel, from Hutchison Whampoa of Hong Kong. Mr Geoff Finch, director of corporate programmes and strategy for Cellnet, comments: 'It is difficult to see that there will be much profitability for four players with 8-10m users and with the current range of services.' However, he notes that the market had been outpacing expectations ever since 1983. THERE have also been recent signs that the level of use by subscribers is beginning to rise. But the key question - to which the telephone companies do not yet know the answer - is whether further price cuts will trigger a higher level of use. 'We need to know people's behaviour patterns more precisely,' says Mr Finch. 'We are spending many hours trying to analyse them.' The launch of the Mercury One-2-One digital service by Cable &amp; Wireless and US West during September was seen by the industry as a marketing success, especially the offer of free calls at off-peak times, to attract home users. Mr Harper says that One-2-One's high-street distribution channels had increased their forecasts as a result and there was a temporary shortage of handsets. The company had over 50,000 inquiries in the first month in response to its Pounds 10m advertising campaign. About 80 per cent of One-2-One's customers were first-time users and more than half of them were primarily domestic users. Early reports are divided on whether digital technology offers any improvement over analog. The One-2-One service is at present confined to the area within the M25 motorway around London. Some users say it only works well close to the M25, where the base stations are located. Others say they have had good service a number of miles beyond the M25. Technology enthusiasts insist that digital will prove itself superior and be better able to guarantee a good service. They predict that almost the whole market will go digital over the next 10 years. Digital will be helped by the progress of the GSM (Groupe Speciale Mobile) pan-European standard. This should prove especially attractive to business users, because through it they can be contacted from Italy to Norway. It will be even more useful when mobile phones start to be used for data transmission. In Germany, the creation of a duopoly has helped the market grow, even without the privatisation of Telekom, which is not expected until at least 1998. Last year the first competitor to Telekom, Mannesmann Mobilfunk, entered the market, using lower prices to catch up and overtake. In July Telekom set up a new private cellular company called DeTeMobil, which has offered cheaper rates and begun to retrieve Telekom's position. The German market is growing much faster than had been expected. There are at present between 600,000 and 800,000 subscribers and there could be 10m by the year 2,000. A third supplier, E-Plus, will enter the market in 1994. Italy now has 1m users, which puts it second to the UK in the European market. The monopoly of SIP, the public phone operator, has not prevented the market from growing fast. During October the Italian government was expected to announce plans for allowing a second supplier into the market. Arguably, SIP's new lower off-peak rates targeted at the consumer market have been induced by the prospect of competition, for which the EC has been pushing. The entry of a competitor is expected to bring more price cuts and keep the market growing.</p>

			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> IF THE DINOSAURS HAD SURVIVED . . .  </P> <P> The New Dinosaurs: An Alternative Evolution by Dougal Dixon (Salem House:  $19.95; 120 pages; illustrated)  </P> <P> Recent years have seen much discussion in scholarly and popular circles about  what happened to the dinosaurs. After ruling the Earth for 150 million years,  those spectacular reptiles suddenly became extinct 65 million years ago.  Current speculation centers on some cataclysmic event, such as the Earth being  hit by a comet, to explain their disappearance.  </P> <P> Dougal Dixon, a British paleontologist and science writer, wonders about a  different question altogether. What if the comet had missed? he muses. What if  the dinosaurs had not become extinct but had continued to flourish, evolve and  dominate the planet? What would today's dinosaurs be like?  </P> <P> The result of this speculation is an engaging, thoroughly enjoyable,  almost-believable book, "The New Dinosaurs," which strictly applies the  principles of evolution to the creation of an imaginary zoo. Starting with the  idea that climate and environment are the deciding factors in how living things  evolve, Dixon charts the changes on the Earth's surface since the dinosaurs  died out and then invents critters to fill all environmental niches.  </P> <P> It is a wonderful idea wonderfully carried out, and the pictures of these  would-have-been creatures are as good as the text.  </P> <P> Here we meet the balaclav (whose name is almost an anagram of a Greek pastry),  a ferocious-looking beast that inhabits mountain snowfields and ekes out a  living on alpine plants. To protect itself from the cold, the balaclav contains  layers of fat and is covered by hair.  </P> <P> The megalosaur, on the other hand, lives in tropical rain forests and offshore  islands. "Its sharp teeth and the powerful claws on the forelimbs are used for  holding prey and tearing it up," Dixon writes. "The actual killing is done with  great talons on the hind feet. As it walks the heavy head is held out at the  front, balanced by the long heavy tail behind."  </P> <P> The dingum, meanwhile, is a meat-eating desert creature with a remarkable  anatomical trait. When a predator appears, "A fin of skin supported by struts  of bone springs up from its curved back and presents a gaudily colored sail to  the attacker, a sudden burst of garish color against the drab grasses. The  crest on the back of the head pops up a frill of spines, each one poisonous  enough to kill a large attacker."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Beast of the Steppes  </P> <P> And don't overlook the taranter, a grass-eating beast of the steppes whose back  is covered with horny bone plates. This armor originally evolved for defense,  but in the taranter, it serves the more important purpose of helping the animal  conserve moisture.  </P> <P> One of Dixon's assumptions is that because the dinosaurs didn't die out, there  was no evolution of mammals from the small, rat-like creatures they were during  the Age of the Reptiles.  </P> <P> All science-fiction movies to the contrary, cavemen did not exist at the time  of the dinosaurs. They came much, much later, after the dinosaurs had  relinquished the planet. In Dixon's imagined evolution, neither cavemen nor  anything close to them ever got started. The highest mammal in Dixon's world is  a zwim, which is about a foot long, looks like a cross between a shrew and a  beaver, lives in streams and rivers and dines on insects. There are no primates  in Dixon's hypothetical world, and certainly no humans.  </P> <P> Nor is there any sign of intelligence, at least in our understanding of that  term. The animals that Dixon envisions all live by instinct and evolutionary  design. Might intelligence not have evolved in creatures other than humans?  Just a thought.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Alternative Zoology'  </P> <P> "The New Dinosaurs" is Dixon's second book of "alternative zoology." The first  was "After Man," which imagined how evolution was going to proceed in the  future. "The New Dinosaurs" wonders how evolution would have occurred up to now  with one large change along the way.  </P> <P> What makes the books so compelling is that they are not mere flights of fancy  cooked up in a dream. Starting with what is known about the dinosaurs that did  exist and hewing to the rules of evolution, Dixon comes up with plausible  creatures that might actually be roaming around today in place of you and me.  It's a pleasant and provocative way to learn about dinosaurs and about  evolution.  </P> <P> Fortunately for us, the comet (or whatever it was) didn't miss, the great  reptiles did die out, the mammals did evolve, and here we are thinking about  all these things. But it could have been otherwise.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We move on to the High Council of the  Republic-Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT]. Each day that passes  curiously resembles the one before it. We all know that faced  with the wall of misunderstanding erected before him by the two  political forces on the scene -- each of which stuck steadfastly  to its guns regarding the appointment of the interim prime  minister -- Monsignor Monsengwo-Pasinya, HCR-PT speaker,  submitted for consideration by yesterday's plenary session a  proposal based on the appointment of a head of government by a  political group other than that of the president of the  Republic. This head of government will set up a truly national  unity team that will have to inspire the confidence of the  HCR-PT before it is formally enacted into office by an executive  instrument. Today's plenary session therefore centered on this  proposal by the HCR-PT speaker but there too, [Oscar] Kambamba  Kasongo, it was, unfortunately, a fiasco. Good evening, Oscar.    [Kasongo] Good evening. You are perfectly right. It was yet  another fruitless plenary session today at the HCR-PT, where the  two forces in the arena -- two forces, surely, because there is  bipolarity -- were unable to agree.    The main thrust of this disagreement which has lasted the  past four days may be summed up by two notions, namely, the  source of legitimacy of power and the method of appointing the  interim prime minister.    For the Sacred Union -- i.e., the Sacred Union of the  Radical  Opposition and Allies [USORAS] -- there is no alternative forum  to the Sovereign National Conference [CNS] because everyone took  part in that conference and participated in electing Prime  Minister Tshisekedi, and also because the two parties present  contributed to the drafting of the deed setting forth the  constitutional arrangements for the transition period.    The Political Forces of the Conclave [FPC] find their  legitimacy in the new forum offered by the HCR-PT, the only  institution that should appoint the prime minister and to which  the latter and his team will be fully answerable. The head of  government must therefore be elected by that institution because  the office of prime minister is vacant at the moment. He must  also be elected from among several aspirants. In short,  therefore, these are the stakes on the floor at the People's  Palace.    This evening, Counselor Kamanda wa Kamanda, on behalf of  USORAS, rejected the proposal put forward yesterday by the  [HCR-PT] executive organ and categorically ruled out that put  forward this very evening by Counselor Mutomoba Kafansenda on  behalf of his political group. This new FPC proposal may be  summed up as follows: The prime minister should be elected by  the HCR-PT by a simple majority vote from among candidates put  up by political camps other than that of the head of state. You  perfectly understand the issue: The proposal was rejected  because it contains the notion of election by the HCR-PT,  instead of by consensus.    The Rally of Forces for Democratic Change, commonly known as  the Allies, also attempted to end the deadlock by making a  proposal, which was equally turned down because it contains the  idea of election by the HCR-PT.    In short, two points in the various formulas proposed  receive  the approval of the two political groups. These are: The prime  minister is the head of government. That is accepted by  everyone. Also, he must be installed in office by the head of  state. That point is also accepted. So the disagreement  centers mainly on whether the election of the prime minister  should be done by the CNS or even by the HCR-PT. Opinions here  depend on whether one belongs to the USORAS or to the FPC. This  is where the four-day old deadlock -- for that is what it is --  really lies.    The executives, with the assistance of the parliamentary  group, has undertaken to handle the dispute which will be  examined on 16 March from 1000 local time. It may be recalled  that what we refer to here as parliamentary group is simply a  group that will comprise the various representatives of the  forces on the scene.</p>

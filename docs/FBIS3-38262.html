The election date is set for Sunday,  March 27, but since that falls on the Jewish Passover Holiday,  the government on January 19th pushed through a decree that  would extend the voting into the following day, Monday, March 28.    The People's [Popular] Party, taking advantage of the fact  that the decree must now be debated in the House and Senate, is  seeking by way of these amendments to re-introduce a second  round of balloting in the general elections. Thus, the party's  deputy caucus leader in the Senate, Francesco Mazzola, submitted  the amendments Tuesday even as the Senate constitutional affairs  committee got down to a study of the government decree this  afternoon. The decree goes before the full Senate tomorrow.    With regard to elections to the House, the proposed changes  to the electoral rules as they now stand would call for a runoff  ballot to be held on the second Sunday after the election, for  candidates who did not receive 50 percent plus one of the votes  in those constituencies where 75 percent of the total seats are  assigned according to the first-past-the-post system. All those  candidates may take part in the runoff who received at least 10  percent of the votes cast and whoever obtains the greatest  number of votes in this second round would be declared the  winner.    With regard to elections to the Senate, the relevant  amendment calls for a runoff ballot the second Sunday following  the first ballot for all those candidates where the uninominal  system holds who did not garner 50 percent plus one of the votes  cast.    Antonio Maccanico, undersecretary at the premier's office  said that the admissibility of the amendments submitted by the  People's [Popular] Party within the context of discussion on the  decree to extend the general election to March 28th must be  decided upon by the speakers of the two houses. It is not up to  the government to express an opinion on this matter, Maccanico  stated.    It will be the panel on Senate rules that will decide  tomorrow morning if the two amendments presented by Mazzola are  admissable or not. The Senate Constitutional Affairs committee,  meanwhile, ruled constitutional the decree extending the general  election date by one day to enable Jews to vote without running  into a conflict with their religious practices.    Coming out strongly against the amendment bid to change the  election rules were the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), the  Northern League and [Republican leader] Marco Pannella, who  wondered if Mazzola wanted the initiative to be seen as a last  blip from the Christian Democrats or the first peep out of the  new People's [Popular] Party.    PDS caucus leader in the senate, Giuseppe Chiarante, said  that while his party had always been in favor of two rounds of  balloting, it was too late now to change the rules of the game.</p>

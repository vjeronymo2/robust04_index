			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Hungary for capital: Budapest's search for western aid The frailty of central European banks has come to light most rapidly in Hungary. The country was the first in the region, in late 1991, to enact a comprehensive package of western-style legislation on bankruptcy, accounting and commercial banking. These laws have introduced greater transparency, in turn revealing accumulated losses at companies and exposing the capital weakness of the banking system. A joint World Bank and International Monetary Fund study of the banking system earlier this year revealed the extent of the problem. It showed that most of the country's banks, including the two largest commercial banks, Magyar Hitel Bank and Kereskedelmi Bank, were 'technically insolvent according to internationally accepted accounting standards'. The report concluded that 'the financial system is unable to finance the transformation to a market economy'. The findings have spurred the authorities and international institutions into action. A World Bank delegation arrived in Budapest last week to pave the way for a loan for financial restructuring; Hungarian officials say the loan could total Dollars 200m-Dollars 300m. One important condition for World Bank assistance should be met today when the International Monetary Fund is expected to approve Hungary's macroeconomic programme, designed to reduce the budget deficit. World Bank financing will in turn allow the authorities to inject new capital into the banks by the year-end. The World Bank has recommended an injection of Ft100bn to bring capital ratios to an initial target of 4 per cent of risk-weighted assets, a big step towards the 8 per cent goal laid down by the Bank for International Settlements. But the Ft100bn may not be enough. Hungarian banks have this month been submitting up-to-date estimates for their bad loan portfolios. While no official figures on the extent of the problem are forthcoming, initial signs are that the defaults and recapitalisation costs could be higher than first thought.  This week, criminal investigations by the chief prosecutor's office have also disclosed that fraud, bribery and other financial crimes have cost banks Ft16bn-Ft18bn. Hungarian government officials alarmed by the cost of the bail-out, are anxious to ensure that loan losses never again spiral out of control. 'We must not convey the message that whenever you run into difficulties someone will bail you out,' says Mr Peter Bod, chairman of the National Bank of Hungary, the central bank. The authorities are therefore improving bank monitoring. The central bank has set up its own banking supervision department. And the State Property Handling Company (AV RT), the holding company which exercises the state's controlling stakes in the largest banks, is also tightening controls. 'We have drawn up a list of 10-15 indicators to monitor the banks' performance,' says Mr Szabolcs Szekeres, AV RT chairman. But monitoring by the authorities, at least in an economy which is rapidly being liberalised, cannot substitute for better management. The greatest effort is required at Magyar Hitel Bank, banker to Hungary's largest and most troubled enterprises and in need of the largest recapitalisation. The shake-up at Magyar Hitel Bank began in April last year when it appointed Mr Istvan Torocskei, a former foreign exchange dealer at the central bank, as its third new chairman in three years. Mr Torocskei's first act was to order an audit of the loan portfolio. Magyar Hitel Bank found that its non-performing loans had tripled from Ft25bn in December 1991 to a peak of Ft78bn last year. Mr Gyorgy Szepesi, deputy chief executive responsible for the investigations, says: 'The amounts, the level of risk, the consequences of expansive credit policy up to 1991, all gave us a shocking surprise.' Now that the bank has a clearer idea of the problem, it has moved on to the remedial phase. This summer the board authorised senior management to set up a special corporate finance unit. To manage the unit Mr Torocskei has brought in Mr Robin Winchester, an experienced international banker who built up Citibank Budapest into one of the most profitable foreign banks in central Europe. This 'bank within a bank', on the fifth floor of Magyar Hitel Bank's headquarters in Budapest's banking hub, has taken over responsibility for Hitel's 80 largest debtors and their outstanding loans of more than Ft100bn (Dollars 1.05bn). Hungary's banking reforms depend as much as anything on the success of this 'bank within a bank'.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HUNGARY'S BANKS: A CAUSE FOR CONCERN (Ft)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Risk     Capital     Capital           Cost to                     wieghted    adequacy    adequacy      recapitalise                       assets                                4% capital                                                         adequacy ratio  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Magyar Hitel Bank    240.8bn       -19bn        -7.9            28.6bn Budapest Bank         93.7bn         2bn         2.2             1.7bn Magyar Kulkereskedelmi   Bank                75.1bn      12.1bn        16.1             0.0 Kereskedelmi Bank    161.7bn     -13.7bn        -8.5            20.2bn Orszagos Takarek   Penztar            413.1bn      -1.8bn        -0.4            18.3bn Other banks          263.6bn       -20bn        -7.6            30.5bn Total                1,248bn     -40.3bn        -3.2            99.3bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Credit Suisse First Boston and World Bank-IMF projections for 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Gold Gold bugs, it seems, are running out of places to crawl. Already frustrated by the metal's soggy showing in the Gulf War - and the narrow trading range which has prevailed ever since - they suffered the further indignity this week of seeing the price dip below last year's important trading point of Dollars 342 per troy ounce. Sizeable distress sales, rumoured to be the work of an eastern European central bank, did most of the damage. Transatlantic speculators seizing on the trend merely added to investors' woe. The days of expecting the gold price to react sharply to macro-economic shifts now seem but a distant memory. Disillusionment set in long ago with falling inflation and high real interest rates, whereas investors now have a much wider range of hedging instruments if by some chance an oil crisis of mid or late 1970s proportions were to be repeated. Gold has thus become a rather dull commodity, oscillating between small changes in the supply/demand equation but always vulnerable to the unexpected behaviour of big stockholders. The fundamentals point to a marginally tighter market in 1992 and 1993, but it would not do to get carried away. The lasting appeal of gold, though, is its great anonymity, a characteristic generally not shared by other financial assets. If the market somehow lost this element of secrecy, it really might be finished.</p>

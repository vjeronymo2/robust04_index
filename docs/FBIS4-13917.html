			<p>BFN     [Text] Lebanese investigators are still questioning Samir  Ja'ja', commander of the banned Lebanese Forces militia, about a  church bombing and the murder of his Christian rival Dani  Sham'un. Ja'ja''s supporters continue to demonstrate on his  behalf, prompting the Lebanese Army to deploy more troops in  east Beirut.    Army personnel detained Ja'ja' last night and took him to  the  Defense Ministry for questioning. Ja'ja' denied any involvement  of the banned Lebanese Forces in the church bombing or Sham'un's  killing.    According to Lebanese Defense Ministry sources, Ja'ja' is  being held in one of the Ministry's offices. He was questioned  today and is expected to remain in custody until 25 April at  least. About 300 supporters of Ja'ja' demonstrated today.  Others congregated in churches to express their loyalty to the  41-year old militia commander.    Other members of the security apparatus of the banned  Lebanese Forces have also been rounded up. One of them, Fawzi  al-Rasi, died today of a heart attack while in custody.</p>

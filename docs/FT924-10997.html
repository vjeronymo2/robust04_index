			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Orkney social workers criticised SOCIAL workers who removed nine children from their Orkney homes in dawn raids during investigations into alleged sex abuse acted too soon and without taking time to think, a judicial inquiry has found. Lord Clyde, who headed the inquiry, said the social workers failed to consider any other action and they and police should have made further inquiries. He made 194 recommendations, including a call for new national guidelines for dealing with child abuse. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said he was 'minded to accept the great majority' of the recommendations. The children's parents said they would bring a civil action for 'substantial damages' for the trauma families suffered. Orkney council chiefs said they were 'shocked and taken aback' by the criticism. An emergency council meeting will be held on Friday and a team set up to decide what action to take.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (14): A bitter cherry - Case history / Caola of Hungary WHEN western executives go cherry picking in eastern Europe, they look for state companies like Hungary's Caola cosmetics producer. However, these east European consumer goods companies, such juicy targets because of their market share, are also the most perishable, for the same reason. For their market shares are generally as perishable as they are large. Trade liberalisation has brought floods of western consumer goods imports into eastern markets, and many local companies have found their markets disappear as consumers defect to the new competitors. Without customers, such a company's worth to a potential foreign or domestic buyer can disappear just as fast. That gives eastern Europe's privatisers - never in a very strong position - an extra handicap. The authorities and the investment banks acting on their behalf can find themselves with all the bargaining power of a stall owner trying to get rid of a load of rotting fruit. Cherries indeed. Caola illustrates the point. Once the Hungarian monopoly supplier of personal care products such as toothpaste and a dominant producer of household chemicals, Caola still held about 80 per cent of the market in 1990. The company appeared to be the key to a market of 10m people whose demand for cosmetics had been suppressed during decades of communist emphasis on productive industry. Caola was a desirable property for the western multinationals which began to sniff around in 1990. Then disaster struck. At the start of 1991, Hungary liberalised imports on most consumer goods and Caola was floored by western competition. Caola's share of the cosmetics and household chemicals market, has fallen to about 40 per cent from near-monopoly two years ago. Turnover has fallen in parallel, the 1992 forecast of Ft4.3bn represents a 50 per cent fall since 1990. Caola's technical and research expertise impresses western competitors. But the company, which as a state monopoly had no need to compete in a market, started with a handicap when it comes to marketing, advertising or packaging. While Procter &amp; Gamble, Colgate Palmolive and Unilever are among Hungary's top 10 advertisers, Caola spends so little that its toothpaste adverts do not even register on surveys of media profiles. Nor do Caola brands inherit such strength that they can afford such neglect. Most are better described as names than brands. Not much attachment can be felt to a brand of washing-machine powder called Bip after the initials of the factory. Older Hungarians may remain loyal but Caola is losing a whole new generation. Colgate meanwhile is catching toothpaste users young with Colgate bunnies on children's television and educational programmes in schools. Mr Tihamer Gedeon, Caola's managing director, recognises that the only hope is to come under the protective wing of a western company with the financial, technological and managerial capabilities to revamp the Hungarian company's tired products. The cruel twist is that just as Caola's growing weakness makes privatisation imperative, so it also makes a sale more difficult. Indeed, the Hungarian company may have missed its best chance. Colgate-Palmolive bid for Caola last year but then pulled out, saying that the company's market share was vanishing. The State Property Agency reportedly held out for Dollars 50m, close to the asset valuation of Caola, while Colgate was prepared to pay about Dollars 35m, much of that in investment commitments, a figure closer to the estimated market valuation. This tension is a classic one in eastern Europe. Market value is necessarily nebulous because there has been no capital market. Moreover local officials are still often stuck in a mindset inherited from the communist past, when physical assets and production were deemed to have value independently of what anyone was prepared to pay. It is difficult enough for buyer and seller to hit on a mutually acceptable price. When perishable consumer goods companies are concerned, they face the added difficulty that they are trying to hit a target which is moving around with the falling value of the company. Government officials say they responded flexibly to Colgate's position. But they do not seem to have responded so flexibly to Caola's falling worth. Officials at the State Property Agency even played down the failure to agree with Colgate saying that they could get a better price by waiting. Caola is looking for a buyer, drawing up an offer for sale and hoping for completion by late summer. But industry executives, far from thinking that Caola is worth more, doubt even that the SPA can attract any bids for the whole of Caola's business. The western multinationals have certainly not hung around. They have been busy further eroding Caola's market share, poaching its best executives and withdrawing from joint licence agreements. Beiersdorf, the German manufacturer has taken back distribution of Nivea and other products which had been licensed by Caola. Ominously, Caola most dynamic executives are voting with their feet. Mr Tamas Suto, Caola's go-ahead marketing head, now works Colgate-Palmolive. Western multinationals have built up local sales and distribution organisations to the extent that they do not really need Caola. Ironically, Colgate is considering producing locally to save on import tariffs. The US company may contract out manufacturing to Caola.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Broader issue on top pay Sir, As you say in your leader, 'Lining the executive nest' (February 14), it is clear that shareholder power is no real check on excessive executive remuneration. A more credible system of assessment is needed. One system would be to include representatives of employees on the assessment panel, for example through a German-style system of supervisory boards. The pros and cons of a two-tier board system do, of course, raise very wide issues, but this episode does remind us that a fresh debate on the respective roles of the different stakeholders in the governance of the company is long overdue.

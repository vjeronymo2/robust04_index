			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Letter: Contracting out - the legal cases favouring employers, and an alternative solution Sir, John Willman and David Goodhart state in 'Contracting out policies face further trouble' (February 3): 'The leading employment QC, Mr Patrick Elias, has advised the local authorities' association that the EC directive is likely to apply in most cases where a service is contracted out'. They then say that an amendment to the regulations now passing through parliament will make this absolutely clear. It would be vulgar to play the game of 'our QC is more leading that yours', but certainly a very leading QC has advised the contract cleaning industry quite differently - resulting in something like 40 legal cases brought by the trade unions arguing for the interpretation of 'Transfer of Undertakings' having been defeated in favour of the employers. And the address of the attorney general to the parliamentary committee made it clear that contracting out services will be legally taken on their merits.

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / The Lex Column: UK savings It is hardly surprising that investment institutions are wary of the government's planned review of savings and investment in the economy. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, has identified high dividend payouts as one of the weaknesses of the UK economy. Any move to restrict dividends would hit unit trust companies, which have been focusing marketing efforts on the attractions of yield. More importantly, pension funds valued by actuaries on the basis of expected dividend income could suffer. If companies were obliged to increase their pension fund contributions as a result, though, the government's tax take could fall. Such arguments may prevent any head-on attack on dividends. The wider threat to investment institutions may lie in the promised review of tax-breaks available to savers on investment products. It seems an anomaly that certain forms of saving enjoy tax advantages - such as pensions, personal equity plans and TESSAs - while others do not. Extending tax-exempt status to bank and building society deposits, for example, would help create a level playing field at little cost to the Exchequer. If such a move encouraged investment in deposits, life insurance and unit trust companies would face tougher competition for funds. Of course tax is only one part of savings decisions. The removal of life assurance premium relief in 1984 did nothing to slow sales of endowment policies through the second half of the decade. But with regulators already getting tough on compliance and disclosure, tax reforms which increased competition in retail savings would be an unwelcome headache for the sector.</p>

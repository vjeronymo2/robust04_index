			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Eduardo Damaso and Fernando Semedo] </F>   [Text] In Spain, the Customs Surveillance Service (SVA)  which, during the 1980's, was converted into a major force for  repressing the international drug traffic, has at its disposal  78 ships, six airplanes, five helicopters, and 350 vehicles on  the ground supporting its operations. As if that were not  enough, 17 of the aircraft have the capacity for intervention on  the open sea, allowing their crews to board suspicious vessels.  It is a powerful armada.    In Portugal, there is no clear perception of whether the  surveillance on the coast for this purpose is assigned to the  force that resulted from the abolishment of the Customs Guard,  or to the Navy, although it is the former that controls the  sophisticated system for detecting suspicious vessels that has  been set up along the coast. At least the results of this type  of surveillance have never been observed.    However, since the early 1980's, Portugal has been one of  the  main entryways for traffickers into Europe. The Portuguese  Criminal Investigations Police inspector, Dias Costa, a  specialist in the investigation of the international traffic,  prepared a study on Portugal's transformation into a major area  for the entry of South American cocaine and Moroccan hashish  into Europe.    Factors of a political and economic nature, particularly the  Spanish authorities' protectionism for the public tobacco  enterprise, prompted the Galician contraband and drug  trafficking groups to concentrate their drug unloading  activities in Viano do Castelo and in the Algarve, particularly  in Lagos, Portimao, and Sagres.    Dias Costa remarks: "Although the Spanish traffickers harbor  a special preference for the Algarve in their activities, since  it is a region protected from winds, even those in summer, and  is located closer to Morocco, they have begun spreading their  influence more toward the north. Some still remained in the  Palmela area until 1986."    According to Dias Costa, the advancement to the Alentejo  coast and the Setubal peninsula may have been due to the  "considerable support that was found, enabling them to carry out  the unloading without any problems." The fact is that, after the  arrest of the drug trafficker, Laureano Oubina, and of the  Charlins brothers, in Troia, the Galician traffickers' methods  changed. This occurred because they concluded that they could  avoid risks and expense by transporting drugs to the Portuguese  coast, since they have at their disposal here "a multitude of  fishermen with financial and logistical problems of all kinds."    Dias Costa recalls that: "At that time, there were fishermen  who were selling essential parts of the equipment on their  boats, even anchors, so as to be able to meet the most  fundamental needs of their families."    As a result, a situation difficult to control was created.  "Let's not deceive ourselves. The unloading of hashish and  cocaine on our seacoast is occurring at such a rate that no one  could, in all honesty, tell how many hundreds of tons of either  drug passed through here last year."</p>

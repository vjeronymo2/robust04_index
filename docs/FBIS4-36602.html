			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, 9 Jun (INA)--Yemeni press sources have  reported that the legitimate Yemeni forces have recently been  able to impose their full control over the military positions of  the forces of rebellion and secession in the city of Aden.    Military reports published today by the newspaper ITHNAN WA  'ISHRUN MAYU, issued by the Yemeni General People's Congress  [GPC], said that the Yemeni Armed Forces are currently stationed  in the areas of al-Mansurah, al-Haswah, al-Mina', Madinat  al-Sha'b, and al-Burayqah areas inside the city of Aden after  they imposed their full control on the Salah al-Din garrison,  and the al-Jala' and Saba' brigades in the city.    The military reports said that the Yemeni forces were able  to  tighten their control on all the military positions established  by the rebels inside the city, and to clear these areas of  military resistance.    The paper said that the legitimate forces have imposed their  full control on the Aden Airport in the Khormaskar area, which  is being besieged by the legitimate forces.    The paper added that a number of military commanders, who  were misled by the secessionists, were captured by the  legitimate forces, including the commander of the secessionists'  3d Armored Brigade, who is called al-Baqri and who had earlier  fled 'Imran area, north of Sanaa, at the beginning of the war.    The reports said that several secessionist military  personnel  fled into the quarters of the city of Aden and began to use  civilians as human shields to protect themselves.    In another development, military reports revealed that the  legitimate forces are in control of important areas and  directorates in the Hadhramaut Governorate, east Yemen. These  reports added that the legitimate forces imposed their control  on the areas of Yafi', east of the city of al-Mukalla, the  stronghold of 'Ali Salim al-Bid. These forces have also captured  the areas of al-'Abr, Bi'r 'Ali, and Brum, approximately 30 km  west of al-Mukalla.    The legitimate forces also advanced into vast areas in the  Hadhramaut Governorate, which the secessionists have planted  with mine fields in an attempt to obstruct the legitimate  forces' advance toward the city of al-Mukalla, which is now  besieged from all directions by the legitimate forces.    The military sources said that the legitimate Yemeni forces  are now in control of the Hadhramaut Governorate, with the  exception of three positions taken by the secessionists as  strongholds. These areas are al-Mukalla, Sihut, and al-Riyan  Airport.</p>

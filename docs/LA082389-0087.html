Meyer's  fiancee was spending the night with the pitcher's parents and they went to  their room. Meyer and Waitkus went to their room, on a different floor.  </P> <P> "We got in early, because (Manager) Eddie Sawyer had a curfew and we knew there  would be a bed check," Meyer said.  </P> <P> "When we got to our room, there must have been six or seven messages for Eddie  to call Ruth Ann in another room at the hotel. That was the name of his  girlfriend back in Massachusetts, and although she wasn't in town, she was the  kind of gal who was capable of flying in without telling anybody."  </P> <P> Meyer said that Waitkus, instead of calling his girlfriend, told him that he  was going directly to her room. From that point, Meyer was told the rest of the  story by Waitkus.  </P> <P> "Eddie said that when he got to the room, a girl he didn't know answered the  door," Meyer said. "He said that he had the wrong room, but the girl said that  she was Ruth Ann's friend. She asked Eddie to come in and wait until Ruth Ann  came back.  </P> <P> "Eddie sat down on a chair opposite a closet. The girl reached into the closet,  pulled out a .22-caliber rifle and let him have it."  </P> <P> The assailant's name was Ruth Ann Steinhagen, a Chicago typist who was  infatuated with Waitkus.  </P> <P> According to Waitkus, right after he was shot, Steinhagen said: "If I can't  have you, neither will anybody else."  </P> <P> Steinhagen's room in Chicago was found to be papered with Waitkus' pictures and  newspaper accounts of his accomplishments.  </P> <P> Meyer said: "Right after she shot Eddie, she called downstairs and said, 'This  is Ruth Ann Steinhagen in room 904 and I've just shot Eddie Waitkus.' If she  doesn't do that, Eddie bleeds to death."  </P> <P> Moments later, Meyer got a call in his room from the Phillies' traveling  secretary and hurried to room 904.  </P> <P> "I remember them hauling Eddie out, to the ambulance," Meyer said. "The only  thing he kept saying was, 'Why? Why? Why?"  </P> <P> Waitkus, who died in 1972, attempted a comeback, but Meyer said he was never  the ballplayer he had been before the shooting.  </P> <P> Meyer had a 94-73 big league record. He was 17-8 for the Phillies in 1949, was  9-11 in their pennant-winning season the next year and played on two  championship teams for the Brooklyn Dodgers.  </P> <P> Meyer has worked as a pitching coach in the New York Yankees' organization  since 1981.  </P> <P> "He's a special man," said Royal Clayton, a pitcher for the Albany Yankees.  </P> <P> "He's not trying to move along to the majors, to make some news and promote  himself. He's just trying to help me. He's been where we're trying to go and  he'll advise you on anything as a pitcher or a person."  </P> <P> Meyer also is a loyal friend. Waitkus was a handsome man who some believe was a  womanizer.  </P> <P> "I don't care what anybody says," Meyer said. "Eddie didn't meet Ruth Ann  Steinhagen until the night she shot him."  </P></p>

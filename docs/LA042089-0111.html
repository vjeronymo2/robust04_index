			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> PAN AM RE-BOOKINGS TOLD  </P> <P> U.S. diplomats apparently heeded an official warning and canceled seats on Pan  Am flights in the weeks before the bombing of Flight 103 last Dec. 21,  according to airline documents quoted in a congressional memorandum. The House  Government Operations transportation subcommittee staff memo, obtained by the  Associated Press, says Pan Am documents indicate that Christmas holiday traffic  for U.S. Embassy personnel had been heavily re-booked before the bombing over  Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people. Relatives of those who died in  the bombing have been angry that a U.S. warning of a possible bombing of a Pan  Am flight from Frankfurt, West Germany to the United States was not made  available to the public.  </P></p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / International Company News: Barclays Canada chief replaced Barclays Bank has quietly replaced the head of its Toronto-based subsidiary as the prelude to an expected shake-up of its commercial and investment banking operations in Canada. Mr Geoffrey Farrar, long-serving president of Barclays Bank Canada, has taken early retirement at the age of 58. He has been replaced by Mr Graeme Hansen, formerly chief executive of Barclays' operations in Australia and New Zealand. Barclays is also in the throes of buying the 50 per cent stake it does not already own of Toronto-based securities dealer, Deacon Barclays de Zoete Wedd. The deal is due to close at the end of May, when the present chairman, Mr Cam Deacon, will leave the firm. Mr Hansen, who arrived in Toronto two weeks ago, said he was not ready yet to make recommendations to the board on the future direction of Barclays Canada. But he acknowledged that 'there's always change with a new chief executive.' Barclays Canada has assets of just over CDollars 3bn (Pounds 1.46bn), making it the fourth biggest foreign-owned bank after Hongkong &amp; Shanghai, Citibank and Credit Suisse. It has been hit in recent years by losses on real estate and resource-industry loans. Outsiders expect that the bank will in future concentrate on big corporate customers and lower its profile in the mid-sized commercial mar-ket. Deacon BZW, whose name will be changed to reflect the UK bank's 100 per cent ownership, is likely to be more closely integrated into BZW's international securities trading and global research.</p>

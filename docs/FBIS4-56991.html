			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Guillen] </F>   [Text] Deputy Julio Montoya has reported that the  Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services dismantled  Operation Rainbow in which drug traffickers were trying to  export 300 tons of cocaine overseas. "I have come to discuss  and announce the discovery of a major drug-trafficking network  whose primary hubs were the ports of Maracaibo, Puerto Cabello,  and Punto Fijo," Montoya said. Operation Rainbow used  hollowed-out coconuts in which the drug, presumably cocaine,  would be hidden.    [Guillen] How many kilograms would be exported that way?    [Montoya] Three-hundred tons of the drug.</p>

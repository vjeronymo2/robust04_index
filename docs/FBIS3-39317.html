			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor, in </F> Moscow]    [Text] The Prime Minister will today take the lead in  helping to give Russia a say in the world's largest and most  influential club -- the exclusive G7 group of the world's  wealthy industrial nations.    He will promise President Boris Yeltsin that he will back to  the hilt Russia's determination to enter the political, although  not the economic, dimension of the group.    But this move, spearheaded by Britain, could if successful  end centuries of distrust and suspicion that the West to this  day still feels about Russia.    And it could mean the end of the East-West divide which  still  cuts Russia off from capitalist Europe.    John Major flew into Moscow late last night for crucial  talks  with Mr Yeltsin in the Kremlin.    Both agree that Russia's rocky economy makes it impossible  for her to become a fully fledged member of G7 -- for a while  anyway.    But Mr Major feels -- and he will probably find that a  majority of his G7 colleagues think likewise -- that Russia  should now be allowed to get a foot in the door.    British officials had denounced as "cynical" suggestions  that  it is merely a sop to buy off Russia to ensure her support for  Nato's threatened air strikes against Bosnian Serbs.    Russia's centuries of affinity with the Serbs makes her  reluctant to support any "muscular" action against them.    But Mr Major hopes today to persuade the Russian leader that  air strikes, if the Serbs refuse to remove their heavy artillery  from the outskirts of Sarajevo, could be one way of ending the  bloody civil war.    Russian will almost certainly come "onside" although with  reservations. In any event they have no veto so the air strikes  could go ahead even with opposition from the Kremlin.    Mr Major and Mr Yeltsin are on extremely cordial terms. This  has a lot to do with the fact that it was Mr Major who was the  first of all the world's leaders to back Yeltsin during the  aborted coup in 1991 and again during the attempted and failed  insurrection last autumn.    Mr Major will seek from Mr Yeltsin information on the  progress of Russia's massive programme of economic reform and  the gradual introduction of privatisation throughout industry.    Meanwhile, Mr Major has made plain that he does not want to  be questioned by reporters about back-to-basics and kiss and  cuddle MPs during his joint news conference with President  Yeltsin later today.    Mr Major is insistent that the objectives of his visit to  Russia should not be overwhelmed by problems on the domestic  front.    If these questions do arise at the news conference,  indication is that the Prime Minister will decline to answer  them, saying that he will only take questions relating to his  visit.    Mr Major flew into freezing Moscow last night wearing a  typically Russian-looking furry hat. But it was disclosed that  he bought it at a hatters in the West End of London.    Mrs Major, who is accompanying him, also wore a furry hat  and  a striking brown and red coat. She was presented with a bouquet  of flowers when she arrived last night.    During today she will attend some of the functions with the  Prime Minister but her programme will also include a visit to a  children's hospital, particularly a burns unit in it, and to the  Bolshoi ballet school.    Tonight she will attend with him a "grand dinner" in their  honour at the Kremlin. Mr Major will make a brief speech before  the meal highlighting President Yeltsin's success in  transforming Russia's economy and his personal courage in  dealing with violent attempts to depose him and his government.</p>

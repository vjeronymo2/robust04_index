			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Exemptions and inheritance tax I believe the Pounds 55,000 exemption rule for inheritance tax applies only to non-domiciled spouse(s) of less than '17 out of 20' years residence in the UK and that once this milestone is passed the normal UK exemption of (currently) Pounds 150,000 applies irrespective of domicile. Is this correct? The limited Pounds 55,000 exemption applies to transfers to non-domiciled spouses. Domicile, in the case of Inheritance Tax, is determined according to the Common Law, subject however, to the provisions of the Inheritance Tax Act in so far as they alter the Common Law. You are correct in saying that non-UK domiciled individuals who are resident in the UK for '17 out of 20 years' are regarded as UK domiciled for Inheritance Tax. Therefore, the above restriction does not apply to non-UK domiciled spouses with the requisite period of residence. This reply was provided by Barry Stillerman of accountants Stoy Hayward.

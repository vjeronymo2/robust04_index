			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FAMILY ASKS AUTOPSY NOT BE DONE ON MARTIN  </P> <P> An autopsy on former New York Yankee Manager Billy Martin was canceled today at  his family's request, and a prosecutor said the decision could make it harder  to press charges against the driver of the truck in which Martin died.  </P> <P> The Broome County Sheriff's Department reported slow progress in investigating  the Christmas night accident that killed Martin, 61, and injured his longtime  friend, William Reedy of Detroit.  </P> <P> Sheriff Anthony Ruffo said it will be another day or two before the alcohol  level in Reedy's blood is confirmed through laboratory tests.  </P> <P> Reedy was charged Christmas night with a misdemeanor charge of driving while  intoxicated and faces a fine of up to $1,000 and a year in jail.  </P> <P> Ruffo posted a sheriff's deputy on the rural road where the accident occurred  to direct a flood of traffic as reporters from across the country came to see  the site where Martin, the pugnacious, hard-drinking former second baseman who  was fired five times as Yankee manager, died.  </P> <P> Authorities say the pickup skidded off an icy road early Monday evening in  front of Martin's 148-acre farm near Binghamton, about 150 miles northwest of  New York City.  </P> <P> Broome County Dist. Atty. Gerald Mollen said he hoped to persuade Coroner  Patrick Ruddy to conduct an autopsy despite the family's wishes in order to  pinpoint the exact cause of Martin's death.  </P> <P> "I'm hoping that's not the final decision, to tell you the truth," Mollen said.  "It's unusual that a coroner would not have an autopsy conducted when cause of  death may be a legal question."  </P> <P> Ruddy said an autopsy on Martin's body would reveal little that an external  examination did not.  </P> <P> "He died, basically, of a fractured neck," Ruddy said. "The chest X-ray was  reasonably intact, belly was normal, blood count was normal. It's all in the  neck area."  </P> <P> The lack of an autopsy would mean that Martin's state of intoxication at the  time of his death might never be known. Mollen and Ruffo said whether or not  Martin was drunk would be irrelevant to any case against Reedy.  </P> <P> Reedy, owner of Reedy's Bar near Detroit's Tiger Stadium, suffered a broken hip  and possible broken ribs in the accident. He was listed in fair condition today  at the Upstate Medical Center Hospital in Syracuse, where he was transferred  after the crash.  </P> <P> Mollen said it would be "days, at least" before he decides whether to charge  Reedy with anything more serious than driving while intoxicated, such as  manslaughter.  </P> <P> He said a grand jury could take up the case as soon as the investigation was  complete.  </P> <P> The lack of an autopsy would not preclude further charges, Mollen said. "It's  not necessary in every case to have an autopsy to determine the cause of  death."  </P> <P> Ruffo said investigators had not made much progress in tracing Martin's  movements in the hours before his death.  </P> <P> "They were out on an errand and apparently were doing a little bit of shopping  before dinner," the sheriff said.  </P> <P> Reedy said he and Martin had gone to a store and then stopped for a quick drink  at a Binghamton bar Reedy could not identify, according to Deputy Steve  Glanville, who issued the DWI ticket.  </P> <P> Icy, slippery roads and Reedy's unfamiliarity with the area were believed to be  factors in the accident, Ruffo said. He said the speed limit on the road that  the truck skidded off was 55 m.p.h., but he did not know how fast the truck had  been going.  </P> <P> In addition to his wife, Martin's survivors include son Billy Joe of Lubbock,  Tex., and daughter, Kelly, both from previous marriages.  </P> <P> A viewing for Martin will be Thursday at the Frank Campbell Funeral Home in New  York. Services will be Friday at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  </P></p>

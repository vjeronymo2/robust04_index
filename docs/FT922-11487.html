			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / French budget deficit still rising THE French government budget deficit will overshoot its budget target again this year because of lower than expected tax revenues, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, said yesterday. He expected the deficit to reach FFr135bn (Pounds 13.7bn), as against the FFr90bn government estimate on which the current year's budget was based, and slightly ahead of the FFr131.7bn budget deficit in 1991. This will be slightly less than 2 per cent of gross domestic product, said Mr Beregovoy. However, he pledged not to raise taxes and risk putting a brake on growth, expected to rise to an annual 2.5 per cent in the first half, according to Insee, the state statistics body. He would instead seek continued curbs on government spending. Mr Beregovoy said the latest sign of the French economy's competitiveness was the widening in the trade surplus to FFr1.38bn in March, announced by the customs directorate yesterday. This compares with a FFr391m surplus in February and brings to FFr5.29bn the positive balance for the first three months of this year, as against a FFr14.28bn shortfall in the same quarter of last year. Exports rose strongly in March, to FFr106.86bn, from FFr103.88bn in February, according to the customs directorate. This was helped by an unusually large number of Airbus commercial aircraft deliveries. Imports rose less strongly, from FFr103.49bn to FFr105.48bn in the same period.</p>

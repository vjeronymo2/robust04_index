			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVABLE FEASTS: YES' SPREAD LEANS TO LIGHT, SHUNS NATIONAL IDENTITY  </P> <P> "How come fettuccine's on the menu?" I asked the hostess as I picked up my  order of Cantonese takeout. "Where do you think Marco Polo discovered pasta?"  she replied.  </P> <P> Before I could do a G. Burns on the G. Allen logic, she whisked me on an  eye-dazzling tour of Yes Bar and Restaurant. Color-coordinated by none other  than Peter Max (and designed by Santa Monica architect Johannes van Tilburg),  Yes is a small village of spaces: a greenhouse, a gazebo, a banquet room and a  big round bar done up in lipstick red, bubble-gum pink, sailcloth blue and lawn  green. If you have your food delivered by their "express courier," you'll never  know how adventurous this Hong Kong-based corporation's first Southern  California venue is.  </P> <P> Happy Hour is big business at Yes, and the combination appetizer platter  (golden shrimp balls, cheese dumplings, scallion rolls, fried won tons and  spring rolls) is fun to scarf down, seconds out of the kitchen, as you nurse  your second mai tai. It's not the same experience when they are delivered.  Those fried stuffed things turn greasy and leaden en route, all except for the  large, simple, ground chicken won tons and the house specialty, those golden  shrimp balls.  </P> <P> I'm usually wary of adjectives but Yes's "golden" shrimp balls ($5.50 for a  platter) are really just that. A smooth light paste within, the thinnest skin  of battered crunch without, they're terrific. Fried calamari is fine too. Just  skip the "garlic dip" accompaniment, which tastes like an execrable party soup  mix.  </P> <P> Yes's ace in the hole is lightness. They don't over-sauce, they're easy on the  salt, they control the sugar on typically sweet dishes. But this light hand can  go too far. None of the "spicy" or "fiery Sichuan" dishes come within 100 yards  of making the eyes water or the mouth blaze.  </P> <P> While not spicy by a long stretch, the quickly deep-fried "spicy" string beans  with slivers of onion and garlic are particularly swell. "Spicy" Kung Pao  prawns ($12.95) is actually a generous portion of plump, scallion-dotted shrimp  bathed in a lady-like, chile-garlic sauce. Boneless, skinless apricot-ginger  glazed chicken, while more apricot than ginger, is about a third as sweet as  Cantonese duck.  </P> <P> Both the magic wok flank steak salad ($8.50) and the Mandarin chicken salad  (two sizes, $4.95 and $7.95) with their fresh greens, rich roasted flavors and  light dressings would make a good lunch. (Make sure that the "specially baked  sourdough loaf" -- or wheat bread -- is included with your order. Ours was  not.)  </P> <P> The very lightly stir-fried Yes vegetable deluxe ($7.75), an assortment of  perky cruciferous things, is totally simple and satisfying with but a scant  spoonful of the announced "garlic, Dijon mustard and wine sauce."  </P> <P> Under the "pasta" heading (there are four Italianate dishes to one chow mein),  both the chicken pesto pasta (tender, very creamy, very mild) and the pollo  basilico fettuccine (light with fresh tomatoes, bright with basil threads) are  tasty and, at $8.50 for large portions, well priced. The pedestrian salmon  steak at $16.75 (and, on arrival, overcooked) is not. I'd also avoid the  unctuously sweet, commercially made, overpriced desserts.  </P> <P> When manager George Luk told me the menu would change regularly, I asked  whether one of these days they'll serve rice. "We have no intention of becoming  a Chinese restaurant," he said. "We're California cuisine." Ah, Toto, maybe  we're not in Kowloon anymore, but we're not yet in Chinois.  </P> <P>  Yes Bar and Restaurant, 11620 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles, (213) 478-7383.

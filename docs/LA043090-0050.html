			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 10-MINUTE SPECIALS SELLING LIKE HOT CAKES  </P> <P> In a world where everyone seems to be in a hurry, some businesses prosper  simply by creating the image of providing speedier service -- rather than  actually doing anything faster.  </P> <P> Denny's Restaurants, for example, started advertising 10-minute breakfast and  lunch specials nationally over the last six months, launching the service by  highlighting the quick items that already were on its menu.  </P> <P> It drives home the point with a further touch of marketing gimmickry, giving  customers stopwatches to let them clock how long an order takes.  </P> <P> "We didn't take anything that normally would take 12 minutes and tell people in  restaurants, 'OK, guys, now you have to do it in 10 minutes,' " said Sue  Henderson, the chain's vice president for marketing.  </P> <P> "We're just making sure they deliver in 10 minutes and that people know they  can go into Denny's and be served in 10 minutes."  </P> <P> The result: Denny's lunch and breakfast business, Henderson said, is up  "significantly."

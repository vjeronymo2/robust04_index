A  good time to go for elephant lovers is mid-November, for the annual Elephant  Roundup in Surin, which is about 300 miles northeast of Bangkok. The colorful  event, which draws visitors from around the world, is a sort of celebration  involving about 150 elephants, with music, games, contests, etc., held in an  area the size of a football field. This year, the event will take place Nov.  17-18.  </P> <P> Accommodations: Among the best places to stay in Chiang Mai are the Chiang Inn,  100 Changklan Road (175 rooms, air-conditioned; from $50 single per night to  $200 for suites), and the Orchid Chiang Mai, 100 Huay Kaew Road  (air-conditioned, swimming pool; from $50 to $300).  </P> <P> Seeing the elephants: There are several elephant training areas near Chiang  Mai. The best is probably at Lampang, less than an hour's drive from the city.  Some have pleasant restaurants. The concierge at your hotel can give you the  prices of the day's outing, which will vary but usually cost less than $100 per  person.  </P> <P> Visas: No visa is needed for Thailand unless travelers are planning to stay  more than 14 days.  </P> <P> For more information: Contact the Tourism Authority of Thailand, 3440 Wilshire  Blvd., Suite 1101, Los Angeles 90010, (213) 382-2353.

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPERTS ASSESS CASE AGAINST MAYOR;  </P> <P> BRADLEY UNLIKELY TO FACE CRIMINAL CONFLICT CHARGE  </P> <P> Legal experts say they do not expect prosecutors to charge Los Angeles Mayor  Tom Bradley with any crimes based on allegations that he took official actions  to benefit a bank and a savings and loan in which he had financial interests.  </P> <P> They say that if the mayor faces legal difficulty stemming from his role as a  paid official of the two financial institutions -- and it is not clear that he  does -- it will most likely take the form of a civil suit alleging that he  violated the less punitive of the state's two conflict-of-interest laws. Such a  suit would carry a maximum $2,000 fine.  </P> <P> The allegations were prompted by disclosures that Bradley was paid $18,000 as  an adviser to Far East National Bank and up to $24,000 a year as a member of  the board of directors of Valley Federal Savings and Loan Assn., both of which  had business dealings with the city. The ties between these institutions and  Bradley have become the central focus of an investigation by City Atty. James  K. Hahn.  </P> <P> This is only one of several inquiries into the mayor's financial affairs. The  Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan  have begun separate inquiries into the mayor's financial affairs.  </P> <P> But the exact nature and likely outcome of these probes are largely unknown.  </P> <P> The assessment that Bradley will not be charged with a crime for violating  conflict-of-interest laws is based in part on the observation that very few  politicians have ever been prosecuted on such charges. Charlotte Rhea, a  research analyst for the state attorney general's Bureau of Criminal  Statistics, said she could not find any record of conflict-of-interest  prosecutions in California in the last 10 years.  </P> <P> The assessment is also based on the mayor's not having acted in a typically  criminal manner: Rather than hide his financial relationship with the financial  institutions, he reported them, as the law requires, on economic disclosure  statements that are open to the public.  </P> <P> "The fact that he did not try to fool the voters -- that he reported it --  pretty much takes it out of the criminal arena," said one prosecutor who has  evaluated numerous conflict-of-interest allegations involving other officials.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most serious of the allegations is that Bradley used his official  position to try to influence the city treasurer to deposit city funds with Far  East National Bank, where Bradley was acting as a paid adviser.  </P> <P> This is what has been reported:  </P> <P> The mayor called city Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg just after he had received a  phone call from the bank's president, Henry Hwang, asking about reports that  the city was about to end its policy of depositing money in small  minority-owned banks. The next day, the treasurer deposited $1 million in  Hwang's bank and another $1 million a few days later.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Civil Suit More Likely  </P> <P> One expert, a lawyer who has wide experience in such cases, said a civil suit  is more likely than a criminal prosecution. Like most of seven experts  interviewed for this story, this one spoke on condition that he not to be  named.  </P> <P> "Bradley has received more than $250 (the legal standard)," the lawyer said.  "It appears he's participated in a decision affecting his source of income in  that he called the city treasurer and said -- if it can be shown that he indeed  said this -- 'why don't you deposit money with Far East?' "  </P> <P> The difficulty is proving Bradley made such a statement.  </P> <P> The treasurer has said that he did not think the mayor or anyone else was  trying to influence him.  </P> <P> What did the mayor then want? The treasurer and the mayor have said Bradley  simply wanted to know if the bank was receiving city deposits. Rebutting this  appears to depend on city documents that reportedly indicate the mayor long  knew the city had funds on deposit with the bank.  </P> <P> A criminal prosecution, which entails proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,  probably would be extremely difficult under these circumstances, experts said.  A civil suit, which requires only that one side's case be a little stronger  than the other's, would be much easier.  </P> <P> Bradley appears clearly off the hook as far as the tougher of California's two  conflict-of-interest laws is concerned. That law, which can be prosecuted as a  felony, prohibits public officials from being "financially interested in any  contract made by them in their official capacity or by any body or board of  which they are members." But bank deposits, although contracts, are  specifically exempted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Role Poses Questions  </P> <P> Bradley's position as Far East's only paid "special adviser" raises other  questions for prosecutors:  </P> <P> Did the mayor, who was a police officer for many years before he became a  politician, have special expertise in banking?  </P> <P> If not, was he really offering advice, or was he offering his influence as  mayor in the guise of advice? If so, was he guilty of accepting an illegal  gratuity -- which is akin to a tip -- or a bribe?  </P> <P> Prosecutors with the Los Angeles city attorney's office, which is reviewing the  allegations, have already ruled out such prosecutions, according to a source  familiar with their probe, because they have come up with no evidence of a quid  pro quo.  </P> <P> But Daniel Lowenstein, a UCLA law professor and principal author of the state's  Political Reform Act, said bribery should not necessarily be ruled out.  </P> <P> Lowenstein said a bribe does not require an explicit exchange of money for an  official action. It merely requires that the public official intends to be  influenced when he accepts the money. Lowenstein said bribes are commonplace in  politics, and distinctions between them and some campaign contributions, gifts,  honorariums and illegal gratuities are blurred. Much "bribery goes unprosecuted  primarily because the crime is so pervasive," he said.  </P> <P> Four prosecutors said that while Lowenstein may be technically correct, it is  unrealistic to expect a jury to convict a public official of bribery without  evidence of a quid pro quo -- preferably on tape.  </P> <P> In part because they believe it is so difficult to obtain convictions against  popular public figures, some prosecutors, who have almost unlimited discretion  in these matters, said they are sometimes content to let politicians take a  beating in the media -- rather than spend money on taking them to court.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Frequent Violations  </P> <P> A decision to prosecute, they said, usually requires that a lot of money,  concealment or repeated violations be involved. They also said they have to be  convinced that there was an intent to commit a crime rather than a foul-up.  </P> <P> The only conflict-of-interest prosecution in Los Angeles County in recent years  -- one that apparently escaped the attention of the Bureau of Criminal  Statistics -- involved a Downey city councilman. The councilman, James  Santangelo, cast the deciding vote in favor of redeveloping an area in which he  operated a large real estate office and owned substantial property, said Deputy  Dist. Atty. Herbert Lapin, who prosecuted the case.  </P> <P> Santangelo had not hidden his assets. The case against him was dropped after a  jury was declared hopelessly deadlocked, 11 to 1, for conviction.  </P> <P> Santangelo was charged with a misdemeanor under the Political Reform Act's  conflict-of-interest provision. It prohibits a public official from  participating in or using his position to try to influence any governmental  decision in which he "knows or has reason to know he has a financial interest."  </P> <P> There is nothing wrong with public officials having conflicting interests. It  is only illegal if they fail to disqualify themselves from public actions that  affect their private interests.  </P> <P> Conflict-of-interest law evolved from the Biblical admonition that "no man  shall serve two masters."  </P> <P> The point of the law, as the attorney general's office has expressed it in a  formal opinion, is to forbid a public official from placing himself "in a  position in which he might be tempted by his own private interest to disregard  the interest of the public."  </P> <P> "We know some people may be capable of acting objectively" even though they  have a competing private interest, Lowenstein said, "but we're not interested  in that. We're saying, 'This is the line, don't cross it.' "  </P> <P> In the case of Valley Federal Savings and Loan, Bradley faces allegations that  he crossed the line because he conducted city business that affected the  financial institution, while a he was one of its stockholders and directors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Approved Rezoning  </P> <P> The city business was approval of zoning changes sought by Valley Federal's  development subsidiary.  </P> <P> One question facing prosecutors is whether Bradley knew or had reason to know  that the documents he signed involved this subsidiary. Bradley has said he did  not know. Rebutting his position would probably be difficult because the  documents did not contain the name of the Valley Federal subsidiary.  </P> <P> Bradley could also be off the hook if it could be shown that the zoning changes  did not have what the law refers to as a "material financial effect" on the  savings and loan. This effect has been variously defined.  </P> <P> To have a material effect on a company the size of IBM, for example, in which a  public official owned stock, a decision by the public official would have to  result in at least a million-dollar change in IBM's gross revenues, according  to regulations imposed by the state Fair Political Practices Commission, a  policing agency created by the Political Reform Act. To materially affect a  small business, the decision would have to result in at least a $10,000 change.  In a zoning case, there would have to be a $10,000 increase or decrease in the  fair market value of the rezoned property.  </P> <P> Whether such a change could be proved as a result of the Valley Federal  rezoning decisions is unclear.  </P> <P> Another difficulty in prosecuting Bradley in connection with the zoning changes  involves an exception to conflict-of-interest law called the rule of necessity.  This exception, according to the attorney general's office, "permits  governmental officers or agencies to carry out essential duties despite  conflicts where only they may act."  </P> <P> In the case of Bradley, he can sign, veto or refuse to sign zoning change  ordinances approved by the City Council. If he refuses to sign, the ordinance  becomes law anyway.  </P> <P> The only way Bradley could have avoided a conflict of interest in the zoning  matters would have been to leave the city.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Leave the City?  </P> <P> The question then becomes: Is the mayor required to leave the city whenever a  conflict arises? The answer is doubtful.  </P> <P> A similar question arose in San Francisco a few years ago when then-Mayor  Dianne Feinstein vetoed an ordinance that could have cost her money. Feinstein  was a landlord with five apartments. The ordinance would have limited the rent  that landlords could have charged new tenants.  </P> <P> Feinstein was sued by a nonprofit group, which alleged her veto violated  conflict-of-interest law. A trial court agreed, but a panel of the state Court  of Appeal ruled there was no violation.  </P> <P> If the city attorney's office declines to prosecute Bradley or file suit  against him, the FPPC still could could begin an administrative action against  the mayor.  </P> <P> The commission did that last year with Los Angeles City Councilman Richard  Alatorre, after the city attorney's office declined to press a  conflict-of-interest case. Alatorre was fined $2,000 after admitting that he  attempted to steer a $722,500 city contract to an Eastside community  organization that had paid him $1,000.  </P> <P> The commission has fined 14 public officials for conflict-of-interest  violations in the last four years.  </P> <P> For public officials concerned about avoiding conflicts, the commission hands  out free advice. Every month, about 10 officials make use of the service.  </P></p>

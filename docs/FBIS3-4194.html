Last year a total of 100 items of advanced farm technology  were introduced into the province, remarkably increasing  agricultural output value.    Despite serious natural disasters, this central province's  total grain output was 26.31 million tons last year, with per  unit area yields of rice and cotton ranking the highest in the  country.    Its production of pork, oranges, tea and fresh-water fish  were also among the highest in the country.    As the birthplace of hybrid rice, Hunan boasts a large  number  of well-known agricultural experts such as Yuan Longping, Li  Bihu, Zhou Kunlu, Kang Chunlin and Zhou Guangqia, who have  succeeded in breeding a series of new varieties of three-stage  hybrid rice after years of efforts.    In 1993 the province planted 2.26 million ha. Of hybrid  rice, increasing rice production by over 1.5 billion kg.    And this year it plans to plant 2.4 million ha. Of hybrid  rice.    The experimental planting of "Hengliangyou No.1", a  two-stage  hybrid rice, has yielded good results. Its average per ha  output is over 7,800 kg.    Last year, it planted 6,000 ha. of "Hengliangyou No. 1" in  experiment and plans to grow 53,000 ha. to 67,000 ha. this year.    The province has also succeeded in developing two-stage  wheat, sorghum and crossbred chili, as well as new varieties of  carp, pigs and cows.    Since 1986 the province has had over 500 agricultural  scientific and technological projects that have won state- or  province-level awards. They have produced an annually  additional income of over three billion yuan (about 350 million  U.S. dollars) for the province.    Hunan has nearly 20,000 agricultural experts and technicians  working at state and collective research institutes, as well as  435,400 grassroots farm technicians.    In recent years the province has set up agricultural science  and education centers in 2,100 townships, 70 percent of the  total. They are playing an important role in helping farmers to  learn new skills and raise their cultural level.    The nationally renowned Hunan radio agriculture school has  enrolled 176,600 students, 56,000 of whom have graduated with  diplomas of polytechnic school education.    The province also attaches importance to publishing and  spreading new technologies and skills. "HUNAN AGRICULTURE", a  leading agricultural magazine, has a subscription of 600,000  nationwide.    Agriculture officials say that the majority of farmers in  Hunan have mastered new techniques for applying fertilizers and  planting new breeds of grain and cotton.    Local peasants have also realized the importance and  advantages of using new techniques and skills in farm production.    At the same time, Hunan has strengthened farm technical  services and supervision of seed and crop quality.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Major backs ending of Sunday trading curbs MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday backed the ending of restrictions on Sunday trading, amid warnings that the government's planned legislation on shop opening hours could be wrecked unless it provided extra protection for shopworkers. The Downing Street statement that the prime minister would vote for total deregulation came as the Home Office unveiled four options for reforming the widely-flouted Sunday trading laws in England and Wales. MPs will have a free vote in the new session of parliament in the autumn on which option will form the basis of legislation. The four options are: Total deregulation, allowing all shops to open at any time. Partial deregulation, based on proposals from the Shopping Hours Reform Council, allowing smaller shops to open at any time, but larger shops to open only six hours. Limited opening, based on proposals from the Keep Sunday Special Campaign. Most shops would shut but small shops and certain categories of large shop, including DIY and garden centres, could open. Limited opening, based on proposals from Retailers for Shops Act Reform, similar to those of the KSSC but allowing all shops to open on the four Sundays before Christmas. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, who also favours deregulation, said he was confident parliament would back one of the options. The government annoyed Labour MPs and campaign groups whose proposals formed the basis of the bill by failing to extend protection against being forced to work on Sundays to future as well as existing shopworkers. Mrs Joan Ruddock, Labour's home affairs spokeswoman, said the threat was 'hanging over the government' that MPs might ultimately vote the bill down, even if one of the options received a majority. Mr Michael Schluter, director of KSSC, said the government had broken its promise to give a 'full and fair representation' of each campaign group's proposals by excluding KSSC's demand for full employee protection and double pay for Sunday working. He said his group could not support any reform of the law without worker protection. Baroness Jay, chairman of SHRC, said she hoped the government's stance on employee protection would not 'jeopardise the reform process'. Bill sparks job fears, Page 13 Editorial Comment, Page 17</p>

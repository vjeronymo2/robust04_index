			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Letter: Australia denies its industrial tariffs are monstrously high Sir, I would take issue with key points in Sir Roy Denman's letter (February 24). It is true that industrial tariffs have been ratcheted down over the course of successive General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade rounds. Australia and the Cairns Group accept that agricultural reform also cannot be achieved overnight. However, the corruption of world agricultural markets is so immense, not least because of EC export subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy, that the need for substantial reductions in subsidies and other support should be manifest to all. At risk is a package (the so-called Dunkel text) which would provide a substantial boost to world trade across a wide range of both goods and services. However, the statement I refute most strongly is 'the Australians (will do) little to cut their monstrously high industrial tariffs'. A few facts are in order to correct this completely out of date view. Between 1983 and 1992 the effective level of protection of Australian industry will have been halved. In contrast with the majors, there are now no quantitative restrictions on imports to Australia, with the sole exception of tariff quotas on textiles, clothing and footwear which will be eliminated by March next year. Australia's average protection on all imports from Most Favoured Nation sources will be less than 5 per cent by the end of this decade. Most imports from developing countries (including the countries of central Europe) will be duty and quota free by July 1996. Let us see the Community come even close to this. Despite the recession Australia is currently experiencing, the prime minister, in his economic statement on Wednesday, did not seek to reverse, or even slow down, the tariff cuts in train - Australia's offer on market access in the current Gatt round is among the highest of all parties to the negotiations. The value to Europe is that we are offering to bind cuts of 44 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. Jim Payne, Counsellor (Public Affairs), Australian High Commission, London</p>

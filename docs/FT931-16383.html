			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Manchester Airport traffic grows 15% PASSENGER traffic through Manchester Airport grew by nearly 15 per cent in 1992, resuming the rapid development that made it Europe's fastest-growing airport before the 1991 Gulf war curtailed air travel. Official figures to be issued today are expected to show that about 12.4m passengers used the airport last year compared with 10.8m in 1991. 'We think this is tremendous, considering the recession,' Mr Gil Thompson, the airport's chief executive, said yesterday. Its passenger figures compare with about 19m for Gatwick and 40m for Heathrow, but controversial plans for a second runway within five years are likely to push Manchester towards 30m passengers a year and about 12th place in the world's airports league. The second runway is being vigorously opposed by local residents and environmental groups but the airport's owners - the 10 borough councils of Greater Manchester - say up to 50,000 new jobs would be generated. British Rail laid the last length of track this week to the airport's new rail terminal, which starts operation in May, providing the airport's first rail link with Manchester city centre. Manchester's new Pounds 570m Terminal Two will open in March, the first step towards increasing the airport's capacity to 23m people. All long-haul traffic except British Airways services will transfer to the new terminal, which will initially handle about 6m passengers a year. The existing Terminals A and B will be renamed Terminals 1 and 1A. British Airways will continue to use them for its domestic, Continental and long-haul services alongside other short-haul UK and Continental operators. The split between charter and scheduled traffic remains about 60-40 in favour of the former, but the airport now boasts 94 airlines serving 165 destinations.</p>

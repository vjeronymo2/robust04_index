			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Azem Hajdarevic: "Persecution of the Muslims"] </F>   [Text] The state of "Yugoslavia" has intensively been  using various methods of ethnic cleansing in Sandzak. Media  propaganda, police repression, and permanent killing and  kidnapping of the Muslims have played the most important role in  that.    Through the Serbian and Montenegrin media, especially  television and the daily press (POLITIKA EXPRES, VECERNJE  NOVOSTI, POBJEDA...), the state is intensively spreading  anti-Muslim propaganda. These state media misinform both the  local and international public and cover up the dramatic  position of the non- Serb population, especially the Muslims, in  what is left of "Yugoslavia."    This is evident from many examples and we are providing but  a  few.    Twenty-five Muslims from Sandzak, from Novi Pazar, Sjenica,  and Tutin, suspected of possessing illegal weapons, threatening  the territorial integrity of the "FRY [Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia]," and creating an independent state of Sandzak were  put on trial on 31 January 1994, eight months after the suspects  had been arrested. During the pre-trial investigation, the  media, especially POLITIKA EXPRES, published numerous articles  and three features accusing the suspects of terrorism,  secession, and Islamic fundamentalism. The authors published  those articles and features in collusion with police directly to  influence public opinion, which is against the law. The  pretrial investigation was much longer than permitted by law,  and the suspects were interrogated by the police and then by the  investigating judge without having their lawyers present, but  the media failed to mention all this.    Nor have the Serbian and Montenegrin media revealed the  truth  about how the suspects were treated when they were interrogated  in Kraljevo prison, where they were tortured both physically and  mentally in order to force a confession.  <H5>  New "Standard Language" </H5>   Suspects are charged under Article 116 of the Criminal Law  of  the "FRY," although that law does not exist in this  "Yugoslavia," for it was enacted by the Assembly of the former  Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, so this law cannot  apply. The attorneys of the arrested suspects, 12 of them,  claim that this is a political show trial, that people cannot be  tried for terrorist acts that they did not commit, but only for  the illegal possession of weapons, which is again controversial,  for it presents a one-sided application of the law for one  section of the population, in this case the Muslims, and that is  an obvious example of discriminatory policy in applying the law.    The following people were put to trial: Ibrahim Fakovic,  Sefkija Rasljanin, Safet Zilkic, Hodo Jakupovic, Asim Sacirovic,  Hajriz Fejzovic, Fadil Ugljanin, Jonuz Skrijelj, Adem Hasic,  Dzemail Etemovic, Mersad Plojevic, Nusuf Halilovic, Murat Music,  Alija Halilovic, Hajriz Kolasinac, Hajro Aljkovic, Mustafa Alic,  Rifat Dupljak, Sefcet Gracanin, Zuhdija Hodzic, Nedzib Hodzic,  all from Novi Pazar, Jakup Hodzic and Mirsad Hodzic from  Sjenica, Semsudin Kucevic and Zekrija Hajrovic from Tutin.    For propaganda purposes, the media have also used the  foreign  policy activity of President of the Sandzak Muslim National  Council Sulejman Ugljanin, which lasted for a couple of days  during September and October, accusing him and the above people  on the same grounds, reporting that an international arrest  warrant has been issued by the Serbian authorities.    Another fine example of anti-Muslim propaganda is an event  of  27 December 1993, when the police raided the Zejnilovic family  of Loznica in Bijelo Polje. The police shot Alen Zejnilovic and  his mother Zurafeta, while his younger brother Adnan (17),  sister Amela (18), and Mirela (19) were seriously injured. In  order to justify this action of the police, the media presented  the Zejnilovic family as terrorists.    Together with the media already mentioned, the local media  of Novi Pazar, Bijelo Polje, and other Sandzak municipalities  have also used disinformation to assist the exodus of Muslims:  such as the Information Center of Bijelo Polje, which consists  of BIJELOPOLJSKE NOVINE and the local radio station. Under the  pretext of "using the standard language," they decided to  abolish all terms, names, and expressions that are used by the  Muslims or even resemble the culture, customs, tradition, and  unique characteristics of the Muslims. On the other hand,  chetnik songs and praise for the chetnik movement can be heard  every day.    Persecution and genocide against the Muslims is presented as  the just fight of the Serbs and the Montenegrins for Serbianity  against "Islamic fundamentalism." Such propaganda encourages  the Serbs and the Montenegrins to treat Muslims even more  brutally, as is evident from the following examples:    On 7 January 1994, a group of armed Montenegrins dispersed  all the Muslim tradesmen from the market in Pavino Polje and  warned them not to return there again.    On 11 January 1994, in Gubavac in Bijelo Polje, three  Montenegrins attempted to rape Sefka Bucan (25) in her back  yard, and no measures were taken against them.  <H5>  Ethnic Composition Is Changing </H5>   In addition to media propaganda and satanization, the  repression or, better still, the terrorism of the  Serbian-Montenegrin authorities is another way to apply pressure  to ethnically cleanse Sandzak of the Muslims.    Let us recall that, on 22 October 1992, under the auspices  of  the authorities, 17 Muslims from the village of Sjeverin in the  Priboj commune were kidnapped and then killed near Visegradska  Banja.    On 16 February 1993, 12 Muslims were kidnapped in Bukovica,  in Pljevlja, among whom there were also two children, aged three  and five, and they were then taken to Cajnici (in  Bosnia-Herzegovina); six of them were exchanged and six returned  to Pljevlja. During the kidnapping, Latif Bungur (95) was  killed on the spot, although he was not buried until eight  months later.    On 18 February 1993, in the village of Kukurovici in Priboj  three people were killed: Bulut Huzeir, Husovic Musan, and  Sarac Sadeta, and they have still not been given a decent burial.    On 27 February 1993, 20 Muslims and one Croat were kidnapped  in Strpci from a train going from Belgrade to Bar and they are  still missing today, in spite of all appeals.    In 1993, in the villages in Priboj and Pljevlja, 47 Muslim  homes, three mosques, and several other buildings were burnt  down or destroyed by explosives. In this area, 36 villages were  ethnically cleansed and most were ransacked.    Increasing police repression is being recorded in Novi  Pazar,  Sjenica, and Tutin, where the Muslims form an overwhelming  majority, and this has contributed to changing the ethnic  situation in those Sandzak communes. In Tutin alone, in 1993  the Serbian police raided 36 villages, arrested 68 people, and  83 were brought in for so-called informative interrogations, of  whom 57 were physically injured.    Even more severe repression during 1993 was observed around  Sjenica, where 21 villages were raided (350 families were  raided), 13 people arrested, 190 taken away for these so-called  informative interrogations, and 250 sustained physical injuries.    Growing fear and uncertainty among Muslims is being caused  by  the opening of new police stations in these places.    For those reasons, the Muslims are fleeing the area in great  numbers, especially to Western Europe, so that some 85,000 are  now in exile. The program of the author of the "greater  Orthodox Serbia" was designed to do exactly that.  Unfortunately, even if we suppose that peace and security will  return to these areas and that the so called FRY will become a  democratic and rule-of-law state, the ethnic composition has  already been changed, as historical and demographic indicators  show that 20 to 30 percent of those who are in exile will never  return to their native country. That means that Sandzak has, in  any case, lost between 20,000 to 25,000 Muslims.    The only solution for the survival of the Muslims in Sandzak  is for their indigenousness to be recognized and for the Sandzak  region to be granted the right to its political and territorial  uniqueness, something for which the people voted in the October  1991 referendum.</p>

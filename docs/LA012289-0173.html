U.S.  District Judge G. Kendall Sharp denied a request for a stay in the morning. A  three-judge panel of the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta denied  Bundy's appeal in a telephone conference Saturday afternoon without addressing  any of the legal issues, court clerk Matt Davidson said.  </P></p>

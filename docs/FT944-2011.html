			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Ministers to seek City advice on defusing executive pay row The cabinet is to set up a committee of City professionals to advise on plans to defuse growing political criticism of executive salaries by forcing public companies to seek shareholder approval at annual meetings. The plans, prompted by concern about salary rises in the privatised utilities, would make executive awards subject to affirmative resolution, dramatically toughening shareholders' rarely used powers to question directors. Detailed proposals were drawn up by Trade and Industry Department and Treasury officials for the cabinet's industry and consumer affairs committee after Mr John Major condemned 'unjustified' increases in the Commons. However, the committee has decided that the proposals are too complex to proceed further without detailed advice from a wide range of City professionals. Ministers are expected to write shortly to the Stock Exchange, the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Fund Managers asking for nominations for the committee to consider the proposals. Officials said other organisations, such as the Institute of Directors, might also be included on a list of City institutions being drawn up for Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. The committee is expected to report to Mr Heseltine early next year. Mr Heseltine is understood to oppose formal legal changes in shareholder powers, which he believes would threaten the competitiveness of UK companies by making it difficult to recruit top executives from overseas. However, other senior ministers believe action to increase shareholders' powers would help to neutralise Labour attacks on the Conservatives as the 'party of privilege'. Mr Major and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, were deeply angered by a 75 per cent pay award to Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, which was followed by cuts in wages for junior staff. In a further indication of cabinet irritation, the British Gas strategy was condemned yesterday by Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, who is one of the cabinet's leading advocates of free markets. Running a large public company was 'a privilege as well as a responsibility', Mr Redwood said. 'If you wish to lead a cost-cutting drive, there should be some effort to control costs at the top as well. A good officer does not expect his men to suffer privations or dangers in action that he himself would not face.'</p>

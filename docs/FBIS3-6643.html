			<p>Language: <F P=105>Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Here is a communique of the Khmer Royal Armed Forces  [KRAF] General Staff on the preliminary results of the Pailin  area's capture:    After days of appealing to the officers and troops of the  Democratic Kampuchea group [DKG] urging them to return to the  national community and join the royal government and because the  DKG remained stubborn in refusing to take part in national  reconciliation, the KRAF decided to enter and occupy the Pailin  area.    During the total seizure of Pailin at 1800 on 19 March, the  KRAF met with a stiff resistance and were counterattacked by the  recalcitrant DKG. As a result of the battle to protect the Bar  Ya Kha village, the KRAF killed 22 DKG troops on the spot. In  particular, at Sala Krau the KRAF seized two 76.2-mm guns, a  122-mm K-38 cannon, 30 RPK's, a DK-75 gun, a DK-82 gun, two  37-mm antiaircraft guns, 10 AK-47's, two SKS's, two SKT's, an  RCL, seven B-40's, an 82-mm mortar, a 107-mm rocket stand, two  105-mm rifles, more than 10 tonnes of assorted ammunition, more  than 50 automobiles, and hundreds of motorcycles.    These are only preliminary results. The General Staff will  inform the public of subsequent results in the future.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7. All or part of the proceeds from a redemption of Class B shares may be reinvested within 30 days of redemption (or such other time period as a Fund may establish) into Class B shares of any Fund at net asset value. The Distributor will refund from its own assets the CDSC imposed at the time of redemption by crediting the shareholder's account with additional shares in an amount equal to the CDSC. Upon any such reinvestment, the amount reinvested will be subject to the same CDSC to which such amount was subject prior to the redemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Class B shares of a Fund held for the Class B CDSC period will automatically convert to Class A shares of such Fund at the relative net asset values of each of the classes. The purpose of the conversion feature is to relieve the Class B shareholders from remaining subject to the asset-based sales charge for longer than the CDSC period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Each class of shares will be exchangeable only for shares of the same class of other Funds. Applicants only will permit exchanges into shares of Money Market Portfolios having rule 12b&hyph;1 plans if either the time period during which the shares of the money market funds are held is included with the time period during which the exchanged shares were held in the calculation of the CDSC, or such time period is not included but the amount of the CDSC is reduced by the amount of any rule 12b&hyph;1 payments made by the money market funds with respect to those shares. Applicants may choose not to offer an exchange privilege for single class Money Market Portfolios. Applicants will comply with rule 11a&hyph;3 as to all exchanges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Class A, Class B, and additional classes of shares created in the future will each represent interests in the same portfolio of investments, and will be identical in all respects except: (a) Each class of shares would have different designation; (b) each class of shares might be sold under different sales arrangements (e.g., subject to a front-end sales load, a CDSC, a front-end sales load and a CDSC, or at net asset value); (c) each class of shares would bear any payments incurred in connection with a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan or non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan related to that class (and any other costs relating to obtaining shareholder approval of the rule 12b&hyph;1 plan for that class or an amendment to its rule 12b&hyph;1 plan); (d) each class of shares would bear expenses specifically attributable to the particular class (``Class Expenses''), as described in the following paragraph; (e) the fact that classes will vote separately with respect to a Fund's rule 12b&hyph;1 plan and/or shareholder services plan, except as provided in condition 15 below; (f) each class of shares would have different exchange privileges; and (g) each class of shares might have different conversion features. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Class Expenses may include the following: (a) Transfer agency fees as identified by the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class; (b) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses and proxies to current shareholders; (c) Blue Sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (d) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (e) the expenses of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class; (f) litigation, tax liens or other legal expenses relating solely to one class of shares; (g) directors' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares; and (h) other expenses that are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares which shall be approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicants request an order exempting them from the provisions of sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) of the Act to the extent that the proposed issuance and sale of various classes of shares representing interests in the same Fund might be deemed: (a) to result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g); (b) prohibited by section 18(f)(1); and (c) to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants believe that the proposed multi-class arrangement will better enable the Funds to meet the competitive demands of today's financial services industry. Under the multi-class arrangement, an investor will be able to choose the method of purchasing shares that is most beneficial given the amount of his or her purchase, the length of time the investor expects to hold his or her shares, and other relevant circumstances. The proposed arrangement would permit the Funds to facilitate both the distribution of their securities and provide investors with a broader choice as to the method of purchasing shares without assuming excessive accounting and bookkeeping costs or unnecessary investment risks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights relating to the rule 12b&hyph;1 plans in the manner described is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders. In addition, such arrangements should not give rise to any conflicts of interest because the rights and privileges of each class of shares are substantially identical. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicants believe that the proposed multi-class arrangement does not present the concerns that section 18 of the Act was designed to address. The multi-class arrangement will not increase the speculative character of the shares of the Fund. The multi-class arrangement does not involve borrowing, nor will it affect the Funds' existing assets or reserves, and does not involve a complex capital structure. Nothing in the multi-class arrangement suggests that it will facilitate control by holders of any class of shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Applicants submit that the requested exemption to permit the Funds to implement the proposed CDSCs is appropriate in the public interest, and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. The proposed CDSC arrangements will provide shareholders the option of having their full payment invested for them at the time of their purchase of shares of the Funds with no deduction of an initial sales charge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

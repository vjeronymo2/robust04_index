			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Letter: A surfeit of importers - and a paucity of UK manufacturers Sir, Mr Dantzic (Letters, February 2) and the manufacturing sector may be interested to learn of our experience. We are the UK arm of a German furniture company. Since September 16 1992 we have been approaching British companies in order to sub-contract the manufacture of certain steel and aluminium products. We are stupefied. Despite the fact that all of the companies approached are still in business, we have not received a response to 30 per cent of our letters. A further 20 per cent had to be sent a second letter before a response was received. One respondent stated: 'We won't make you a sample in case you take the business elsewhere.' Prices have occasionally been preposterous, and the quality of samples - where available - is normally poor. Our products are simple and do not require high technology machinery for their manufacture. We agree that there is a surfeit of importers. Is the sector really devoid both of adept finance directors and willing production directors? Mark Adams, managing director, Vitsoe UK, 189 Bermondsey Street, London SE1 3UW</p>

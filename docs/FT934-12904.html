			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Squabbles over EC goodies near an end: This Friday's summit is likely to send nearly everyone home with an institution A COMPLEX exercise in EC lobbying is approaching a climax. Two years of wrangling on choosing sites for nine institutions designed to enhance European co-operation have shown how that commodity can be in short supply. However, Friday's special summit in Brussels should produce a deal which - barring last-minute surprises - provides benefits for nearly everyone. One UK official in Brussels compares the parcelling out of institutions to a children's party ritual in which all the guests go home proudly clutching a bag of sweets. Governments have to choose homes for a rich variety of agencies. The most difficult horse-trading has focused on the well-publicised struggle to select the city to host the European Monetary Institute (EMI), the forerunner of the planned European central bank. Also seeking a home are institutions aimed at harmonising Community policies on cleaning up the environment, fighting drug dealers, licensing pharmaceuticals, breeding plants and registering trade marks. The key to the likely compromise is that Britain has dropped its long-standing opposition to placing the EMI in Germany. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, will reiterate London's attractions - but this will be for form's sake only. After the French and Spanish governments this month came out publicly in favour of Germany, Frankfurt - heavily promoted by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the Bundesbank - seems the probable choice. Mr Kohl claims this would buttress the German electorate's declining support for economic and monetary union (Emu). France in particular opposes a city which is already a financial centre. Bonn, Mainz, Kiel, Wiesbaden and Berlin have been mentioned as alternatives. But Mr Kohl has signalled strong opposition to anywhere but Frankfurt. In view of Germany's pivotal role in the politics of Emu, he is likely to have his way. Pointing to what they see as the slender possibility that the EMI will grow into a fully-fledged central bank in coming years, British officials say the institute will have mainly 'academic' significance. That interpretation was strengthened by last week's announcement that Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, is likely to be the first EMI president. Mr Wim Duisenberg, president of the Dutch National Bank, was backed by several countries as a much more high-profile choice to run the EMI. But he turned the idea down, partly because the job would offer him only limited scope. Underlining the links between different parts of EC decision-making, there are several other reasons why the Dutch government has not pressed Mr Duisenberg's candidacy. Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, is bidding to become the next EC Commission president when Mr Jacques Delors departs at the end of next year. The Netherlands reckons that Mr Lubbers's chances would be impeded if Mr Duisenberg were given the less important EMI post. On a still more Byzantine level, the Netherlands believes that nominating Mr Duisenberg as EMI chief would undermine its separate candidacy of Amsterdam as the EMI site. The Dutch know that Frankfurt has the upper hand. But they want formally to maintain Amsterdam's bid as a means of ensuring that the EC agrees to their alternative objective - opposed by France - of bringing to The Hague the planned Europol Drugs Agency. Several EC members are backing Frankfurt's EMI candidature in a blatant attempt to win German support for bringing other sought-after institutions to their capitals. Denmark - which, like Britain, has won an exemption from Emu - says it supports Frankfurt as the price for awarding the Environment Agency to Copenhagen. The Spanish government has backed the German line for precisely the same reason. In case either city fails to win the Environment Agency, Madrid and Copenhagen have their eye on a consolation prize: they are also maintaining fall-back bids for the Trade Mark Office. Ireland, which strongly supports putting the EMI in Germany, wants to host the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, which would investigate the safety and effectiveness of medicines across the EC. Mr Brendan Howlin, the Irish health minister, says Dublin is concentrating on winning the medicines agency, having given up earlier plans to lobby for the trade marks and environmental agencies. The stiffest competitor here is the UK government, which now believes the medicines agency would be a greater source of employment than the EMI. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the UK health minister, has recently visited Brussels to press London's application. She points to evidence that Swiss and US drugs companies, as well as British ones, support London's application. A key component of Britain's case is that southern England offers a more liberal environment for pharmaceutical research than competing areas on the continent. If Mr Major this week can persuade Mr Kohl of this salient point, Britain's chances of stitching up a deal will increase. THE NEW NINE: WHAT THEY WOULD DO European Monetary Institute: harmonising monetary policies Europol Drugs Agency: handling data on narcotics. European Plant Breeders' Rights Office: registering plant strains. European Trade Mark Office: registering trade marks. European Medicine Evaluation Agency: testing pharmaceuticals. European Work Health and Safety  Agency: Improving work conditions. European Veterinary Inspection Agency: testing animal health. European Drugs Observatory: analysing data and trends on drugs. European Foundation for Training: harmonising training procedures.                            *      *      * WHO HAS WHAT ....AND WHO WANTS WHAT DUBLIN Bidding for Medicines Evaluation Agency CAMBRIDGE Bidding for plant Breeder's Rights Office BRUSSELS Council of Ministers European Commission LUXEMBOURG Court of Justice European Investment Bank (EIB) Euratom Court of Auditors STRASBOURG European Parliament (Permanent seat) MUNICH European Patent Office LISBON Bidding form Environment Agency MADRID Bidding form Environment Agency BARCELONA Bidding for Medicines Evaluation Agency LONDON Most likely site for Medicines Evaluation Agency LONDON European Bank for reconstruction and Development (EBRD) COPENHAGEN Bidding for Environment Agency, Trade Mark Office, Medicines Evaluation Agency THE HAGUE Most likely site for Europol Drugs Agency BERLIN Bidding for Environment Agency, Foundation for Training LUXEMBOURG Bidding for Trade Mark Office FRANKFURT Most likely site for European Monetary Institute (EMI), forerunner to European Central Bank</p>

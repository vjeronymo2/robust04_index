			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> MALLE DISSECTS FRENCH FAMILY LIFE IN 'MURMUR OF THE HEART'  </P> <P> Young Laurent Chevalier, hero of Louis Malle's sunnily sensual reissued "Murmur  of the Heart" (opening Friday at the Music Hall) has a wide, droll mouth that  curls up at the ends like a Picasso line drawing and ears almost like a faun's.  Something about that look, combined with his skinny skittishness, lets us  tolerate 14-year-old Laurent even when he behaves like a consummate brat; when,  for example, in an agony of jealousy he deliberately drops a bottle of milk for  their aging family maid to clean up.  </P> <P> Also, it's 1954. Horrific manners are the mark of the lordly young Frenchman,  these three particularly; sons of a well-off Dijon gynecologist and his  free-spirited Italian wife. Their world would change soon enough; it is already  changing: the French are losing at Dien Bien Phu; in a little more than a  decade, kids this age from the bourgeoisie would became radicalized.  </P> <P> Writer-director Malle, who wrote the film in one firestorm week in the spring  of 1970 and finished it the following year, conjures up that family, that time,  that insular smugness with a notable mixture of affection and observation. It's  his family, something we recognize even more clearly after "Au Revoir Les  Enfants."  </P> <P> Malle, too, had the two older brothers, the love for Charlie Parker and Jelly  Roll Morton, the heart murmur and the summer at the spa that his young Laurent  shares. Even the hilarious game of spinach tennis is from memory. But the  funny, earthy, faintly unhappy Italian mother, Clara, a wild bird untamed by  her 20 years stifled in the bosom of the French bourgeoisie, is Malle's  creation.  </P> <P> She has been given indelible life by Lea Massari, an apricot-colored goddess  whose charm lies in her exuberance, her physicality, her very un-Frenchness,  and in an utterly disarming sprinkling of freckles. Clara, the daughter of a  radical political exile, was a 16-year-old visitor to France when Charles  Chevalier (Daniel Gelin) became her first lover and then her husband, to the  consternation of his moneyed parents.  </P> <P> Of their three sons, Laurent (Benoit Ferreux), the youngest, is her favorite.  She adores and babies him; (somehow) he sees her spirit for what it is. His  older brothers, Marc (Marc Winocourt) and Thomas (Fabien Ferreux, Benoit's own  brother) have fallen into the habit of putting her down, telling her that she  couldn't even pass their exams.  </P> <P> When scarlet fever leaves Laurent with a heart murmur, Clara goes with him to a  health spa up in the mountains. The two are like one closed fist against the  young prigs and Royalists Laurent encounters, these children of the stuffy,  social French families who populate the spa. Clara, by being herself -- playing  her first game of tennis in sneakers and street clothes -- seems marvelous to  these 16- and 17-year-olds.  </P> <P> It's at the spa, triggered by an evening of Bastille Day celebration, that the  scene that made the film a cause celebre occurs. It's a subdued, nuzzling  moment between boy-child and intensely affectionate mother, when all his  impacted jealousy, fascination, adoration and curiousity carry Laurent across  the line into incest.  </P> <P> Eighteen years ago, some of us were so busy priding ourselves on being  shockproof that we didn't really think to question Malle further: to wonder at  how firmly he denied the moment its reverberations -- to both parties. If this  was incest, tasteful, "open," utterly without consequence, then what was all  the fuss about? Actually, what today's audiences may wonder is what the movie  is about if this moment, toward which the film is so insistently pointed, is so  without effect.  </P> <P> From today's vantage point, "Murmur of the Heart's" strongest memory becomes  its climate: political, familial, full of warmth, family jokes and indulged bad  manners, brotherly acts of rivalry and support. This may be just what Malle was  aiming for: in his words, "a contemporary comedy of French bourgeois  education." (The film is MPAA-rated R.) What we see now is elegant detail,  sharp observation, perfect performances (especially by Benoit Ferreux and the  sublime Massari). And a possibly far-reaching moment that becomes simply one of  those enigmatic Gallic shrugs.  </P> <P> Could it really be as weightless as all that? Perhaps. Possibly. One wonders.  </P> <P> 'MURMUR OF THE HEART'  </P> <P> An Orion Classics Release of a Co-production of Nouvelles Editions de Films;  Marianne Productions (Paris), Vides Cinematographica (Rome), Franz Seitz  Filmproduktion (Munich).

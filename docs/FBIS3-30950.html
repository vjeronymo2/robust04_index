			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Geneva by Tihomir Vinkovic] </F>   [Excerpt] Following their meetings in Geneva on 9 and 10  February held in an open and constructive atmosphere, Mate  Granic, vice president and minister for foreign affairs of the  Republic of Croatia, and Haris Silajdzic, president of the  government of Bosnia-Herzegovina, have agreed on the following  joint statement, which we present in its entirety:    1. Both countries will send letters to the UN Security  Council demanding international controls over  Bosnia-Herzegovina's borders to achieve a peaceful solution.    2. The two sides have agreed that the commanders of the  Croatian Defense Council [HVO] and the Bosnia-Herzegovina army,  Generals Ante Roso and Rasim Delic, should meet within the next  seven days to outline in conrete terms an agreement on a total  cease-fire between the Bosnia-Herzegovina army and the HVO in  all battlefields as the first step to the solution of all issues  in the interest of the Croatian and Muslim peoples.    3. Both sides will speed up negotiations on an unconditional  exchange of all prisoners, particularly the Mostar group, and  cooperate in the search for missing persons.    4. Both sides agreed to continue their talks on all models  of  future Muslim-Croatian relations in Bosnia-Herzegovina and  future relations between the two countries and to respect the  agreements already finalized.    5. Agreement has been reached that, regardless of any future  solutions, the return of all refugees should be secured  following the restoration of peace.    6. Agreement has been reached that the talks should continue  and intensify.    Geneva, 10 February 1994.    This joint statement was signed by Haris Silajdzic, General  Ante Roso, and Mate Granic. The joint statement is a step  toward the solution of Muslim-Croatian relations as well as of  relations between the Republic of Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mate Granic said following the signing of  the joint statement. He maintains that the signed statement and  the letters sent by ambassadors of the Republic of Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina to the United Nations in New York are a basis  for appropriate action by the UN Security Council.    The plenary session began at 1800 in Geneva's Palace of  Nations where peace mediators Owen and Stoltenberg are talking  to the representatives of the three peoples of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is hard to say how long this session  will last because of the irreconcilable standpoints of the Serbs  and Muslims regarding the makeup of a commission which should  investigate the circumstances surrounding Saturday's massacre in  Sarajevo's marketplace. The Serbs insist on their own  representative taking part in the commission's work, something  that is being met with resolute disapproval from Muslims.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Iran to raise basic wage by 36% IRAN is raising its minimum wage by 36 per cent, Reuter reports from Nicosia. Iranian television, quoting a deputy labour minister, said the minimum daily wage would rise to 2,267 rials on March 21, the Iranian New Year. That would buy Dollars 1.60 at the officially set floating rate now used for many foreign transactions. But its purchasing power is still considerably greater for most of the items in a low income family budget. The Central Bank last estimate for inflation was 20.7 per cent up in 12 months.</p>

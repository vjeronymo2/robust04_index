China was fifth on the 1992 list of Japan's major trading  partners.    Japan-China trade in 1993 grew 30.9 percent from the  previous  year to 37,844 million dollars, renewing an annual record for  the third consecutive year, Jetro said.    Japan's trade with the U.S. last year totaled 160.5 billion  dollars.    Chinese statistics showed Japan was China's largest trading  partner last year, with two-way trade amounting to 39 billion  dollars, Jetro said.    Japan's 1993 exports to China surged 44.6 percent from the  previous year to 17,281 million dollars, Jetro said. Passenger  car exports increased 2.5 times and communications equipment  exports, including telephones, doubled.    Japan's imports from China advanced 21.3 percent to 20,563  million dollars. Apparel imports rose 30.0 percent and  vegetable imports surged 42.0 percent, due to poor crops in  Japan.    Jetro forecast Japan-China trade this year will surpass 40  billion dollars, with imports steadily increasing despite an  expected slowdown in exports due to China's import restraints.</p>

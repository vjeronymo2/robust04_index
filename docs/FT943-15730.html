			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (2): Five-tier rate system controversial - While cheaper premiums in growth areas may help some, struggling east German businesses will be hit by more expensive rates for countries of the former Soviet Union / German credit insurance Germany's export credit insurance system came of age on July 1 with the abandonment of a 50-year-old system of uniform premium rates. A five-tier system was introduced which effectively reduced the former standard premium by two-thirds for cover on deals with lowest-risk countries, and doubled it for companies doing business with the world's economic laggards. While the government saw the change as an occasion for celebration, industry and the opposition remained as resolutely glum as they had through more than two years of consultation. Certain media commentators were downright aggressive. One leading newspaper, for example, described the move as an insurance policy for the Bonn government paid for by exporters. East German politicians complained that because of the heavier premiums for deals with their manufacturers' traditional Russian and other east bloc countries, export credit insurance would now exclusively benefit west German companies. Bonn was insistent that the changes should go through. Germany was behind the times, it said, being the only major exporter to apply uniform tariffs. It also had international agreements to honour: subsidy rules in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade required export credit insurance schemes to be independent and self-supporting. The old system was increasingly failing to meet these criteria. At the same time, the Bonn administration was under strict orders from the Bundesbank to cut state spending wherever possible. Mounting deficits in the state-sponsored Hermes insurance programme, administered by the Allianz group, were a clear target. The federal budget subsidised the Hermes programme to the tune of a record DM5.1bn last year, and a further escalation to DM7.5bn (regardless of the impact of the new premiums) has already been earmarked for the current year. As Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, pointed out recently, DM4.5bn of the 1993 Hermes deficit was due to outstanding debts from the former Soviet Union. While he failed to mention that countries such as Russia and the Ukraine - still important outlets for east Germany's struggling industry - had been placed in the worst risk grade, he made much of cheaper premiums for other countries where west German exporters are hoping to find new growth. Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea are now in the top rank - 'countries without special risks'. For export credit insurance purposes, they are now on equal terms with large industrialised nations for which the services of Hermes play no role. Premiums on deals with China and the Czech Republic are reduced by a third. Mr Rexrodt insisted that higher premiums for Russia and former Soviet Union states offered no disadvantages to German exporters, since competing nations had long since been paying more for cover there. While the minister side-stepped the implications for east Germany, his ministry officials had earlier ridden rough-shod over protests. At a March meeting in the Baltic state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, regional leaders protested that Hermes operated exclusively on behalf of west German interests. A Hermes representative was able to demonstrate the charge as untrue with figures which at the same time starkly illustrated just how important the system was to the region's economy. While Hermes covered 6 per cent at most of all German exports, the proportion rose to 50 per cent in the former GDR. But Hans Birner from the federal economics ministry could offer nothing more than a repeat of Bonn's earlier urgings that east German industry should find new markets. Small and medium-sized companies especially should not place their faith in the eastern market, he said. Their chances lay in the west. Any companies still concentrating on the former Soviet Union should re-examine their strategies, he added. The opposition Social Democrats, meanwhile, have been drafting their economic strategies in preparation for the federal elections due in October. The party's leading economics spokesmen last month agreed that under a future SPD government subsidised financing should be made available for important foreign contracts, and that overseas development policy should be interlocked more closely with trade policy. None of the officials would expand on the 'interlocking' proposal - a delicate issue in the light of recent trade-and-aid developments elsewhere. Dieter Spori, economics minister in Baden-Wurttemberg, still irritated by the award of a South Korean high-speed rail contract to GEC-Alsthom instead of his local company, Siemens, said cheap financing was essential. It was not acceptable that German 'purism' should cost it opportunities. Export promotion should not end with Hermes credit insurance. German companies found it difficult to establish themselves in developing markets such as China, where US and French concerns had considerable help from subsidised finance and diplomatic support, Mr Spori claimed, turning a blind eye to evidence of clear progress. Some 400 Sino-German joint ventures are already established, and German exports to China last year rose 67 per cent to DM9.6bn. A recent survey of more than 700 companies by the Munich-based Ifo economics institute yielded 70 per cent of the sample asking for subsidised interest on loans for deals in new markets, while more than half rated the government's foreign trade policy as bad. Heinrich von Pierer, chairman of the Siemens group, was even to be heard grumbling during a trip around China late last year with Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Though German development aid contributed partially to an underground railway contract in Canton (announced during the visit) he let it be known that he and the rest of German industry expected more co-operation from government. He suggested that Mr Kohl should use his political weight to roll level the playing field within the European Union, and particular attention should to be paid to France. Mr von Pierer objected strongly to state-backed interest rate guarantees, where competitors such as the Anglo-French combine GEC-Alsthom, were able to tender for long-term engineering or infrastructural contracts with fixed rates in the knowledge that the French government would cover any difference when bills came to be paid. It remains to be seen whether the chancellor, current head of the council of ministers, who has pledged several joint EU initiatives with France, which takes over the council next January, is prepared to tackle the issue. But at least he has shown himself willing to support with his considerable personal presence a plethora of recent industry initiatives, advisory groups and commercial 'fishing trips', especially in south-east Asia. The government has also launched an 'Asia Initiative'. German ambassadors have been instructed that henceforth the promotion of and assistance to German business interests have equal ranking with their other tasks. The Asia Initiative also provides a talking shop to complement the networking efforts of industry's own newly-founded Asia-Pacific Committee. What is lacking, according to the Asia-Pacific Committee, is central guidance and co-ordination of diverse projects in which efforts are duplicated and which may threaten to irritate the most patient potential customers. Chancellor Kohl and Mr Rexrodt led separate business groups to the people's republic last year . . . and so did Hans Kasper, finance minister of Saarland, and Erwin Teufel, prime minister of Baden-Wurttemberg. His party, including more than 100 of his local business leaders, was touted at home as the biggest commercial delegation ever to visit China. The Bavarian government, not to be done down, recently took an impressive stand at a technology fair in Bangkok, in which the independent-minded state presented itself as 'the thirteenth-largest exporting nation' in the world.</p>

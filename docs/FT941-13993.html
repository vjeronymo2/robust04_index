			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: A workload that is overload Sir, May I add a footnote to Peter Bonfield's Personal View ('If I were a government minister . . .', January 19). Someone really ought to point out to the prime minister that very few successful chief executives in business operate with more than 10 direct reports. I believe the prime minister currently has around three times that number. Colin-Grant-Wilson, managing director, Lease Plan UK, Thames Side, Windsor, Berks SL4 1TY</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment: Nordic Countries (12): Beleaguered and disfigured - The banking system NORWAY'S beleaguered banks, disfigured by successive record annual losses, are glad to see the back of last year. But 1992 holds little promise for any big improvement. Last year, Norway was forced to virtually nationalise its banking system. Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank, respectively the second and third biggest banks, saw their share capital wiped out while Den norske Bank (DnB), the biggest, was barely saved from technical insolvency by a complex re-capitalisation bail-out orchestrated by the state. However, Mr Hermod Skaanland, governor of the central bank, issued a warning last month when he said that the crisis within the banking system would not be solved until the banks were in a position to raise capital in the private market on a commercial basis. 'The state's engagement (in the banking system) must be wound down as soon as possible,' Mr Skaanland said in his annual speech on the state of the domestic economy. In 1991, the Oslo bourse's bank sub-index saw prices plummet 79 per cent. After deregulation in the 1980s, which fuelled competition among the banks bordering on the extreme, they became prey to a euphoric expansion in the Norwegian economy and among themselves which has ended in dispiriting declines. According to the Norwegian Banks' Association, combined net losses by the commercial banks, its members, last year hit NKr15.882bn - a near four-fold increase from 1990 when they were NKr4.3bn. In 1989, losses were just NKr326m. Credit losses last year soared to NKr12.362bn, up from NKr8.221bn in 1990 and NKr7.407bn in 1989. But the picture is even worse if the savings banks and secondary finance institutions are taken into account. According to the Banking Insurance and Securities Commission (BISC), the country's finance watchdog, combined credit losses accelerated to NKr19.8bn in 1991, up from NKr12.3bn in 1990, while operating losses increased to beyond NKr17bn from NKr6.5bn in 1990. 'The problems within the banking system have seriously rocked the political establishment,' said Mr Arne Oeien, former Labour oil minister, who is now secretary-general of the Finance Ministry. Mr Oeien forms half of a dynamic duo - his partner is Mr Tormod Hermansen, chairman of the year-old state-backed Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) - responsible for designing last year's big bank rescue package and overseeing the state's new bank acquisitions. BIF was allocated state funds of NKr11bn in 1991 to help prop up the banks but the fund has been reduced to about NKr500m-NKr600m by calls made upon it. Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank have warned that they will need additional state appropriations if new capital adequacy rules are to be met by the end of the year. Christiania alone says it needs NKr2.5bn just to abide by the new rules which are based on the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) standards. Mr Oeien is more optimistic about the future of the banks than Mr Hermansen who believes that it will take the rest of this decade before the their health can be restored to allow profitability and growth which in turn can fuel private investor interest. 'Norway's banking industry is in a very deep crisis which has proven to be worse than feared and will last longer than what many people are willing to believe,' Mr Hermansen said recently. His pessimistic outlook is based in part on his forecast of a lack of solid growth within the Norwegian economy until the end of the 1990s and the necessity for a big restructuring of the banking industry which has yet to take off. Mr Oeien believes there is a good chance that further state appropriations to DnB may not be necessary in 1992. Last year, Norway's taxpayers and the bank's own security funds coughed up close to NKr20bn to prop up the ailing banks through subsidised loans and state cash transfers. Christiania Bank, which the government had sought to sell, but failed, required NKr7.864bn alone. Fokus and DnB also had massive support. It still remains unclear if the ownership of Christiania Bank will remain in Norwegian hands. Clouds over the bank seem darker than those over Fokus and DnB. The government is determined to keep DnB out of complete control of the state although its ownership in the bank is already pushing 80 per cent. 'For DnB and for Norway it is important to keep at least part of the bank's ownership in private hands,' says Mr Hermansen. 'For Christiania the losses were so high that there was virtually nothing left of the bank. . . it was just too far gone to allow a symbolic value to be retained. . . but I will admit that we were surprised over the size of DnB's 1991 losses,' he said. For Fokus Bank there are some positive signs: the bank's leadership has adopted a realistic strategy and reorganisation, according to Mr Hermansen, in which an association of banks have been established where each bank is responsible for its performance. However, Mr Hermansen and Mr Oeien both believe that DnB and Christiania need to do more to improve efficiency, cut costs and boost profitability. But the banks' future development will hinge greatly on the development of the domestic economy. Unemployment, including those on government training schemes, is at a post-war record high of nearly 9 per cent, while corporate and private bankruptcies continue to swell to new record levels. Wage levels are far above those of Norway's trading partners and export industries have been hard hit by the international recession. One thing is certain; Norway's banking industry in the year 2000 will be quite different than what it is today and Mr Hermansen intends to play a leading role in shaping its new structure. But at this point, not even a whisper can be heard about the timing of re-privatisation of Norway's banking system.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Maritime region's administration has no right to  authorize the dumping of radioactive liquid into the Sea of  Japan since only Russia's government is entitled to make such a  decision. This was told to Interfax by Nikolay Shapovalenko, the  head of the atomic supervision committee's department for  overseeing radiation safety at defence facilities.    The Chairman of the Maritime Region's Committee for Natural  Resources Evgeniy Stomatyuk announced in Vladivostok on Thursday  that next week the local administration may adopt a decision on  the dumping of radioactive waste because the Pacific Fleet's  TNT-5 and TNT-27 waste storage vessels were in dangerous  condition.    According to Shapovalenko, Russia abstained from signing an  amendment to the International Convention on Waste Utilization,  which completely prohibits the dumping of any radioactive waste.    "Thereby, Russia reserved the right to decide on radiation  safety issues in handling waste as it finds fit for its national  interests," Shaposhnikov said and stressed that "no local leader  is authorized to allow the dumping of radioactive pollutants."    He reported that the government had approved a plan for  putting a nuclear waste processing plant into operation within  three months. However, he declined to say when the project would  start to be implemented since the government had not decided who  would fund it.    His organization believes that the Maritime Region's  Governor  Evgeniy Nazdratenko favors a Japanese waste processing facility  and rejects for some reasons "the actually existing and  effective blue-prints designed by various organizations in the  Far East and elsewhere."    According to the nuclear supervision committee, the Japanese  nuclear waste purification technology is far better than the  Russian project. "If Japan's offer is accepted, an electric  station will have to be build next to the waste processing  plant," Shapovalenko said.    Meanwhile, as a senior Russian navy officer told Interfax  the  situation with the storage of radioactive contaminants in the  Far East "is appalling and calls for urgent measures." "If the  local environmental protection agency approves the regional  administration's decision, theoretically I admit the possibility  of nuclear waste dumping into the Sea of Japan," he said.    In his opinion, the local authorities "simply have to act in  such a manner since the government fails to allocate any  resources to solve the problem of storing radioactive  pollutants."</p>

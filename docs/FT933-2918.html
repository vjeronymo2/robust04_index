			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Lamont delivers attack on Major's leadership: Ex-chancellor backs rightwing opposition to tax rises MR NORMAN LAMONT, the former chancellor, yesterday delivered a wide-ranging attack on government policy, calculated to weaken Mr John Major's hold on Downing Street. Mr Lamont, who was sacked by Mr Major in May, challenged the prime minister to rule out British participation in European monetary union, endorsed rightwing opposition to tax increases, and questioned in scarcely coded language Mr Major's leadership. He said Britain's ignominious withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism a year ago today had accelerated economic recovery. But, writing in The Sun, he warned: 'Instead of talking about tax increases, the government should be looking at spending cuts.' He added: 'Given the right leadership, the British people could equal the best in the world.' Mr Lamont's intervention will encourage rightwing Conservative critics of Mr Major, and could help trigger a leadership challenge this year. Mrs Teresa Gorman, a consistent critic, said a challenger might emerge in November unless Mr Major mobilises support at next month's party conference. Mrs Gorman said Conservative MPs 'must not get bogged down with the idea that this is an honest man, and therefore impregnable'. In his Sun article, Mr Lamont warns that, 'unbelievably', plans for monetary union are being revived by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. 'Fortunately, there is now no ERM for us to rejoin, and there is not likely to be for some time. What better time for the prime minister to stand up and say once and for all that Britain should never again have anything to do with a single currency,' he says. Mr Lamont urges Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to bow to rightwing calls to re-open cabinet talks on next year's public spending and drop his insistence that tax increases remain an option in the November Budget. In an article in The Times, also published today, Mr Lamont says he considered resigning when Britain was forced out of the ERM, but was dissuaded by Mr Major. 'Had I known he would change his mind as he did, I would have done so,' he says. Mr Lamont says the withdrawal was 'a humiliation for the government, the prime minister and myself'. But he says the government's desire to be 'at the heart of Europe' was an obstacle to voluntary withdrawal.</p>

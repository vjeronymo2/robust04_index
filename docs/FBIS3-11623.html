Mr. President, we hear you.    [De Leon] With great consternation, I wish to voice, on  behalf of the people and Government of Guatemala, that the  tragic death of Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, presidential  candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] of  Mexico, has filled me with consternation, because of the loss of  an outstanding and important statesman for the democratic  development of a sister country and also because I had  friendship ties with him that were strengthened when he visited  us as senator and president of the Permanent Conference of Latin  American Political Parties.    I wish to tell you that on that occasion, when I had the  privilege of talking to him, we identified with our respective  projects, he as political leader, and I as human rights  ombudsman. Recently, he sent me a political envoy to advise me  that in his program he would include the strengthening of  relations between our countries, because he believed that  geographical neighborhoods should be the object of broad and  constructive cooperation.    I think that the Mexican people are astonished, from what I  have seen on television, at a crime that is condemnable from  every standpoint, but the Mexican people, I think, have solid  and firm institutions that are capable of overcoming  unreasonable acts of violence that have been occurring  everywhere in the world. In this case, they have been happening  in Mexico since 1 January to the detriment of the Mexican people.    The answer to provocations is within the framework of a  legal  regime, and, I think, it is based on the permanent inclination  to ensure that justice is served, as has always been the case in  the Mexican nation.    The political message of Colosio gains greater strength and  I  think that it has become more legitimate and pure, and stands as  an example for all world democratic sectors. I sent my personal  message to President Salinas de Gortari, with whom I met  recently during a state visit, an official visit in Mexico. I  expressed my solidarity with him in this time of mourning.    I told him that Guatemalans view him as a serene leader, and  thus, we trust that despite the pain of this drama, he will, as  well as the Mexicans, be able to overcome such as regrettable  and condemnable incident, such as the one that transpired on the  evening of 23 March.    I also addressed, via our diplomatic mission in Mexico, the  esteemed family of the illustrious missing one to voice my  sorrow and the sorrow of my family, government, and Guatemalan  people. I urged them to be strong in view of this regrettable  incident and to have faith in God to win comfort. I said that  the notable social and political accomplishments should be the  best homage to his memory.    As for the PRI and the other legal and democratic political  forces of Mexico, I take advantage of this opportunity to voice  our trust that as neighbors and brothers we will preserve peace  with democracy and justice. We hope that the death of a just  person will move us to reflection to pay homage to him by making  his wishes come true.    I thank you for the opportunity you have given me to express  the deep sorrow that overtakes me this evening, because of the  loss of a Mexican patriot, and because, in one way or another,  this event constitutes a shakeup and commotion among a people,  who in contrast to ours, is not used to this kind of violent  act. I regret this profoundly, from a human standpoint, because  the most precious thing to a human being is his live, and in  this case it was taken away from Colosio.    In my role as president of Guatemala, however, I lament this  and express my sorrow to the Mexican people, who in the end are  suffering consequences and it is unfair for them to suffer. We  regret the events that have occurred since 1 January and events  on the evening of 23 March, because we, the Guatemalan people,  have suffered for so many years these kinds of violent acts,  which lead nowhere.    As I said earlier, I expressed my sorrow to his family, to  President Salinas de Gortari, but I especially extend my  condolences to the Mexican people, whom I urge to be as strong  and firm as possible to preserve democracy with justice, and  above all, to ensure trust in its democratic institutions that  for so many years have been an example for Latin America.    [Zabludovsky] Thank you very much, Mr. President.    [De Leon] Thank you very much. I reiterate my condolences to  all the people of Mexico.</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Sega TV channel looks to Europe Sega Channel, the computer games channel due to launch in the US in the spring, is considering a move into Europe, starting with the UK in 1995. The channel, owned by the games manufacturer Sega of Japan, Time Warner and TCI, the American cable operator, has been talking to cable and satellite television operators across Europe, according to New Media Markets, the Financial Times newsletter. The channel is expected to launch on cable first although the company has also been talking to British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite broadcaster in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake. The UK is Sega's main priority because of the estimated installed base of 1.4m Megadrive games consoles. Through a decoder owners of consoles will be able to get access to a range of games, including previews of new games. The games company hopes the channel will both stimulate the sale of consoles and games cartridges and at the same time create an additional stream of revenue.</p>

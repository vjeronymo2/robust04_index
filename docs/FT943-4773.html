			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: CRH continues strong growth with 60% rise Pre-tax profits at CRH continued their strong growth in the six months to June 30 advancing 60 per cent from IPounds 25.1m to IPounds 40.1m (Pounds 39.7m) on turnover up 12 per cent at IPounds 725.7m, against IPounds 647.3m. The Dublin-based construction and building materials group said an increase in construction activity in the company's core market in the Irish Republic, compared with a depressed first half of 1993, had contributed to the growth. They were further helped by improvements in the UK and increased contributions from two US associates in the tempered glass and masonry industries. Mr Tony Barry, chief executive, expected more moderate growth in the second half, but said 'we do expect a good improvement in the results for the year as a whole'. There was net interest receivable of IPounds 129,000, against charges of IPounds 2.77m, reflecting the benefits of last year's rights issue and strong cash flow. The period end debt:equity ratio was 19.6 per cent. Mr Jack Hayes, managing director for finance and development, said that by the end of the year the group would have IPounds 100m in cash for acquisitions, which could be enhanced by borrowing up to IPounds 200m. Earnings per share rose 37 per cent to 9.26p (6.77p), and the interim dividend is raised to 2.5p (2.27p). Dublin analysts anticipate full-year profits of between IPounds 110m and IPounds 115m for earnings of 25p-27p per share, giving a prospective p/e of about 15.</p>

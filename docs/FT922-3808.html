			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Observer: Better PR Move over Body Shop, make way for Betterware. The door-to-door seller of household goods is the latest household name to climb onto the corporate environmental bandwagon. If you want a biodegradable mildew cleaner or a non-rain forest brush handle, Betterware knows where to find them. It has also committed itself to plant a tree for every one cut down to make the paper for its 13m catalogues. That works out at 8,000 a year. Betterware proudly boasts that its trees will grow in 'a managed forest' in Sweden, where its paper comes from. 'It's all part of the deal for paper purchasing,' says chief executive Andrew Cohen. True. But it was the Swedes who thought up the idea not Betterware.</p>

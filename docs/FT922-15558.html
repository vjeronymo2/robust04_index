			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Unbowed Cresson on point of resignation PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand yesterday declined to announce the widely-expected resignation of Mrs Edith Cresson as prime minister and the formation of a new government. Mr Mitterrand interrupted a busy ceremonial schedule to hold a series of meetings with ministers and close political advisers. In between the inauguration of an exhibition of Viking art, a lunch for Queen Margreth of Denmark, and a meeting of the High Council of the Francophone countries, the President met Mrs Cresson, after which the prime minister flew off to open the Hanover trade fair. French commentators are unanimous that he has no option but to replace Mrs Cresson, after the Socialist Party's big defeats in the regional and departmental elections on the past two Sundays. But they also agree that the choice of a successor is critical, since Mr Mitterrand could not change his prime minister again before the general elections a little over a year from now. Whoever takes over now, therefore, must be able to sustain confidence in the government, and if possible restore a degree of popularity. One of the few candidates capable of such a feat might be Mr Jacques Delors, President of the European Commission, who is immensely popular in France. But his spokesman made clear on Monday that he was committed by his present responsibilities until the end of this year, and therefore not available. The most noted visitor to the Elysee Palace yesterday was Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the finance minister, who is commonly tipped as favourite to succeed Mrs Cresson. As if to advertise the success of his economic policy and his qualifications for promotion, Mr Beregovoy yesterday issued optimistic new economic forecasts to the effect that the French economy would grow by 2 per cent this year, and by 2.6 per cent next year. This, he said, would be 0.3 percentage points higher than the European average for both these years. President Mitterrand also received Mr Roland Dumas, foreign minister and one of the President's oldest associates, Mr Laurent Fabius, Socialist party leader, and Mr Pierre Mauroy, his predecessor as party leader. Meanwhile, the full ramifications of the defeat suffered by the Socialist party in the regional elections ten days ago, are becoming more and more apparent. In the northern region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais, the Socialists' historic fortress and one of only two regions where it previously had a governing majority, the Socialist party was forced to concede the council leadership to a member of the Green ecological party, as the only way to keep out the conservatives. An important factor was the proportional representation voting system which ensured that the new councils would be split between many different parties, and therefore difficult to govern. In many cases it has proved difficult to put together governing majorities, except through devious and opportunistic political deals which are unlikely to provide stability. Mr Brice Lalonde, the Environment Minister and leader of the Generation Ecologie Party, said yesterday he was so disgusted by the manoeuvring that he would not join the next Socialist government. In Nord-Pas-de-Calais Mrs Marie-Christine Blandin became the first woman and the first ecologist to head a regional council; but since her Green party group only musters eight members, compared with the 27 Socialists and 15 Communists who also voted for her, it is difficult to see how she can stay on top.</p>

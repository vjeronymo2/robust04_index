			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Fabio Barbieri report: "Roberto Maroni Considers Accord </F> Victory for League But Speroni Skeptical, Still `Uncertain'"]    [Text] Milan -- "We are very pleased." This was the  comment from Roberto Maroni, the Northern League's number two,  who is certain to be the next deputy prime minister and very  likely to be the next justice minister. "We are pleased," he  added, "because we have achieved everything that we decided at  Pontida [League rally venue] to demand. Our representation in  the government team will be strong, concrete, and consistent  with our fundamental pledges, namely, federalism and economic  liberalism. Certain difficulties will still have to be  overcome, but we are confident that the prime minister-designate  will find the best solution among those that have been agreed.  The government formation process is therefore almost over."    Francesco Speroni, leader of the League's Senate caucus, is  of a very different, indeed the opposite, opinion. He said:  "Nothing is clear any more. I think that everything is being  called into question again. In that case, how can we know  whether or not we are pleased? I can see the strangest things  happening. I hope that there is not some kind of trick  concealed behind them. It seems to me that the only real  problem was the Interior Ministry: [Judge] Di Pietro's refusal  calls the entire agreement into question. I cannot say whether,  and, if so, when, the government will be formed. Berlusconi  wanted to be the magician; now it is up to him to pull the  rabbit out of the hat. So for the present I am adopting a  wait-and-see stance and I can't hide my concerns."    Roberto Maroni was at his home in Varese, after a long night  which ended with his go-ahead to Berlusconi. His remarks gave  no hint of enthusiasm; they merely hinted at the realization  that whatever needed to be done has been done.  <H5>  Political Balance </H5>   He added: "Our position can be judged in two ways: either  as a sense of responsibility with regard to the country, or as  some kind of surrender, an attitude of submission. Of course, I  identify with the former assessment and I consider the latter  totally short-sighted. I stress that, irrespective of the  Interior Ministry, we can feel pleased." Maroni was reserved in  his assessment of the government: "Berlusconi has to choose  among several overlapping possibilities. It is like a jigsaw  puzzle. Whichever of them is chosen, they all guarantee our  position." Bossi's deputy rejected as groundless the assertion  that the League will be "scaled down": "One Christian Democrat  told me that our influence is less than that envisaged by the  Cencelli manual [the rules of spoils system]. If he says so, it  is doubtless true. But that pleases me: It shows indisputably  that our rationale was the exact opposite of that of the parties  of the old regime, and it confirms the correctness of what has  always been our approach -- that is, to join the government in  order to carry out a program clearly, not merely for the purpose  of gaining power. We did not want any `business' ministries.  We will not discuss the relative importance of individual  ministries, those with or without a portfolio. Our commitment  is a political one. The League wants institutional reform, it  wants the birth of local government, it wants federalism. And  it wants a system of economic liberalism that will put  privatization at the top of the agenda."    Maroni said absolutely nothing about the division of the  ministries among the parties and about the people that will be  appointed to them: "Primary and secondary possibilities have  been put forward. Names have been put forward, and we have  pledged not to name them."  <H5>  A Plain `No Comment' </H5>   This reserve was not broken even by rumors such as those  that  emerged following Di Pietro's refusal, according to which  magistrates Piercamillo Davigo or Francesco Di Maggio will be  interior minister. There was a plain "no comment" with regard  to the possibility of Lamberto Dini's becoming treasury  minister. And what about the Justice Ministry? Maroni said:  "I am flattered and pleased by the fact that my name has been  mentioned in connection with this important position. I have  stated my willingness: The final decision lies with the prime  minister-designate." The League's second-in-command had few  doubts about the time scale: "If Berlusconi works Sunday, too,  the list of ministers could be ready as early as Monday  afternoon [9 May], Tuesday at the latest. We are on vacation  now. The prime minister-designate has all the means available  to complete the process."    Then the list will be assessed by the alliance partners:  "The choices," Maroni said, "will be made from among the  approved options so there will be no surprises. Apart from the  fact that the Constitution so requires, it is normal for the  head of the government to have the last word, in other words,  for him to choose -- from among those indicated and who have  been approved -- the individuals with whom he believes he can  work best, who have most affinity with him. I am very  confident; the government will be formed."    So is there no anxiety about the rumors that Berlusconi  intends to postpone the presentation of his cabinet by a few  days? "I repeat," Maroni concluded, "that the prime  minister-designate has all he needs in order to form the  government, and if he postpones it by a few days, it means that  he is taking a little time to reach the best solution."</p>

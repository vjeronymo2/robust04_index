			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FOR KRETZSCHMAR, SERRA FOOTBALL IS MORE THAN GAME  </P> <P> Angie was a name spoken hundreds of times in Gardena on Friday night as Serra  High celebrated its 40th homecoming with a Camino Real League football game  against St. Monica.  </P> <P> Angela Maria Kretzschmar, a fixture at the all-boys Catholic school for 39  years, is "our biggest fan" according to Athletic Director Michael Falco. A  short and motherly figure, Angie watches the games from a lawn chair at the  30-yard line, where she is often dwarfed by huge red, white and blue-uniformed  players.  </P> <P> At 75, she has slowed a bit in the past few years, attending fewer events, but  she is a regular figure at most of the school's varsity athletic contests,  especially the football games.  </P> <P> "These are my boys," she said.  </P> <P> A resident of Hawthorne, Angie has been on a first-name basis with most  everyone associated with Serra since 1951, when the first of her three sons  attended the high school.  </P> <P> "No one remembers Kretzschmar," she said.  </P> <P> She greets spectators as they enter the stadium prior to home games. When  former students and players pass through the gates, they get a big hug.  </P> <P> "What are you up to these days?" she will ask. "Are you taking care of yourself  dear?"  </P> <P> Angie will accept nothing but a straight answer.  </P> <P> "Young people are looking for somebody to give a darn," she said. "There just  isn't enough of that going on today."  </P> <P> Angie gives a darn, and a lot more. Each year she contributes $2,000 toward  athletic equipment and scholarships.  </P> <P> But she is best known for her patronage on the sidelines, where she mingles  with players and offers encouragement. It is tradition for her to pass out gum  after the team's first score.  </P> <P> "No certain brand, mind you," she said. "Especially now, I give them sugarless.  They must take care of their teeth."  </P> <P> She also attends football practices daily.  </P> <P> "Except Wednesdays," she said. "That's when I go dancing."  </P> <P> She has been known to watch game films with coaches and give pep talks before  games.  </P> <P> "However, Angie never tells the coach what to do," she said. "That's a no-no."  </P> <P> She has touched the lives of many athletes at Serra, and at times she has been  rewarded. When the football team won the Southern Section Division VII title  last year, the players bought Angie a pendant that resembles the championship  rings they received.  </P> <P> Born in New York City to Italian immigrants, Angie moved to Los Angeles when  she was 7. She met her husband, Raymond, at a dance. They married in 1936 and  eventually moved to Hawthorne. They had a daughter, Raemonda, and sons, Frank,  John and Bernie, all of whom graduated from Serra in the 1950s. Raymond died in  1981. Frank remains close to the school as the president of its Alumni Assn.  </P> <P> Angie has become the link between different generations of what Frank  Kretzschmar calls "the Serra man," someone who is "a well-rounded person with  the ability to work well with people."  </P> <P> Said Principal James E. Crowell: "Twenty-five years ago, when I was a student  at Serra, there was Angie. Fifteen years ago, when I returned here as a  teacher, there was Angie. Today, there still is Angie."  </P> <P> A lot has changed in that time. In the 1950s, Serra was all white and all  Catholic. Today the student body is only 65% Catholic and most of the 300  students are minorities. A year from now, when the school begins accepting  girls for the first time, enrollment is expected to jump considerably.  </P> <P> "We went from being an all-white school to an all-black school and now to a  school that is 50% black, 40% Latino and 10% white and others," Angie said.  </P> <P> As for the change in the school's ethnic makeup, Angie said: "This is the best  place to learn how to get along with people of other races. So when the kids  get out of here and experience mixed races, they know what to do and how to  act. It's no big deal to them."  </P> <P> Tuition is $1,740 for Catholics and $300 more for non-Catholics. With so much  money at stake, Angie said, it is imperative that Serra students respect the  school. The campus is graffiti-free, she pointed out because "tomfoolery isn't  tolerated."  </P> <P> "Our kids know what is expected of them," she said. "They know that if they  make a mistake they're out (of school)."  </P> <P> That's what makes Serra unique from other educational settings, Crowell and  Angie said.  </P> <P> "We foster a family spirit here," Crowell said. "As the school population has  changed, Angie has become an example of our extended family."  </P> <P> Serra, which has won 18 consecutive games and is ranked No. 1 in Division VII,  played a sloppy, penalty-ridden first half two weeks ago before defeating  visiting Inglewood, 42-6. Serra took a 22-6 halftime lead, but Angie wasn't  impressed.  </P> <P> "We look crummy," she said. "I don't want to be in the locker room at  halftime."  </P> <P> Angie was on the field to help "my players" when they needed her. When  defensive end Twan Hall was ejected from the game for punching an opponent in  the first series, Angie took him by the arm.  </P> <P> "I didn't punch the dude," Hall said.  </P> <P> "Easy, honey. Easy," Angie said. "Calm down. It will be all right."  </P> <P> She encouraged the team to play better. Then, when Jerald Henry scored on a  six-yard sweep with 5:11 left in the first quarter, she said, "Shall we pass  out the gum now?"  </P> <P> Off she went down the sidelines, handing out the bounty. Coach Leo Hand took a  stick and popped it into his mouth. He glanced back at Angie, surrounded by  football players.  </P> <P> The scene was repeated last night, and will be repeated time and time again for  years to come.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, February 16 (TANJUG) -- The ceasefire  agreement for the region of Sarajevo, reached by the Bosnian  Serbs and Moslems, is being mostly respected apart from sporadic  violations by the Moslem side, Bosnian Serb army sources said on  Wednesday. Small arms and sniper fire was opened from Moslem  positions on Serb parts of the city, primarily on the suburbs of  Grbavica and Ilijas, the Belgrade Street and the Ilidza  Hospital, the sources said.    They pointed out the fact that the Moslem side is digging  trenches and building bunkers and other kinds of shelter.    Officials of the United Nations Protection Forces UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Force] have over the past few days confirmed that  the Moslem side was using the truce and the withdrawal of the  Serb artillery to advance closer to the Bosnian Serb defence  lines and dig up trenches there. The Serb side has asked  UNPROFOR to prevent such activity of the Moslem forces.    In other parts of the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-  Herzegovina, the Moslem forces continued provocations against  the Serb side. In the areas of Doboj, Teslic, Gradacac and  Ozren in northern Bosnia, the Moslem forces opened fire on Serb  positions from mortars and small arms and the situation was  similar in the regions of Olovo and Kladanj in north-eastern  Bosnia.    Moslem small arms attacks were more serious in the area of  Brcko in the Sava River valley in northern Bosnia and the Moslem  forces were especially active on the Tesliv front, where its  infantry was launching attacks backed by strong mortar fire.    Croatian radio quoted Bosnian Croat sources as saying that  there was no large-scale fighting between Bosnian Croats and  Moslems on Wednesday.    In the area of Kiseljak in central Bosnia, a Moslem  terrorist  group attempted to make a break-through while in the Kiseljak-  Fojnica region and the area of Zavidovici re-grouping and  movement of Moslem troops was observed, the radio said.</p>

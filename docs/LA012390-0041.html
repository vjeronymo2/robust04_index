			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GRANDMOTHERLY WOMAN, 81, ACCUSED OF SWINDLE  </P> <P> A grandmotherly 81-year-old Van Nuys woman who was convicted six years ago of  attempting to swindle then-President Ronald Reagan is now charged with stealing  a portion of an elderly neighbor's life savings.  </P> <P> Ann Roberts, described by a prosecutor as looking "like anybody's grandmother,"  has a record of forgery convictions dating back to 1940, prosecutors said. She  faces a preliminary hearing Feb. 9 on charges of grand theft.  </P> <P> Roberts is accused of bilking Mildred Hendricks, 74, out of $2,000 last June  with tearful claims that she needed money to buy a headstone for a recently  deceased aunt, Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrew W. Diamond said.  </P> <P> Hendricks told Los Angeles police that Roberts claimed she was worth $13  million and would repay the money and an additional $1,000 as soon as funds  became available, Diamond said.  </P> <P> Hendricks called police after the $3,000 check Roberts wrote her in repayment  for the loan bounced, Diamond said.  </P> <P> "You walk by her on the street and she looks just like anybody's grandmother,"  Diamond said. "She has a criminal record going back a half a century" for  theft, embezzlement and fraud.  </P> <P> Roberts has pleaded not guilty to the charges. "I didn't do anything," she said  in a telephone interview. "When I get to court I will prove that everything is  a lie. I'm a nice, honest lady and if you met me, you'd say the same thing."  </P> <P> Roberts' attorney, Philip Nameth, said the case should be handled in civil  court. "But for the fact she was involved in the Reagan case, this matter would  not be filed as a criminal offense," Nameth said.  </P> <P> Roberts and her husband, James Yarborough, were convicted six years ago of  opening escrow on Reagan's former residence in Pacific Palisades with a phony,  postdated cashier's check and other documents to make it appear they were  multimillionaires. She used the name Ann Yarborough at the time.  </P> <P> She also pleaded guilty to swindling two banks, a dentist and her maid and  chauffeur out of more than $350,000, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Adalbert T.  Botello.  </P> <P> Roberts used fake court orders indicating that she would inherit large sums of  money from her late ex-husband and doctored financial statements and money  orders to persuade people to make temporary loans, Botello said.  </P> <P> She was sentenced to three years and four months in prison and her husband, who  prosecutors said was a follower in the scheme, received three years probation.  </P> <P> "I think her age and gender made it easier for her to steal from people,"  Botello said. "People want to believe an elderly woman who fits the image of  their grandmother."  </P></p>

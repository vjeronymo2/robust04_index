			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Chinese Ambassador to Japan  Xu Dunxin renewed China's stance Friday that it wants to solve  through dialogue and negotiations an international row over  North Korea's suspected nuclear development, Foreign Ministry  officials said.    Xu reiterated the Chinese stance in a meeting over lunch  with  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, who will visit Beijing on  Sunday, the officials said. The ambassador told Kakizawa that  China's basic position is that it supports the denuclearization  of the Korean peninsula and considers peace and stability in  Northeast Asia as important. Beijing has been making efforts to  solve the problem and will continue to do so, Xu was quoted as  saying.    Kakizawa told the Chinese ambassador that Japan and China  share the perception that a peaceful solution to the problem is  important but that the situation is becoming grave. The foreign  minister called on China to exercise influence on North Korea.  Kakizawa also told Xu he wants to engage in frank discussions  on the North Korean situation with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian  Qichen.</p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Sport: Conceived on a rainy day in Birmingham - Cricket / The England Amateurs tell Teresa McLean that they are no Gentlemen THE inspiration came during a rainy afternoon at Edgbaston. Not one of the Test Match wash-outs we have just had there, but four years ago. Frank Elliott was watching the rain and talking to some friends about the hardships of English cricket. Out of the blue, or strictly speaking out of the drizzling grey, he had the idea that they should found an English amateur team. His friends agreed and, he said with a shrug: 'Things got going.' Things connected with the English Amateur XI are blessed with insouciance, as one might hope of a side that does not play cricket for money. But they also show a strong sense of realism, as one might expect of a side conceived on a dismal day at Edgbaston and kept alive in the face of powerful professional pressures. The English Amateur XI are not the country's amateurs of old, the Gentlemen who played an annual game against the Players, professional cricketers, from 1806 until 1962, when the distinction between Gentlemen and Players was deemed out of date and undesirable. The new Amateurs do not want to be the new Gentlemen. 'We're not like that at all. We wouldn't like to be. There is no class or anything of that sort in our game. Our purpose is to give people a chance to play cricket for their country.' The Amateurs' manager, Terry Bates, speaks with weary passion, with the voice of one who is used to not being taken seriously. He knew his team would lose their recent match against Pakistan, as indeed they did, by an innings and 16 runs. But he also knew that the game was the team's greatest honour in the three years it has been playing. The players knew it too. To a man they declared themselves thrilled to have been chosen to play against the tourists, whatever the result. One of them, a slender Australian called Paul Roshier, with pale skin carpeted in black hair, only reflected for a fleeting moment before telling me that the best memory of his cricketing life was getting the wicket of Inzamam-ul-Haq the day before. By then, Inzamam had made 102 out of the Pakistanis' opulent first day total of 332 for 3 declared. Roshier is a fine cricketer. A few years ago he was on the verge of a career in professional cricket and a place in the Australian Test team. Yet he chose as his pride and joy this one wicket, taken in a two-day game in Luton, in muggy weather, in front of a crowd consisting almost entirely of Pakistanis tirelessly chanting and invading the pitch, as their heroes swanned along towards victory. Why? As an Amateur he plays for pleasure. And, all games at this high level, however one-sided, are exhilarating. Inzamam is a spectacular scalp, even in Luton. This is the first year the Amateurs have secured a fixture in the tourists' hectic schedule and doubtless they will ensure it is a regular fixture. It puts them up a rank. The Pakistanis did not play patronisingly. Free of strain, they seemed to welcome the opportunity to try out Waqar Younis nice and gently before the Test matches started. Waqar took a wicket with his first ball on the second day, keeping the Amateurs' fatal first innings collapse going, from 117 for 0 to 174 all out. That style of scoring suits the Amateurs. One feature they have inherited from the Gentlemen is the swashbuckling tendency to produce one or two stars in each game, but they lack the cohesion to give them winning support. They do not make a thorough team because they do not have the time to be thorough. Practice time, like playing time, has to be taken out of the players' annual leave from work. They are impressive, experienced cricketers whose only training time together each year is a long week-end in Lilleshall. Almost all the Amateurs play for Minor Counties, County Associations or County Leagues. Steve Dean (Staffordshire) and Malcolm Roberts (Buckinghamshire and the Surrey League), who opened the batting at Luton with 80 and 45 respectively, are good examples. Several Amateurs could have been professional cricketers but chose not to be, for personal, family or job reasons. Mel, brother of Nasser Hussain, of Essex and England, and Neil, brother of Bruce French, the Nottinghamshire and England wicket keeper, are among a number who have cricket in the family. When you meet the Amateurs, one of the most powerful impressions you get is that you are meeting the members of a small, cricketing brotherhood. It is an exceptionally friendly one, only too happy to share its story. Although team spirit has to look after itself, a vivid sense of identity is an Amateur speciality, even with only a short, erratic fixture list like this season's: the big game at Luton then, more than six weeks later, two away games in two days against Ireland, then two weeks later two away games in two days against Scotland. Next year the National Cricket Association, which gives the Amateurs the money, facilities and coaching they need to survive, is expanding this home international circuit to include Wales and giving it a proper title: The Triple Crown. Possibly, just possibly, another year or two may see the Amateurs taking on the Dutch, the Danes or any other talented Europeans. The players prefer not to look further ahead than the end of whatever game they are playing. Nick Folland, their captain, put it neatly: 'One at a time is plenty.' He looks like a magazine advert for a cricketer: tall, sunburnt and healthy, born to wear whites. He is a teacher at Blundell's School in Devon where, officially, he teaches geography but, unofficially, helps with cricket. A school with a proud cricketing tradition, Blundell's is generous with the amount of time it gives him to play. In return, Folland speaks enthusiastically of the school, is a distinguished, enterprising captain of Devon and, when he gets a chance to play for England, as on the fading grass of inner Luton, bats with aplomb. In the second innings, seeing Waqar loosening up and the Amateur wickets falling apace, he knew there was no point holding back and scored an increasingly cavalier 76. It included an almost straight six, which landed next to the small, wooden pavilion where his team-mates sat on the grass, awaiting defeat, cheering his innings. When he was out, caught behind, Folland walked without waiting for the umpire's decision.</p>

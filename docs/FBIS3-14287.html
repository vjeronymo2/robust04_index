			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Maryam M. Shahin] </F>   [Text] Amman--A group of prominent businessmen on Wednesday  [23 March] officially launched a $200 million holding company to  invest in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Kamal  al-Sha'ir, a Jordanian businessman, was elected chairman of the  company's 16- member board of directors.    The Palestine Development and Investment Incorporated (PDII)  is the first major Arab-led commercial enterprise to be launched  since the Sept. 13 signing of the autonomy accord between Israel  and the PLO.    "This is a historic day for the economic and developmental  future of the occupied territories," said Ahmad Quray', head of  the Economic Department of the Palestine Liberation Organization  (PLO), addressing the audience at a ceremony launching PDII at  the Amman Chamber of Industry.    The ceremony, followed by the election of the board of  directors, was attended by many of the 141 investors who  constitute the financial backbone of much of the Palestinian  community in the diaspora. They include Arab Bank Chairman  'Abd-al-Hamid Shuman, Hasib al-Sabbagh, Sa'id Khuri, Munib  al-Masri, Ramzi Dallul, and 'Abd-al-Muhsin Qattan.    Several leaders of the Jordanian business community such as  Khalil al-Talhuni, Kamal al-Sha'ir, and Khaldun Abu-Hassan and  Jordanian banks such as the Cairo Amman Bank and the Housing  Bank are also founding members of the PDII.    The opening was attended by Minister of Information Jawad  al-'Anani and Palestinian Ambassador to Jordan al-Tayyib  'Abd-al-Rahim as well as Jerusalem-based Palestinian leader and  leading peace negotiator Faysal al-Husayni.    "We, in the occupied territories, welcome the venture with  open arms," Mr. Husayni told the press. He stressed that in  view of the economic difficulties and restraints faced by the  people in the occupied territories, "all help is welcome."    Mr. Quray', one of the Palestinian architects behind the  Oslo  peace accord, said: "Our information indicates that at least 50  per cent of the people in the occupied territories are  unemployed; investment in housing and industries will change  that."    "We have estimated that we need to build 185,000 housing  units in the occupied territories," he added.    The founding members, who have thus far contributed just  over  half of the capital, or $100 million, say they hope to raise  another $100 million.    "In another six to eight months the number of founding  investors could reach up to 300 or more and the capital  investment would grow to $200 million," said company spokesman  Raja'i al-Masri.    "This is the first major initiative of its kind by the  Palestinian private sector in the economic development of the  occupied territories," said Mr. Quray'.    The company was registered in Liberia as an off-shore  share-holding firm in October 1993, and it will retain that  status until the political and economic situation in the  occupied territories becomes "more settled," Mr. al-Masri said.    It was also announced at Wednesday's meeting that the PDII  was a 49 per cent share-holder in the West Bank-based al-Ruwad  Investment Group, which is a West Bank-registered share-holding  company with an initial capital of $50 million.    Al-Ruwad will act as PDII's largest subsidiary in the  occupied territories, said Kamal Hassuni, a West Bank investor  in PDII and director of Al-Ruwad.    "West Bank and Gaza investors have 51 per cent of the shares  and our first priority is to build badly needed housing units,"  Mr. Hassuni said.    PDII will initially concentrate on housing, industry, light  industry and the tourism.    The ownership composition is in accordance with Jordanian  laws implemented before the 1967 Israeli seizure of the West  Bank and the Gaza Strip. "Local residents must have the  majority of the shares," said Raja Shihadah, a prominent  Ramallah-based lawyer, who also addressed the audience and  briefed investors on the legal aspects of investment in the  occupied territories.    Company shares will be made available to the public once  PDII  is listed at a stock market. "We don't expect that a  Palestinian stock market will develop in the very near future  but the PDII stocks will undoubtedly be listed in the stock  markets of Arab capitals such as Amman, Beirut and Bahrain,"  said one of the founders of the company.    The members of the board are: The Arab Bank Ltd, the  Cairo-Amman Bank (Yazid Mufti), Said Co., al-Masirah Co., Nabil  al-Shawwa, Ramzi Dallul, 'Azmi 'Abd-al-Hadi, Nidal Sukhtyan,  Riad Sadiq, Husayn Sharqawi, Zuhdi Khury and the Housing Bank.</p>

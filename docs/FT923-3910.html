			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Moscow hopes for debt plan approval RUSSIA hopes a new set of debt rescheduling proposals to clear arrears on the former Soviet Union's Dollars 70bn (Pounds 35.1bn) foreign debt will win favour from Group of Seven officials in Paris today. Mr Peter Aven, Russia's minister for foreign economic relations, said yesterday the proposals were based on newly available balance of payments projections by the International Monetary Fund, giving a clearer picture of the amounts Russia could afford to pay. He said a figure of Dollars 2.5bn-Dollars 3bn quoted by Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister and his immediate superior, as an estimate of what Russia could afford to spend on annual debt repayments was not necessarily the last offer. 'If somebody can prove we can pay Dollars 6bn then we'll pay Dollars 6bn,' he said. 'We would like to fulfil our obligations after signing a long-term rescheduling agreement, and not to be in a position like today where we have signed something but still accumulate arrears,' Mr Aven said. 'If you pay just part of your debt you have to choose who to pay. You have to make priorities and that's absolutely wrong,' he added, referring to the practice whereby payments are made only to countries which lend Russia more money or when Moscow is faced with the suspension of key imports. Credit lines with dozens of countries have been frozen because of arrears exceeding Dollars 4bn on debts excluded from a deferral of principal payments on medium-term debt already granted by the Paris Club of creditor nations. A final decision on debt rescheduling may be taken by the Paris Club, which is due to meet at the end of the month. Mr Aven claimed that capital flight was about Dollars 3bn, and not the inflated figure given in some estimates. But such flight had reduced resources for debt repayment and contributed to the rouble's weakness. Further confidence-building measures, such as increasing interest rates on rouble deposits within Russia, would be needed before state-owned enterprises could be persuaded to bring back currency from abroad. Mr Aven said that forcing enterprises to sell 100 per cent of their hard currency earnings in order to boost the thin foreign currency market - as suggested by Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the acting central bank chairman - would worsen the problem. 'We will do this only when we manage to defend a stable exchange rate and bring down inflation,' the minister said. Mr Aven expects differences with Mr Gerashchenko over economic policy reform to be sorted out.</p>

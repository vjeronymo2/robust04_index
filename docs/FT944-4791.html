			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / World Trade News: US and Japan to resume glass talks The US and Japan were yesterday due to re-open talks aimed at fulfilling an autumn pledge to open Japan's Dollars 4.5bn flat-glass market. The two sides struck an agreement in principle in early October but negotiations have failed to yield an actual pact. The two sides have agreed the principles for opening Japan's flat glass market but some issues remain over the details of foreign access and technical aspects. Washington and Tokyo decided to extend the deadline for agreement on the flat glass sector negotiations after last month's failure to secure a comprehensive accord. Japan has agreed to promote the use of foreign-made glass in some government-funded facilities which would serve as model projects. There is also broad agreement on the use of objective criteria to measure progress in import penetration. Differences remain, however, over whether the objective criteria should be forward-looking, as the US hopes, or should only measure past developments, as the Japanese insist. Japanese officials are concerned that forward-looking measures could turn into restrictive targets aimed at ensuring a specific market share for foreign products in the domestic glass market. There has been less progress in parallel talks on access for US vehicles and vehicle parts in the Japanese market. Negotiations have not been resumed since September when the US cited Japan's vehicle parts after-sales market as being characterised by 'unfair and discriminatory trade practices' and unilaterally began an investigation under Section 301 of its trade act.</p>

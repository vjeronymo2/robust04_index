			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: US banks register sharp profits growth A pick-up in consumer lending in the US this year was the main factor behind underlying double-digit earnings growth at three large US commercial banks which reported third-quarter earnings yesterday. NationsBank, the third biggest bank with assets of Dollars 167bn, said its consumer loans were up 18 per cent on a year ago, while commercial loans were 10 per cent higher, excluding the effect of acquisitions. KeyCorp, the Cleveland-based group with assets of Dollars 65bn, reported loans up 13 per cent on a year before. First Interstate, a Los Angeles-based bank, reported loan growth of 22 per cent. The advance was based on acquisitions, as well as the continuing recovery in the Californian economy. The growth in loans came against the background of narrower lending margins at the first two banks. At NationsBank, the net interest margin slipped from 3.83 to 3.54 per cent, and at KeyCorp from 5.3 to 4.69 per cent. First Interstate, though, reported an improvement in its margin, to 5.22 per cent. NationsBank reported after-tax profits of Dollars 431m, up 26 per cent due partly to acquisitions. Earnings per share rose 17 per cent, to Dollars 1.55, in line with market expectations. KeyCorp's net income also matched most analysts' projections, with a 14 per cent year-on-year rise, to Dollars 229m. Earnings per share rose 12 per cent, to 92 cents. First Interstate, despite the advance in underlying earnings, was held back by a previously announced restructuring charge of Dollars 86.2m, or Dollars 1.05, after tax. Net income was Dollars 130m, or Dollars 1.49 a share, down from Dollars 150m, or Dollars 1.80 a share. However, First Chicago, with assets of Dollars 66bn at end-September, reported a 46 per cent fall in net income from a record level in the third quarter of 1993. Earnings last year had benefited from the sale of equity investments, which contributed Dollars 1.40 a share. Net income was Dollars 154m, or Dollars 1.54 a share.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The foreign minister has reiterated that the Thai  Government has no relations with the Khmer Rouge [KR] as charged  by the United States ambassador to Thailand.    Commenting on the statement of the U.S. ambassador at a  Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand dinner that the Thai  Government still maintained ties with the Khmer Rouge, which  continue to wage battles with the Cambodian Government, Foreign  Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri said he has already  explained to the ambassador that the Thai Government only  maintains diplomatic ties with Cambodia's legitimate government.  The Thai Government has moreover complied with the UN  resolution banning border trading with the Khmer Rouge. He said  if there are any more comments to that effect, he will invite  that person to check the situation at the place itself.  However, he added, the Cambodian Government has not declared  the Khmer Rouge faction as outlaws.</p>

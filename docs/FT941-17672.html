			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Dollars and Pounds stronger The dollar and sterling ended the year on a bullish note yesterday as investors and traders looked forward to further steady growth in the US and British economies, writes Peter Norman. Although London trading was thin, reflecting the closure of markets in Japan, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark and the virtual cessation of activity in the UK around lunchtime, dealers expected the firm undertone of both currencies to be maintained in the new year. As the charts show, both the dollar and sterling closed near five-month highs against the D-Mark with the dollar about 7 per cent higher against the German currency since the start of last year and sterling up nearly 4 1/2 per cent. Although the D-Mark recovered slightly against the French franc yesterday, rising to FFr3.401 from FFr3.397 on Thursday, it ended 1993 slightly weaker than at the start of the year when it was worth FFr3.404. Since October, the franc has recouped the losses suffered as a result of the July-August crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism. The yen was another former high-flyer to close the year at a comparatively low ebb. Although the dollar ended 1993 more than 10 per cent down against the yen, its close in London yesterday marked a recovery of about 10 per cent from its mid-August low of Y101.13. Strong economic indicators pointing to fast US fourth quarter growth and mounting expectations that the Federal Reserve will have to raise short-term interest early this year underpinned the dollar in yesterday's thin trading. The US currency was able to attract buying interest whenever it dipped against the D-Mark or the yen. However, there was a limit to its upwards potential because operators were unwilling to take on large positions in an illiquid holiday market. The dollar closed in London at DM1.7365, up from Thursday's DM1.7337. However, it was fractionally lower against the yen at Y111.605 against Y111.845. The dollar's slight decline against the Japanese currency reflected some profit-taking on long dollar positions as investors tidied their books ahead of the year's end. The dollar also continued to be pinned down by sell orders placed by Japanese exporters at around Y112. However, traders pointed to good buying support when the dollar dipped to Y111.5 as an illustration of its strength. Sterling rose against both the D-Mark and dollar in London yesterday in spite of an absence of news. It gained nearly a pfennig against the D-Mark to close at DM2.5692 against DM2.5602 on Thursday to end just 2 pfennigs below its late July high against the German currency. It was well up on its D-Mark low for the year of DM2.33 recorded in late February. The pound moved slightly higher against the dollar to close at Dollars 1.4795 yesterday from Dollars 1.4768 on Thursday, bringing a year of erratic movements against the US currency to an end. Although at yesterday's close sterling was only 2.5 per cent down on its rate against the dollar at the start of the year, it fell in mid-February to a low of Dollars 1.42 before rising to Dollars 1.59 in late April. The Bank of England provided the UK money market with Pounds 1.705bn of liquidity yesterday compared with its estimate of a Pounds 2.2bn shortage. Some Pounds 1.545bn of assistance was provided during the course of its regular money market dealings. It provided Pounds 160m of late assistance at unspecified rates.</p>

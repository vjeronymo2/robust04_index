			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Arts: Vintage Rivals The curtain that greets the audience as they take their seats gives the cue to this production of The Rivals. Showing a scene from Bath in the 18th century, it is charmingly pretty, and looks quite authentic, but is somehow insipid. Richard Cottrell's staging (first shown in Chichester earlier this year) gives us a flavour of how the original might have looked, with its clearly artificial flat painted backdrops. The acting style too is vintage - ornately mannered and involving plenty of appeals to the audience: comic asides, sly glances and shrugs. But while the production emphasises Sheridan's highly developed sense of the theatrical, this does not translate into a wickedly funny critique of the contrived behaviour of fashionable society. Sheridan's comedy has warmth, but it also has bite, and he is merciless in his lampooning of pretentiousness, nowhere more so than in his most memorable creation, Mrs Malaprop. To be sure, Patricia Routledge, as Mrs Malaprop, is splendid. Decked out like a lingerie department at Christmas, resplendent with ribbons and bows, satin and lace, she arrives in full sail to hold the stage. Her performance matches her appearance, with extra trimmings all over. She plunges into her character's hopeless mauling of the English language with enjoyable relish, while an occasional haughty snort reminds of us Hyacinth Bucket (the stuck-up old harridan she plays in Keeping Up Appearances on television). Richard Johnson is amusing as the crusty Sir Anthony Absolute, growling, harrumphing and waving his stick, and James Simmons has dash and charm as his wayward son Jack, whose secret disguise as Ensign Beverley is the lynchpin of the plot. Scenes that involve any combination of these three characters do take off: the reconciliation between father and son is delightfully funny. But elsewhere, the production feels half-hearted. It takes a long while to crank up, and though Debra Beaumont is exquisitely pretty as Lydia Languish, she is so straight there is no fun to be had out of her at all. Sheridan spared no-one in his ridicule of fashionable society and if this does not emerge the whole Acres sub-plot, detailing the absurd length this yokel will go to to be thought au fait with proper social etiquette, seems rather meaningless. Billy Doyle is good as a bluff, scornful Sir Lucius O'Trigger and Adam Godley works hard as the maddening, simpering Faulkland. But it is all rather like a bite from an old snake who forgot to put his fangs in. At the Albery, WC2.</p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Liberals back in Quebec election race: On the campaign trail The election campaign which could determine Quebec's future role in Canada is turning out to be more closely fought than many political observers predicted. When Mr Daniel Johnson, Quebec's prime minister, called the September 12 poll two weeks ago, his ruling Liberal party had been all but written off to win a third successive term. The Parti Quebecois, whose main goal is to lead the francophone province to sovereignty, was far ahead in public opinion polls. It was widely assumed that Mr Johnson, who took office only last January, would be unable to turn things around with his diffident style and a new, inexperienced team. But those who dismissed Mr Johnson are having to eat their words. A poll published over the weekend indicates that the Liberals have made strong gains in the past fortnight. According to the poll, conducted by the Centre de Recherche sur l'Opinion Publique (CROP) in Montreal, support for the PQ among decided voters has dropped in the past fortnight from 52 per cent to 48 per cent, while the Liberals have climbed from 42 per cent to 46 per cent. If the election were held now, the PQ would probably still win a sizeable majority of seats in the National Assembly. Much of the Liberals' support is concentrated among English-speaking and immigrant communities around Montreal. On the other hand, the CROP poll suggests that many rural, francophone voters have begun to have second thoughts about the PQ. Although the Liberals' campaign has lacked sparkle, it has shone in comparison to the separatists'. Mr Jacques Parizeau, the PQ leader, began by attacking Canada's 'straitjacket' federal system, saying Quebec could assure its social and economic future best by breaking away. If the PQ won the election, it would immediately pass a National Assembly resolution proclaiming the goal of separation and begin talks with Ottawa about ways to achieve this. A referendum on independence would follow within 10 months. But polls consistently show that while voters favour a change of government, they are far from wanting separation or independence. Most Quebec voters are worried by the prospect of losing their Canadian passports, their federal pensions and unemployment insurance cheques, and possibly the Canadian dollar. A new PQ platform stresses 'sovereignty', which to most Quebeckers implies something less than full independ ence. Mr Parizeau has repeatedly had to paste over divisions within his own party. Some of his trusted lieutenants have said a PQ government cannot start the machinery of separation before the voters make their choice in a referendum. But this contradicts the party platform and Mr Parizeau's own promises. Among those presenting a more gradual approach to independence are Mr Lucien Bouchard, the charismatic leader of the Bloc Quebecois, the federal counterpart of the PQ which became the official opposition in the federal parliament in Ottawa in last year's general election. Mr Bouchard joined the election campaign last week. One senior Liberal says Mr Bouchard's job is to play the 'good guy' in the PQ campaign. Though he is unabashedly dedicated to Quebec independence, he says the Quebec election 'should be the first step towards what will come afterwards, the referendum'. Mr Parizeau also invited ridicule when he claimed to have obtained 'private assurances' from US officials that Washington would back an independent Quebec's accession to the North American Free Trade Agreement. The US State Department quickly insisted that no such assurances had been given. Other PQ candidates have touched politically sensitive nerves by suggesting that an independent Quebec could replace the Canadian dollar with the US dollar as its currency, and that French-only language laws would be stiffened after a PQ victory. Mr Johnson has seized on these inconsistencies. 'Who's in charge?' he asks rhetorically. The Liberals have tried to hammer home the message that the best way to create jobs is for Quebec to remain part of Canada. A PQ win, the Liberals argue, would generate months if not years of economic uncertainty. In the run-up to the election, the Liberal government has backed the reopening of two big pulp mills in PQ strongholds, and has supported other industrial plants with loan guarantees. Closer to grassroots, it has introduced measures to force recalcitrant spouses to make child-support payments on time. The latest poll clearly shows that these tactics, coupled with the PQ's gaffes, are turning the tide towards the Liberals. But Mr Johnson still has a long way to go.</p>

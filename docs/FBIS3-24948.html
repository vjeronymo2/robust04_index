"The government is extremely concerned about the situation,"  she told SAPA at the National Party federal congress in Kempton  Park.    She said there had been reports of union members urinating  on  patients, emptying dustbins in hospitals, attacks on  administrative staff and the damaging of staff cars. "This is  totally unacceptable and the public should take notice that the  union has lost control of its members. The African National  Congress says striking is an essential weapon for negotiation.  It says hospitals cannot be categorised as emergency services  and that it wants to protect patients".    She said it was a fact neither ANC election candidate and  NEHAWU Secretary-General Philip Dexter, nor union members cared  about the welfare of the patients.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Tripoli, 10 Jun -- Brother 'Umar al-Muntasir,  secretary of the General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison  and International Cooperation, delivered a speech [words  indistinct].    He added [words indistinct] that what has become known as  the  "Lockerbie" crisis, which was made public in a sudden and  planned manner on 1 November 1991, and despite the numerous  efforts and initiatives...[agency ellipses] the three Western  countries insisted on transforming a legal conflict into a  political issue to achieve [word indistinct] against the Great  Jamahiriyah, and resorted to the UN Security Council and issued  three resolutions, 731/92, 748/92, and 883/93. Despite that,  the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah agreed to deal  with Resolution No. 731/92 and took practical measures to  respond to [word indistinct] condemning terrorism in all its  forms...[agency ellipses] complete readiness to cooperate with  any quarter combating terrorism, affirmed that there were no  camps for training terrorists, and repeated its call for the UN  secretary general to send a fact-finding mission to investigate  that.    He added: "The only remaining part to complete the  implementation of UN Security Council Resolution No. 731 was  that the two suspects appear before justice. As it is the case  in all countries of the world, laws stipulated that the  nationals of a given country should not be handed over for trial  in other countries. Nevertheless, the Basic People's Congresses  issued a decision stating that they did not object to the two  suspects appearing before a fair and transparent court to be  agreed upon." [passage omitted]    He stressed: "The Great Jamahiriyah insisted that the venue  for the court must have all objective conditions required in any  just court, because what was reported by Western media, what was  written by a former CIA agent in his book, and what was  announced by the director of the Swedish electronics firm that  manufactured the timing devices refuted the main point in the  charges against the two Libyan nationals, against whom the  Western media had issued a verdict condemning them in advance.  We would like to say here that this conference, in its 59th  session, had called for a fair trial in a neutral venue.    He said for the sake of showing justice, the Socialist  People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah did not object to the suspects  appearing in front of a just and honest court that had all the  psychological and legal requirements in order to achieve the  truth, and to do the victims and their families justice.    He added: "You might agree with me that the style of the  three countries [words indistinct] in tackling the case has  caused us clear damage and injustice, and is not helping to  solve the crisis in a satisfactory way."    He said: "In this context we would like to point out that  international legal experts have studied the idea of trying the  suspects at the headquarters of the International Court of  Justice. [Word indistinct] and that the suspects' lawyer has  agreed [word indistinct] to end the efforts to impose additional  sanctions that will increase the suffering of the Libyan Arab  people who have endured great losses as a result of the unjust  sanctions of the UN Security Council Resolutions 748 and 883."</p>

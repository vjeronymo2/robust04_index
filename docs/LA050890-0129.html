			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMUGGLING A BANNED COMMODITY  </P> <P> South Africa is accustomed to inconvenience. Decades of isolation in sports and  business have made resourcefulness a necessity.  </P> <P> In sports, the boycotts and bans have also engendered a sophisticated level of  cheating among some sportsmen, those who have learned to use subterfuge to get  what the world would deny them.  </P> <P> They use bribery and corruption. They buy passports, change names and blur  identities.  </P> <P> It is no great surprise that money greases the wheels of this international  intrigue. The formula runs something like this: Someone wants help. Someone  emerges who can help. Someone provides help and is well paid. Repeat procedure.  </P> <P> In the case of South African athletes who seek to compete outside the country,  Paul Coetser is someone who helps. Coetser, an unassuming fellow, and his  partner, Tony McKeever, run SportsMark, South Africa's largest, and possibly  its only, sports management company. The two represent dozens of amateur and  professional athletes in South Africa and elsewhere.  </P> <P> Coetser, who says that other areas of the business provide the profit,  estimates that his company has spent half a million rand to get South African  athletes into international competition since 1982.  </P> <P> "You want to know what we have made out of athletes?" he says. "Let's be  extravagant. Let's say we have made 50,000 rand (about $22,000). From all the  athletes. Athletes owe us about 300,000 rand, according to our contracts. I am  being as honest as I can be. About 50,000 rand."  </P> <P> So why does Coetser do this? Why is he so helpful?  </P> <P> According to SportsMark's contracts, as the agent, Coetser would receive 15% to  30% of an athlete's earnings. For that cut, Coetser delivers professional,  expert service.  </P> <P> </P> <P> GOING TO SEE THE CHIEF  </P> <P> They call Lesotho, an independent country surrounded by South Africa, "the  Kingdom in the Sky" because of its mountainous terrain. If you know where you  are going, it is a most welcoming place. If you are from outside, you might  well lose your way.  </P> <P> Three people had been following a guide for more than an hour, hiking though  the mountains, trying to find a river near a particular village. Coetser and  Annette Falkson, who is white and one of South Africa's best women marathon  runners, were on their way to see the chief. Johan Fourie, a South African  1,500-meter runner, had come along to help.  </P> <P> At last they came to the river, which was swollen with rain and looked, from  the high bank, unfordable. The guide set off, eventually returning with a man  and a mule.  </P> <P> "You must give this man some money for his mule and he will take you across,"  the guide said.  </P> <P> This ferry system took still more time, as the man carefully picked his way  across the rocky riverbed, sitting on the back of his mule, taking first one  passenger then another.  </P> <P> Wet, but finally on the other side, they set out again. At last they found the  village and sat to wait for the chief. After a time the chief arrived and they  all went to his kraal, where they sat in a circle. Coetser told the chief that  he had come from afar to seek the chief's wisdom on a certain matter.  </P> <P> The matter, he said, involved one of the chief's people, a girl who had grown  up in this village. He told the chief he had brought this girl, now a woman,  before him to identify.  </P> <P> Coetser told the chief that if he confirmed that the woman and her parents  before her had come from this area, then this woman could get a birth  certificate, which was very important to her.  </P> <P> The chief thought about this. They continued to sit and smoked a pipe for a  time. Then someone brought some of the chief's home-brewed beer. They drank  that. The chief said he wasn't sure he could remember this one woman from among  so many people in his village.  </P> <P> Coetser said he understood how an elder with such responsibilities could have  this problem. Coetser pulled out a bill. The chief thought about this. Coetser  pulled out another bill. The chief peered at Falkson. The more money Coetser  extracted from his pocket, the more the chief seemed to recognize Falkson.  </P> <P> Near the end of Coetser's money, the chief suddenly recalled that Falkson and  her blood kin had been respected residents of his village for generations. More  money. He remembered her as a baby.  </P> <P> A little later, Coetser and his party left the chief and his village, found the  river, the man and his mule and descended from the Kingdom in the Sky.  </P> <P> It took Coetser nine months and a considerable amount of money to set up that  trip. But he walked away from the deal with exactly what he had wanted -- a  Lesotho passport and birth certificate for Falkson, a South African citizen.  </P> <P> It was a triumph of persistence and ingenuity, but it was more than that. Those  simple documents were the ticket to Falkson's athletic freedom. Freedom that  she bought, with the help of Coetser, South Africa's foremost practitioner of  the fine art of getting out.  </P> <P> Here's how he did it. The birth certificate came first. Falkson was not born in  Lesotho, but a woman with her name was. Coetser knew this because he had  examined the Lesotho Registry of Births. For that privilege he'd had to bribe  an official. Coetser now had a registration of Falkson's birth.  </P> <P> To get a birth certificate he had to show proof that Falkson was born where the  Registry had recorded. The helpful chief solved that problem.  </P> <P> With the document from the chief, Falkson could get a birth certificate. With  that, she could apply for a Lesotho passport.  </P> <P> She bought the passport and tried to use it as proof of citizenship to run in  the 1988 L.A. Marathon. At the 11th hour, she wasn't allowed to run because she  was recognized by U.S. track officials as a South African.  </P> <P> Postscript: Falkson is still living and competing in South Africa and has not  tried to use the Lesotho passport again.  </P> <P> If South Africa ever becomes socially acceptable to the sports world and its  athletes are free to compete internationally, Coetser's contracts will increase  dramatically in value. Making, of course, more money for Coetser.  </P> <P> Until then, he has little fear of the international rules that are supposed to  keep South Africans from participating in international competition.  </P> <P> "Come on, that is a joke," said Coetser, a recreational runner who has entered  international races under assumed names.  </P> <P> "I can't tell you the number of big races we have run in the U.S. and  everywhere else. We have people registered with TAC, we are members of the New  York Road Racing Club. I try to run as many races under as many names as I can,  to get a name established (and pass on to other South Africans). So when race  directors ask where my athletes have run, we can show results. I have run many  times under women's names."  </P> <P> Running a race under a woman's name is a radical departure for this former  schoolteacher. Coetser used to be the classic mild-mannered  scholar-with-thick-glasses type, and he is at a loss to explain his eager dive  into the depths of international intrigue. A staunch family man and outward  conservative, Coetser is a puzzle.  </P> <P> Coetser might seem bold when he scoffs at international rules. But he has  reason to hold them in low regard -- he has broken them so many times.  </P> <P> </P> <P> AN AUDIENCE WITH THE KING  </P> <P> It started when Fourie, the 1,500-meter runner, came to Coetser one day in 1983  and said he had heard he could get Swazi citizenship in time to compete in the  1984 Olympics.  </P> <P> They took a day trip to Swaziland, another small country almost totally  surrounded by South Africa, and met with the head of the country's sports  council. They were told that, yes, it would not be difficult for such a fine  runner to represent Swaziland at the Olympics.  </P> <P> They went another time and met with officials of the country's track and field  federation. On still another trip, they talked to the Swazi Olympic Committee.  After about six months of introductions, Coetser began noticing that the more  Swazi officials he met, the more it was costing him.  </P> <P> Ultimately, it paid off. Fourie and two other South African athletes finally  received Swazi passports for a total of about 50 rand, about $22. Much cheaper  than meeting officials.  </P> <P> Still, the passports were not enough. The L.A. Olympics had come and gone and  still Fourie didn't have his citizenship, and they were running out of money.  They had bribed officials to get residence permits, about 1,200 rand. But  residence permits were not the same as citizenship papers, and without those  they could not go abroad to compete.  </P> <P> Coetser was becoming angry. It was time to see the King.  </P> <P> After three months of negotiations, they arrived at the appointed time for the  audience. They waited. The King, a teen-ager, never showed. The King's  counselors had little to say to Coetser about this. This sometimes happens,  they told him.  </P> <P> That night, Coetser invited a few members of the Swaziland Olympic Committee to  dinner. Twenty-five "officials" showed up. The next morning as he was checking  out of his hotel, he noticed a discrepancy in his bill. It seems that his  dinner guests had checked into eight hotel rooms and charged their expenses to  his account.  </P> <P> Postscript: Coetser still has the three passports, which he keeps as souvenirs.  They have never been used. He still does not have the Swazi citizenship papers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Paul Coetser, an Afrikaner who was raised in arch-conservative Pretoria and who  loudly condemns apartheid, argues that his sometimes shady methods have been  forced upon him.  </P> <P> "I don't know if you know how desperate we are," he said. "I am doing what I  believe is good for the individual athlete in this country. The isolation is  horrible. They have hit this country where it hurts the most -- at sports. The  day they started the sports campaign, that was the best angle they ever had  against apartheid.  </P> <P> "However, the time has come to stop. The world must meet the sportsman halfway.  The athletes, black and white, are suffering because the politicians can't make  up their damn minds. Athletes have been taken as instruments and shoved around  for many years. Today they are simply instruments in the hands of politicians."  </P> <P> Coetser recalls with some pride that he was once the most hated man in South  African sports. Now, he said, officials are coming to see his methods as less  radical and more practical.  </P> <P> He said he doesn't want to continue to break the rules. He said he is only  telling his story now because of the changing political climate in South Africa  and because, "It's time for people to know what's going on.  </P> <P> "The point is, there are many ways of doing it," he said. "It's all done  because of desperation and a burning desire to run internationally. If I really  want to, I can keep doing it. If they catch us, they catch us. We can just come  back next time and do it under different names. It's very expensive, but we can  find the money."  </P> <P> </P> <P> DO YOU KNOW THE WAY TO PARAGUAY?  </P> <P> It was called Project Genesis. The name symbolized the beginning of a new  approach by Coetser, a desperate, try-anything attempt to get South African  athletes into international competition.  </P> <P> Coetser picked the Honolulu Marathon because it fit well into the schedule. It  was also off the beaten path, and that was a key.  </P> <P> Coetser called Larry Heidebrecht, a sports agent he met at the 1987 World  Championships at Rome. Heidebrecht knew Coetser as Paul Stevens, a name Coetser  used when he didn't want to be identified as a South African. Coetser told  Heidebrecht that he had two marathon runners from Paraguay and he wanted to get  them into the Honolulu Marathon. Heidebrecht said he would call the race  director.  </P> <P> The two runners were entered 10 days before the race, with modest times. The  race director, Jim Barahal, agreed that the runners would pay their own way to  the race and he would provide hotel rooms. In addition, Barahal agreed that if  one of the runners finished in the top three, the race would then pay the  transportation of the coach.  </P> <P> Later, Heidebrecht called to say that only one runner, Brandt Nava, would  compete, that the other was not ready. The truth was that Coetser wasn't sure  he could get passports for two runners.  </P> <P> Nava got there, but quite late. He, his coach and Coetser arrived at 5 p.m. the  day before the race, only 12 hours before race time. Coetser introduced himself  to Barahal as Paul Stefanos, a Greek national living in London. Nava's real  name was David Tsebe. He was a young welfare officer in a platinum mine, a  South African.  </P> <P> Coetser and Tsebe kept to themselves before the race and even Barahal said he  didn't notice Tsebe-Nava until about six miles into the race. The runner was  among the leaders and looking strong. He led at nine miles. At 15 miles Gianni  Poli of Italy made a break. Nava went with him, still in the lead. Poli caught  him at 22 1/2 miles and Nava settled in behind him. To most, Nava looked fresh  and Poli was laboring.  </P> <P> Poli won and Nava was second in 2 hours 15 minutes 12 seconds.  </P> <P> In retrospect, Nava clearly threw the race, on Coetser's instructions. Awaiting  the winner were many inquiring eyes and a national television audience.  </P> <P> Among the reporters was runner Alberto Salazar, who was doing television  commentary. Salazar, who speaks Spanish, approached Nava for an interview.  Salazar spoke Spanish to Nava, supposedly a Paraguayan whose native language  would have been Spanish. Nava didn't appear to understand. Salazar spoke to him  in English, with no response.  </P> <P> The charade unraveled quickly. It became apparent that Stefanos and Nava  weren't who they said they were and were neither Greek nor Paraguayan. After  agreeing to meet Barahal to discuss the situation, the South Africans left  Honolulu abruptly. Barahal was left with a hotel bill that included $258 worth  of phone calls to South Africa.  </P> <P> Postscript: Coetser still has the Paraguayan passports. He still has two checks  for $5,000, Brandt Nava's prize money. The checks have never been cashed.  </P> <P> Post-Postscript: How did Coetser get the Paraguayan passports? That's still  another story.  </P> <P> "There was a government project to sell farms in northern Paraguay to  investors," he said. "Part of the deal was that I could get passports. I went  there and I said, OK, I'll buy one farm for $20,000 U.S. I was supposed to get  four passports. Well, at the end of the day, I only paid 5,000 rand and I got  the passports. I got a registered number and the farm address."  </P> <P> Coetser said he had little trouble registering the names, all false, of South  African athletes with the Paraguayan track and field federation.  </P> <P> "There is corruption out there like you cannot believe," he said. "Anything is  possible with money."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Because of its policy of apartheid, or racial separation, South Africa has been  shunned by the international sporting community. It has been banned from the  Olympics since 1960 and international sporting codes prohibit South African  athletes from competing anywhere outside their country and impose lengthy bans  on any athlete who competes in South Africa.  </P></p>

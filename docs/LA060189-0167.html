			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ECONOMY;  </P> <P> HIKE IN KEY U.S. INDEX EASES RECESSION FEARS  </P> <P> The government's chief economic forecasting gauge jumped 0.8% in April, the  Commerce Department reported Wednesday, easing fears that the nation might be  about to tumble into a recession.  </P> <P> The increase in the index of leading economic indicators followed declines of  0.3% in February and 0.6% in March. Three consecutive monthly declines have  traditionally been a signal of a possible recession on the horizon.  </P> <P> "We believe there will be a slowdown that is gradually occurring in the  economy, but it's not going to ultimately end in a recession," said economist  John Hagens of the WEFA Group in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. "It was a bit too premature  to call for a recession later this year based on the data in February and  March."  </P> <P> Still, analysts were not suggesting that the strong numbers for April meant a  robust economy this summer.  </P> <P> Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York said the report  suggests that although there "was a bit of a rebound in April from March, the  general story about the economy is that it is slowing down and slowing  dramatically."  </P> <P> Although a three-month drop in the index has preceded all eight recessions  since 1948, there have also been five similar series of declines -- including  the five consecutive months surrounding the stock market crash in October, 1987  -- that were not followed by recessions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fairly Steady Slowing  </P> <P> The index of leading indicators is designed to foretell economic activity six  to nine months in the future.  </P> <P> Robert Brusca, an economist with Nikko Securities Co. International in New  York, said recent reports show that "the economy is confused, somewhere between  boom and bust."  </P> <P> But he noted that over the past six months "there's been some pretty steady  decelerating in the growth of the index."  </P> <P> Commerce reported that the leading indicators rose 1.3% over the past six  months, compared to 1.7% in the previous half-year.  </P> <P> The April report showed that eight of the 11 indicators in the index rose, led  by increased manufacturers' orders for consumer goods, increased building  permits and a longer average workweek.  </P> <P> Other pluses were higher stock prices, lower initial claims for jobless  benefits, slower vendor deliveries (meaning growing demand), more orders for  plants and equipment and an increase in manufacturers' unfilled orders.  </P> <P> On the minus side were the third consecutive drop in an index measuring  consumer confidence, a drop in the money supply and lower prices for sensitive  materials, indicating slower demand.  </P> <P> Hagens said he was closely watching the consumer confidence index.  </P> <P> "That has been a fairly good leading indicator on its own of a recession," he  said. "It hasn't dropped nearly enough to indicate that a recession is coming,  but if it dropped dramatically over the next three or four months, we would be  concerned."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Heading for Soft Landing  </P> <P> Instead, Hagens concludes that the "economy is in a slowing mode," heading for  a soft landing with growth over the next year of 1.5%. Growth in the gross  national product for the first three months of 1989, with the statistical  rebound from last year's drought removed, was 1.8%.  </P> <P> Robert Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, also sees  "a soft landing -- continued but subdued growth."  </P> <P> A soft landing, rather than a recession, is what the Federal Reserve hopes to  achieve in its effort to contain inflation by tightening credit.  </P> <P> William K. MacReynolds, U.S. Chamber of Commerce forecasting director, said he  believes that "it would be a mistake to interpret April's uptick . . . as an  indication that the economy is in good shape."  </P> <P> "Persistent declines in the money supply . . . are a harbinger of a more  dramatic slowdown than most analysts expect," he said. "Historically, a falling  money supply has led to a large decline in overall economic growth."  </P> <P> The drop in the money supply in April was the fourth in a row.  </P> <P> The April index of leading economic indicators stood at 145.7% of its 1982 base  of 100.  </P></p>

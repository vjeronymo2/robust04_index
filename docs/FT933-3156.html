			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Buckingham Intl asset sale after Pounds 62.5m loss BUCKINGHAM International, the property, hotels and nursing group, is in talks with its bankers after it wrote down the value of its property by almost Pounds 60m leading to a loss before tax of Pounds 62.5m in the half year to May 2. Net borrowings rose to Pounds 95.5m, representing gearing of 200 per cent. Interest increased to Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 4m). The rise in debt led to a breach of covenants with its banks. Mr David Hardy, chairman, said: 'We are talking to our lenders about a programme of disposals. We expect the discussions to be resolved satisfactorily and the sale of assets should result in a big reduction in debt. The banks are not going to pull the plug.' An exceptional charge of Pounds 60m mainly relates to the write down of the group's assets, which includes property in Portugal. The provision amounts to 49p per share and leaves net assets of 35p (80p) per share. Mr Clarke, who became a multi-millionaire after the Greenalls takeover of Devenish, has been given 5m share options exercisable in five years at 10p each. Buckingham's shares, which rose to Pounds 1 four years ago, were yesterday unchanged at 6 1/2 p. 'The group is a shadow of its former glory' said Mr Hardy. 'But with new management and a disposal programme in place I hope better times are coming.' Profit before exceptional items rose to Pounds 1.67m (Pounds 1.27m) on increased sales of Pounds 24.4m (Pounds 19.5m). Operating profits from hotels and nursing homes increased to Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 2.4m) and Pounds 521,000 (Pounds 459,000) respectively. The Portugal development business made a loss of Pounds 273,000. Losses per share of 51.85p compare to losses of 1.84p. The interim dividend has been passed again.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Malaysian car import racket Criminal syndicates are using Malaysian students and government officers overseas, mainly in Britain, to import luxury cars into Malaysia without paying import duty, Mr Anwar Ibrahim, finance minister, said yesterday, Reuter reports. 'We have detained 95 luxury cars, mostly Mercedes-Benz, since 1991, whose registered owners are students and officers we know can ill afford them,' Mr Anwar said. Import duty on cars owned by government officers returning to Malaysia at the end of their tenure is usually waived while students are given concessions, the minister said. 'I have directed the Customs Department to be stringent and not allow for any leaks in our taxation system. There will be no more waivers.'</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Money Markets: French rates tumble French cash rates declined sharply again yesterday on strong speculation that there might be another cut in France's official interest rates today or next week, writes James Blitz. The French franc's performance on the currency markets has been sufficiently strong in recent days to make possible another easing in the Bank of France's monetary policy. At the same time, more bad news on the French economy in recent days, including the fact that the unemployment figures have risen above 3 million, have put pressure on the authorities to cut rates again. Three month French francs declined sharply on this speculation yesterday, falling from about 7.90 per cent at the start of the day to about 7.45 per cent. This brought 3 month French franc interest rates more-or-less in line with 3 month D-Marks. There was a similarly bullish performance in the French franc futures market. The June contract rose 19 basis points on the day to close at 92.62. The September contract also closed 15 basis points higher at 93.28. The spread between June futures in France and Germany also contracted yesterday to about 21 basis points. In part this was due to a slightly less bullish rise in the June Euromark contract which closed at 92.83, 4 basis pounds up on the day. The rise in Euromarks was partly due to a larger than expected cut in the Bundesbank's repo rate, which came down 4 basis points to 7.71 per cent. There had been some speculation that the rate might rise, due to the high level of call money. However, the Bundesbank unexpectedly drained DM2.4bn from the market in its weekly operation. This took dealers by surprise because the payment of a new Bund issue later this week is expected to sap market liquidity. German call money closed higher on the day at around 7.80 per cent. Sterling cash markets were quiet, with 3-month money closing about 1/16 per cent softer at 6 per cent. The Pounds 1.35bn shortage was easily removed, helping the short-dated rates lower. The June and September futures contracts both closed at 93.95, suggesting that dealers may be starting to wonder about base rate cuts again.</p>

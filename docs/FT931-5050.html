			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / International Company News: A dividend dilemma at Banesto - Disposal could allow the bank to make a full payout MARIO Conde, chairman of Banesto, Spain's third largest bank, has one of those problems this week that occasionally make it fun to be in debt. On Friday, Banesto announced it had sold its biggest banking subsidiary, Banco de Madrid, to Deutsche Bank for Pta42bn (Dollars 357m). This deal will allow the German bank, which already owns Catalonia-based Bancotrans, to become the largest foreign bank in Spain. But it was far more important for Mr Conde. Banesto will make a profit of Pta30bn from the disposal and now has to decide what to do with it. It has two choices. The first and most probable use of the money will be to provide for bad debts. Non-recoverable loans are at record levels in Spain, but are particularly burdensome at Banesto where assets grew rapidly just prior to the downturn in the economy last year. The Bank of Spain had given Banesto until the end of next year to find an extra Pta40bn to cover itself. The other, more remote, possibility, is that the money will be used to help pay a full dividend for 1992. As things stand now, Banesto cannot possibly match the full 1991 payout of Pta205, because the parent bank's profits fell last year and the Bank of Spain would frown on any bank, perhaps especially Banesto, reducing the amount of net profit transferred to reserves in the middle of a recession. Banesto has already paid Pta95 to shareholders for 1991, though, and has until June to decide whether, and how, to make its traditional complimentary payment. Analysts disagree about what might be done and the bank is keeping silent. But there is some hope for shareholders. The waters are further muddied by the fact that Banesto is planning a large three-for-one rights issue, which has won a promise of support from JP Morgan and which Banesto hopes will raise up to Pta53bn in new capital. There is an outside chance that a successful rights issue might persuade the Bank of Spain to allow Mr Conde to use all or most of last year's Pta20.2bn parent bank net profit to pay shareholders. The rights-issue proceeds would then go to reserves where, normally, most of the 1992 profit would expect to end up. Clearly the central bank would be persuaded one way or the other by the final outcome of the rights issue. In truth, though, the rights issue would be paying the dividend, thus putting Mr Conde in the curious position of asking shareholders for money in order to be able to give it back to them. Between making the full possible payment, with Bank of Spain complicity, and making none at all lies an acceptable policy. It is this that Mr Conde - and his prospective new shareholder in JP Morgan - will be searching for.</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (5): Large overheads persist - Change is being sought in the way cars are sold European carmakers and importers are in quandary about what long-term form they would like the retailing of their products to take. The upcoming European Union verdict on whether to continue the industry's block exemption from normal EU competition rules, and which permits the industry to restrict sales to exclusively franchised dealers, may yet impose its own structural change on car retailing in Europe. But even if Brussels were to decide to extend the exemption for another 10 years and leave its terms largely unchanged, commercial pressures are building which are themselves expected to bring substantial restructuring of the estimated 100,000 manufacturer-franchised outlets through which new cars are sold throughout Europe. The commercial pressures have much to do with the need to cut the costs involved in both the distribution and retailing of vehicles. In the past 10 years, most European car makers have concentrated heavily on reducing manufacturing costs and raising production efficiency as the main means of seeking to get on terms with Japanese competition. Much of the fat has now been cut out of manufacturing. But large and unnecessary overheads persist in distribution and retailing because of the fragmented nature of retailing, not least wide differences in practice between individual countries. Most manufacturers are starting to address the problems, through 'lean' distribution systems which are at least shortening the supply pipeline to dealers. The important questions for the future, as seen by the manufacturers, are how many dealers should there be and how large and powerful can individual dealer groups be allowed to grow? On the one hand, the manufactures know there are too many small and inefficient dealers scattered throughout Europe. They welcome the efficiencies and investment capability of large dealer groups. On the other, they have no wish to see big retailing groups hold sway over the manufacturers as with, for example, the supremacy of the big supermarket chains in food retailing. Some kind of new balance needs to be struck. Throughout most of Europe, the market is served by more than 90,000 dealers, many of them small, individually owned dealers known in the industry as 'mama and papa' businesses. In France, size and population distribution has contributed to the development of one of the most fragmented retailing infrastructures, with a first tier of the 'mama and papa' dealers outnumbering the main dealerships by more than four-to-one. The two-tier dealer structure itself represents an inefficiency but is entrenched in the system throughout Europe. The UK, however, also has a band of large, financially powerful public groups - some owning about 100 outlets each - eager and willing to invest sums in the business far beyond those which could be contemplated by the 'mamas and papas'. The biggest, the Lex Service group with more than 120 outlets covering most major franchises, accounted for nearly 3.5 per cent of all UK new car sales last year. Furthermore in the UK the two-tier system is being dismantled. This summer, for example, the Rover Group announced that 150 of its small dealers would have to go as the result of a move to a single-tier dealer network by the middle of 1997. The network is to be based primarily on Rover's existing main dealers. The main dealers will be required to set up 'satellite' sub-dealerships in areas previously occupied by the small independent retail outlets - investments relatively easily made by the big dealers groups and with the outlets benefiting from the group's overall economies of scale. With retained profit per car shrinking under the pressure of competition, as Europe moves towards a completely open market for new cars at the end of the decade, maximising sales per outlet is becoming of ever greater importance. By that yardstick, Europe as a whole is remarkably inefficient compared with North America, where new car prices are well below European levels. Europe's 100,000 franchised dealers last year sold some 11.4m new cars, an average of 114 each. Their roughly 25,000 US counterparts sold 13m - an average 520 per outlet. Even allowing for last year being a relatively poor one for Europe while the US was recovering, the contrast is a stark one. The UK already occupies a half-way house between Europe as a whole and the US. This year, total UK sales are likely to reach slightly short of 2m - well below the record 2.3m of 1989, but enough to provide the country's 7,400 franchised dealers an average of nearly 270 cars per outlet. As an annual survey by the trade journal Automotive Management of the UK's biggest dealer groups - many of them publicly owned - shows, the big have steadily been getting bigger. Their combined turnover topped Pounds 15bn for the first time last year and they are estimated by Automotive Management to have accounted for 37.5 per cent of all new car sales last year. While many small, individually owned dealerships in the UK and continental Europe have ceased trading in the post-1990 recessions, most of these big groups have remained profitable, maintained a high level of investment and continued to take over less competent smaller rivals. Their credentials for playing an ever-expanding role in an industry in need of their expertise and efficiencies appear impeccable. Yet their very effectiveness has made manufacturers wary of their potential power. As a result, dealers historically have been junior partners in the manufacturer-dealer relationship. Much as many groups wanted to they were forbidden, for example, to set up multi-franchise sites where customers compare one make against another. Ford, for years the unchallenged UK market leader, had a rule whereby no single group could hold more than five Ford outlets or operate any other franchise within 20 miles of that outlet. This was all very well for Ford when it controlled more than 30 per cent of the market - at the time around twice the share of anyone else. Now its share is just over 20 per cent, Vauxhall is treading on its heels and Rover is not far behind. Toyota, Nissan and Honda are increasing their UK manufacturing output and new players from the Far East such as Kia and Daewoo are joing Hyundai on the scene. Europe is becoming more competitive as manufacturers crowd into the market. The big dealers' dependence on any one manufacturer, even Ford, is dwindling and with it their submissiveness to manufacturer diktat. Cracks are appearing: Vauxhall and Rover are allowing multi-franchising. The big dealer groups may now have a maximum of eight Ford dealerships. Thus the balance of power is starting to tilt in the UK. It may be only a question of time before Lex, Inchape and their cohorts start to turn their attention to taking their expertise to continental Europe and starting the transformation process there.</p>

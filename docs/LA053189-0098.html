			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> JUDGE FACES STATE CHARGES  </P> <P> The state Commission on Judicial Performance said it has filed misconduct  charges against Orange County Municipal Judge Calvin P. Schmidt, but did not  disclose what the charges involve. Thomas Malcolm, attorney for Schmidt, said  they do not include a publicized allegation that Schmidt gave favorable  treatment to a prostitute in exchange for sex. The commission wants to hold a  public hearing, but Malcolm said, "Why should he have to go through the circus  of a hearing open to the public? So the press can have a field day, even though  he will ultimately be vindicated?"  </P></p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / SmithKline Beecham advances 11% on increased turnover SMITHKLINE BEECHAM, the Anglo-US drugs and consumer products group, yesterday reported full-year pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 up 11 per cent from Pounds 1bn to Pounds 1.12bn. The results were achieved on turnover up 11.4 per cent from Pounds 4.69bn to Pounds 5.22bn. Mr Bob Bauman, chief executive, said they showed the group was well prepared to cope with the increasingly tough pricing environment for drugs in the US and elsewhere. Sales of Tagamet, the ulcer drug and SB's best-selling drug, fell from Pounds 620m to Pounds 614m. About half of the drug's sales will be affected by the expiry of its US patents in May next year. Tagamet would represent only 10 per cent of group sales by 1994. During the following two years, Mr Bauman predicted US sales would fall not more than 50 per cent. This would be an improvement on ICI's recent performance with Tenormin, a heart drug, which lost 50 per cent of US sales in only 12 months after its patents expiry. Mr Bauman set out his strategy for defending Tagamet. He hoped to launch a non-prescription over the counter (OTC) version of Tagamet in the US before May next year. In addition, the group might offset the full impact of the patents expiry by manufacturing the product for a generic drugs company, he said. SB would also package Tagamet with other drugs in deals with US healthcare organisations in an effort to maintain Tagamet sales. Pharmaceuticals operating profits rose 9 per cent from Pounds 694m to Pounds 758m on turnover up 17 per cent at Pounds 2.89bn (Pounds 2.47bn). Underlying sales growth - excluding currencies - was 15 per cent. Consumer brands' trading profits rose 5 per cent from Pounds 232m to Pounds 244m on turnover up 2 per cent at Pounds 1.38bn (Pounds 1.36bn). Animal health trading profits fell 2 per cent from Pounds 63m to Pounds 62m on turnover of Pounds 337m (Pounds 318m). Clinical Laboratories reported profits up 14 per cent from Pounds 68m to Pounds 77m on turnover of Pounds 609m (Pounds 539m). Net debt fell from Pounds 502m to Pounds 392m, while gearing dropped from 42 per cent to 24 per cent. Earnings per share increased from 24p per share to 27.3 p. Earnings per ADR equity unit were 136.5p (120p). The last quarter dividend is 2.375p per share, making 8.6p for the year (7.7p). Lex, Page 20; Details, Page 22</p>

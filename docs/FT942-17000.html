			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Leading Article: Superhighways for Britain It might seem appropriate that just as the government has decided to scale back the UK's road building programme, the debate is accelerating on the merits of a national fibre-optic grid taking a multimedia 'superhighway' up everyone's front garden. The connections are more than superficial. In terms of capacity, fibre is to copper what motorways were to village lanes. A national fibre network, like the motorway system, can be built incrementally: despite the 'superhighway' tag, it is no more than an upgrading or duplication of existing local telecoms networks (trunk networks are already fibre). There might even be a trade-off between highways and superhighways: current projections of future trunk road requirements, inevitably based on historic trends, make insufficient allowance for the potential of 'teleworking' and video-conferencing to transform work and travel patterns. But the relationship should not be pushed too far. Demand for superhighway services - entertainment, information, education, home shopping - is still largely speculative, particularly at current projections of their price. Even the fate of video-on-demand, the first service set to come on line, is uncertain: punters are unlikely to pay much of a premium to avoid a 10-minute trip to the local video store. Cash cows Nor should a fibre-optic grid be viewed as a unique national asset to be provided by public funds. Telecoms companies are among the largest cash cows the world over: if there is a market for superhighway services, they will be able to raise the money easily enough without troubling hard-pressed taxpayers. State funding ought to be reserved for subsidiary but critical goals such as the application of fibre networks to education. In the UK, the most immediate question is the future of the ban on BT carrying entertainment services over its network. The ban was a deliberate bid by the Thatcher government to encourage cable companies to compete with BT in telecommunications. As such it was justified; but it would be an unjustifiable waste of national resources were it seriously to hold BT back from upgrading its own network. Such an eventuality would not arise if the government announced now its intention to lift the entertainment ban in 1998, which it could do within the terms of the ban itself. Then BT would be free to decide the case for further fibre investment on its commercial merits. If Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is truly concerned at Britain's competitive edge, he should take this step and not risk Britain languishing in the installation of fibre networks. Fair access The other side of that coin, however, is that operators besides BT should have full and fair access to BT's existing and future networks. BT need not have fibre monopoly - indeed it is unlikely to have one, given the welcome investment by cable companies in competing urban fibre networks. But if it goes ahead with further investment in fibre, BT is certain to have Britain's most extensive, and probably its most advanced, superhighway. To ensure a diversity of services, other operators must have access to that network on the same terms as BT itself. Mr Don Cruickshank, the telecommunications regulator, is taking the essential first steps to ensuring such open access. He is forcing BT to account for its network business separately from its retail activities, and to publish cost-based charges for access to specific services needed by competitors requiring access to the BT network. His guiding light is the benefits to be had from competition in terms of diversity of services and downward pressure on prices. This is the right approach. It is important, however, to be clear about the object of the exercise, which is not to emasculate BT but to give consumers maximum choice consistent with an efficient use of existing resources. The upshot will undoubtedly be a smaller market share for BT than the 90 per cent it now commands. But to go further and use the regulatory system to endow new entrants with long-term subsidies at BT's expense would be to resurrect the evils of the old nationalised telecoms regime.</p>

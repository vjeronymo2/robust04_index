Demonstrations are a traditional tool not only of the  unions,  he said, adding that "demonstrations belong to democracy and  democratic political culture as one of the ways people express  themselves." Havel said this was why he would not see the  union-organized Old Town Square demonstration last Tuesday [22  March] as problematic.    In the event, union members, who came to Prague from all  over  the Czech Republic in 400 buses, and filled most of the square,  protested against the employment bill which they saw as leading  to worsening working and social conditions. The bill was passed  by parliament last Wednesday [23 March].    "On the other hand, I became aware of still how much our  unions have to learn to demonstrate in a cultured way," Havel  said, adding that throwing a stone or saying that the Minister  (of Employment and Social Affairs Jindrich Vodicka, who was  prevented by the crowd from addressing the rally) should not  have come, were "not good signs." "This proves we all have to  learn political culture," Havel said.</p>

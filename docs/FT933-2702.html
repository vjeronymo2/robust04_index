			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / People: Morrissey to join Independent Newspaper Publishing, publisher of The Independent and Independent on Sunday newspapers, has appointed Patrick Morrissey as chief executive from October 1 and to the board immediately. Andreas Whittam-Smith, Newspaper Publishing's deputy chairman and editor of The Independent, who announced his intention to stand down as chief executive in July, said yesterday: 'The qualities and experience that Patrick brings us are exactly what we need for our next phase of growth.' Starting his career in marketing at J. Lyons &amp; Co, he eventually moved on to the international division of Beecham Group in 1971, where his posts included regional director. Morrissey, managing director of Mirror Group Newspapers between 1985 and 1990, says that his first task would be to 'develop a business strategy for the next three to five years'. Since leaving MGN, Morrissey, 52, has been managing partner of The Advantage Partnership, working as a consultant to various publishing companies and newspapers, including the Financial Times. David Bell, the FT's chief executive, says Morrissey has 'been very helpful to us, making a significant contribution to refining the overall strategy of the group.' Morrissey himself said that his time at MGN 'gave me experience of the transfer of a newspaper group from loss-making into one making significant profits. But I don't think there are any magical formulas.' Bruce Fireman, a non-exec-utive director who has been on the board from the inception, has resigned.</p>

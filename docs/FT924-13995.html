			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Canary Wharf banks seek more time over Tube cash ADMINISTRATORS of Canary Wharf, the financially troubled east London property development, asked the Government last night for time to revise their offer of a contribution to the costs of building the Jubilee Line Tube extension. The administrators, three partners of the accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young, met Lord Wakeham, the leader of the Lords, who is chairing a government committee on London Docklands. They were accompanied by Lord Griffiths, Lady Thatcher's former adviser, who is now international adviser at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank working for the administrators. The administrators and Canary Wharf's 11 commercial banks had faced a deadline of the end of September for making an offer of private-sector funds for the Tube project. Yesterday they sought a later deadline for two reasons. First, they had believed that the government was planning to move Department of Environment officials to Canary Wharf. If the staff are to stay in central London, as government officials have hinted, the banks need time to assess the implications. Second, the administrators had not understood that the government was opposed in principle to an offer of private-sector funds being conditional on government support. Three weeks ago the banks offered Pounds 390m towards the Jubilee Line's Pounds 1.6bn costs, but the fact that the offer was conditional on civil servants moving to Canary Wharf made the offer unaccceptable to the government.</p>

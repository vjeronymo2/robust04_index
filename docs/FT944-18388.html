			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / People: Coopers partner to EDS After 23 years with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, John Pendlebury has made the geographical and cultural leap to Electronic Data Systems, where he will be leading the US company's 400-strong European consulting practice. Now 50, he has been a managing partner at Coopers for the past few years. He will be based in Brussels with an office in the company's UK headquarters at Stockley Park, west London. Pendlebury expects to spend much of his time on the road working with clients and seeking out talented individuals and companies to help fulfill ambitious plans for the consultancy division. EDS says Pendlebury will 'direct an aggressive campaign dramatically expanding the company's management consulting presence and market share throughout Europe'. EDS also mentions 'aggressive hiring', although an unaggressive Pendlebury said yesterday he hoped other consultancies would not take fright at such language. An engineer with a first degree and doctorate from Cambridge University, Pendlebury's first job was with English Electric, now absorbed into GEC. He worked for Kodak - learning accountancy at night school - before joining Coopers in the early 1970s. He worked for Coopers in the US, Middle East and Russia. EDS, the computing services arm of General Motors of the US, appealed to Pendlebury because of its global presence and strong technology base. He will take the lead in shaping the consultancy around the themes of business process re-engineering, change management and strategic planning. David Thorpe has been appointed managing director of EDS' public sector division, with overall responsibility for developing the company's business with central government and government agencies. He joins EDS from the board of Bull Information Systems UK, where he was managing director of Bull's largest operating unit, the systems intergration and services division.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  said on Monday his government has in fact prepared for a  South-North summit since long ago in expectation of a North  Korean proposal for summit talks.    "This is why I readily accepted Kim Il-song's offer for a  summit as conveyed by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter over  the weekend," the president said.    President Kim made the remarks over a luncheon he hosted at  Chongwadae [presidential offices] for a group of 97 bureau  directors of non-economic government offices.    He said the South proposed to have a working-level meeting  on  Tuesday next week after the issue was meticulously reviewed over  the weekend and Sunday morning.    "We offered to them to have a working-level meeting on June  28 since we don't need to have complex talks and all we have to  agree to is the place and time (of a summit)," Kim said.    He was quick to add, however, that the South cannot tolerate  North Korea going nuclear. "There should be no nuclear arms on  the Korean peninsula under any circumstances," the president  stressed.</p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Call for greater quango scrutiny A former Conservative MP today adds his voice to mounting calls for more effective scrutiny of quangos. In a study published by the free-market Adam Smith Institute, Sir Philip Holland, former MP for Carlton and an ex-ministerial aide, argues that quangos - quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations - should face automatic extinction unless MPs vote to renew them. Identifying more than 2,000 quangos - down from 3,068 in 1979 - Sir Philip calls for legislation forcing such bodies to 'come back to parliament every few years . . . for a renewed lease on life'. 'Unless parliament specifically votes for each one to continue, they will be terminated,' he suggests. Sir Philip calls for the membership and accounts of all quangos to be placed on an open public register. This would disclose the names of all appointees and give details of how much they were paid, what work was undertaken and what action was taken by ministers as a result. But he argues that National Health Service hospital trusts and grant-maintained schools should not be 'hunted as quangos'. The Hunting of the Quango.

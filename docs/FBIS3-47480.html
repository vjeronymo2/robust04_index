			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- The Rice Price Council on  Thursday [13 January] approved a Farm Ministry plan to set the  government selling prices of imported table-use rice at 60 to 84  percent of the average selling price of standard Japanese rice,  ministry officials said.    The approval came when the Agriculture, Forestry and  Fisheries Ministry briefed the government advisory council on  the plan at an informal council meeting, the officials said.    They said the ministry is likely to make an official  decision  next week on the prices of imported rice, which is scheduled to  go on sale nationwide in Japan next month. The imported rice  will be blended with Japanese rice for sale to consumers.    Japan is importing rice on an emergency basis due to a bad  crop in 1993.    The prices will be based on two categories of rice --  long-grain and short- or medium-grain -- and on the country of  origin, the officials said.    Among the imports, rice from the United States and top-grade  rice from China, both short- or medium-grain, will be sold for  16,898 yen per 60 kilograms, 84 percent of the average selling  price of standard Japanese rice.    Long-grain non-glutinous rice from Thailand will be sold for  11,992 yen per 60 kilograms, 60 percent of the Japanese rice  price.    Major supermarket chains, meanwhile, have started studying  plans for selling imported rice to consumers.    Daiei Inc. said it plans to sell blends of imported and  domestic rice and expects to eventually replace 100 percent  top-grade domestic rice with blended rice.    Daiei officials said 100 percent imported rice is likely to  be sold at prices 30 to 50 percent lower than domestic rice.    Ito-Yokado Co. said it plans to test-market imported rice at  limited outlets, beginning in February.    Restaurant chain Skylark Co. declined comment on the  possibility of cutting menu prices by using imported rice.    Frozen food manufacturer Nichirei Inc. also declined comment  on possible price cuts for its products through the use of  imported rice. The company last year raised its prices for  frozen rice-based foods.</p>

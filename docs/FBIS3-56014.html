			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Sidorov report: "Where `Humanitarian' Bombings Will </F> Lead"]    [Text] NATO countries' heads of state and government would  be better off leaving the topic of the war in the former  Yugoslavia, and in Bosnia and Herzegovina in particular, well  alone. Once again the North Atlantic alliance has demonstrated  its powerlessness and internal discord over this problem. This  is how a Berlin newspaper evaluated the results of the NATO  Council emergency session.    On the other hand, a number of French and British mass media  sources believe the time is ripe for more resolute action by the  bloc. The "France-3" television company and THE DAILY  TELEGRAPH, for instance, reported with reference to Western  officials that air strikes against targets in Bosnia and  Herzegovina will in fact be carried out over the next few days.  Mention is made in particular of the allegedly blockaded  humanitarian route into Srebrenica and the Serb positions around  Sarajevo.    So what has actually happened? Has the North Atlantic bloc  really made direct moves toward open military intervention in  Bosnia? Naturally, there is no direct reference to air strikes  or the decision taken in the concluding document of the NATO  Council session. The NATO partners merely confirmed their  "readiness to participate in launching air strikes in the event  of continued gunfire by Sarajevo and attacks on servicemen from  UN forces." At the same time, important changes have occurred  in the approaches to the decision on the use of air power.  Whereas previously the main ringleader militating for the use  of air power was the United States, while France and Britain  expressed opposition, believing that were this to happen their  "blue helmets" would become targets for partisans, now both  Paris and London favor strikes from the air. As for the United  States, Washington seems to have swapped roles with its allies.  Commenting on the outcome of the session, President Clinton  noted cautiously that "NATO could be embarking on a very risky  path."    Most experts are inclined to assess the declaration on the  readiness to carry out bombings as pressure tactics on the  Bosnian sides prior to the new round of talks to be held in a  week's time. That is, it is basically a matter of a peculiar  military-diplomatic game. However, there is in this game a  highly important factor which often remains outside observers'  field of vision.    Military figures like General Jean Cot, commander of the  French "blue helmets" contingent, often get carried away with  purely military logic. Let us recall the general's highly  debatable conviction that "only force will stop the war in the  Balkans." Civilian officials from the UN Protection Force  [UNPROFOR] in their turn suggest that direct military action  will signify an end to humanitarian operations and hopes of a  peaceful settlement. The conflict between General J. Cot and  Cedric Thornberry, leader of the civilian mission, escalated a  short while ago and led to the latter's recent resignation. It  is J. Cot who has repeatedly submitted the issue of deploying  air power for discussion at UNPROFOR headquarters, striving to  attain the right to take a decision on this autonomously. The  chaos which would arise if this right were used even once is  obvious even to the uninitiated. UNPROFOR would then appear to  the warring parties not as neutral but as a warring side, an  ally for some and an enemy for others. The line between bombing  raids "for the purpose of facilitating humanitarian operations"  and air strikes aimed at weakening the potential of one or other  side is too fine.</p>

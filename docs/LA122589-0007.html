			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> VOLCANO MONITORED FOR MOLTEN ROCK  </P> <P> Although Redoubt Volcano has been fairly quiet in recent days since it exploded  back to life this month, geologists said Sunday magma, or molten rock, may be  very near the volcano's crater floor.  </P> <P> But Steve Brantley, a geologist with the Alaska Volcano Observatory, said  scientists will have to wait until poor weather conditions improve for them to  fly over the volcano to confirm their suspicions.  </P> <P> The crater floor is estimated to be about 200 feet from the volcano's summit,  Brantley said.  </P> <P> Observatory officials have been monitoring the volcano around the clock since  it began rumbling earlier this month.  </P> <P> The latest series of eruptions at the 10,197-foot volcano, 110 miles southwest  of Anchorage, began Dec. 14, sending ash plumes several thousand feet into the  air and temporarily grounding thousands of frustrated holiday travelers. Air  travel has since returned to normal with no reports of ash for several days.  </P> <P> Brantley said subtle changes in the type and number of earthquakes at the  volcano's summit suggest the presence of molten rock.  </P></p>

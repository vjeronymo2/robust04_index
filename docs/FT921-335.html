			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Britain's baking industry fights for every crumb: Fierce competition and declining demand from consumers threatens a shake-out among UK bread producers Food manufacturing is supposed to sail through recessions, because consumers always have to eat. But for Britain's Pounds 3bn-a-year baking industry, these are proving some of the toughest times since the invention of sliced bread. The bakers' plight challenges conventional assumptions about the advantages of size and cost efficiency in a mature sector. It also offers striking evidence of how far the rise of powerful supermarket chains has transformed the balance of competition in Britain's food industry. Cut-throat competition has slashed the retail price of standard white loaves  -the biggest-selling type of bread - from about 40p each to less than 30p in many stores. The profits and share prices of Associated British Foods (ABF) and Ranks Hovis McDougall (RHM), the country's largest bakers, have been clobbered, and many smaller companies appear to be clinging on by their fingernails. With UK bread consumption in long-term decline and surplus production capacity estimated at 10-15 per cent, the stage seems set for a shake-out of the kind which forced Spillers out of the business in 1978. Says Mr Mike Handley, managing director of RHM's bakery division: 'There is just too much equipment out there making bread people don't want to eat.' ABF and RHM together account for about two-thirds of bread sales and are the only bakers with nationwide brands and distribution systems. Both have invested heavily to cut costs by concentrating production in fewer, bigger plants equipped to bake as many as 8,000 loaves an hour - more than 10 times the maximum capacity 20 years ago. Yet size has not guaranteed invulnerability. Baking neither requires sophisticated technology, nor depends on expensive equipment. Furthermore, scale economies are quickly exhausted. 'A bakery doesn't have to be national to be efficient,' says Mr Garry Weston, chairman of ABF. 'You can be as efficient with one plant as with 20.' That has allowed about a dozen small independent bakers to challenge the industry goliaths by cutting prices to the bone. The Davids keep costs low by operating only regional distribution facilities and buying flour from small independent millers for less than ABF and RHM, which have in-house milling operations. The Davids' trump card is that they can survive on wafer-thin margins. As family businesses, they have leaner overheads than ABF and RHM and do not need to earn the financial returns that the City expects of the two big companies. But the small companies, many of which have built new plants in the past few years, could never have succeeded without the large supermarket groups. As these have come to dominate bread sales, the big bakers' control over the market has grown steadily weaker. Their grip began to loosen in the 1970s, when two national baking strikes halted bread supplies. Since then, the trend has been accelerated by the spread of supermarkets' own in-store bakeries and by their growing reliance on 'own label' packaged bread, now more than 40 per cent of sales. These developments have undermined the big bakers' brands and their bargaining power with supermarket buyers, who have been increasingly ready to switch orders to the independents unless their terms are met. This ought to be good news for consumers. However, there are growing signs that pressure to compete on price has led to compromises on quality. Says Mr David Lang, a respected industry analyst with stockbrokers Henderson Crosthwaite: 'A lot of the cheaper bread on sale is muck.' That is a further setback for an industry desperate to persuade an already sceptical market that its product is rich in nutrition. Although the claim is backed by scientific evidence, opinion polls regularly find many consumers consider ordinary bread unhealthy. Despite growth in demand for ready-made sandwiches, the British eat less bread than any other European nation. In western Germany, where bread is double the price in Britain, consumption is twice as high and has grown by a sixth in the past 15 years. UK consumption has fallen by about as much in the same period. Many factors have contributed to bread's down-market image in the UK - among them the disastrous 'styrofoam' loaf produced after EC membership forced millers to switch from North American to lower-protein European wheat in the 1970s. However, producers have not made much effort to change consumers' perceptions for the better. Indeed, marketing has long played poor relation to the relentless drive to produce ever larger volumes of bread at lower cost. 'The people running the bakeries now aren't bakers, they're engineers. They're less interested in how bread tastes than in making it consistently.' In most other areas of food manufacturing, it is accepted wisdom that high margins and clout with retailers depend on strong brands. Many leading manufacturers routinely spend 10 per cent or more of sales on advertising and brand promotion. By contrast, the entire UK bread industry spent a paltry Pounds 7.9m on advertising last year, according to Media Register-Meal, which measures advertising spending. Mr Weston of ABF argues that heavy brand support is hard to justify because bread varieties are difficult to differentiate and innovations easily copied. However, this view is challenged by the experience of Warburton's, a Bolton-based regional baker which is the market leader in Lancashire. The company has established a strong brand identity, based on a reputation for outstanding product quality backed by substantial television advertising. Unlike its main competitors, Warburton's refuses to make own-label products for supermarkets or to offer discounts - even though its loaves sell for twice as much as their cheapest rivals. 'I don't want our bread sold cheaply,' says Mr Jonathan Warburton, marketing director. 'There's no point in offering what the rest of the industry offers already.' Other bakers, while admiring Warburton's achievements, argue that it is a special case. The company serves a limited region, its local roots run deep, and its advertising makes much of the skills developed over five generations of family ownership. Still, there are signs that the industry leaders are taking marketing more seriously. Mr Handley of RHM is a marketing man by background while Mr Henry Jackson, head of ABF's Allied Bakeries until his sudden death in January, was recruited from Mars, the confectionery maker renowned for its marketing expertise. ABF is sponsoring a 'generic' advertising campaign for bread, while RHM has stepped up its advertising expenditure recently. However, rebuilding brands is expensive, while resources are limited by poor profits and - in RHM's case - by concern about falling prey to a hostile takeover. In any case, the big bakers' immediate preoccupation is with restoring price disciplines. The recent collapse of one of the small independent millers suggests a capacity shake-out may be starting. But rehabilitating bread's image - let alone persuading consumers that it is a quality product which justifies premium prices - is bound to take longer.</p>

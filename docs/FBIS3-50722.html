From 25 to 28 January, Cuba will once again be the stage for  the largest expression of intercontinental solidarity when it  welcomes the participants to the Fourth Latin American and  Caribbean Meeting for Solidarity, Sovereignty,  Self-Determination, and the Lives of our Peoples.    The precedents for the meeting in Havana are similar  meetings  held in the capitals of Ecuador and Colombia in 1988 and 1989,  respectively, as well as the Sao Paulo summit in 1991. The  impact of the new political, economic, and military realigning  of the world for the people and nations of Latin America and the  Caribbean; U.S. policies on the threshold of the 21st century;  and the role of people's movements in establishing democratic  alternatives, among other things, are some of the political  issues to be discussed in the meeting.    In terms of the economy, the organizers of the event have  scheduled debates and conferences regarding regional reinsertion  into the global economy; the effects of neoliberalism on the  Latin American and Caribbean peoples; and the peoples'  alternatives for development and integration and their  experiences and action programs. More than 1,000 people will  attend the event, which will be fully underwritten by the  participants. They will be lodged in the Pan American Village.  The event will be held in the Convention Center.    In order to give direction to all the actions and results of  the meeting, the continental organizing committee has called for  the reactivation and strengthening of national committees. The  national committees have among their main goals collecting funds  to cover transportation costs and to fully underwrite the event,  which is an expression of solidarity and material support for  Cuba.</p>

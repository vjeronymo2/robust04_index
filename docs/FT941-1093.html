			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Markets: A week to satisfy the gloomiest Jonahs - Wall Street Rising interest rates, fresh revelations in the Whitewater affair, an assassination in Mexico and the threat of war between the two Koreas: this week's news was bad enough to satisfy the gloomiest pessimist. No wonder shares on Wall Street took a tumble. Yet, the surprise was not that the Dow Jones industrial average fell 75 points in four days of trading. It was that share prices did not fall further. After all, this is a bull market that has looked vulnerable ever since the Federal Reserve reversed five years of policy in early February by raising short-term interest rates from 3 per cent to 3.25 per cent. Just before the Fed acted, the Dow was flirting with 4,000 and the Standard &amp; Poor's appeared headed inexorably for 500. Since then, the two indices have not looked like getting near those landmarks again. Every time the market has taken a step forward, something has sent it two steps back. More often than not, that something has been another rise in bond yields. These have been rising because, in spite of statistics and analysis which suggest the contrary, investors in Treasury bonds are convinced that the recent rapid pace of economic growth will eventually feed through into a rate of higher inflation later this year. While stock market investors are more sanguine about the inflationary threat, they have been unable to ignore the depth of bond market concern, or the potential impact on equities. Consequently, share prices have been stuck in limbo over the last two months. Almost everyone agrees that since the Fed raised rates, stocks were unlikely to be be heading much higher in the near future. At the same time, there has been a growing apprehension on Wall Street that the market was becoming increasingly susceptible to a big sell-off, the sort that might be triggered by a nasty and unforeseen external shock. Surely this week provided an ample supply of those? Yet, there are good reasons why the markets ultimately handled them so well. Taking take them one by one, the rise in interest rates was hardly unexpected, although once again the exact timing of the move caught the markets by surprise. On Tuesday, the Fed's Open Market Committee was in session. But, contrary to the expectation that the FOMC would sanction a rate increase, the Fed intervened in the bank lending market just before midday to keep short-term interest rates at their old target of 3.25 per cent. Analysts immediately said the action signalled no change in policy. Yet, minutes later, the Fed announced it was, indeed, raising short-term rates, from 3.25 per cent to 3.5 per cent. The market reaction was instantaneous - bond and stocks prices surged. It seemed a puzzling response, but a second monetary policy tightening from the Fed had already been priced into stocks and bonds, so the rush of buying was mostly an expression of investors' relief that the dirty deed was done. If the markets took the Fed rate increase in their stride, they were less assured in their reaction to the latest developments in the Whitewater affair. On Thursday, President Clinton announced he would hold an evening press conference to counter some of the more serious allegations. But nerves were further shaken when a leading Republican in Congress claimed he had new evidence on Whitewater damaging to the president. Ultimately, however, neither the president's briefing, nor the congressman's supposedly damaging revelations, appeared to advance the story much further and, by Friday morning, the markets had moved on. As for the two international shocks of the week - the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, leading candidate in the upcoming Mexican presidential election, and growing tensions on the Korean peninsula - were disturbing, but were not enough to undermine investor sentiment seriously. Of the two, Korea has the greater potential to disrupt sentiment in the future, particularly if extra US military forces have to be sent to the region. The situation in Mexico, however, created more initial problems for US markets. Yet, while the death of Murrieta, coming so soon after the peasant uprising in Chiapas, reinforced the image that Mexico was mired in a phase of political instability, it did nothing to alter the economic and investment fundamentals of the country. Once the initial shock of the assassination passes, US markets should be able to concentrate on more pressing concerns at home: inflation, rising interest rates, and an economy that may be growing too fast for its own good.  ------------------------------- Monday      3864.85  -  30.80 Tuesday     3862.55  -  02.30 Wednesday   3869.46  +  06.91 Thursday    3821.09  -  48.37 Friday      3774.73  -  46.36  -------------------------------</p>

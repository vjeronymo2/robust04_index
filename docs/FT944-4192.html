			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Democracy wins in VAT vote uproar Sir, Why all the uproar surrounding the defeat of the UK government's plans to increase value added tax on domestic fuel? Surely this is how proper democracy should work? A measure which is clearly unpopular with the majority of the electorate, and is now not necessary because of the improved borrowing requirement, should not be allowed to proceed. MPs should not be forced to vote against their beliefs and constituents' wishes for narrow party interests. Were Parliament more representative of the electorate, bad and unwanted measures would be put forward less frequently. The various political parties, whose policies seem increasingly similar, would be obliged to work together, and we might get away from the appalling confrontational system which serves us so badly and continues to exacerbate the divisions in our society. Unfortunately, while we the electorate are so apathetic on these matters and mainly inherit the way we vote - against, rather than for, anything - we are stuck with the stale dead-end status quo, whichever of the two main parties is in power.

			<p>BFN     [Text] YEREVAN ("Lragir", "Azg" dailies), 04/23/94 --  Shutting down the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant (ANPP) has been  considered as the only correct decision for quite a long period  of time. Only later, gradually, the idea of reopening the plant  arouse again.    RA [Republic of Armenia] Vice Prime Minister Vigen  Chitechyan declared during a press conference yesterday, the  decision of reopening the nuclear power plant is not subject for  further revisions and the reconstruction will be finished by the  end of the year. About 70-100 million US dollars are necessary  for implementation of the project, the majority of this money  being the price of nuclear fuel. RA government is currently  carrying negotiations with the government of Russian Federation  on purchasing the necessary fuel. Project's first stage is to  operate the plant at the planned level of operation. Only then  the security operations are to be carried out. Only second,  newer, reactor is currently being prepared for reconstruction.  ANPP Chief Engineer Gagik Markosyan said, reconstruction of the  two reactors simultaneously is neither physically nor  economically possible in the current stage. Reconstruction work  is actively implemented.    Meanwhile "Azg" reports, not all questions were clarified  during the press conference. Particularly, concrete date when  the plant will start producing electricity was not mentioned.  Mr. Chitechyan reported that preparation work is finished, and  special programs are now being devised based on the conclusions  of Russian specialists.    "We produced 755 MGWt/h of electricity on April 21; this  figure would increase by another 400 MGWt/h in case plant's one  reactor is reopened", Vice Prime Minister said.</p>

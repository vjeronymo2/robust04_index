			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "And Now a Recess"] </F>   [Text] This kind of parliament, if it is in the  interest of the ruling party, can remain until the next  elections--without doing anything. And Lilic could say that  Yugoslavia needs a parliament that it will be proud of, if it  goes down along with the dinar.    The federal parliament--after it tried last week to  extricate  itself from four months of a blockade--became entangled even  deeper in the quicksand of complete uncertainty. Just as the  Council of Citizens ended its recess and began a session on 2  March, Radoman Bozovic declared another recess on the evening of  the very next day.    When Bozovic declares a recess, it has never turned out  well,  at least not so far. The experience of this chamber of  parliament and its current membership confirms that any other  miracles are possible after a recess.    On the night of 31 May-1 June 1993, for instance, bloody  demonstrations broke out in front of parliament. The fierce  clash between police and demonstrators in front of the Federal  Assembly was preceded by an incident in the Assembly building.  Bozovic, as always when he is at a dead end or someone tells him  "That is necessary," in one classic knockout arbitrated--with a  recess. Even after the Assembly was disbanded on 20 October,  when Slobodan Milosevic said that the people needed a parliament  that it would be proud of, the session of the Council of  Citizens ended again with a recess.    Bozovic apparently has all the rights to that patent. The  people's deputies have not yet come to ask whether he is doing  it all himself or whether someone is helping him. It is said,  admittedly, that his dossier, after the ministerial scandal, in  which Bozovic played the role of the third man, is still on  Slobodan Milosevic's desk. Allegedly, whenever the president of  Serbia needs that role he reminds Bozovic that 700,000 German  marks have not been found yet and that an investigation could  begin. Milosevic, according to that scenario, puts pressure on  Bozovic and the latter subsequently puts pressure on whomever he  needs to. It seems that he does not even have to be particularly  persuaded to do so.    In contrast to a comic strip, the situation with  continuations in the Federal Assembly is incomparably more  complicated: They are always announced, but they are never  seriously meant. After all, some special customs prevail in  parliament, along the lines of "It may be, but it does not have  to mean anything." Admittedly, Bozovic more or less promised a  continuation "as soon as possible." It was clear that that  promise was completely consistent with the promise by his  Socialist colleague Milomir Minic, who tried to use the quarrel  between the Serbian and Montenegrin Radicals to appeal to the  people, who are viewing this performance comfortably and  directly. "The people are good at taking the measure of  political options which, according to our (the Socialists')  understanding, are a transitory phenomenon on the Serbian  political scene." The people are asking the Socialists "to be  involved in the key issues," and those, according to Minic, are  peace, economic renewal, the functioning of a law-governed  state, and the unification of political forces in the country.    Except for the "two eyes in the head"--the deputies of the  Socialist Party of Serbia and the Democratic Party of Socialists  of Montenegro, who are fraternally pressing each other in an  apparently increasingly firmer embrace and more and more  exaggeratedly offering proof of their mutual love--all the  others in the federal parliament are deeply affected by quarrels  and schisms. Kilibarda's four Populists, with all their labor,  are still unsuccessfully trying to recall the interests of the  people and the state.    The "Socialist fortune hunters," as Seselj honored his  former  allies last Tuesday, and the Radical "street thugs and  primitives," as they were already characterized on Wednesday by  the Socialist Party of Serbia in an official statement for the  public, have taken off the gloves and a fight with bare fists  could even start now. The ring has been moved from the Serbian  parliament, where it was in the fall, while the Radicals tried  unsuccessfully to overthrow Sainovic's government, to the  Federal Assembly.    The conflict cannot be disguised any longer: the conflict is  here. Like every bad alliance or bad marriage, the link between  the Socialists and the Radicals apparently also has to collapse  with curses, hatred, and a deafening uproar. Since such scenes  imply an audience, both the Radicals and the Socialists think  that it is good to have the performance take place in public:  the people will be able to choose the better ones.    It seems that SOMEONE has upset the born Montenegrin, of  Serbian origin, and the warlord who is still proud of his  confiscated title today, who were constantly caught until last  summer in the act of illicit love. Nothing is left of their  mutual respect. The final scene of the session that was  interrupted last Wednesday (before Bozovic used a recess to  prevent something more than a quarrel) shows that at the heart  of the parliament there are two angry and merciless enemies,  whose quarrels, or something worse than them, are yet to come.  Almost driven mad by Seselj's insistence that he stay at the  rostrum, Bozovic, perhaps with the intention of keeping the  "people" from hearing everything that he would say, pressed the  key to turn off the speaker, but poured into in his microphone a  whole heap of accusations at his expense.    "Your insults are over.... I hope that you are civilized  enough for a deputy's seat.... You are uncivilized.... You have  misused the podium enough. I will demand that they remove  you...." Bozovic got angry, so that finally Seselj retorted with  a single sentence, in a similar style, that there would never be  an end to Bozovic's insolence.    All of this, however, is only details, or at least the  outward manifestation of the serious drama through which this  parliamentary membership is passing. It is becoming more and  more obvious that this Federal Assembly is not lucky with the  people's deputies. Just when one thinks that finally it will  start to do its job, to pass at least some of the laws which we  cannot have done without for a long time now or to deprive the  third Yugoslavia of the application of regulations that were in  effect in its past, the deadlock appears inevitable. It is not  possible to move out of the deadlock to which parliament is  constantly returned by the quarrels and incidents.    After the split between the Socialists and Radicals, it  seemed that the opposition would take fate into its hands in  parliament. With the collapse of that alliance, the ruling  parties of Serbia and Montenegro lost a majority in the lower  chamber. The illusion, however, was only a parliamentary  episode, and the opposition deputies, for the most part, were  not capable enough to take advantage of that split. In the  meantime, while parliament's work was blocked, the "political  police," publicly accused of causing conflict within the  opposition parties, did not sit with their hands folded. Whether  someone outside was undermining the political parties or whether  they, like all other organisms, were "multiplying" from  themselves, is less important than the already noted fact that  divisions within them, usually, indicate new elections.    In regard to what is happening in the Federal Assembly,  perhaps one of those two historic sentences of Slobodan  Milosevic is not unimportant (the first is the one from Kosovo,  "No one should beat you"), uttered precisely in parliament, as a  message to the Rakovica workers: "And now, everyone to his job."  Any good reader of the message realized that the job applied  considerably more broadly and deeply than the auditorium in  which it was mentioned.    Perhaps the "job" had to do with the battle for renewed  prestige in parliament? Since the lost majority with which they  were faced last October, the Serbian and Montegrin  Socialists--as unsurpassable technicians of power--gained (it  does not matter whether it was on their own or by assignment)  the desired balance of power, in their favor, to such an extent  that they virtually no longer needed the opposition. Of the 20  DEPOS (Democratic Movement of Serbia) deputies in the Council of  Citizens, 11 (whom the SPO [Serbian Renewal Movement] were  expelled from the party but who nevertheless succeeded in  keeping their places on the benches) are "renegades," seven  declared themselves to be SPO deputies, and Milorad Savicevic  and Pavle Nikolic declared themselves to be "non-party figures."  The leader of the SPO, who is demanding a separate deputies'  office for his wing of the party, made his seat in the Council  of Republics conditional upon a new discussion of depriving the  11 rebels of their seats.    The attitude among the Democrats is even apparent in the  Assembly restaurant. The new leader, Dr. Zoran Djindjic,  represents that party in the Council of Republics, and the old  one, Dr. Dragoljub Micunovic, is still considered the leader of  the deputies' group in the Council of Citizens. Dr. Miroljub  Labus and Miodrag Perisic sit at the table with Djindjic, and  Dr. Ivan Vujacic and Desimir Tosic with Micunovic. Djordje  Zecevic was also absent from this session, while Dr. Dragan  Domazet also went abroad--i.e., the two wings of the Democrats.    The Radicals, proud of their party discipline, although they  expelled from their ranks three deputies from the Montenegrin  SRS [Serbian Radical Party], did not succeed in having granted  the desire to deprive them of their seats. Allowing the  Montenegrin Radicals to complaint about Seselj, Bozovic, "in the  name of defending the status of deputies, rules of procedure,  and laws," "verified the will of the Council," and returned the  previously denied seats to the Committee on Mandate-Immunity  Issues for further consideration. Then the chairman of that  committee, Radical Jovan Glamocanin, suddenly submitted his  resignation, and the vice president of the Council of Citizens,  Maja Gojkovic, saying that she had not agreed with Bozovic for a  long time, also ostentatiously left the deputies' bench.    The Federal Assembly has been faced with this practice for  the first time: Deputies refuse to participate in committees and  commissions, but remain in parliament. In the corridors of the  Assembly, the question of who will be vicpresident of the  Council of Citizens has been answered by the joke that it will  be Radmilo Bogdanovic, who was re-elected vice president of the  upper chamber that day. Recommended by the Socialists on both  sides (the signatures of Radoje Kontic and Milos Radulovic are  prominent among the Montenegrin signatures), Bogdanovic was only  denied the votes of the Montenegrin Radicals and two Democratic  Party deputies.    The Council of Republics, on which representatives of the  opposition counted so much, has been strengthened in a way that  few people could have expected. In addition to Bogdanovic, it  now also has two Zorans--Andjelkovic and Solokovic. With a rump  composition (16 instead of 20), the Serbian Assembly was able to  choose its fiercest fighters. No one paid attention to Novak  Kilibarda's criticism that no chamber was constituted with a  rump composition anywhere in the world, and that this one should  not be constituted when it was reduced by 10 percent of the  deputies. Thus, this Council, as in the past, can adopt whatever  it cares to routinely and without debate: The majority is always  powerful. After all, even before the blockade this chamber was  able to choose federal judges, and Dragoslav Jovanovic as  governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia, or, as now, to  adopt the federal budget and later, when it did not get through  the other chamber, to get over it and go on.    With that kind of Council of Republics and that kind of  Council of Citizens, the federal parliament--if it is in the  interest of the ruling parties and the current regime--can wait  for the next regular elections without doing anything at all. Of  course, if the leader of the Radicals does not intend to turn  his clash with the federal prime minister about "secret dinners"  and "kisses with Dafina" into a demand for the replacement of  Kontic's cabinet. It is difficult to say whether Seselj would  obtain support from the ranks of the fragile and internally  undermined opposition, since only seven deputies raised their  hands for his proposal for a vote on violation of the rules of  procedure.    What could the head of state do in that case? Could Zoran  Lilic, on his own or "on assignment," one evening, in the  leading news story on state television, be the first one to  pound his fist on the table and then say that Yugoslavs needed a  parliament that they could be proud of? He could--why not--if he  used the contrived recovery of the dinar and the economy. If the  new governor really holds out and does not allow printing money  for the needs of the budget, and prohibits borrowing for the  budget if there is not enough foreign exchange to cover it (and  there is no coverage for March), and, all in all, succeeds in  surviving until the middle of the year, when many people expect  an end for him like Panic's and Cosic's, a celebration has to be  arranged for the people. So far they have not had any better  entertainment from replacements and elections.</p>

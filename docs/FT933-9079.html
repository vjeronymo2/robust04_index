			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / BCCI lawsuit wins backing TOUCHE Ross, the liquidator of Bank of Credit and Commerce International, has received what it considers a powerful mandate to pursue its legal action against the Bank of England. More than 5,000 depositors have signed and returned agreements to assign claims worth Pounds 400m in all to the liquidators. This is substantially more than was thought necessary to justify pursuit of the action, according to a letter sent out by the liquidators. The Bank of England has been granted an extension until September 1 to serve its defence of the action. Originally the defence should have been made by July 5 but the Bank asked for more time. Depositors have been told that a civil court decision in Luxembourg, which is needed before payments can be made from the proposed compensation agreement, will not be made until October 27. Touche Ross has been frustrated by the time taken by the Luxembourg court to consider the agreement. The court has found only two and a half day's court time since May for legal arguments. The compensation package worked out between the liquidators and BCCI's Abu Dhabi majority shareholders has been consistently opposed by a number of creditors. However, a large majority of those who replied when canvassed voted to accept the deal in which Abu Dhabi would contribute a minimum of Dollars 1.7bn. The referendum had been demanded by the Luxembourg court. The delays meant that staged payments of Dollars 800m in December 1992 and Dollars 500m in June this year, promised by Abu Dhabi into the pooling agreement, did not go ahead because they were conditional on the approval of the agreement in the UK, Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands. The package has already been approved in British and Cayman courts. Liquidators have three principal civil suits outstanding. One is against The Bank of England; another is against the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Khalid Bin Mahfouz, its former chief operating officer, who is also a former shareholder of BCCI; the third is against the former BCCI auditors, Price Waterhouse and Ernst and Whinney (now Ernst and Young). Ernst and Whinney audited part of the bank until 1987. The action against the Bank of England is unprecedented and may rest on the liquidators' ability to prove that the Bank was negligent in not acting earlier against BCCI when it told of problems in 1985.</p>

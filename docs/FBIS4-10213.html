			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Senate of the Republic is tied up. There is  mistrust. [Senate] President Firmin Jean-Louis is being keenly  criticized and is suspected of working to get named prime  minister. Yvon Gislain, vice-president of the legal office  [title as heard], explains that he can convene the Senate if he  wishes. Here is a report by Daly Valet:    [Begin recording, in Creole] [Valet] It is true that the  [Senate] office presided over by Bernard Sansaricq did not  follow Senate regulations to the letter when it was being set  up. It is true that this office trampled underfoot certain  articles of the nation's Constitution. It is true that a climate  of fear, worry, and insecurity was established at the Senate. It  is also true, however, that Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, president  of the legitimate [Senate] office, is not a wholly innocent  party in the Senate crisis. Thus said several parliamentarians  who have broken their silence to condemn the dilatory maneuvers  being effected by Sen. Firmin Jean-Louis in order to prevent the  Senate from holding sessions. This time, the reactions come from  Sen. Firmin Jean-Louis's side itself.    Sen. Yvon Gislain, vice-president [title as heard] of the  legitimate Senate office, condemns the fact that the office of  which he is a member has not created any means for holding  sessions at the Senate since [acting Prime Minister] Robert  Malval was ratified.    [Gislain] The Senate crisis began back at the time of  Malval's rafification. From the time Malval was ratified,  nothing has been done at the Senate. There is an office, of  which I am a member. I admit that the office has never taken any  initiative to hold further sessions. Other elements within the  Senate take the initiative to form a second office without  respecting the constitutional norms regarding the Senate's  internal regulations. This is what has made this office  ineffectual. It is really unconstitutional. I think, however,  something must be done so that we can come up with something  because the country is collapsing due to the fact that the  Senate remains totally tied up.    [Valet] Rumor has it that through the empty-seat policy at  the Senate, Sen. Jean-Louis is defending his personal interests.  Some say Sen. Jean-Louis is seeking to become prime minister.  According to such people, this is why he does not want to hold  Senate sessions. We have said: Well, these are rumors that  Firmin Jean-Louis has not confirmed.    The vice-president of the legitimate Senate Office, however,  calls on Sen. Jean-Louis to hold sessions so that personal  interests can be set aside for the benefit of the nation's  interests, which are suffering.    [Gislain] The whole thing is a question of holding sessions.  If sessions are held, the [parliamentary] plan will be passed.  It will be ratified, because there will always be a majority  that will allow the plan to pass. [passage omitted]    [Valet] After Deputy Duly Brutus, [Deputy] Antoine Joseph,  and [Senator] Gislain, the ball is now in Sen. Jean-Louis's  court, and he can do one of two things: either he will decide to  create the means to hold Senate sessions or he will decide to  let rumor continue to claim that, at the Senate, he is defending  his own, personal interests.

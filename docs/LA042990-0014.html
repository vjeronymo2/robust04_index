			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: IN BRIEF:;  </P> <P> *** "PRETTY WOMAN," EMI.  </P> <P> These days pop-rock sound tracks are usually unsatisfying packages featuring  one or two likable songs and the rest filler.  </P> <P> But this one, from the hit romantic comedy, is loaded with gems, from David  Bowie's updated "Fame 90" and Natalie Cole's "Wild Women Do" to Red Hot Chili  Pepper's "Show Me Your Soul." But there are two sappy clunkers -- by Jane  Wiedlin and Peter Cetera. The gem of this collection, of course, is Roy  Orbison's classic rendition of the title song. DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

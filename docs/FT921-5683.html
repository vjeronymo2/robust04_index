			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: DG Bank calls in auditors THE financially-stretched DG Bank has called in a firm of auditors to investigate the activities of the bank and its management and supervisory boards between January 1989 to mid-1991. The precise scope of the investigation by Deutsche Treuhand Gesellschaft, a German accountancy firm, has not been made public, although during the period under review DG Bank became embroiled in disputes with French banks over bond sales and repurchase agreements, ultimately requiring DG Bank to take heavy write-offs. DG Bank would only confirm yesterday, in response to an article in the Spiegel news magazine, that the investigation was under way and had been approved by management and supervisory boards. In October last year, Mr Bernd Thiemann, the bank's chief executive since early 1991, announced a DM1.4bn (Dollars 840m) cash injection and said the bank would only break even at the operating level.</p>

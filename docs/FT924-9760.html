			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: Why MPs will have to vote twice MPs will vote twice at the end of the debate. First on a Labour amendment that further consideration of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill should await the outcome of the Edinburgh meeting of the European Council next month. Then on the government motion. If the amendment were carried, the government motion would be dead and MPs would be asked to vote again on the Labour amendment. A Yes vote on the Labour amendment by 324 MPs, or fewer depending on the number of abstentions, would carry it. Tory rebels might opt collectively to support the Labour amendment in the first vote. If the amendment were then carried, they could logically support the amended government motion in the second. If the the Labour amendment fell, then hard-line Tory rebels would probably vote against the original government motion, which gives a green light for the Maastricht bill. That represents the rebels' best chance to stymie the process. Soft Tory rebels would probably abstain.</p>

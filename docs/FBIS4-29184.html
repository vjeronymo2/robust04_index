			<p>BFN     [Text] The "Kayu-Kai," which consists of senior leaders of  various factions of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], held a  meeting at the party headquarters on the afternoon of 14 June to  exchange views on measures to deal with the current political  situation. Among the participants were Seiroku Kajiyam, former  party general secretary, and Koko Sato, former chairman of the  party policy affairs research council. As a result, they  reached a consensus that the party should insist on submitting a  motion of no-confidence in the cabinet following the passage of  the draft budget for fiscal 1994. They confirmed the plan to  support the party executives under President Yosuke Kono, who  plan to submit the no- confidence motion. After the meeting,  Sato and other leaders met with President Kono to convey their  views.    Participants in the meeting stated one after another their  views against the Hata cabinet. For example, one participant  said: "The Hata cabinet is a minority administration endorsed by  the fewest Dietmen ever. Therefore, the cabinet deserves a  no-confidence motion."</p>

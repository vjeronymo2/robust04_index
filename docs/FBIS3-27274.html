			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Ranan Huang and Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Boston, Feb. 18 (CNA) -- A Ranking Republic of  China [ROC] Government official said here Friday that Taiwan is  willing to play a role in the maintenance of peace and security  in Asia.    "As an Asia-Pacific nation, the Republic of China cannot  stay  outside regional development. We are prepared to make our  contributions to Asia-Pacific security and economic  cooperation," Jason Hu, director-general of the Government  Information Office, said in a speech delivered at the Yen-Ching  Library of Harvard University.    In the speech titled "The Prospects for a changing Asia: A  Case for Open-Style Regionalism," Hu stressed that "we are  willing to play an active and appropriate role under the more  inclusive and dynamic political and economic framework that is  taking shape in the Asia-Pacific region."    However, the government spokesman pointed out a minimum  military balance across the Taiwan Strait must be sustained so  that the 21 million people on Taiwan can live free from worry  and devote themselves to economic development and political  reform.    "It can also give us a sense of security in dealing with the  People's Republic of China, and foster the confidence to promote  positive interaction between the two sides," Hu said.    In his speech, Hu also pointed out that the number of  potential crises in the region has fueled the desire for a  Southeast Asia regional security system.    Hu quoted ROC President Li Teng-hui as saying that such a  system should start with an informal ad hoc "security dialogue,"  and the ROC is more than willing to join the system.    Taiwan, located at a pivotal point between Northeast Asia  and  Southeast Asia, "surely would constitute an indispensable link  in the Asian security system and among partners in the security  dialogue."    Turning to the ROC's mainland policy, Hu said Taiwan is bent  on maintaining non-official channels of communication,  strengthening people-to-people exchanges, mapping out economic  and investment activities, and increasing a bilateral "win-win"  consensus.</p>

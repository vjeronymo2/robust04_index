			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> ENQUIRING MINDS PREEMPTED  </P> <P> Joan Lunden says she is not leaving "Good Morning America," getting a divorce  or even having an alien's baby.  </P> <P> Lunden told viewers of ABC's morning show all this Tuesday after she said  National Enquirer reporters were asking her colleagues if she seems troubled  lately.  </P> <P> "It was a preemptive strike," she said afterward. "I told them I could either  do that or just be a wimp and sit back and let them make up whatever they want  and print it."  </P> <P> Ian Calder, editor of the tabloid in Lantana, Fla., said the queries about  Lunden concerned problems her husband, a TV producer, has had with lawsuits  over production bills for "Everyday," a syndicated program on which Lunden is  host.  </P> <P> "As far as I know, this was just something we were checking out and we've no  plans to run a story," Calder said.  </P></p>

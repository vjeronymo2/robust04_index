			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Adamishin, Russian first deputy </F> foreign minister, by correspondent Aleksandr Shkirando in the  Russian Foreign Ministry on 4 May; from the "Novosti" program --  recorded]    [Text] [Announcer Pavel Ogorodnikov] Emomali Rakhmonov, the  chairman of the National Assembly of Tajikistan, is beginning  his visit to Moscow tomorrow [5 May]. It is expected that a  complex of problems relating to political settlement both in  Tajikistan itself, and on its border with Afghanistan, will be  discussed during the talks.    [Shkirando] Anatoliy Leonidovich, what role is Tajikistan  currently playing in Russia's life as a whole, apart from its  foreign policy?    [Adamishin] In Tajikistan, a whole range of very important  issues have, as it were, become interwoven, each of which  directly affects the interests of Russia. Russia has made a  considerable effort to extinguish the flame of civil war and  find a way toward national reconciliation.    [Shkirando] Incidentally, the first round of Tajik-Tajik  talks has just ended. To what extent has Moscow, and in  particular the Foreign Ministry, succeeded in bringing the  positions of the two sides closer together?    [Adamishin] The two sides have sat down round the  negotiating  table. This is something that we have tried to achieve several  times. They have at last agreed that only a political  settlement can be a route toward resolving Tajikistan's problems.    [Shkirando] One of the results of the first round of talks  was the statement that both sides would stop hostilities in  order to step up the process of talks. However, we know that  explosions are still being heard on the border with Afghanistan.    [Adamishin] Regrettably, the phrasing they had there was  less  binding. Agreements in concrete terms are still to be concluded  and, of course, serious criticisms can be made with regard to  the opposition's behavior on the border. I will say this: It is  necessary to continue this process to which the first Moscow  round of talks has given a powerful impetus.    [Shkirando] What concrete results can be expected of Emomali  Rakhmonov's visit to Moscow?    [Adamishin] I think all these problems will be discussed --  the problems of domestic political reforms in Tajikistan, of  finding a common language with the opposition, of economic  cooperation between Tajikistan and Russia, the problem of  strengthening the border which is the border of the entire CIS  -- this is in fact our border because, as I sometimes say, we  have no other border between there and the Arctic Ocean, which  requires defending. But there such factors are in play as arms  smuggling, drug trafficking, and so on and so forth. This  should be constantly borne in mind in order to realize the  entire complexity of the situation in Tajikistan. Finally, the  problem of the Russian-speaking population: Its numbers are  decreasing in Tajikistan but they are still not small enough to  be negligible. In a word, the whole gamut of our cooperation  and involvement of the peacemaking forces will be the subject of  the talks between the two heads of state.</p>

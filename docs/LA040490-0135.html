			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> CENSUS OFFICES GET REQUESTS FOR FORMS  </P> <P> U.S. Census offices in Orange County have been flooded with telephone calls in  recent days from residents who have not received questionnaires, even though  the official deadline for completing and returning the once-a-decade national  survey was Sunday.  </P> <P> The bulk of the queries came from South County residents, most of them  newcomers whose homes were built during the past year, officials said Monday.  </P> <P> Bill Bellamy, census director in the Irvine office that serves South County,  said his office has received 200 to 300 calls from residents requesting  questionnaires. The Buena Park office reported about 75 calls, while the  Fullerton and Santa Ana offices have also received numerous requests.  </P> <P> Although the Census Bureau first began surveying the county in mid-1989 to put  together a mailing list, thousands of houses have been built since then,  Bellamy said. The census has done occasional updates, but the last of those is  only now being completed.  </P> <P> The problem has been particularly acute in South County, where the bulk of the  growth has occurred. Upward of 10,000 questionnaires for South County residents  on the updated list are expected to be mailed out by the middle of next week,  Bellamy said.  </P> <P> While the official deadline was Sunday, residents have until mid-April to  return the forms without expecting a call or visit from a census enumerator,  bureau officials say.  </P> <P> Even so, residents who haven't heard from the census should call their closest  district office to ask that a new form be sent, Bellamy said.  </P> <P> The bureaus can be reached by calling these phone numbers: Irvine, (714)  476-6500; Santa Ana, (714) 668-1000; Buena Park, (714) 994-8000, and Fullerton,  (714) 449-8800.

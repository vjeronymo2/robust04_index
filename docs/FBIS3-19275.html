Several retail stores ran out of beer last  week and some restaurants, specializing in the sale of  medium-strength beer, have already had to close their doors. In  other respects, there have been sufficient quantities of food in  the shops so far. This morning, all the basic necessities were  still available almost as normal, but the situation may become  somewhat more difficult in the next few days. The employers'  organization in the food industry thinks that processed meat and  fresh meat will disappear from the stores at the end of the week  if the strike continues.</p>

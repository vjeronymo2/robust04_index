			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Hoars to sell major stake in Hoskins MR BARRIE Hoar, chairman of Hoskins Brewery, which is facing its second shareholders' rebellion within a year, said yesterday that his family had decided to sell a majority of its 30 per cent shareholding. He announced the decision as the USM-quoted Leicester real ale brewer reported a 16 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits to Pounds 96,226 (Pounds 83,060). Mr Hoar described the 12 months to end-March as a period of 'turmoil in the marketplace'. At the operating level profits declined from Pounds 214,749 to Pounds 148,701 on turnover 30 per cent lower at Pounds 1.22m. Earnings per share rose 28 per cent to 1.77p. The company, which disposed of nine of its pubs in October last year for Pounds 2.45m, now had cash balances of about Pounds 850,000, Mr Hoar said. Interest charges declined from Pounds 137,932 to Pounds 84,123 while interest income rose from Pounds 6,243 to Pounds 31,648. The accounts included an extraordinary charge of Pounds 35,254 (Pounds 63,126) for the costs of defending last year's unsuccessful attempt by a number of shareholders to remove Mr Hoar and his brother, Robert, from the board. Other dissident shareholders, led by Mr Richard Holman, who has a 7.4 per cent holding, have now called for an extraordinary meeting in a further attempt to remove the two directors. Mr Barrie Hoar said yesterday that attacks from dissident shareholders had disrupted efforts to reposition the company. As a result, the Hoar family would sell a majority of its shareholding provided it could ensure that new management would be in the long term interest of all shareholders.</p>

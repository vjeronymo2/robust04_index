			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt The election effect, which prompted a sharp correction in the Frankfurt stock market last week, with a clear knock-on into bonds on Friday, is expected to dominate sentiment in the German financial markets, at least until the federal polls on October 16. If future opinion samplings confirm the tendency thrown up by the latest Forsa survey, which was published on Friday and showed the Social Democrat/Green alliance with the advantage, then market sentiment may be deeply depressed. The Forsa results showed the liberal Free Democrats, junior partners in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling coalition, with insufficient support to gain seats in the Bundestag. Politics apart, the usual fundamental factors affecting bonds are continuing to improve. Provisional September inflation figures for west Germany showed prices behaving themselves. A 2 per cent pay rise for clothing industry workers and flexible working arrangements, announced on Friday, was also encouraging for the longer-term price perspective, although textiles is a particularly depressed sector and expectations were low. August industrial output fell sharply, because of unquantifiable holiday effects, but confidence in the recovery remains intact among most industrial leaders.</p>

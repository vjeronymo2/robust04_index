			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / GPA Group's Aborted Global Issue: General Ryan loses the battle of the bulge THE SHANNON headquarters of GPA looks more like the branch office of a small software company than the nerve centre of a worldwide business. Its main operations room, however, resembles the war games room of a military headquarters.  Maps, charts and data can be instantly called up fromm blinking banks of computers on to three movie screens. Information on every jet manufactured in the western world - maintenance history, owner, technical data - can be shown in seconds. Simultaneously, maps can be displayed showing the locations of individual aircraft types, beside charts of the latest exchange the world's main financial centres.  The locations of GPA's 100-odd marketing agents in the field can be superimposed, and game plans drawn up. Here the company's executives meet every Monday morning to discuss strategy.  Chariman Tony Ryan, who started GPA with Dollars 50,000 in 1975, does not tolerate excuses for missed meetings. The grandson of a station master, and son of a train driver, 56-year old Ryan started with Aer Lingus as a dispatcher at Shannon airport when he was 19.  Quickly moving up through the ranks, he discovered there was money in jet aircraft leasing when he leased two 747s for Aer Lingus in the mid-1970s. Guinness Peat, the merchant banker, and Aer Lingus, helped him set up GPA, providing 90 per cent of the capital.  The company initially earned commissions by placing one airline's surplus aircraft with those short of jets. Since 1987, he has built a star-studded cast of non-executive directors, including: Nigel Lawson, former UK Chancellor, Garrett Fitzgerald, former Irish prime minister, Sir John Harvey Jones, chairman of The Economist, Peter Sutherland, chairman of AIB Group and former EC Commissioner, and Shinroku Morohashi, president of Mitsubishi. Today, 'the business of GPA is turning airplanes into attractive financial assets and selling them to investors,' says Mr Ken Holden, GPA's chief strategist.  Its 300 employees - about a third of whom are abroad at any one time doing just that - produced a profit of US Dollars 279m in the last financial year, almost trebled in five years. GPA's rapid growth put it on the verge of becoming Ireland's biggest company.  Had it been floated, GPA would have accounted for 20 per cent of the Dublin stock market capitalisation. Mr Ryan's implacable drive and his creation of a major international business from such humble beginnings, has won him admirers, but also detractors.  One Dublin banker said yesterday: 'He has been very arrogant with the institutions, and there are probably more than a few people laughing up their sleeves at the moment.' As Mr Maurice Foley, GPA's chief executive said recently, leasing 'is a very cold, unsentimental business, even in Ireland'.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Two-thirds back unitary councils Two-thirds of people questioned by MORI, the pollsters, for the Local Government Commission approve in principle of a unitary system of local government. The findings were released yesterday by the Association of District Councils, which claimed that the polls showed that people wanted 'change, not the status quo'. But support for removing a tier of government was strongest in areas such as Bristol and Cleveland where new counties were set up in 1974. The poll did not present local people with detailed proposals for possible unitary councils, and showed that in most areas only half of residents identified strongly with their district or county council.</p>

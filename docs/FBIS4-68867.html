			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Larisa Sayenko: "The Future President of </F> Belarus?"; first paragraph is introductory paragraph]    [Text] Few people doubt that Vyacheslav Kebich will be the  first President of Byelorussia. What will this election entail?    The Vyacheslav Kebich's entourage zealously proves that the  advent of the current prime minister to the presidential post is  inevitable, and there is no alternative to him. Several teams  can compete on equal grounds in great Russian, though somewhat  differing in programs but having equal strength. But,  Byelorussia hardly scraped up one membership of the Council of  Ministers.    Probably, this also may explain the first place held by  Vyacheslav Kebich in the political hierarchy of Byelorussia.  This is a team man, a company. In the past, a man of party  "clip," who did not try to show off his intelligence. He is  winning people's favor first of all by his sociableness and  simplicity. A rare deputy who has not asked credits on easy  terms, a batch of cheap refrigerators or trucks, a flat or a car  for himself. Vyacheslav Frantsevich is generous not only towards  his associates but also offers his political opponents whatever  help he can.    Vyacheslav Kebich is a business manager, rather than a  politician. He won his "first" popularity as director of the  machine-tool works. The promising organizer was sent by the  party to a backward enterprise, which he managed to place among  the foremost in the socialist emulation. He was the first among  business managers in the capital to recognize such a bourgeois  novelty as sociology, providing sociologists with full freedom  for any polls. It is noteworthy that with absolutely anonymous  questioning the director of the plant received a very high  rating of the majority.    Vyacheslav Kebich was always distinguished for business  activity and the ability to get on with people. Everything seems  to indicate that he has kept these qualities even today. The  head of the government, addressing the national intelligentsia  and convincing them that he places above everything else the  independence of his country, and the head of government who made  a report to leading industrialists and assured them that he is  building a confederation with Russia -- is one and the same man,  Vyacheslav Frantsevich Kebich. He is equally ready for both,  depending on the circumstances and the situation.    MN File    In the republic, Vyacheslav Kebich mainly relies on the  scientific-industrial association that unites the leading  economic executives and entrepreneurs, as well as the  pro-communist popular movement of Belarus. He has a major lobby  in the parliament. On the eve of the election campaign, this  lobby enabled him to remove his rival Stanislav Shushkevich  without any problems. What's more, the prime minister called the  campaign against him "kitchen squabble" and did not allow  himself to make any attacks on his opponent, even in  retaliation. In the course of a single day he collected 70 votes  in the Supreme Soviet needed for his nomination as a candidate  for presidency, and in one week -- about 150,000 votes of  ordinary electors.    The awakening of the Byelorussian premier's national  self-consciousness which took place a year and a half ago, most  likely may be explained by the tough pragmatic policy of Yegor  Gaidar's government regarding the fraternal republic: inflating  the fuels prices, ultimatum demands to pay the debt right up to  switching off oil-and-gas supplies for a lengthy period.    On the other hand, the present craving for Slav unity is  nothing but a calculation on an amicable shifting off of  economic burdens on the shoulders of Viktor Chernomyrdin's  government. The psychological compatibility of the two premiers  has more than once helped Belarus out of seemingly hopeless  situations -- with the same enormous non-payments to Russia's  Gazprom. The question arises: how compatible are the economic  models of the two states and is Vyacheslav Kebich going to  accept the tough financial-credit terms of the Russian side or  hope to prolong Byelorussian socialism at the expense of Russia?    Vyacheslav Kebich was greatly impressed by the outcome of  the  latest Russian elections. In Minsk they were assessed as the  alienation of the broad masses from the market-economic reforms.  Large-scale restoration of socialism started, in the form of  distributing advantageous credits, allowances, impressive  increment of pensions, minimum wages. From the beginning of the  year this thricely devaluated the Byelorussian "zaichik."*    It is hard to suspect the prime minister of not knowing the  real price of such reforms. But the election marathon calls for  sacrifices.    Let's take, for example, bread. Belarus is importing wheat.  By spring, Kazakhstan's grain had run out at the bakeries and  the grain for hard currency flowed from Europe. The retail  prices of rolls and buns from wheat, officially called "free,"  automatically rose more than two-fold, sparking off the  discontent of the population. Knowing for sure the objective  need for the price rise, Vyacheslav Kebich instantly responded  live on TV, explaining everything by the arbitrariness of  certain officials and promising to punish them. Indeed, he found  the "guilty" and punished, even if with official reprimands, and  restored the previous prices. The subsidy from the budget  remained in the shade. It was allocated for making long loafs  cheaper -- 49 billion only for one month. The Finance Minister  Stepan Yanchuk was compelled to state that the "unplanned growth  of state subsidies on some types of food, housing, communal and  transport services resulted in the exhaustion of the annual  limit of the budget deficit today."    MN File    According to the Council of Ministers, during the first  quarter the gross domestic product and payments to the budget  went down by 40%. The drop came closer to the limits which  dictate "the minimum necessary production volume to ensure the  minimal requirements of the state." The number of unprofitable  enterprises trebled. The average monthly inflation came to  50%.  The Cabinet of Ministers sees the way out in rough vertical  management, selective backing of enterprises and collective  farms, in centralized regulation and, no doubt, in monetary and  economic unification with the Russian Federation. The team of  Vyacheslav Kebich reveals full unanimity. A special stand is  taken only by Stanislav Bogdankevich, Chairman of the National  Bank, and Finance Minister Stepan Yanchuk, who nurse no  illusions regarding unification and suggest the introduction of  market-economy mechanisms. This is explained not so much by  personal qualities, as by objective circumstances: the financial  system of the republic is coming closer to failure.    At the meeting with war and labour veterans, when Vyacheslav  Kebich was accused of the disintegration of the economy, he  parried: "Just name me an ex-USSR republic where the life of  people is better?" As a result of debates the representatives of  the older generation unanimously backed up the candidature of  the prime minister for the post of the President. There is a  great deal of truth in what Kebich says. He did not overlook  control over industry, at a time when becoming a head of the  government, about 50% of the industrial potential was in  republican subordination. Social security spreads not only to  old men and children, but practically to all of the able-bodied  population. Not a single bankrupt enterprise has been shut down,  the giant plants standing idle pay rather impressive wages "or,  to be more exact -- allowances."    The favorite leisure of the prime minister is angling. The  recently economic reports of the prime minister are increasingly  reminding of anglers' stories. From time to time Vyacheslav  Frantsevich assures that the economic situation is improving.  And from the autumn of 1993 the most successful catch is the  idea of economic union with Russia. Today Vyacheslav Kebich  maintains: "The creation of a single ruble zone is the aim of my  whole life." As though his life has not passed in that ruble  zone. Was it that long ago at a press conference regarding the  introduction of "zaichiki," that the prime minister tried to  convince people that Byelorussian and Russian rubles are  absolutely equal, but shortly "zaichik" will outweigh and "one  Russian ruble will be equal to 60-70 Byelorussian kopeks."  Meanwhile, the widely-advertised abolition of the customs duty  on raw materials and fuels in the Russian Federation from May 1  did not produce the desired effect. Instead of the customs duty  Russia introduced an excise tax which did not improve the  situation in the republic.    Vyacheslav Kebich must be done justice. Initially the  conditions of the Byelorussian-Russian financial-economic union  really promised a number of advantages to the Byelorussian side  and could really become a ring-buoy. But the methods in "the  settlement of issues," polished throughout years, began to  malfunction in bilateral relations. The most sober-minded  supporters of Kebich believe that it is quite in vain that he  has become stuck so strongly to this idea, actually becoming a  hostage of the Russian authorities. The hearty attitude of  Viktor Chernomyrdin may be balanced by the cool attitude of  Boris Yeltsin: unlike Stanislav Shushkevich, the Byelorussian  prime minister was not in a hurry to express his support to the  President in the critical moments of his confrontation with the  legislative power.    Vyacheslav Kebich is a pragmatic business manager, and this  undoubtedly does him credit at the post he occupies. Quite  timely he parted with the communist party "on moral and ethical"  considerations -- after the August coup. In Byelorussia he  kisses the hand of the Metropolitan Filaret, in Israel wears a  skull-cap, in the Arab Emirates would surely accept a Muslim  ritual under guaranteed supplies of cheap oil. But the  impression lately taking shape is that the sense of realism is  leaving the prime minister. He is beginning to believe in his  promises, making too big a stake in the political game with  Russia.    As to his personal qualities, Vyacheslav Kebich on the post  of President would guarantee the absence of sharp changes in  keeping to traditions (as an ideal prototype for the  Byelorussian President he considers Pyotr Masherov, leader of  the Communist Party, rather popular even today). But in case of  unification with Russia the economic levers of management will  be passed over to Moscow which will hardly back up Byelorussian  socialism. If the agreement fails, then the economic situation,  undermined by the election campaign of the prime minister, will  inevitably lead to the worsening of living standards and will  call for unpopular tough measures and a corresponding leader for  their implementation.    MN File    Vyacheslav Kebich is a Byelorussian. He was born in  Volozhin District in 1936. Finishing school with a gold medal,  he enrolled in the Byelorussian Polytechnic Institute. In 1958  he became a business manager as a rank-and-file engineer at the  plant of automatic transfer lines, covering the road to one of  its leaders. At the age of 40, he became general manager of the  Kirov machine-tool works, at the same time heading its design  office. In 1980, he was promoted to party work: Second Secretary  of the Minsk City Committee of the Communist Party of  Byelorussia and head of the department of the Central Committee  of the Communist Party of Byelorussia; Second Secretary of the  Minsk Regional Committee of the Communist Party of Byelorussia.  He also headed the republican Committee for Economic Planning.  Since April 1994, he has been Chairman of the Council of  Ministers, and one of the most realistic aspirants for the post  of the first President of the Republic of Belarus.    He is married and has two children. The members of his  family were mentioned in the materials on the parliamentary  anti-corruption commission. However, the Procurator's Office did  not find any facts of the crime in their actions.    * The Byelorussian national currency depicts various  animals (including a hare on the one-ruble note), therefore  among the people, Byelorussian money is called "zaichik."

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Jerzy Milewski, the deputy national  defense minister and head of the National Security Office  attached to the president, told the Polish Radio First Program  that the Partnership for Peace agreement signed in Brussels  recently by Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak contains very  positive elements with regard to our country's joining the NATO  Treaty structures, but at this stage it, unfortunately, does not  guarantee political security for us.    [Begin Milewski recording] I consider the Partnership for  Peace program very good as a transitional measure that will  speed up and facilitate Poland's full membership in NATO,  membership as an equal partner, and as a partner equally  valuable to our future NATO partners.    The Partnership for Peace program has, however, been  criticized. It has been criticized by the highest state  officials in the country, by President Lech Walesa and by  Foreign Affairs Minister Andrzej Olechowski, as a program that  does not give us the necessary political protection, protection  needed at this particular moment against the growing threat, now  only political and verbal, from the East. Increasingly  frequently we hear from Moscow voices that give indications that  a return to imperial, expansionist policies is increasingly  probable. Because at the moment this threat is only political  and is expressed in words, not in deeds or military action, and  thank God, there is no military threat yet, today we only need  political protection. The transitional period when our Army  adapts itself to NATO can and must take a few years. [end  recording]</p>

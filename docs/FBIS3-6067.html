The government levies only 20 percent of customs  duties on any of the items when a research institute affiliated  with a corporation imports them for the purpose of technology  development. The ministry said it has given priority to the  needs of semiconductor, auto and aerospace industries in  selecting the new items. Favors have also been given to research  institute working on machine tools and measurement instruments  mainly used by small- and medium-sized corporations, it said.    The newly selected items include gas turbines, electron  lithography systems, chip-mounting machines and optical wave  length meters. Dropped from last year's list of 243 items for  tariff reduction are 50 items, all of which can be replaced by  locally manufactured products, the ministry said. While changing  the specifications of another 75 items, the ministry said, the  government has redesignated 118 items for tariff reduction. As a  result, 241 items are eligible for tariff reduction.</p>

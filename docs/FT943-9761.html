			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / International Company News: Holvis cuts target after mid-term deficit Holvis, the troubled Swiss nonwoven fabric and distribution group, suffered a SFr4.5m (Dollars 3.4m) net loss in the first half, compared with a SFr19.6m profit in the same period of last year. It has reduced its operating profit forecast for 1994 from SFr32m to SFr20m. Turnover was down 11.6 per cent, mainly as a result of the sale last year of the speciality papermaking business. The group has been hurt by price pressure in the traditional markets for non-wovens and diapers, and is having problems with volume production of higher value fabrics for the medical market. Operating profit in the non-woven division fell 35 per cent in the first half to SFr7.7m, dragging down group operating profit 41 per cent to SFr12.3m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The Nigerian foreign minister, Babagana Kingibe, has  left Cameroon after failing to secure a meeting with President  Paul Biya to try to resolve the border dispute of the oil rich  Bakassi Peninsula. In the last two days, Mr. Kingibe held talks  in Yaounde with the Cameroonian foreign and defense ministers.    Before departing for Abuja, Mr. Kingibe said the two sides  would have to sit down at some point to sort out whose territory  Bakassi is. Cameroon's state radio later reported that  President Biya would not be meeting the Nigeria leader, General  Sani Abacha, until Nigerian troops had withdrawn from Bakassi.</p>

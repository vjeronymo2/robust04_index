			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pay deal ends jute mills strike THE 54 jute mills which have been strike bound since January 28 are reopenning today following the signing of an agreement on Tuesday by the Indian Jute Mills Association and 18 trade unions. The mills will need at least a fortnight to get back to normal production, according to Mr Bharat Jalan, chairman of IJMA. The agreement providing for a basic wage increase of Rs90 (Pounds 1.95) a week and a higher cost of living allowance will raise the industry's wage bill by about Rs450m a year. This falls far short of what the unions had been agitating for, and the industry, said Mr Jalan, would be able to bear the additional wage burden provided there was a matching improvement in productivity. The Marxist government in West Bengal, which intervened to bring about the settlement, has agreed to appoint a committee to determine the basis of productivity-linked wages in the industry. Yet another committee will be looking at the 'labour complement and manning pattern' in jute mills where wages constitute as much as 40 per cent of the total cost of production. Mr Jalan admitted that during the 50-day strike, the overseas buyers had cancelled orders worth more than Rs600m. Moreover, routine orders worth about Rs500m were lost as the buyers did not know when the strike would end, he added. The industry is reconciled to the fact that it will not be able to achieve the export target of 250,000 tonnes during the financial year ending March 1992. While the jute mills lost production of approximately 180,000 tonnes worth Rs2.4bn, the synthetic substitute products have made further inroads into the fertiliser and cement packaging market. With the federal government no longer keen to provide protection to the traditional jute industry, it will be difficult for jute to regain the lost ground.</p>

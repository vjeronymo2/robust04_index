			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Smith and Gould advance broad reform LABOUR must reject the notion that minor policy changes will prove adequate to win the next election and instead develop a platform with a breadth of appeal that embraces the interests and aspirations of middle-class voters. That is the view held by both contenders for the party leadership in articles published in the New Statesman and Society today. Shadow chancellor Mr John Smith, the odds-on favourite, and Mr Bryan Gould, his challenger, definitively reject the so-called 'one last heave' notion, which argues that the party should simply repackage its current policies and improve on its communications with the electorate. But their approaches as to how to broaden the party's appeal varies subtly with Mr Gould delivering a new, thinly-veiled attack on his rival for his handling of economic policy at the election. Mr Smith argues that Labour should play heavily on the argument of enlightened self-interest, a broad concept of freedom and economic logic. The shadow chancellor suggests that the 'comfortable and contented' are anxious about inner-city degeneration, unemployment and the decline in the quality of life. 'Poverty and injustice . . . are not only moral issues but also questions about the cohesion and security of the whole community,' he argues. Relatively affluent people share with the less well-off an interest in improved investment in skills and innovation, opportunities for women and high standards of health and education provision. He points out that poverty and unemployment are not just bad for individuals but 'undermine the capacity for wealth creation in a modern economy. 'This is our economic argument: a path to personal enrichment for the fruits of economic progress more widely shared,' he writes. Mr Gould begins by criticising Labour's election campaign for failing to offer motives to middle-class voters to support the party. 'In the event, all we had to say to them was that we intended to tax them more severely - if not immediately, then at some not long delyed point in the future,' he writes. In a passage that will infuriate Mr Smith's supporters, he says the party endorsed Tory macroeconomic policies by accepting a simple goal of monetary stability, offering no route to full employment or recovery. He also asks why constructive proposals such as contributors' control over pensions funds, share ownership schemes and better employee rights were not proposed. In future, electors should not be treated as socio-economic groups but as individuals given the power that leaves them 'properly equipped to operate in a market place that would otherwise treat them unfairly'. 'Labour's concern should, in other words, be with the initial distribution of wealth rather than with a post hoc redistribution that offends the intended beneficiaries almost as much as it alienates the forced contributors,' he concludes.</p>

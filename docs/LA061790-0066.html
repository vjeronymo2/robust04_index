			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PENNSYLVANIA SHAD RUNS REBORN, ONE BUCKET AT A TIME;  </P> <P> FISH: CUT OFF FROM ANCESTRAL SPAWNING GROUNDS BY DAMS, THEY ARE BEING SCOOPED  UP AND RETURNED TO THE SUSQUEHANNA RIVER.  </P> <P> Eighty years after a 55-foot high dam cut them off from their ancestral  spawning grounds, record numbers of American shad are being returned to the  Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania, wildlife officials say.  </P> <P> More than 10,000 shad have been scooped by bucket out of the river below the  Conowingo Dam in Maryland this spring and released about 50 miles upriver. And  biologists predict more than 15,000 will be trapped and released by the time  the spawning season ends in mid-June, a 90 % increase over last year.  </P> <P> In 1972, the first year of the Conowingo fish lift program, only 182 shad were  trapped and released.  </P> <P> Still, the increase over the years pales in comparison to the millions of shad  that migrated up the Susquehanna before four new dams virtually ended the  spring shad runs on the East Coast's longest river basin.  </P> <P> The dams stretch from Conowingo north to the York Haven Dam near Harrisburg,  Pa., and are operated by four power companies. The Holtwood Dam, built in 1910,  limited shad runs to the lower 25 miles of the river.  </P> <P> In the 1970s, pollution was blamed for a decline in the shad population along  the East Coast. But the runs have increased dramatically in recent years in  rivers such as the Delaware, where water quality has improved.  </P> <P> In 1980, when the state of Maryland banned shad fishing, there were fewer than  5,000 American shad in the upper basin of the Chesapeake Bay, federal Fish and  Wildlife Service officials say. Last year there were 75,000.  </P> <P> But federal and state officials agree that the costly lift program has a long  way to go before shad are plentiful in the Susquehanna, which flows into the  Chesapeake, and a 10-year fishing ban is lifted.  </P> <P> "The numbers are improving steadily. We're showing a 50% per year improvement  in stock size," said Richard St. Pierre, the Fish and Wildlife Service's  Susquehanna River coordinator. "We're talking about a few thousand fish  compared to millions years ago."  </P> <P> St. Pierre has charted the progress of shad in the Susquehanna since the early  1980s, when state and federal authorities began pressuring the power companies  that own the dams to help bring back the fish.  </P> <P> The owners of the Holtwood, Safe Harbor and York Haven dams eventually agreed,  among other things, to spend $3.7 million to stock shad upstream and to find  ways to help young shad make their way downstream.  </P> <P> But Philadelphia Electric Co., which has operated a fish lift at the Conowingo  Dam since 1972, resisted pressure to build a permanent fish lift.  </P> <P> Finally, in December, 1986, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered  the company to build a second lift. Construction on that facility, which will  cost $12.5 million, began this spring. It is expected to be finished by the  fall of 1991.  </P> <P> Philadelphia Electric Co. officials say the new lift will still require that  shad be trapped and loaded into trucks, then hauled nearly 50 miles past the  York Haven dam near Harrisburg. Once released, the shad will have more than 350  miles of unobstructed river to spawn.  </P> <P> After years of fighting the proposal, the power company has done an about-face,  and is now vigorously working to bring back the shad, according to St. Pierre.  </P> <P> "They used to be the bad guys and now they're the good guys," he said. "We  fought them hard and bitterly but they didn't want to spend the money."  </P> <P> Biologist Chris Freas, whose company, RMC Environmental Services, contracts  with Philadelphia Electric, said the fish lift is actually like an elevator. He  said the fish are drawn into a holding pool, lifted in a bucket and dumped into  a sorting tank. The shad are then separated and put into transport tanks.  </P> <P> Freas said the lift someday will be able to trap and transport 1.5 million shad  and 20 million river herring. And while he is excited about the progress in  recent years, he realizes the battle is far from over.  </P> <P> "Ten thousand fish is great news but that's a long way from a restored  population of fish," he said. "There's still a long way to go. The ultimate  goal is to restore 3 million shad to the base of the Conowingo Dam."  </P> <P> Freas noted that the recent increase in shad catches may be due in part to  favorable river conditions, with an optimal water flow and temperature.  </P> <P> "If we have four bad years of spawning we could be back to square one," he  said. "We can't control Mother Nature."  </P> <P> St. Pierre said the Conowingo fish lift program is only a stopgap measure. He  said for shad to flourish, the owners of the other three dams must also build  fish lifts.  </P> <P> "All three of them are working on plans to build passageways," he said. "The  next step will be to convince them to put together a construction schedule."  </P> <P> Shad will only spawn in the rivers where they were born. It is therefore  important to establish a population of young shad in the spawning areas, said  Art Michaels, who edits "Pennsylvania Angler," a Fish Commission publication.  </P></p>

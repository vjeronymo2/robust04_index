			<p>BFN     [Text] Pakistan's Interior Minister Nasrullah Khan Babar  and Giorgio Giacomelli, the UN executive under secretary-general  and chairman of the Anti-Narcotics Committee, were received by  President Hashemi-Rafsanjani today.    At the meeting the president expressed his pleasure with the  consultation, cooperation, and joint efforts of Iran and  Pakistan in combatting the cursed phenomenon of narcotics on the  common border and in the region. He also described as very  positive the UN's support for the successful implementation of  joint measures.    Hashemi-Rafsanjani referred to the fact that over the past  few years the Islamic Republic of Iran has been in the vanguard  of the fight against contraband narcotics in the region. He  stressed that the comprehensive fight against the big  international narcotics gangs, which have advanced facilities  and equipment, requires the cooperation and coordinated joint  effort of all neighboring countries.    The president said that the venomous propaganda by certain  Western media, and even some institutes affiliated to the United  Nations about Iran's efforts to fight the merchants of death  stems from the infiltration of the world's propaganda centers by  big international narcotics smuggling gangs. He said: While  Iran is combatting the merchants of death in the region at great  expense, certain so-called human rights institutions, with the  help of their influential propaganda centers, paint Iran's  humanitarian efforts with the same brush as their own political  prejudices and describe the execution of narcotics smugglers as  the execution of political dissidents and a contravention of  human rights. He said: Iran will not deviate from its chosen  path despite these allegations. Iran's law enforcement and  military personnel will fight this cursed phenomenon with  decisiveness and will support the actions of other countries in  the matter.    At the meeting, the UN executive under secretary-general and  chairman of the Anti-Narcotics Committee expressed his pleasure  at Iran's progress in the fight against narcotics. He said: In  our inspection of the common border between Iran, Pakistan, and  Afghanistan, I and the team accompanying me saw the diligent  efforts of Iran's law enforcement forces to combat the narcotics  smugglers. We will place at the UN's disposal comprehensive  information on those humanitarian efforts.    He added: Iran's efforts in the matter should not only be  praised by international forums but it should be presented to  the rest of the world as a model.    Supporting the joint efforts of Iran and Pakistan to combat  narcotics smuggling, he said: There is no doubt that fighting  this cursed global phenomenon, which causes murder, corrupts  youngsters, and pollutes the environment requires all-round  international effort. All other countries, particularly  regional countries, must use Iran's and Pakistan's joint efforts  as a model and continue their efforts to combat narcotics  jointly and comprehensively.    Later in the meeting, which was also attended by Interior  Minister Besharati and a number of our country's law enforcement  officials, the Pakistani interior minister thanked the Iranian  authorities for their efforts in the fight against narcotics  smuggling. He described his talks with his Iranian counterpart  as very fruitful, and added: We hope that with the measures  taken to safeguard the common border the fight against narcotics  and the merchants of death will be continued even more seriously  in the future.</p>

			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOLS EXAMINE SCREENING THAT LET CONVICTED MOLESTER THROUGH  </P> <P> San Diego school officials are baffled by how a teacher, who was convicted of  child molestation 12 years ago in Florida, passed through their hiring process  with his criminal record undetected.  </P> <P> "We don't know what happened, and are in the process of reviewing our screening  process," Deputy Supt. Bertha Pendleton said.  </P> <P> A teaching credential is not issued if a background check reveals a conviction,  Pendleton said.  </P> <P> All prospective teachers go through the screening, which includes submitting a  resume, a reference list and copies of any teaching certificates from other  states. A fingerprint check is made. The Commission for Teacher Credentialing  makes the background checks.  </P> <P> "Maybe his criminal record didn't show up because he was acquitted in Florida,"  Pendleton said. Florida officials, however, said that Ernest B. Brown had been  convicted of child molestation in 1977.  </P> <P> After his conviction, Florida's education department revoked Brown's teaching  license in 1978, said Martin Schaap, administrator for the Professional  Practices Council in Florida. He said Brown resigned from Gulf Beaches  Elementary School in St. Petersburg in 1977.  </P> <P> Brown, 47, was arrested in San Diego on Nov. 30 on suspicion of molesting two  former students who are now in junior high school. He has been suspended from  teaching while the case is pending, said Melanie Petersen, attorney for the  school district.  </P> <P> He is being held in the County Jail on 32 counts of lewd and lascivious acts  with a child. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Jan. 11 in Municipal  Court.  </P> <P> Brown was hired by the San Diego Unified School District in 1986 and taught a  combination fourth- and fifth-grade class at Knox Elementary School.  </P> <P> Pendleton said Brown was considered a good teacher and was popular with parents  and students.  </P> <P> Crisis counselors were brought in to help students deal with the arrest,  Pendleton said, adding that school officials met with parents and answered  questions.  </P></p>

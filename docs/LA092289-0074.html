			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. SCHOOLS EMBARK ON NEW EFFORT;  </P> <P> DISTRICTWIDE COMMITTEE GEARS UP FOR BOLD TRY TO RESTRUCTURE SYSTEM  </P> <P> Planning for changes that educators, parents and community leaders hope will  dramatically improve education in the Los Angeles Unified School District began  in earnest Thursday at the first meeting of a powerful new districtwide  committee.  </P> <P> Meeting at the 32nd Street Performing and Visual Arts Magnet School near USC,  the 24-member Shared Decision-Making and School-Based Management Central  Council discussed goals and organizational needs as it geared up for what many  observers say is the district's boldest effort ever to restructure schools.  </P> <P> The council's co-chairs, Deputy Supt. Sidney Thompson and United Teachers-Los  Angeles Vice President Helen Bernstein, sat side-by-side in a display of  cooperation that both said could never have transpired four months ago, when  teachers went on a nine-day strike for higher pay and more authority to run  schools.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Settlement Element  </P> <P> The Central Council, a key element of the teachers' contract settlement in  June, will oversee the district's move toward placing more authority and  responsibility for improving education at the local school level, with  administrators, parents and, in particular, with teachers.  </P> <P> The contract also provides for new local councils at each of the district's 800  regular and adult schools that eventually will have the power to make sweeping  changes affecting curriculum, hiring and other aspects of school life.  </P> <P> Los Angeles is following the example of the Dade County, Fla., and Rochester,  N.Y., school systems, which pioneered similar decentralization efforts a few  years ago. Supporters of the approach hope it will produce happier teachers,  more involved parents and better schools -- critical goals in Los Angeles with  its 39% dropout rate and chronically low test scores.  </P> <P> "Whatever we're doing now is not working," Bernstein said. "The future of the  district depends on what this (Central Council) does."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Accountability Issue  </P> <P> Said Central Council member Joseph Duff, president of the Los Angeles branch of  the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People: "The biggest question  is whether we can bring accountability into the (school) system."  </P> <P> As set out in the contract, teachers make up 50% of the Central Council and the  individual school councils, while parents, community leaders and administrators  make up the remaining half. Principals will not have veto power over local  council actions.  </P> <P> Bernstein said the main task of the Central Council will be to train the local  school councils and draft guidelines for them to follow. The local councils  this year will begin to make decisions regarding student discipline policies,  spending of certain funds, scheduling, even access to the school copying  machine.  </P> <P> The Central Council will meet twice a month, with the next meeting set for Oct.  12.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SCHOOL DISTRICT COUNCIL  </P> <P>  Here are the members of the Los Angeles Unified School District Central  Council on Shared Decision-Making and Site-Based Management:  </P> <P> </P> <P> SUPERINTENDENT'S APPOINTEES  </P> <P> Deputy Supt.

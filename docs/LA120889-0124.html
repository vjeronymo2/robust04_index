			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FLORIDA;  </P> <P> FRUIT COMPENSATION LAW FOUGHT IN COURT  </P> <P> The citrus canker scare that led to the burning of 20 million fruit trees in  the mid-1980s reached the state Supreme Court in Tallahassee, Fla., with  growers arguing that a compensation plan violates their rights. They said a law  passed by the Legislature providing a $30-million compensation fund and setting  up an administrative hearing procedure was unconstitutional because it denied  them their right to have compensations settled in court.  </P></p>

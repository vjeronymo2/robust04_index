			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Changchun, January 30 (XINHUA) -- China's largest  auto joint venture -- the First Automotive Works  (FAW)-Volkswagenwert Automotive Co. Ltd, located in northeast  China's Jilin Province -- has expanded steadily thanks to joint  efforts of the two sides and their good collaboration.    This was stated by Claus Wolf, deputy general manager of the  Sino-Germany automotive corporation, during a recent interview.    The FAW-Volkswagenwert Automotive Co. Ltd. was established  in  February 1991, jointly funded by the First Automotive Works  (FAW) of China and the world-renowned Volkswagenwert AG of  Germany.    Substantial progress has been gained ever since with  modernized workshops towering over former vegetable plots and  the number of employees expanding to more than 1,400 from merely  six at the very beginning.    Getta sedan cars produced by the joint venture have won much  favor on the domestic market and total output topped 20,000 by  the end of last year.    Joint ventures are among the most difficult sort of  enterprises to be managed well due to unavoidable differences in  cultural and social backgrounds of working staff from both sides.    But the employees of the two sides in FAW-Volkswagenwert  have  successfully overcome the cultural barrier, if it exist, and  work together happily, according to deputy general manager Wolf.  "We are heading toward a common goal, to make the corporation  better and better," said Wolf. "This helps to remove  misunderstandings and make us at home here."    He deeply felt that both the Chinese and German sides have  worked wholeheartedly for the success of the project.    So far, total funds of the project have reached 7.86 billion  yuan, with the Chinese side holding 60 percent and German side  40 percent, making it the country's largest auto joint venture.    Collective responsibility system of a management committee  under the board has been adopted in managing the whole  corporation. The committee consists of three Chinese managers  and two German managers.    As a member of the committee, Wolf believe that the most  important thing is to find the best way of working and  cooperating. "We share one large office and try to hide  nothing between one another. The three Chinese managers are all  my good friends. I also feel happy working with the chairman of  the corporation, Geng Zhaojie, whom I respect very much," he  said.    The joint venture has now adopted the policy of simultaneous  development of construction, production and increased use of  domestically-produced spare parts, according to Wolf. Plans  have been drawn up for management and marketing to as far ahead  as the year 2,000.    Installation of ten-plus production lines has been completed  and two of them are already in operation.    While the sedan cars produced by the corporation are warmly  welcomed by customers, efforts of hard-working staff are also  highly appreciated.    Talking about an award granted by the Chinese Government to  him and meeting with Premier Li Peng, Wolf said politely and  modesty: "It is not an award solely for myself, but for the  joint efforts of us all."    The 52-year-old deputy general manager, who has worked in  China for almost a decade, is fully confident of the  corporation's future. With the anticipated annual output of  300,000 sedan cars by the year 2000, the cooperation will be one  of China's biggest car producing bases, Wolf said.</p>

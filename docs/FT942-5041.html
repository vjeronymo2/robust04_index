			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Business failures 'likely to fall by 10%' Business failures during 1994 will be 10 per cent lower than last year, Trade Indemnity, the specialist trade credit insurer, forecast yesterday. The number of company failures notified to Trade Indemnity was up 10.7 per cent to 1,037 in the first quarter of 1994 compared with the last quarter of 1993. But failures were down 42 per cent compared with the first quarter of last year, when they stood at 1,767. Mr William Simpson, chief economist, said companies' investment intentions were modest because of 'erosion of capacity during the recession, widespread late-payment mistrust and weak loan demand'. Trade Indemnity's quarterly financial trends survey suggested that a further reduction in business failures would be a function of progress on overdue debts, the attitude of banks and whether companies can absorb rising materials costs. It warned that risk would be concentrated in smaller companies which find it most difficult to obtain finance and invest, and those in unpredictable sectors such as high technology. The survey showed that the average value of debts outstanding for more than 30 days beyond the due date had risen to Pounds 145,000. The largest regional declines in failures compared with a year ago came in the west Midlands at 53 per cent, East Anglia at 49 per cent, Wales at 48 per cent and Yorkshire and Humberside at 47 per cent. The region with the largest number of failures in the first quarter was south-east England, with a total of 392, a reduction of 35 per cent on the total of 605 recorded in the first quarter of last year. The smallest reduction was in the south-west, where the total declined by 29 per cent to 71 in the first quarter from 100 a year earlier.</p>

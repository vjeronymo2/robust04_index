			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HONOR GUARDS;  </P> <P> FOR THOSE TOUCHED BY WAR, MEMORIAL DAY IS CHANCE TO REMEMBER;  </P> <P> A LIFE IN LIMBO  </P> <P> Twenty-one Memorial Days have gone by since Barbara Birchim's husband, Army  Capt. James Birchim of the Green Berets, was listed as Missing in Action in  South Vietnam. But she still lives life in limbo.  </P> <P> She knows this much about Nov. 15, 1968, the last day he was seen alive: "They  were going on a reconnaissance, to help extract some men who had gotten  surrounded by the enemy. It was in Laos." Birchim and another man were being  lifted out, suspended below a helicopter.  </P> <P> Beyond that, she only knows what the other man has told her, that "at some  point between Point A and Point B, Jim dropped off. It was at night. It was  raining." Cut by ropes, he was unable to hang on. No one knows just where the  helicopter was, or at what altitude.  </P> <P> Birchim was at her parents' home in San Francisco when two officers appeared at  the door that November day 22 years ago to tell her that her husband was MIA.  </P> <P> About the time he was declared missing, she received a letter from him. "He  told me he was working with the Montagnards and how much he enjoyed that. He  had even suggested adopting a Montagnard baby." She was pregnant with David,  now 21. Their daughter, Kim, was 6 months old.  </P> <P> Barbara Birchim doesn't quite believe her husband is alive, but she isn't sure  he's dead, either. "I think it's very possible he's wandering around not  knowing where he is."  </P> <P> With no solid evidence, the Army in May, 1971, changed James Birchim's status  from MIA to "killed in action, body not recovered." In August of that year, she  married another Army officer.  </P> <P> The marriage ended in divorce 11 years later. Now 43, she lives in San Diego.  </P> <P> Birchim belongs to the National League of Families of American Prisoners and  Missing in Southeast Asia, which seeks information on 2,303 Americans missing  or unaccounted for in the region. Independently, she has made two trips to  Vietnam, the last in March.  </P> <P> "When Jim first turned up missing, I made a promise to him and myself that I  would go to Vietnam when the kids were old enough to be self-sufficient," she  said. The responses of villagers there to her questions convinced her that  "there are Americans there."  </P> <P> She is critical of the U.S. government for what she views as inaction and the  withholding of information. She went to Vietnam, she said, partially because  she had to explode the "mystique" of Vietnam. "Now, a lot of the mystery is  gone and there's comfort in that."  </P> <P> In the last 18 months, she said, "there have been rumors that there are five to  seven Green Berets living in the mountains in the Kontum area (near where  Birchim's base camp was) with the Montagnard people." She believes Jim Birchim  could be one of them.  </P> <P> She poses the possibility, too, that Americans are being held by "some little  militant faction that thinks they're still at war with us." If Jim Birchim is  alive, she believes, he is being held against his will.  </P> <P> If he is alive, he is 43 now. Barbara Birchim accepts the possibility that he  could be leading another life there. "We've heard stories about men forced to  work in the fields, and part of their pay is they give them Vietnamese wives."  </P> <P> But she is adamant that the men and women still in Southeast Asia "have the  right to come home" and that their government should be fighting harder for  that right. BEVERLY BEYETTE  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and </F> Vladimir Novikov]    [Text] Murmansk, 22 May -- Cooperation between Russia and  Britain is developing very well, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev said after talks here with his British colleague Douglas  Hurd, who has arrived in Russia on a three-day official visit.    The Russian foreign minister said that British Prime  Minister  John Major's meeting with Russian Federation President Boris  Yeltsin was still quite a recent event, while a new and  important event for mutual relations was now on the agenda: the  first state visit to Russia by Queen Elizabeth II.    Kozyrev mentioned the broad list of issues discussed at the  current talks, in particular, preparations for the political  meeting of leaders of the G-7 and Russia in Naples, the working  out of an agreement on partnership between Russia and the  European Union, the prospects of cooperation between Russia and  NATO, the Bosnian crisis, and Moscow's relations with the Baltic  countries. Significant attention, in his words, was paid to  finding ways to step up the activities of the CSCE during  preparations for the summit meeting of the member countries of  this international forum. There was also a productive exchange  of views on ways of developing regional cooperation, including  cooperation with Murmansk. The minister said that "Britain was a  partner with whom Russia was holding a stable, open and friendly  dialogue."    The head of the British Foreign Office noted that his  country  was playing pioneering role in ties with Murmansk. In Hurd's  words, this role was clearly manifested in the past wars, and it  continues now, as demonstrated by the present visit, the first  by a British foreign secretary to the polar regions of Russia.  "Agreement has been reached on all the issues we discussed," the  head of the Foreign Office said. "There are three major  organizations in Europe - NATO, the EC, and the CSCE. In the  early stages of their existence they were dealing with the  problem of overcoming confrontation, but now a new stage has  begun, and work is under way with the aim of reaching accord.  Russia is playing a key role in this process. I hope a  cooperation agreement between Russia and the European Union will  be signed as early as June. We in Britain at any rate will be  striving towards this. We also expect Russia to reach accord  with NATO on the basis of the Partnership for Peace program, and  we expect the CSCE to become a more effective tool in overcoming  international crises."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Fikret Bila: "Suggestions for Ciller from </F> Demirel"]    [Excerpt] Ankara--[Passage omitted] Demirel listed as  follows for MILLIYET the decisions he considers necessary for  the economy to overcome its stagnation:    1) The state must definitely get out of setting prices. 2)  The KIT's [State Economic Enterprises] must be sold rapidly. 3)  The marketplace must abandon interest formation and must not  insist on an interest ceiling below inflation. 4) The foreign  exchange rate must be left entirely to the marketplace, and the  state definitely must not intervene. 5) The taxation and export  incentive systems must be revised. 6) State indebtedness to the  investing private sector must be repaid immediately.    Demirel stressed that although these measures are not as  radical as the 24 January decisions they must absolutely be  adopted if the free market economy is to take hold and healthy  balances to be formed.  <H5>  Fear of Intervention </H5>   Demirel stressed that Turkey seems to want a free market  economy, but actually does not and fears the free economy. For  Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, he had the message: "Don't  intervene in the economy," and made the following evaluation:    "The most important problem of the economy in Turkey is the  failure to make the transition to a free market economy in the  full sense. Turkey is afraid of the free market. The state is  intervening in the economy. Free market rules do not work when  there is constant fear of state intervention. It is necessary to  take the measures I listed to eliminate this fear."    Demirel pointed out that the 24 January decisions met two of  the three goals of the period in which they originated and said:  "The 24 January decisions had three goals. One was to eliminate  shortages, another was to step up the economic process, and  another was to ensure the transition to a free market economy.  The decisions eliminated the shortages at that time and stepped  up the economic process, but the transition to the free market  economy, the most important goal, has not been fully  accomplished. This process is continuing but has not been  completed. From this standpoint, the 24 January decisions failed  to achieve their third goal. To achieve it, the decisions I  mentioned must be taken and the formation of economic balances  must be left entirely to the marketplace.    ``Turkey's economy is still a command economy. As long as we  have a command economy, the necessity to overcome bottlenecks  and the occurrence of sudden imbalances, just as in the past,  will be unavoidable. Turkey must now make the decision to  abandon the command economy and must not be afraid of it.''    Demirel pointed out that the dinner he hosted at Cankaya  yesterday for bank administrators had nothing to do with recent  economic events, that for a long time he has been having dinners  periodically for groups such as professional organizations and  trade guilds, and that this one had been planned far in advance  of the recent foreign exchange event. Demirel said, "My party  for bank administrators was not something that was done after  the recent foreign exchange event. It was a routine arrangement  along with other organizations for which the date had been set  far in advance."</p>

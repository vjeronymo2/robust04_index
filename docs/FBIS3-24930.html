			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] This Tuesday, 1 February 1994, the head of state,  Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko signed a number of decrees, some  related to public and mixed economy companies, one related to  the Banque du Zaire and two others concerning the education  sector.    Concerning the Banque du Zaire, the head of state has  appointed a new governor and a new deputy governor. Through  this action, and following the protective measures taken to curb  the ill-considered outflow of important funds from the Banque du  Zaire, the head of state sought to draw all the conclusions from  the report issued by the board of the Banque du Zaire. It has  been concluded from this report that serious presumptions of  responsibility weigh heavily on the governor of the Banque du  Zaire, concerning not only the failure of the monetary reform of  28 September 1993 but also the mismanagement of the (?concurrent  issuing of bank notes) that resulted from the aforementioned  reform.    In promoting the former deputy governor, (Ndian Kabul) --  who  was not involved in the failure of the aforementioned monetary  reform -- to the rank of governor, the head of state has put his  trust in a high-ranking civil servant of the institution who is  called on to take measures likely to improve the dramatic  situation of our central bank. The same could be said of the  deputy governor who has been chosen among the high-ranking  experienced men of our monetary institution.    Concerning public sector companies and one mixed economy  company, the head of state has taken these measures to fill the  vacancies that resulted from the measures of dismissal that have  recently hit the former managers of PetroZaire, the national  post and telecommunications board of Zaire and Zaire-SEP.    We note that concerning this matter, the head of state has  appealed to competent managers who are experienced in their  fields. In addition, the head of state has at the same time  sought to resolve the problem of the legal statute of the Banque  de Commerce Exterieure du Zaire [Foreign Trade Bank of Zaire]  which has for a long time been operation in a state of confusion.    Finally, concerning the education sector, the president of  the republic, Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko has also signed two  decrees, one concerning the restructuring and the reorganization  of the Zairean national commission to UNESCO and the other  appointing the permanent secretary of this commission.    Here are the main points of these decrees, signed on  Tuesday,  1 February, 1994 by the president of the republic, Marshal  Mobutu Sese Seko:    1.

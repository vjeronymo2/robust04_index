			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / ESA sees Russia as space partner EUROPE'S manned space shuttle is heading for fresh cost cuts and delays but will seek technology co-operation with the Russian space programme, the European Space Agency (ESA) announced yesterday. The ESA will propose a diminished future for the Ecu4.4bn (Dollars 6.3bn) Hermes shuttle programme at a meeting of technology ministers of its 13 members in Spain next month, said Mr Jean-Marie Luton, the agency's director general. Mr Luton, speaking a day after a meeting of the ESA's governing council, said the agency would propose a slowdown in work on Hermes over the three years to 1995 and an Ecu231m reduction in its budget. He denied reports that the ESA was preparing to scrap Hermes. If accepted by ESA members, this will mark a reprieve for the shuttle, in which France is the leading partner, contributing 43.5 per cent of its budget. Germany successfully demanded at the last ESA ministerial, last November, that any decision on the continuation of Europe's manned space programme should be delayed for a year. France is a staunch supporter of Hermes, which it sees as the spearhead of Europe's hopes for autonomy in space, but Germany - the second biggest partner with 28 per cent of the budget - is keen to defray the costs by seeking international co-operation. Bonn has argued that Russia has technology to offer from its cash-strapped space programme. Both the two leading Hermes partners' government spending has come under pressure over the past year, from the costs of German unification and French budget austerity. Separately, he announced that the ESA would take part in the development of Russia's latest generation of space stations, the MIR-2, due to be put into orbit in 1996.</p>

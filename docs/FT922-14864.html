			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: WH Smith to inject Pounds 24m into Do It All WH SMITH is to inject Pounds 24m into Do It All, its DIY joint venture with Boots, to help fund the roll-out of a new format aimed at the serious home-improvement enthusiast. At the same time, the two parent companies are tidying up Do It All's shareholding structure, which was created through the merger of Boots's Payless chain with WH Smith's Do It All two years ago. Do It All's preference shares will be converted into Pounds 1 ordinary shares, of which Boots will receive 48.5m and WH Smith 24.5m, reflecting the difference in profitability between the two merged DIY businesses. However, WH Smith will remain an equal partner by subscribing in cash for a further 24m Pounds 1 shares. The cash inflow will initially be used to reduce Do It All's borrowings and will then be applied to financing the expansion of project-based DIY stores which have been successfully trialled at Rugby and Stafford. Mr David Thompson, Boots' finance director, said Do It All's stores would be converted from August at the rate of six a month at a cost of about Pounds 250,000 apiece. The DIY market has recently been disfigured by price discounting among the market leaders, B&amp;Q and Texas Homecare, which has hit the 230-store Do It All chain. But Mr John Napier, Smith's finance director, said: 'Overall, our market is stable despite the competitive activity. It is not buoyant but it is not dreadfully awful. I am not sure that we share the City's view that there is a mid-life crisis in the DIY industry.' The restructuring is expected to have little effect on the reported earnings of both parent companies this year. But City analysts suggest more money may be needed next year to fund any further expansion. See Lex</p>

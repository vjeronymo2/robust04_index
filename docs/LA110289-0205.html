			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Drug crimes -- A story in the Oct. 29 South Bay edition of The Times about drug  dealing in Harbor City incorrectly identified Hector DuBon as assistant  principal of Normont Elementary School and quoted DuBon about gang shootings  and other crimes. DuBon is assistant principal of another elementary school,  elsewhere in Los Angeles, and the remarks he made do not apply to Normont  Elementary. Rosalie Cochran, principal at Normont, said there have been no gang  shootings on or near school property, and that her biggest crime concern is  that students must sometimes walk to and from campus on streets where drug  dealers operate.  </P></p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / International Company News: Smurfit plays catalyst for change - Takeover could spark further consolidation Jefferson Smurfit's takeover of Cellulose du Pin, the paper and packaging activities of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, the French glass and building materials group, could start a ripple of consolidation in the highly fragmented European packaging industry. 'The industry needs more consolidation to be healthy and I hope we can be something of a catalyst in that,' said Mr Howard Kilroy, Smurfit's president and chief operations director. Although Jefferson will become the largest producer of corrugated board in Europe and one of the largest packaging companies after the merger, it will hold only a 10 per cent market share. Industry leaders command a share of 20 to 30 per cent of sales in other sectors. Smurfit is still looking for further expansion in the paper and packaging business as the industry emerges from its worst recession. Mr Kilroy believes Smurfit can turn round Cellulose du Pin's loss-making activities quickly on the back of the industry upturn which started this year, and the rationalisation effort which has gone into the French group's operations in recent years. 'They are some good assets which have been well-invested and are just coming out of some historical problems,' says Mr Kilroy. The packaging arm made a loss of FFr1.1bn (Dollars 204m) last year, but Mr Kilroy says that much of that can be accounted for by a fluff pulp plant and a wood business which are not included in the takeover deal. In addition, the French group had incurred restructuring costs in making the operations more efficient. The company reckons that the takeover will enhance its earnings per share in 1996. The merger of Smurfit's European operations with the French company will pivot Jefferson into the market leader for corrugated board, with production overtaking the Swedish company, SCA, by 200,000 tonnes. Corrugated board, used predominantly in the manufacture of cardboard boxes, is a leading indicator of economic recovery as it is such a widely used packaging material. Industry watchers say demand is picking up fast in Europe. Mr Tim Rothwell, packaging analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the London securities house, says demand is up by 12 per cent in Italy and between 3 per cent and 5 per cent in Germany, the Netherlands, France and the UK. At the same time, raw materials costs are increasing - waste paper prices have risen by up to 50 per cent following a 30 per cent upturn in virgin pulp prices this year. In some areas, waste paper which is used for making corrugated board is not available. Two German mills have been forced to suspend operations this year for lack of raw materials. Smurfit is well equipped to provide waste paper to Cellulose du Pin's French corrugated business, which Mr Kilroy describes as a 'jewel'. Smurfit runs the second largest waste paper recycling business in France. Some analysts are sceptical that the company will be able to make the savings it says it will to turn the business round. Mr Dennis Christie, packaging analyst at James Capel, the London brokerage, notes that corrugated paper producers are finding it hard to pass on higher raw materials costs to their customers. 'The company might suffer a short-term margin squeeze, but it is a good time in the cycle to purchase, and over the longer term it is probably a good thing,' says Mr Christie. He says the purchase price paid by Smurfit for the French company is relatively cheap compared with other companies in the sector. He points out that Smurfit is paying a price equal to 70 per cent of the turnover of Cellulose du Pin, whereas similar companies have a market capitalisation equal to 120 per cent to 130 per cent of sales on European stock markets.  --------------------------------------------------         EUROPE'S LEADING PACKAGING COMPANIES  --------------------------------------------------                               Sales (Dollars bn)                                    1993 est  -------------------------------------------------- CarnaudMetalBox                      3.87 Viag                                 3.26 Jefferson Smurfit*                   3.00 Saint-Gobain**                       2.49 Pechiney                             2.27 Tetra-Laval                           2.2 KNP BT                               1.74 SCA                                  1.71 Van Leer                             1.45  -------------------------------------------------- *after the acquisition; Jefferson Smurfit 12th before acquisition. **before acquisition  -------------------------------------------------- Source: BZW/Pira  --------------------------------------------------</p>

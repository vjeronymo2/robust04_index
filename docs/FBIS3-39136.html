			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Silvio Buzzanca: "The New Right Musters Almost </F> 50 Percent"]    [Text] The CIRM [Italian Center for Market Research] weekly  survey conducted for Telemontecarlo [TMC] gives Forza Italia 24  percent of the vote, the left coalition 34 percent, and [Pact  for Italy leader] Segni and [Italian Popular Party, PPI,  Secretary] Martinazzoli 17 percent. The League drops to 10  percent, on a par with National Alliance.    Forza Italia thus gains percentage points, the left holds  on,  the center drops behind. Rete [Network] and the Greens move up  together with [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi; National  Alliance, Democratic Alliance [AD] (with the secularists), and  Communist Renewal hold their positions; the PDS [Democratic  Party of the Left] and the League move slightly back;  Martinazzoli's PPI and Segni's Pact for Italy lose ground, as do  [Christian Democratic Center, CCD, leaders] Casini and  Mastella's centrists. These are the results of the CIRM weekly  survey of Italians' electoral preferences, as broadcast by TMC  yesterday evening.    These results, however, must be treated very cautiously,  because they are based on a proportional share of the vote,  whereas 75 percent of the seats must actually be won in each  individual constituency, following a direct contest between  candidates, in which "local" factors not taken into account in  surveys also come into play. Furthermore, the results must take  into account the fact that 71 percent of the 2,500 interviewees  said they had made up their minds, whereas 29 percent have not  yet decided for whom to vote. The undecided, however,  constitute a shrinking percentage -- last week they made up 33  percent -- and largely belong to certain sociodemographic  categories: women, particularly housewives, people over 55,  people with no formal education.    Among the undecided, a particularly important group are  those  who profess to support the "center." CIRM emphasized this fact,  adding that, whereas in previous elections undeciveness was  spread across the parties, this time it involved mainly the  "center." Researchers warned, however, that this does not  necessarily mean such people will eventually vote for  Martinazzoli and Segni's candidates. The "center" interviewees  range from Berlusconi to the progressives' right wing and those  PDS candidates who are considered to be more "moderate." In  addition, in order to interpret these percentages, it is  necessary to establish who will ultimately win the vote of those  who identify with certain political forces -- for example,  republicans and socialists -- that are profoundly divided in  terms of the alliances. There are [Italian Socialist Party  Secretary] Del Turco's socialists, who are aligned with the  progressives with [Enzo] Mattina's socialists; there are Piro  and Boniver's socialists [Federation of Italian Socialists], who  want to reach an agreement with Martinazzoli; and there are  those, such as Signorile, who have already reached an agreement  with the center. The same applies to the republicans: Some are  siding with AD and the progressives; [Italian Republican Party,  PRI, Secretary] La Malfa occupies the center with the PPI; and  Castagnetti and Gorgoni are siding with Segni.    [Radical Party leader] Pannella, on the other hand,  constitutes a typical case. He has chosen a center position,  whereas those who say they want to vote for him identify with  the progressives. What will these voters do in the  constituencies when they will be forced to choose between a  "progressive" candidate and some other candidate?    In this flurry of men and acronyms, of pacts and alliances  which are born and die within a few hours, the only possible  reading of the results is one in terms of major groupings:  left, center, and center-right. Within this framework, the  center-right alignment headed by Berlusconi, [National Alliance  leader] Fini, [League Secretary] Bossi, and Casini is predicted  to win 49 percent of the vote, compared with 45 percent seven  days ago. This figure is obtained by adding Forza Italia's 24  percent, National Alliance's 10 percent, another 10 percent  corresponding to the League, and the 4 percent mustered by CCD,  which has lost one percentage point.    The CIRM opinion poll shows a Knight [Berlusconi nickname]  sailing full steam ahead, moving from 19 percent to 24 percent  of the vote in a single week -- a result which must have been  influenced by the electoral show at the EUR [Rome suburb], and  the wide coverage given to the "convention" by certain TV  networks. Fini obtained the same results as the previous week,  whereas Bossi lost one percentage point. This confirms the  downtrend in the Bandwagon's [League nickname] share: On 21  January CIRM gave it 13 percent of the vote, on 28 January 12  percent, and on 4 February 11 percent -- and yet the League's  congress took place only one week ago, offering ample  opportunity for TV and press coverage.    The PPI and Forza Italia's "center," still struggling with  the problem of certain "thorny" candidacies, lost another three  percentage points, dropping from 20 percent to 17 percent. This  confirms that Berlusconi entering the field penalized  Martinazzoli and Segni, who mustered 23 percent of the vote only  one week ago. The same applies to National Alliance which, had  the Knight remained in place at the head of his business empire,  could have aspired to 15 percent of the vote.    What about the left? Despite Berlusconi's forceful entry on  stage, the progressives' alliance, though badly shaken by fierce  disputes over the candidacies and by AD's threats to  "disengage," can still count on the same share as last week: 34  percent of the vote. Does this signal a reversal of the trend  of the previous two weeks, during which the "glorious war  machine" seemed to be misfiring? On 28 January support was down  to 36 percent of the vote, whereas on 21 January it was 39  percent. The Oak [PDS nickname] lost one percentage point,  dropping from 20 percent to 19 percent, whereas Rete and the  Greens, who are grouped together by CIRM researchers, gained one  percentage point, up from 4 percent to 5 percent. This is the  same figure given for Communist Renewal and AD, which remain  stationary.</p>

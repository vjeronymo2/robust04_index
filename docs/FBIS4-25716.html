			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on government work report delivered by Tibet </F> Autonomous Regional Chairman Gyaincain Norbu at the Second  Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous Regional People's  Congress; from the "News" program]    [Text] Discussing Tibet's opening wider to the outside  world and efforts to develop foreign trade and tourism, Chairman  Gyaincain Norbu pointed out in the government work report: In  further reforming the foreign economic and trade system and  establishing foreign trade operating mechanisms in keeping with  the needs of a market economy, we should adhere to such  principles of reform as unified policies, liberalized operation,  competition on equal terms, responsibility for one's own profits  and losses, the integration of industry and trade, and the  promotion of the agent system. We should focus the reform on,  first of all, implementing, together with other parts of the  country, a single foreign exchange rate; on abandoning mandatory  plans on foreign exchange receipts and payments in the export  trade, as well as the system of foreign exchange retention and  delivery; and on introducing the system of settling and selling  foreign exchange by banks. Second, we should formulate and  perfect preferential policies to encourage exports. Third, we  should accelerate the pace of changing the operating mechanisms  of foreign trade enterprises, in linking their wage, bonus, and  distribution system with their economic efficiency in earning  foreign exchange through exports. Fourth, we should grant  foreign trade autonomy to qualified productive and circulation  enterprises and set up a number of comprehensive foreign trade  companies. Fifth, we should strengthen and improve macroeconomic  regulation and control in foreign trade and establish a sound  foreign trade operating order.    In seeking to develop foreign trade and economic relations,  we should pay particular attention to the work in the following  aspects: We should rely on the region's resources in actively  promoting the exports of agricultural, animal, native, and  special products; ethnic handicrafts, and souvenirs for  tourists. We should bring into play the frontier's advantage  and improve the facilities of the existing trading ports. While  expanding foreign trade, we should take the initiative to  cooperate with neighboring countries in various fields; ensure  the coordination of production, processing, and exportation  links; and accelerate the integration of foreign trade,  industry, agriculture, and technology. We should improve the  investment environment in order to attract more businessmen to  invest in Tibet, and we should explore various ways of absorbing  foreign capital. To increase foreign exchange earnings through  exports, we should continue to carry out regional cooperative  projects, joint ventures, cooperation in related fields,  materials exchanges, and the construction of joint export  commodity production bases with enterprises in the hinterland.    In seeking to promote tourism, we should, in centering on  quality and efficiency, pay close attention to the resources of  tourism markets and the development of commodities. We should  open up new tourist routes and areas, and gradually set up a  system of connecting tourist points, routes, and areas.  Moreover, we should actively develop special tourist courses in  mountaineering, exploration, and scientific surveys so as to  strive to achieve breakthroughs in this year's number of  tourists, tourism business volume, and tourism foreign exchange  earnings.    We should attach importance to and strengthen the work  related to foreign affairs. We should actively coordinate with  the state's overall diplomacy in ensuring a good job in border  supervision, consular and foreign affairs, protocol, and  cooperation with friendship cities. We should seek to create a  sound peripheral environment and continuously expand contacts  with foreign countries so as to promote Tibet's reform, opening  up, and economic construction.</p>

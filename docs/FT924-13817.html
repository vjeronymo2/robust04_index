			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Henderson close to agreement on buying Touche Remnant HENDERSON Administration said yesterday it was close to buying fellow fund management company Touche Remnant from the French bank Societe Generale. The combined group would have more than Pounds 9bn of funds under management and would be the largest manager in the UK investment trust sector. The proposed deal may herald a period of rationalisation in the fund management sector, where companies have battled sluggish stock markets and a lack of enthusiasm of private investors in recent years. A survey by Touche Ross Management Consultants recently found that half of all unit trust companies earned marginal profits or made losses in 1991. Henderson has seen a decline in its funds under management from Pounds 9.57bn at the end of September 1987 to about Pounds 7bn at present. On the institutional side, Henderson has lost a number of pension fund clients because of poor investment performance in 1987 and 1988. In retail, Henderson lacks the direct sales force operated by many of its bank and insurance company rivals. Touche Remnant also lacks a direct sales force, but it will add Pounds 1.3bn of funds in the investment trust sector, where the quality of earnings is high. Henderson said the enlarged group should also achieve economies of scale in head office, advertising and technology costs. Each group has a wide range of unit trusts, where funds can eventually be rationalised. Societe Generale, one of France's largest banks, bought Touche Remnant in 1989 for Pounds 50m, intending to use it as a base from which to expand into the UK unit trust market. In the late 1980s a number of European banks bought UK fund management expertise. Equity markets, however, have performed poorly since 1989 and the value of Touche Remnant's funds under management has shrunk from Pounds 2.9bn at the time of the acquisition to Pounds 2bn last year. The French bank said it had decided that Touche Remnant no longer had the necessary critical mass needed in fund management. No price has yet been agreed for the deal.

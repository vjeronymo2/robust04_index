			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Corneliu Coposu, president of the National </F> Peasant Christian Democratic Party, at a news conference in  Bucharest on 24 January: "Mr. Coposu Warns: The Men in Power  Will Be Kicked Out of Their Jobs Within 24 Hours of the Change  of Regime!]    [Text] "The new government will agonize for a maximum  three months after its creation. We do not give the new  government, if it is created, more than three months to  survive," Mr. Corneliu Coposu, president of the National Peasant  Christian Democratic Party [PNTCD] said at a news conference  yesterday. "This is a very short-term transitional government.  According to our information, not even Mr. Ion Iliescu likes  the idea of the Romanian National Unity Party [PUNR] joining the  cabinet, since he is aware of the image as an extremist party  that the PUNR 'enjoys' abroad. The new team will cause negative  reactions and will be contested from the very start. The new  ministers might not even obtain the endorsement of the  parliament, although I do not see why the power should be afraid  of that, since its holds the majority there... Anyhow, it is a  strong proof of naivete on the part of the people in power to  believe that, if they occupy all the decision-taking functions  in the current society, they will stay nailed to their chairs.  Actually, all these newly appointed people will be kicked out of  their jobs within 24 hours of the change of regime..."    He also said that Romania risks being ejected from the  Council of Europe if the government does not implement the nine  amendments imposed by the aforementioned body within a maximum  of six months from the date of adherence. A similar situation  will occur if the former owners do not get back the assets  confiscated by the communists and sue the Romanian state at the  Council of Europe. "It is certain that the owners will win  their cases and the restitution verdicts will have to be applied  immediately," the PNTCD leader said. "Without foreign  financing, the government will get bogged down in petty  administrative activities, which will also be blocked themselves  by the lack of money. But what is worse, I have yet to hear of  a program from either the PUNR or the Social Democracy Party of  Romania [PDSR]; their so-called salvation programs are nothing  but fantasies. We have never considered Mr. Nicolae Vacaroiu to  be an authentic prime minister, but rather a candidate for the  position."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Linda Choy in Beijing] </F>   [Text] The Liberal Party was told its attempt to bring the  electoral bill closer to the Basic Law would not prevent China  disbanding the three tiers of government in 1997. The message  was delivered by Hong Kong co-convener of the Preliminary  Working Committee (PWC) political subgroup, Leung Chun-ying, who  is in Beijing to discuss an initial report on the formation of  the first post-1997 legislature and district organisations.  Political parties' attempts to amend Governor Chris Patten's  reform proposals had nothing to do with the PWC's work, Mr Leung  said.    The Liberal Party's proposal, to be discussed by the  Legislative Council on June 29, would retain the original system  of functional constituencies under which votes are cast by  corporate members of business organisations. The party also  seeks to bring the four-sector composition of the election  committee in line with the Basic Law requirements.    The PWC would come up with a proposal which followed the  Basic Law.    In its report, the subgroup will list possible solutions and  recommendations for the formation of the first legislature and  district organisations. One of the key features is related to  the voting method, including the multi-seat single-vote system  that has been voted down by Legco. Another proposal is for  proportional representation, which most subgroup members  preferred.    The report will also touch on the smooth transition of the  civil service, the formation of the first Special Administrative  Region government, the relationship between the executive and  legislature, and the setting up of offices in the SAR by  different levels of the Chinese Government.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Letter: Way out for County Hall buyer Sir, You report Shirayama's threat to pull out of developing County Hall unless the government clarifies its position ('County Hall buyer threatens to pull out', June 15). Far from being a blow to the government if Shirayama were to withdraw, it would be a great fillip to London and a credit to the govern-ment if Mr John Major were to direct that the London Residuary Body could sell the site for a nominal amount to the London School of Economics in recognition of the benefits such a use could bring to the city. That this great building should be required for institutional use was anticipated by the LRB and Shirayama which have not 'paid' Pounds 60m but by all accounts have entered into an arrangement giving both parties the option to withdraw. It would probably help a depressed property market if Shirayama were given a way out of a development whose financing in better times has already defeated more experienced operators. Gideon Nellen, Nellen &amp; Co, 19 Albemarle Street, London W1X 3HA</p>

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Toyota to cut output as demand weakens Weaker-than-expected demand for new cars in Europe means Toyota will not use the 100,000-a-year capacity at its Burnaston plant near Derby next year, contrary to plan, the company said yesterday, John Griffiths writes. It now plans to produce 90,000 cars next year, compared with a projected 85,000 this year. 'However, as we have seen this year, which started strongly but then slowed more recently, the market is very changeable and our production levels next year may be amended accordingly,' said Mr Yukihisa Hirano, managing director of Toyota UK. The announcement, added to Nissan's failure to meet output projections for its plant at Washington, Tyne and Wear, and relatively slow growth in output at Honda's plant in Swindon, Wiltshire, may indicate that European carmakers have overstated fears about potential strong growth in sales of Japanese cars. Mr Hirano rejected speculation that Toyota had decided to delay plans to double its Burnaston capacity.</p>

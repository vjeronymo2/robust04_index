"When the party is determined, we can do anything!", a motto  of faith of our people, well shows the noble spiritual world of  our officials and party members and other working people who  accept the lines and policies of the party as a requirement of  their life and carry them out on the principles of absoluteness  and unconditionality.

The significance and vitality of the work also lie in that  it  has helped to establish a revolutionary style of life whereby  all the officials and party members participate in their party  life sincerely with a correct viewpoint on the party  organisation.

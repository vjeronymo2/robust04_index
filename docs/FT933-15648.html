			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / UN and Iraq in oil export talks UN AND Iraqi officials began negotiations yesterday on the possible resumption of oil exports from Iraq that, if successful, could add more than half a million barrels a day to the current glut, further depressing prices. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, said he hoped that an eventual agreement to ship up to Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.06bn) of Iraqi oil over six months would be 'a first step in building confidence between the UN and Iraq'. He was instrumental in reviving the talks during a meeting with Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraqi deputy prime minister, in Geneva last month. The earlier rounds in the first half of 1992 ended in failure, in part because of Baghdad's objections to a requirement that oil be shipped through a Turkish pipeline in order to facilitate UN monitoring of the quantities sold. Mr Carl-August Fleischhauer, German head of the UN legal office, is leading the negotiating team from the UN Secretariat. Mr Riyadh al-Qaysi, is the principal Iraqi negotiator. A UN spokesman stressed that the talks were open ended. Some sources officials they could go on for a week or more. An unaccustomed mood of optimism prevailed last night that this time there could be success. Almost two years ago, the Security Council approved a limited lifting of sanctions to permit oil sales to raise cash for Iraqi humanitarian needs and reimburse the UN for its costs in implementing the Gulf ceasefire.</p>

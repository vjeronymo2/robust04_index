			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOSEPH N. BELL: NICE MIX OF LAW AND IDEALISM  </P> <P> Several weeks ago, 15 homeless people who had filed suit against the city of  Santa Ana for confiscating their personal possessions were awarded about $3,300  each in a settlement with the city. Deep in the story, it was noted that their  attorney, Christopher Mears, took no fee and charged only $373 as reimbursement  for expenses. That seemed remarkable enough to look up Mears and see what he  was about.  </P> <P> First off, he didn't find his waiving of a fee all that remarkable. "It happens  a lot more often than you think," he said. "Personal injury lawyers" -- which  he is -- "take a bad rap. It's a popular stereotype that has existed for years  and is substantiated by a few bad apples, when nine-tenths are hard-working,  sincere professionals. But no one is allowed to have good motives anymore. I'm  really sick and tired that the only image of lawyers the public seems to have  is this greedy stereotype."  </P> <P> We were talking in his bright, airy office in a converted grain silo in the Old  Town of Irvine. His windows look out on a background of mountains and a  foreground of agricultural fields, staked out for the summer's crop. "When I  come in in the early morning," he said a little dreamily, "and the sun is  coming up behind this building, the stakes cast fantastic shadow patterns."  </P> <P> This is the anomaly of Mears, a short, stocky man with longish, dark-brown hair  forever drifting over his forehead and an almost cherubic face, rather like a  clean-shaven Robin Williams. He is coldly surgical in court -- I watched him  questioning a Westminster police officer who shot and killed the 18-year-old  son of a Latino family he is representing -- and almost wistfully optimistic  about the potential humanity of most people, as well as fiercely defensive of  their rights. Especially those who are powerless in the Orange County social  order.  </P> <P> Mears is a second-generation Orange County native who graduated from Santa Ana  High School in 1969, won his law degree from Western State University ("I  wanted to be a lawyer ever since I saw 'To Kill a Mockingbird' as a child"),  and practiced in an Orange County firm until he went out on his own about five  years ago. His biggest settlement was $15.5 million for an elderly woman whose  medical insurance was canceled on the basis of a fraudulent report. (It was  later reduced to $2 million, then settled out of court when that figure was  appealed.) He takes all his cases, without apology, on a contingency basis --  usually, he says, one-third -- and mostly on behalf of people who couldn't  otherwise afford an attorney.  </P> <P> "I was infected in the 1960s with the idealism of my times," he says. "And it  was easy because my schoolteacher mother -- who raised me with my grandmother  -- was the most non-judgmental person I still have ever met. She taught my  brother and me that we weren't any better than anyone else."  </P> <P> Mears got involved in the homeless case when Orange County Legal Aid called and  asked him to help. It took two years, and he probably could have won a sizable  fee from the city had he taken the case to court, but he chose to settle it and  get some money in the hands of the people he was representing.  </P> <P> "It could very well turn their lives around," he said. "I know one of them  bought a car so he could get to job interviews. Another bought a ticket back  home where he hopes to rebuild his life. Many of them used the money for  housing so they would have a base from which to look for work.  </P> <P> "So many of these people could make the transition back into society with less  help than most people realize. Most of them work as often as they can. They  just can't get enough money together to break out of the vicious circle of  looking unkempt because they live on the street and being unable to receive  mail or offer a resume or complete a job interview because they don't have an  address."  </P> <P> He told about two brothers -- skilled mechanics from a Montana town where work  had dried up -- who came to Orange County looking for jobs. They slept in their  car to save money, and one day the car was impounded for being illegally parked  while the brothers were applying for work. They didn't have enough money to get  the car out of hock, the cost of retrieving it is growing daily, and they are  on the streets -- dealing with a system that has no flexibility to help them  out of this dilemma.  </P> <P> He also told about one of his homeless clients who found a laboring job that  required him to be at work at 5:30 a.m. Because the buses didn't run that  early, this man walked from Santa Ana to Anaheim every morning to report for  work that still didn't pay him enough to get him off the streets.  </P> <P> "In cities like New York and Chicago," he says, "you step over homeless people.  You can't ignore them. But in Santa Ana, the homeless people were trying to  stay out of sight, stashing their things under bushes. That makes the city of  Santa Ana even more despicable for coming in with a slash-and-burn policy that  not only ignored basic constitutional rights but, even more important, violated  all the standards of human decency."  </P> <P> So what about the rights of the businessmen who put heat on the city because  they don't want the homeless camping out on their doorsteps?  </P> <P> "They have a legitimate beef," Mears says, "but there are ways of dealing with  this without doing violence to people's possessions. I can't solve the homeless  problem in this conversation. But I do know one thing for sure: It has to start  with the right level of concern -- with humanity and caring. This isn't just  liberal naivete. Change has to start from within, and when it starts from that  point, when we have the right attitude, answers will be forthcoming. It's only  when we try to avoid or ignore the problem or function in spite of it that it  doesn't get resolved."  </P> <P> Mears thinks it is easier to ignore these social problems in Orange County  "because the veneer of normalcy is very thick here, very insidious. But there  are also signs of hope. Every day I can see at least as many people helping  others as hurting them. Each one of us is either part of the problem or part of  the solution, and I guess I'm not cynical because I believe in the inherent  humanity of man and in the power of the individual to bring about change."  </P> <P> To which 15 erstwhile homeless Santa Ana residents who are using a new-found  stake to try to get their lives back on track would say a fervent "Amen."  </P></p>

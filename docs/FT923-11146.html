			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Construction Contracts: New Bangladeshi bridge design study RENDEL PALMER &amp; TRIT TON and its fellow consultants on the proposed Pounds 310m Jamuna Bridge in Bangladesh have been commissioned to integrate the bridge end design with the land use master plan drawn up by another British consultant, GHK/MRM International. It is recognised that the World Bank-funded bridge will provide considerable development potential at the bridge ends and that it is vital to adapt and integrate the master plan with the engineering design and tender documents. RPT, its engineering partners NEDECO of Holland and the locally-based Bangladesh Consultants, will consider a number of factors. These range from distribution of landfill and integration of re-settlement sites to assessing the general layout of bridge end facilities, including roads and railway land allocation. As far as the bridge is concerned, RPT is in the process of completing the new programme of contractor prequalification called for by the bank. Tender documents are expected to relate to a bridge designed for road, but with the potential to be adapted to road plus rail at a future date and at minimum incremental cost. The bridge will be the first fixed transport link across the Jamuna River, which forms a 15km barrier separating the fertile north-west zone from the commercial centre, Dhaka and the country's primary port, Chittagong.</p>

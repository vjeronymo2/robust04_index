			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NO FAN OF HOUSE OF THE FUTURE  </P> <P> As a homeowner who has been trying to save 10% of water usage every year and  finding it difficult to do it, I find it irritating to read (Around the Valley,  March 1) that homes are being built with indoor swimming pools and waterfalls.  </P> <P> If you have the money, build waterfalls and swimming pools and more high-rises  in the Valley, and I will be asked to save 10% again and have to ask for a  glass of water at my restaurant.  </P> <P> STANLEY GARDNER  </P> <P> Reseda  </P></p>

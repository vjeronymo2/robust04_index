			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Spain acts to haltrunaway deficit THE SPANISH government will tomorrow attempt to bring its runaway public finances under control by announcing a risky fiscal package designed to cut this year's deficit by Dollars 3.26bn (Pounds 1.7bn). The Finance Ministry, which has admitted it has badly miscalculated the effect the slowdown in the economy would have on tax revenues, is expected to announce an immediate increase in the top rate of value added tax from 13 per cent to 15 per cent, an increase in the tax on personal incomes, and spending cuts expected to affect most ministries. Such an increase in VAT, six months before Spain would have been obliged to introduce it under European Community tax harmonisation agreements, will increase revenues for the rest of this year by about Dollars 900m. The government is hoping to take in an extra Dollars 400m by withholding more tax. Madrid had been forecasting revenues of Dollars 128bn in 1992 but had reached only Dollars 54bn by the end of June. It has struggled also to find budget cuts of around Dollars 1.9bn for the rest of this year - with roughly 80 per cent of government spending already committed. This compares with the Dollars 3.5bn it was forced to cut this time last year when faced with a similar crisis. Now, though, the government has come under pressure from the ruling socialists not to cut social spending as a general election must be held by October 1993 at the latest. The budget deficit in the first six months of 1992 was more than 40 per cent over target, making it impossible to lower the deficit from 4.4 per cent of gross domestic product last year to 2.6 per cent as pledged in plans presented to the EC. The measures to be announced tomorrow will attempt to re-establish that target, although a VAT increase is likely to damage efforts to end the year with inflation of below 6 per cent.</p>

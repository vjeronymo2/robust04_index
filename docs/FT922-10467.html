			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: EC clears Accor bid for Wagons-Lits THE EUROPEAN Commission has cleared Accor's bid for Wagons-Lits, the Franco-Belgian travel company, but on the condition that the French hotels group sells Wagons-Lits' chain of motorway cafes in France. Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, has set a legally-binding deadline for the sale of the Wagons-Lits division. Officials would not indicate the final date, on the grounds that it might be used by potential buyers to extract a better price out of Accor. Brussels' merger task force concluded there were no objections to the merger in the hotels and general catering sector, but that the groups would have over half the French motorway cafe market.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ETTELA'AT correspondent's report] </F>   [Text] The goods exported by the Islamic Republic of Iran  enjoy immense popularity in the markets of southern Azerbaijan,  according to the press committee official of the Azerbaijani  city of Lenkoran. He said: The facilities provided to  Azerbaijan for the importing of Iranian products, their suitable  prices and quality are among the factors that have enabled  Iranian products to attract greater attention and have greater  commercial competitiveness in this region.    Tofik Allavardiyev, the press committee official of  Lenkoran,  elaborated: The cities of Lenkoran and Astara have become  wholesale centers for Iranian commodities in Azerbaijan. He  added: The merchants of the republics of Dagestan and Chechenya  are among the permanent customers of Iranian products,  particularly of preserves and plastic materials.    An Iranian trader in Lenkoran said: Since Lenkoran is  considered a bridge for the transportation of Iranian goods to  various parts of the Caucasus, most of our businessmen display a  special interest in operating here. He added that the Iranian  products most in demand include apples, dairy products,  potatoes, tomato paste, dill pickles, chocolates, machine-made  carpets, and low-price garments.    Allavardiyev said: As soon as the Iranian products arrive,  long queues of store owners and retailers form outside the  import companies.    One of the merchants resident in Lenkoran, Ali Teymuriyev,  said: Our proximity to the Islamic Republic of Iran has been of  immense assistance in eliminating the bottlenecks resulting from  privatization in the southern regions in Azerbaijan. He added:  Most of the traders in this region have--with their prompt  payments--been able to elicit the attention of the Iranian  businessmen for the purchase of these goods for resale in  markets in other parts of Azerbaijan and the Caucasus.</p>

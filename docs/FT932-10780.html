			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / House valuations probed by MMC MORTGAGE lenders' practice of making their borrowers pay a fee for the valuation of houses they intend to buy was yesterday referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission after complaints that borrowers are being overcharged. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said he was referring to the MMC the practice by which house buyers pay a total of more than Pounds 100m a year so that mortgage lenders can ensure that they are lending the appropriate amount. The OFT has also received complaints from valuers and surveyors that some lenders choose valuers because of the number of other borrowers they can refer to the lender. Sir Bryan said he was concerned that lenders have little incentive to keep down the service's cost as it was passed on. He was also worried that borrowers had little opportunity to 'shop around' to cut the cost. The OFT said there had been 'a great many complaints' from bodies representing valuers and surveyors that some mortgage lenders are restricting the ability of some surveyors to compete in the market. It said many lenders seemed increasingly unwilling to accept, for mortgage valuation purposes, house surveys already carried out for a potential borrower. It also said borrowers had been complaining about fee increases. The Council of Mortgage Lenders welcomed the reference, which asks the MMC to report by next February. It said that the process would 'clarify a difficult subject and confirm that mortgage lenders' procedures are both prudent and reasonable'. Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the council, said that consumer interest was not damaged by lenders restricting their list of valuers, and that care was needed to avoid exploitation by fraudsters. 'Borrowers would be less well-served if lenders did not take stringent precautions to ensure that mortgage valuations are carried out by competent and reputable professionals,' Mr Boleat said. The council said that most lenders 'carefully vetted' valuers. As long as they meet criteria such as qualifications, the ability to introduce other business 'may then become an additional consideration'. The Incorporated Society of Valuers and Auctioneers said it had expressed concern for some time about the cost of survey and valuations. It said there were many reports of lenders rejecting valuations by independent valuers.</p>

			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NO HENDERSON INQUIRY NEEDED, WITT SAYS;  </P> <P> POLITICS: CITY COUNCILMAN HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN ONGOING FEUD WITH LEADER OF SAN  DIEGANS FOR MANAGED GROWTH.  </P> <P> San Diego City Atty. John Witt has declined to investigate allegations that  Councilman Bruce Henderson violated state law when he met privately with a  developer who wanted to build a 1,400-room hotel and resort in Henderson's  district.  </P> <P> The charges were levied last week by Bob Glaser, co-chairman of San Diegans for  Managed Growth, as part of an ongoing feud started Dec. 14, when Henderson  accused Glaser of secretly soliciting payments from the same developer.  </P> <P> In a one-paragraph letter Dec. 21 to Glaser, a copy of which was released  Tuesday by Henderson's office, Witt wrote that nothing in Glaser's complaint  "discloses any violation of law which would render action by my office  appropriate. Your concern has been duly noted, however."  </P> <P> Glaser asked for the investigation Dec. 19, the same day he held a news  conference to rebut Henderson's charges. Glaser asked Witt to see whether  Henderson's September discussion with Michael Gelfand, senior vice president of  the De Anza Group Inc., violated laws prohibiting a council member from  discussing with a developer any project that the the council member may later  have to review in a quasi-judicial capacity.  </P> <P> De Anza's proposal to build a resort on the shores of Mission Bay Park is the  central issue in the mudslinging between Henderson and Glaser, currently  co-chairman of San Diegans for Managed Growth.  </P> <P> At his news conference, Henderson released an August draft contract between  Gelfand and Glaser, claiming that Glaser had offered to help De Anza win city  approval of the controversial project in return for payments of more than  $250,000.  </P> <P> Henderson said the offer was hypocritical in light of lobbying by Glaser and  other environmentalists to remove Henderson as chairman of the council  committee overseeing Mission Bay and Balboa parks.  </P> <P> Henderson declared his opposition to the project in November, and said he would  have used his chairmanship of the council's Public Facilities and Recreation  Committee to fight it.  </P> <P> Glaser claimed that his offer was to help De Anza move the project out of  Mission Bay, allowing construction of the hotel and returning the company's 70  acres on De Anza Point to parkland, a position environmentalists favor.  </P> <P> Moreover, Glaser claimed that because Henderson had the draft contract since  September, he should have known that Gelfand rejected the offer because Glaser  was asking for too much money.  </P></p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Thunder of battle as Washington's giants lock horns WASHINGTON ushered in the spring equinox yesterday with predictable and choreographed rolls of political thunder - as President George Bush and the Democratic leadership in Congress squared off over how best to revitalise the US economy and thus win the hearts, minds and votes of the country. Mr Bush, speaking in the White House to invited supporters, declared he would veto the Dollars 77.5bn (Pounds 45.4bn) economic recovery tax bill finalised overnight by two Democratic grandees and passed only hours before by both houses of Congress. Its great fault, he said, was that it included some tax increases. He then announced he would ask Congress to stop funding 68 projects and programmes, worth Dollars 3.6bn, that he considered examples of 'pork barrel' profligacy. They include such vital items as research into asparagus yields and the prickly pear, as well as maintenance of gondolas in Idaho. Some, Mr Bush said, 'would be funny if they weren't serious.' Even the White House concedes there is some doubt over whether the president's authority, using a never-used provision in the 1974 Budget Act, extends to requiring Congress to vote on specific items of spending. He seems to be trying a variation of the 'line item veto' used in many states. But the political point was to throw down the gauntlet to Congress. Just in case the message had not been received by the Democrats, he proclaimed: 'The bottom line is that we all need a new Congress.' He again threw his support behind the populist right-wing movement to limit the number of terms a Congressman or Senator may serve. It was known in advance the president would veto the economic recovery tax bill and it passed both houses by margins much less than needed to override a veto. Still, Mr Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House ways and means committee and co-author of the bill along with Senator Lloyd Bentsen, said: 'We have met the president's challenge.' In his State of the Union message at the end of January, Mr Bush had called on Congress to act by March 20. The bill in fact incorporates many of his proposals, but in pursuing fiscal neutrality it finances tax credits for middle classes by an increase, from 31 to 36 per cent, in the top marginal rate of tax paid by individuals earning more than Dollars 115,000 (Pounds 67,400) a year. Last month, in a Damascene conversion, Mr Bush confessed he had been grievously wrong in dropping his 1988 election pledge never to raise taxes. Yesterday's veto lived up to that promise. It also brought on his head equally predictable Democratic denunciations. Mr Thomas Foley, speaker of the house, said the president's speech 'is the most partisan I have ever heard coming in the guise of a presidential address.' Mr George Mitchell, Senate majority leader, chipped in: 'He should act like a president, not like a panicky candidate for re-election.' Mr Bush's strategy is perfectly clear. He wishes to re-establish his credentials as a leader who will not raise taxes, even on the wealthy, and will cut spending; the Democrats in Congress, in contrast, become the 'tax and spend' party, a tag which has hurt Democratic presidential candidates in the last three elections. He also knows that Congress, engulfed in a series of scandals, is not the national flavour of the month. One poll yesterday found public confidence in Congress at an historic low of under 20 per cent, about half Mr Bush's rating. The Democrat-run Congress, therefore, is an inviting interim target for Mr Bush before he locks horns with his probable Democratic opponent, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, in the presidential election proper.</p>

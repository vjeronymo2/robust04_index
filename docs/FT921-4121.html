			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Appointments: Swapping foreign exchangers Lehman Brothers International must have pulled out all the remuneration stops in pursuit of its 'commitment to a global business strategy'. Its most recent catch for the London operation, after Dan Tyree who joins from Salomon, is 43-year-old Chris Deuters, head of European foreign exchange and derivatives at Citicorp. Appointed at managing director level, he comes in as head of global foreign exchange, a new position. Deuters leaves a bank which, despite its other problems, is one of the major forces in global foreign exchange, something which investment bank Lehman, hitherto, is clearly not. 'Money has a lot to do with the decision,' reckons Ernst Brutsche who is in charge of Citicorp's European corporate business and Deuters' boss. Deuters (which does not rhyme with Reuters) came to Citi as a teller in 1970 and, apart from a two year spell with Deutsche in London, has been there ever since. While acknowledging the predominance of commercial rather than investment banks in global fx, Lehman claims to be intent on achieving 'a leadership position within foreign exchange worldwide'. Citi is replacing him with Julian Simmonds, who was previously head of the UK fx business, the bank's largest and most profitable fx operation worldwide. While he will assume control of money markets as well as European fx, Brutsche will oversee the derivatives business 'for the time being'. Simmonds is 40 and joined Citi two years after Deuters with a degree in Russian and maths. ***** Max Kaye is promoted to financial director of RACAL ELECTRONICS on the retirement at the age of 56 of John Coates, who is to pursue other interests.

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Kashmir resolution dropped Pakistan told the UN Human Rights Commission yesterday it was dropping a hotly-contested draft resolution condemning India for rights abuses in the Kashmir region, Reuter reports from Geneva. It agreed to drop the resolution, which had led to a severe bilateral crisis with India, after a joint appeal by Iran and China, later supported by a string of other Islamic, Asian and developing nations. Pakistan's draft was the most contentious of all the resolutions at the annual six-week session. It was introduced by a fierce attack on India by Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on a visit to Geneva last month.</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> MURPHY &amp; PRYOR'S STAR TREK;  </P> <P> MOVIES: FOR ALL THE STAR QUALITY EDDIE MURPHY AND RICHARD PRYOR BRING TO THE  SCREEN, THEIR COMIC TALENTS SEEM TO HAVE TAKEN A WRONG TURN.  </P> <P> "Harlem Nights" is the first movie to co-star Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor.  Watching the sorry, unfunny mess that has resulted is like witnessing a highly  touted heavyweight title bout that inexplicably turns into a pat-a-cake session  between cruiserweights. Even those of us who have just about given up on Murphy  hoped the pairing with Pryor would snap him to attention. But it's been a long  stretch since either Murphy or Pryor has thrilled audiences with anything more  than their star power.  </P> <P> There was a time -- say, seven or eight years ago -- when such a confab would  have raised the rafters. Murphy began his four-year stint at "Saturday Night  Live" during the 1980-81 season, and his appearances on that show, with his  impersonations of pimps, jailbirds, Gumby, Buckwheat and Bill Cosby, are still  his comic high point. He could create characters that had the whole country  talking about them the next day. Pryor, of course, had a thriving if uneven  movie career in the early '80s. His glory, however, was his stand-up comedy  films, particularly the 1978 "Richard Pryor Live in Concert" and the 1982  "Richard Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip." They were the movies in which Richard  Pryor could be Richard Pryor.  </P> <P> In the intervening years, Murphy has become a major movie star largely at the  expense of what made him a TV star. He has moved away from the quicksilver,  revue-sketch humor and the edgy playfulness of his "SNL" days and turned  himself into a commodity. His comic facetiousness has turned stone-cold.  Whereas he once professed his idol to be Richard Pryor, his movies suggest  another deity: Sylvester Stallone.  </P> <P> Murphy is a movie star because his films make fortunes, but is there anything  stellar about his work as a '30s nightclub dandy in "Harlem Nights," a movie in  which his character's homicidal streak is played for cheap laughs? Is there  anything anointed about his work in such films as "The Golden Child," "Coming  to America" or "Beverly Hills Cop II"? His reprehensible 1987 stand-up comedy  film "Raw" begins when, leather-suited, he strides on stage amid hoopla not  inappropriate to the Second Coming. The film was a real potpourri of hatred. In  it, his free-floating hostilities descend on women, gays, whites, blacks --  take your pick. To review it was to leave the domain of criticism for  psychiatry.  </P> <P> Stardom can sometimes enlarge an actor's possibilities and bring out what was  nascent, and best, in his talents. The reverse seems to have happened to  Murphy. In "SNL," he was part of an ensemble; he was challenged by the other  performers. In his movies, starting with his first (and still best) film, "48  HRS," where he co-starred with Nick Nolte, Murphy has essentially been  performing solo. He works with such crackerjack precision that sometimes he  doesn't need anybody else around; he can be his own most appreciative audience.  </P> <P> But Murphy desperately needs to be challenged in the movies. Yet, given the  fact that he controls them so completely -- he is writer, director and  executive producer of "Harlem Nights" -- how will that ever happen? His clout  has allowed his worst instincts to come through.  </P> <P> Richard Pryor is playing his surrogate father in his new film, but there's an  element of condescension in the casting. Pryor is positioned as Murphy's wise  and cautious mentor, an elder statesman. It's the kind of "tribute" that's  indistinguishable from neutering.  </P> <P> If Eddie Murphy's star power has allowed him all too successfully to tincture  his films with the poison of his stand-up-comedy attitudes, then Richard Pryor  has the opposite problem. His box-office clout has allowed him the opportunity  to make a series of marginal movies with virtually no connection to his great  stand-up persona. In films ranging from "The Toy" to "Bustin' Loose" to  "Brewster's Millions," Pryor has opted for the cushiony comforts of family  entertainment. With his pick of writers, directors and co-stars, he has  nevertheless willingly led himself into creative oblivion.  </P> <P> It's never been easy for a volatile talent to score in the movies; the  commercial demands of the business are invariably at odds with true  subversiveness. But Pryor has the kind of control that might have preserved his  rawness on film, not only in his concert movies, but in his dramatic films too.  The cuddliness of his screen image is a sick joke. It might seem like a put-on  if only Pryor showed some sign that he was in on the con. But he is resignedly  bland in his movies; anything malign or threatening has been bleached out.  </P> <P> With an artist as troubled and complicated as Pryor, it's difficult to assign  motivation. Does a film like "Bustin' Loose," where he plays a good-natured  grump to a busload of kids, represent what Pryor thinks the movies deserve?  Does he think such movies represent what he deserves? Obscenity has always been  the fuel of Pryor's art, and these roles can't accommodate it.  </P> <P> He has never quite given up entirely, though. Bad as it was, his 1986  autobiographical film "Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling," which he also  directed, was at least an attempt to scour the treacle from his image. In films  like the 1972 "Lady Sings the Blues," playing Piano Man to Diana Ross' Billie  Holiday, the 1978 "Blue Collar," where he played a Detroit auto worker, and the  1981 "Some Kind of Hero," where he played a POW returning from Vietnam, he gave  indications of wanting to do more as an actor than just make nice. For years  there was talk that he was preparing a biography of Charlie Parker.  </P> <P> The problem may be that Pryor believes that, in order to quell his demons, he  can't draw on anything in his life that means anything to him. In "Live on the  Sunset Strip," talking about his recuperation after his free-basing accident,  he says, "Maybe I ain't funny anymore. Maybe I ain't hungry at nothing for real  in my heart." But the triumph of that film was that Pryor demonstrated he could  be an artist without working up a fount of rage. Pryor has been funnier than he  was in that film, but he was never as mysteriously moving, or as fragile.  </P> <P> Actually, Pryor has always been mischaracterized as a riotous comic. He was  never really a social-activist crusader; his stand-up riffs exposed racism, but  his humor was deeply personal, screwed up, aloof. The Get Whitey agenda of the  early '70s never quite played for Pryor as it did for the other black comics  and actors because Pryor was after private demons, not white demons.  </P> <P> Regarding whites, he went beyond rage and into stupefaction. (That's what made  the scene in "Silver Streak" where he attempts to teach Gene Wilder how to be  black such a howl.) His landscape was ultimately interior. He could split  himself into an entire gallery of characters: winos, junkies, hustlers, movie  executives, ex-wives. He could animate inanimate objects, like, most memorably,  his cocaine pipe in "Live on the Sunset Strip." The only thing Pryor can't play  is normal, and that, ironically, is what he's set out to be in movie after  movie.  </P> <P> The history of black performers in the movie business is such a trail of waste  and despair that the ascension of Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor has symbolic  value out of all proportion to their actual achievement. With few exceptions,  black actors have only been accepted as stars when they are comics.  </P> <P> This must explain some of Eddie Murphy's rage. Deprived in his early movies of  any love interest with his white female co-stars, straitened into situations  where he played the black sidekick joker to white actors, he has  overcompensated by shunting his creative energies into a makeover that probably  means a lot more to him than it does to audiences. His attempts to promote  himself as a stud action-hero with a curdling cruel humor must function as a  kind of retribution for him. For some of us, it's a punishment.  </P></p>

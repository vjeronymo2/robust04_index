			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Fokker drops deeper in the red as market demand falls Fokker, the Dutch aircraft maker, has ploughed heavily into the red for 1993 after slack market conditions forced it to cut prices to attract customers. The company, which came under control of Daimler-Benz of Germany last year, said net losses totalled Fl 460m (Pounds 164m). This is more than three times higher than its previous predictions of a Fl 150m loss. Fokker posted a net profit of Fl 19.8m for 1992. The shares closed down nearly 12.5 per cent at Fl 18.30 from Fl 20.90 on Tuesday. Fokker blamed the unexpectedly large losses on a provision of Fl 275m to cover the cost of cutting prices to customers. Group turnover fell nearly 10 per cent to Fl 3.7bn from Fl 4.1bn. The price discounting has allowed the company to reduce its unsold stock to just six aircraft in March 1994 from 32 at the start of 1993. Like other aircraft manufacturers, Fokker has been hit by the financial difficulties of the world's airlines. The 1993 figures also include a separate charge of Fl 90m to finance redundancies in the first half. Last month, Fokker said 1,900 further jobs would have to be eliminated this year, representing the third large restructuring in three years, as part of wider efforts to reduce output to meet lower market demand. 'The company cannot afford to continue building more aircraft than the market demands,' it said. Interest charges rose to Fl 181m from Fl 126m, reflecting Fokker's increased involvement in sales financing, mainly leasing, as a way of finding customers. The company also announced that Mr Ben van Schaik is to become its management board chairman on April 1, succeeding Mr Erik Jan Nederkoorn who resigned last month after a boardroom row. Mr van Schaik, a Dutchman, is the head of European sales at Mercedes-Benz Commercial Vehicles in Stuttgart, Germany. The appointment ends speculation that Fokker's majority shareholder would put a German or a non-Dutch national at the head of the company.</p>

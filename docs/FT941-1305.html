			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Dowding doubles to Pounds 3.34m Dowding &amp; Mills, the electrical and mechanical repair company, nearly doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.77m to Pounds 3.34m in the six months to December 31. Mr Peter Hollings, chairman, said the improved first-half results were mainly because of increased productivity and cost control rather than an overall increase in activity. Sales rose from Pounds 41.2m to Pounds 45m. Earnings per share increased to 1.37p (0.61p). The interim dividend increased to 0.94p (0.92p). The group said that trading at the start of the second half had continued at a similar level to the first, and if this trend continued then profits for the full year would be ahead of last year's Pounds 5.04m. Mr Hollings said: 'The decline in activity in the UK over each of the last three years has finally ceased and production has levelled out, whilst elsewhere in Europe business remains difficult with no signs of immediate improvement.' He added that the level of activity in American operations continued to be satisfactory. Following a reduction last year, expenditure on plant and equipment had increased to Pounds 1.24m (Pounds 655,000), while gearing was maintained at 19.2 per cent.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Renault/Volvo After the acrimonious end to their merger plans, it was probably too much to expect Renault and Volvo to maintain the connections established during their courtship. The more ambitious collaboration schemes have already been abandoned. Renault's partial sale of its stake in Volvo begins the severance of financial ties as well. It is not yet clear how far this process will go. Disposal of its stakes in Volvo Car and Volvo Truck will be complicated. So will Volvo's disposal of its 20 per cent stake in Renault. Once the disentanglement has started, however, it makes sense, particularly for Volvo, to see it through. Volvo's shares have risen sharply on relief that its recovery prospects will not be diluted by union with a Renault bogged down by the continental European automotive cycle. Volvo's main markets in Sweden, the UK and US are growing. With the benefit of the krona devaluation and its own cost-cutting, it can look forward to profits that do not make yesterday's close of SKr692 look expensive. The shares have also been driven by the view that a policy of focusing on its basic automotive business will enable Volvo to dispose of activities into which it has diversified. For now, that may obviate the need for a rights issue. Volvo, though, does not have the resources to soldier on alone indefinitely. If Renault is not to be its automotive partner, it needs a clean slate to find another one. Opponents of the merger used to cite BMW as an example of a thriving independent car company with a limited model range. In buying Rover, even BMW seems to be admitting that scale is important.</p>

			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / How To Spend It: A new look for the piste de resistance - Snow is falling, the skiing season is upon us. Picking the best gear for the slopes FOR THE dedicated ski fan this winter has brought the best news for years. In New Zealand they have just had more snow than many skiers ever remember, while from Aspen to Alpbach and Avoriaz the snow is falling, falling, falling. By now you are unlikely to need any prompting - you are probably one of the thousands who have rushed to give the ski-tour companies THEIR best season for years. You may, however, be a mite concerned about what you should wear. Has a new fad or fashion sprung up that you have yet to discover? Never fear. Fads and fashions come and go and most of us can take them or leave them without any disastrous consequences. What really makes the difference, particularly when it comes to skiwear, is technology - it has this habit of marching on and leaving some of us marooned in what was once the dernier cri and now turns out to be very vieux chapeau. The real problem with skiwear is that it has to cope with a vast range of weather conditions. Nevica, a highly-regarded skiwear manufacturer, sums it up perfectly in its latest brochure: 'It could be -20`, a whiteout and snowing hard. It could be still as night and shrouded in mist. It could be baking hot and thawing all around. Or it could just be that perfect day with untracked, fresh powder and glorious sunshine.' It could . . . it could. It could also be all four in the course of 24 hours. So what do you wear? The real answer is the best that you can afford. The experts seem to agree that there is nothing to beat Goretex for keeping the wet out and the warmth in. The problem is that it is expensive, so several companies have produced less expensive fabrics which have some of the same qualities - Tenson, for example, uses a textile called Airpush which has microscopic hairs on the surface of the fabric to trap air and keep water droplets out. The Japanese company Descente uses Entrant, and so on. For wearing under shellsuits or waterproofs Fleece has to be the textile of the cold climate set - made from 100 per cent polyester, it is used by many manufacturers, including the ultra eco-chic Patagonia, and combines great lightness with softness and warmth. If you do not need a whole garment try a fleecy neckwarmer for Pounds 10.99 - it keeps the draughts out, adds warmth and on cold lifts you pull it up around your ears. You may or may not be relieved to know that the fashionable florescent look of a couple of years back has died a terrible death. Colours are more muted, much more chic. In Euro ski circles skiwear has come full-circle - the sleek ski-pants or leggings topped by an anorak or parka which have been seen on the smartest urban streets are now to be seen again on skiers' backs, where they came from in the first place. In the US the skisuit still reigns supreme. If, back home, you wear Doctor Martens, black Levis and leather jackets then the right-on piste-cred name to look out for is Mambo - needless to say it is heavily into black. Bad Boys and Oxbow are two other names to look out for - both go in for clothes that could transfer happily from piste to street. There are some fun new gadgets to look out for, all stocked by Snow + Rock and other good ski shops. If you have always wondered if you were going as fast as you thought you were the ski-pole watch (Pounds 9.99) will tell you. Cat tracks prevent you slipping on ice - you put them on over the sole of your ski-boots. Pounds 10.95. For the cold-feet sufferer there is the Hotronic (Pounds 79.95) boot-heater. insole is slipped into the boot and is connected to a battery-pack clipped on to the back of the boot. It can be taken in and out easily and put into, say, climbing or walking boots. Salomon has ski boots with a polar fleece lining - Force 7 costs Pounds 199.50 and Force 9, Pounds 234.50. Finally, in skiing circles it is never long before talk comes round to Knees and their problems. Help is at hand. Snow + Rock has joined forces with a team of sports physiotherapists who will fit customers with a rigid frame brace called an MVP. Dion Taylor, a ski buff who works with Snow + Rock, has a torn cruciate ligament, one of the most common skiing injuries, and he tells me that ever since he took to wearing an MVP brace he skis with scarcely any problems at all. The Pounds 299 fee includes the consultation and the brace. For Pounds 520 there is what could be called a Rolls-Royce service which offers a similar but slimmer and stronger brace. Those who keep office hours might appreciate that Snow + Rock at 188 Kensington High Street, London W8, is open on Sundays (until Easter) from 11 am to 5 pm. The branch at 150 Holborn, London EC1 is open until 6 pm six days a week and the Birmingham branch (14 Priory Queensway) opens until 5.30 five days a week, except Thursdays, when closes at 6.30 pm. It also has an excellent mail order service - ring 0753-830868 for a free full-colour catalogue. From Luhta, a Finnish company which specialises in fashionable, extremely reasonably priced skiwear made from a combination of cotton and polyamid (you should take great care over how you clean it - ideally wash it by hand), come the two current looks - the tapered ski pants (Pounds 61.50) and large jacket (Pounds 173.95) and the one-piece suit (Pounds 246.95). There are lots of colours - black, red, pink, turquoise and lilac. Available from all branches of Olympus Sports, Blacks, Ellis Brigham, Snow + Rock and Harrods' skiwear department. One of this year's major skiwear themes from Chervo - a blouson jacket with a white body and 'silky' inserts. It has lots of pockets and a detachable imitation fur hood. In 54 per cent polyamide and 46 per cent polyester, Pounds 379 from Snow + Rock branches. When it comes to that essential accessory - sunglasses - the wrap is the shape to go for: they are fashionable this year and give much better protection from dangerous rays than ordinary sunglasses. This pair by Block sports Gamma reflective lenses which may look a bit sinister but give good visibility and high protection. Pounds 27.99. from good ski shops including Snow + Rock.</p>

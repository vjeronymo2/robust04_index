			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Dan Margalit: "Unconvincing Ability"] </F>   [Text] The media thoroughly analyzed Yasir 'Arafat's body  language when he refused to sign the maps appended to the Gaza-  Jericho agreement. The whole world saw it. Nevertheless,  diplomats were more interested in Warren Christopher's bland  reaction. Nobody was surprised. In certain respects, the  status of the U.S. representative at the Cairo ceremony was  similar to that of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev.  Both their contributions to the agreement signed by Israel and  the PLO were paltry.    Nobody in official Jerusalem is saying a word on the issue.  On the contrary, Yitzhaq Rabin and Shim'on Peres lavished  praise on Christopher's objectivity. The man with the Indian  features is considered one of the fairest statesmen Israel has  had contact with since the Six-Day War. Beyond his personal  attributes, however, how beneficial can he be in the Middle East  arena?    There has been no dearth of U.S. blunders in the 27 years  since Israel took over the territories in a defensive war and  declared its willingness to return to the international border  in the Sinai and the Golan taking its security needs into  account. Nevertheless, William Quandt's 460-page book "The  Peace Process" shows that the Israeli-Arab conflict constantly  featured in U.S. foreign policy.    To wit, Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger saw to linking the  Israeli-Arab conflict to the world's oil reserves, the Vietnam  war, the detente with the USSR and the openness toward China,  and what not. Jimmy Carter was almost obsessive in his efforts  to bring about peace between Israel and Egypt in Camp David,  although he was not the one who initiated the move. How many  lines will be devoted to Christopher's actions on behalf of Bill  Clinton?    There were years when Israel wished U.S. diplomacy would  butt  out, but that old pattern has long vanished. Assuming that  1994's Israel is interested in an active and spirited political  process, the U.S. level of performance is disappointing to  Jerusalem. After all, behind the smoke screen of flattery,  Israeli experts gained the impression that Christopher did not  fully grasp Hafiz al-Asad's sly intentions; that the Syrian  president took the U.S. secretary for a ride; that he is  actually unfit to steer the process upon his return to the  region next week for a shuttle trip between Jerusalem and  Damascus. What he brought back from his previous meeting with  al-Asad aroused serious suspicions that he is unable to fully  grasp the Syrians' true intentions, which the world must glean  from hints and by reading between the lines.    Israel's unofficial disappointment with the U.S. ability to  perform the Herculean task the Israeli-Syrian contacts will  entail is not detached from the overall Clinton Administration's  foreign policy. After the retreat in Somalia, the disgrace in  Haiti, the capitulation in North Korea, and the fears in Bosnia,  U.S. allies around the world are having a hard time trusting its  diplomatic mettle. Al-Asad, who is not thrilled about peace  with Israel anyway and merely wants to have Syria struck from  the list of terror-supporting states, does not really care that  such doubts come up.    Now, on the eve of the negotiations with Syria, Israel is  clearly interested to monitor the actions of the U.S. diplomats  who will be sent to the Middle East to carry out what they did  with partial success in other areas around the globe. From  Margaret Thatcher, America's loyal ally, going through the  liberal commentator Anthony Lewis and the conservative Charles  Krauthammer, the disappointment is sweeping and absolute.  Thatcher has already warned Clinton about the conclusions his  allies will draw from his failure in Bosnia. Such an event does  not go without leaving an imprint. Also, using the United  Nations as an alibi for the failures is pathetic. Krauthammer  wrote in TIME magazine that when it comes to foreign policy  Clinton must think as a President and not make decisions based  on an analysis of UN Security Council resolutions.    Israel has some experience of its own. Eytan Bentzur, the  Foreign Ministry's assistant director general, sought to forge a  link with North Korea which had been developing long-range  missiles and avoiding international supervision of its nuclear  facilities. The State Department dissuaded Israel from speaking  on its own to North Korea, which had been developing a dangerous  arms trade with Iran. The United States promised Israel to take  action on the issue. How much weight does such a commitment  carry in view of the recurring signs that Washington is not  entirely averse to including Pyongyang in the nuclear club?    In the context of the Middle East, Washington promised not  to  have a repeat performance of the Madrid conference under joint  U.S.- Russian auspices. Although it trusts Clinton's goodwill,  Jerusalem cannot trust his ability to stick to his guns. This  is only the beginning. Furthermore, although America's status  in the international arena is an indisputable fact -- even at a  time when the man sitting in the White House is a President who  is mostly engrossed in domestic policies -- Christopher and his  entourage must still earn a solid position vis-a-vis al-Asad to  enable Rabin to deal with Syria through them. Can they do that?  On the eve of the resumption of the talks on the  Jerusalem-Damascus track, one cannot avoid hearing the whisper  of doubts.</p>

Balaji; place and date not  given--quotation marks as published--first three paragraphs  DECCAN CHRONICLE introduction]    [Text] Hyderabad, Jan 13--He does not betray the image of  being the `super cop' of the country. Obviously delighted with  the resounding success he and his men had against the terrorists  in Punjab, Mr. K.P. Singh Gill, the Director-General of the  Punjab police, feels that, if Punjab can be freed from the  stranglehold of terrorists, there is no reason why the volatile  Jammu and Kashmir cannot [be] freed from the trigger-happy  ultras.    And given Mr. Gill's determination and the way in which he  paid the Punjab terrorists in their own coin, Kashmir can  certainly become once again a peaceful and prosperous State that  it was a decade back. Will he go to Kashmir to counter the  terrorists? "Yes, if the government wants me," says Mr. Gill  like a true soldier.    Mr. Gill, who is now on a visit to the city, spoke to DECCAN  CHRONICLE at length on the way he dealt with the militants in  his State.    Excerpts from the interview.    What priorities did you have in mind when you worked  out a strategy for Punjab?    The top priority was to beat the terrorists at their own  game. Develop the expertise to meet them face to face, match  their firepower, strategy and ultimately it was a man to man  fight. When we changed our strategy and also improved our  weaponry and intelligence network, we were always ahead of them  and able to put them down.    Did your strategy go as per the plan?    We kept two things in mind. First we knew we had to react to  their moves and counter it. Then we wanted to try and find out  about their recruits and prevent the same. We also countered  their propaganda and tried to cut their roots, destroy their  bases and indulge in day and night combing operations.    Was there any change in the strategy adopted by your  predecessor, Mr. J.F.Riberio, and you?    My strategy was part of an extension of the strategy adopted  by Mr. Riberio. We extended upon the 25 percent success achieved  by him.    What is the estimated member of terrorists remaining in  the State?    There are no active terrorists now. Once in a while they  come  from other places and indulge in some acts and escape. But now  we are very alert and preventing them from coming in.    Do you think the police alone was responsible for the  success or is it because of better coordination with other  agencies?    Oh yes! We had very good cooperation from the Army, BSF  [Border Security Force], CRPF [Central Reserve Police Force] and  others which contributed to the success.    What is the role of Pakistan in promoting subversive  activities in Punjab?    Pakistan is very much involved in encouraging terrorist  activities in the State. The recent arrest of Dr Sohan Singh  revealed that at least eight important leaders of different  groups are operating from Pakistan.    Is there a difference of opinion between you and the  Chief Minister, Mr. Beant Singh?    No there is no differences between me and the Chief  Minister.    Since the focus on terrorist violence has shifted from  Punjab to Kashmir and in view of your own success in Punjab,  would you prefer to take an assignment in Kashmir?    Yes ... for some time there was such a talk. If the  government wants my services for Kashmir, I am ready for it. And  I will go there if they want me.    Are you confident of achieving success in Kashmir  too?    Well, one does not go to a place to fail in the mission. One  goes to the place wanting to achieve success.    What strategy do you envisage for tackling the  militants in Kashmir?    Sitting at a distant place (Punjab) one cannot work out any  strategy. You have to be there to take a decision.    After your term, would you be interested in joining  politics?    I have no intention of joining politics.  *</p>

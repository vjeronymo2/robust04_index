			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / International Company News: Litton Industries spins off arm LITTON Industries yesterday joined the trend for US companies to spin-off large subsidiaries as separately quoted businesses when it announced plans to establish a commercial company independent from its defence and aerospace operations. The move was warmly welcomed on Wall Street, where Litton's stock rose more than 14 per cent on the New York Stock Exchange, to close at Dollars 65 1/8 , up Dollars 8 1/8 . Litton said the new company would include its oilfield information services and industrial automation businesses and would have annual revenues of around Dollars 2bn. Shares in the new company would be distributed to holders of Litton's common stock and the deal should be completed before the end of 1993. Analysts said the commercial company, whose subsidiaries have strong positions in their respective markets, would enjoy a stock market rating much superior to that of the group as a whole. The move is somewhat unusual for a defence company, since most businesses in this sector, faced with declining Pentagon spending, have been seeking to diversify into commercial operations to bolster profits. Another exception to this trend is General Dynamics, which has aggressively sold off commercial businesses to concentrate on its core defence operations. Mr Alton Brann, Litton chief executive, said growing commercial markets and the consolidating defence industry demand different corporate strategies. By responding to each separately, 'both our businesses will benefit, as should our shareholders'. Some 60 per cent of the new company's revenues will come from oil services, where its Western Atlas business is a top supplier of seismic, well logging and reservoir information.</p>

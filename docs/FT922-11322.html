			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Higher bond yields send Dow lower Wall Street ALTHOUGH DRUG stocks recovered well from losses sustained earlier in the week, a round of computerised program selling late yesterday left share prices rooted firmly in negative territory, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 24.15 at 3,324.46. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended lower, down 2.59 at 409.01, while the Nasdaq composite index slipped 3.16 to 572.89. Turnover on the NYSE was 200m shares, and declines outpaced rises by 891 to 788. In early trading, another rise in long-term bond yields unsettled equity investors. Higher Treasury yields are seen as a threat to economic recovery because they put upward pressure on mortgage rates, and also make stocks less attractive to yield-hungry investors. Although they fell back later, stubbornly high bond yields remain bad news for stocks. The feeling that the market is overvalued, at least until corporate earnings catch up with gains in equity prices, was another negative factor. The generally positive first quarter results have been discounted by the market, and more good economic news is now needed before investors make fresh purchases, analysts said. Drug stocks, which had been sold heavily on Thursday on concern that they would underperform the market, bounced back. Merck rose more than Dollars 1 in the morning, but ended up only  3/8 at Dollars 140 1/8 . Schering-Plough rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 52 5/8 , Pfizer put on Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 68 3/4 and Eli Lilly rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 68 3/8 . General Motors dropped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 39 5/8 in turnover of 2.5m shares as the market awaited news of the latest developments in the planned re-organisation of the car maker's unprofitable North American business. GM also notified the Securities and Exchange Commission that it will raise more than Dollars 2bn from a public offering of 50m shares. GM's weakness spread to other car stocks, with Ford down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 43 1/4 and Chrysler off Dollars 1 at Dollars 18 1/2 . After early gains, bank stocks ran into heavy profit-taking. Chemical fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 35 3/4 in brisk trading despite reports from the company's management that cost savings from its recent merger with Manufacturers Hanover would exceed targets, that loan loss provisions would decline for the rest of the year and that revenues exceeded internal estimates. Also lower were JP Morgan, down Dollars 1 at Dollars 54 3/8 , Bankers Trust, Dollars  3/4 easier at Dollars 57 3/4 , and Citicorp, down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 18 3/4 . Chiquita Brands plunged Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 20 3/8 after the company reported on Thursday that first quarter profit was well down on a year ago, and said it did not expect to meet 1992 earnings forecasts. Canada TORONTO STOCK prices closed lower in light trading, as the composite index was pushed downward by a sell-off in the last hour of a generally bearish trading week. According to preliminary figures, the index fell 21.78 points, or 0.65 per cent, to close at 3,349.69, after edging up 3.72 points yesterday. The index was down only about seven points entering the last hour of trading, before dropping sharply to the close.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Metalrax bucks sector trend with modest rise METALRAX, the Birming-ham-based specialist engineering group, yesterday reported record profits and a sizeable increase in the dividend in sharp contrast to evidence of recession in much of the sector. Pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 advanced from Pounds 7.13m to Pounds 7.21m on sales marginally lower at Pounds 62.9m (Pounds 63.9m). The company said the record profits had been achieved through productivity gains from capital investment and positive cash flows, as well as its broad spectrum of engineering activities which range from branded storage systems and housewares to general engineering components. Earnings per share rose from 7.25p to 7.62p and the directors have recommended raising the final dividend to 2.9p (2.58p), giving 3.9p for the year, a rise of almost 12 per cent. The company is also to make a 1-for-10 scrip issue. To this end, the directors are recommending that Pounds 325,523 of reserves be capitalised. Metalrax said that its 'momentum' had continued during the first two months of 1992.</p>

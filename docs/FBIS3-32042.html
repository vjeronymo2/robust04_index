			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mayra Chirino Ochoa] </F>   [Text] The Central Bank Board of Directors met on Sunday  and approved a general assistance program for the national  banking system. Finance Minister Carlos Rafael Silva -- who  held talks with Central Bank President Ruth de Krivoy yesterday  -- made this announcement.    Although he did not explain the type of measures involved in  the implementation of this program, he said that they are joint  efforts by the Central Bank, the Deposit Guarantee Fund  (FOGADE), and commercial banks.    [Reporter] Does it mean that liquidity will be injected into  the financial system?    [Silva] Obviously, because I do not think that withdrawals  are being made at this time.    The minister said he did not know the quantity of resources  to be made available for this plan. He also denied knowledge of  the possibility that the government, through FOGADE, will  capitalize Banco Latino stocks, which is one of the options  under study.    Asked about the exact date when Banco Latino will reopen its  doors and start returning their money to depositors, he noted  that matters concerning Banco Latino were already entrusted to a  board of auditors [Junta Interventora] on Friday. This board is  made up of Julio Santodomingo, Hernan Oyarzabal, and Tesalio  Cardenas.    The board of auditors is the top authority in handling that  institution, Silva said. He added: I understand that they are  assessing the patrimonial status of the bank in order to make a  decision.    The finance minister was also asked about the decree that  suspended the Value-Added Tax (VAT) and he replied: "Let's not  talk about that."    However, it was learned that the decree in question has not  been published in the official gazette because of the legal  difficulties that would result from suspending a law by decree,  a decree that was not approved by the Attorney General's Office  and the finance minister who will not sign the decree.</p>

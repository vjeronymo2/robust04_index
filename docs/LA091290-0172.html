Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> MACLAINE TO TWINKLE TOES LESS  </P> <P> Shirley MacLaine's song and dance act will be a little less dance and a bit  more song.  </P> <P> She blames age.  </P> <P> "It's real life that's a problem. I can't run for a cab in the rain in the  streets of New York anymore," the 56-year-old MacLaine said.  </P> <P> After 40 movies, five TV specials, six books and a half a century of dancing,  MacLaine said on the new syndicated TV show "Personalities" that it was time to  "scale down the dancing."  </P> <P> "It isn't that direly necessary to me. At this stage, I think it's bombastic  because of my age you can still do this stuff," she said in the interview  broadcast Monday.  </P></p>

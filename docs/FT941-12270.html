			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: New York The US bond market, having rallied strongly late last week on hopes of subdued inflation, will have plenty of fresh information to absorb over the next five days, which will bring significant new data on the strength of the economy, and perhaps some clues to Federal Reserve thinking. The benchmark 30-year Government bond ended last week yielding 6.21 per cent, against 6.28 per cent a week earlier,as fourth-quarter GDP figures convinced Wall Street inflation was not an immediate problem and the Fed was unlikely to tighten policy in the near future. Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is scheduled to go before Congress's joint economic committee today to discuss the economic outlook, and the market will be scouring his testimony for clues on interest rates. Fed policy will be set on Thursday and Friday at its Open Market Committee meeting. It is expected to discuss tightening monetary policy for the first time in five years, although many analysts think a move may not happen until the early spring. The Fed will be able to chew over the first major economic indicator for January - employment figures due out on Friday morning. The Treasury will also announce its February refunding plans during the week, including an auction of 30-year bonds.</p>

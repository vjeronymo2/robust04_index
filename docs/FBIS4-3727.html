			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xiao Qiu: "Light Industry To Open Door to Foreign </F> Managers"]    [Text] The government this year will start allowing  foreign managers to run Chinese light industrial enterprises  independently so as to attract more overseas capital, technology  and products, a senior official revealed.    The pursuit of foreign managers is intended to enhance light  industry's production and exports, said the official, who works  in the China National Council of Light Industry but wished not  to be identified.    This year, light industry is expected to export $34.5  billion  worth of products.    The official said big export-oriented enterprises will be  the  first to be designated for foreigners to manage under contract.    The move is expected to bring in advanced technology from  overseas that will help modernize these enterprises and expand  their exports,the official explained.    Besides the contract management system, he said, overseas  companies can also pour in money to convert State enterprises  into joint ventures.    The China National Council of Light Industry is also  planning  management and technical training programmes in Sweden, Finland  and other countries, the official said.    Besides managers, China will bring in technicians from these  countries to help renovate enterprises' technology.    China is also ready to extend its policies on investment and  co-operation to overseas enterprises, the official said.    The official said overseas investment is expected in  capital-  and technology-intensive industries but those that pollute  heavily should be prohibited.    This year, the light industry council will seek more  overseas  capital, technology and skills for China's inland areas, the  official said.    Last year inland areas used 180 percent more overseas  investment than the previous year, while the growth rate in the  thriving coastal regions was 52 percent.    The official said that besides direct overseas management,  joint ventures in light industry are still a major force in  exports, accounting for about 20 percent of the industry's total.    The council is co-operating more closely with big overseas  companies, the official said. Early this year, for example, it  signed a $350 million investment agreement with PepsiCo Inc, the  American food and beverage giant. This followed the signing  last year of a $150 million agreement with Coca-Cola Co.    Loans from international organizations and foreign  governments will also be important in promoting light industry's  co-operation, the official said.</p>

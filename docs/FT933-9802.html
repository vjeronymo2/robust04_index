			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Newmarket net asset value at 61p NET ASSET value per share of Newmarket Venture Capital slipped 1p to 61p over the six months ended June 30. The figure was the result of 'several counter balancing factors.' At June 30 1992 the value stood at 56p. For the half year to end-June net losses were cut to Pounds 70,000 compared with a previous deficit of Pounds 1.04m and losses per share were 0.2p against 2.9p. As already announced, the company is to be voluntarily wound up and the assets distributed to shareholders following the 1994 annual meeting. Net assets at June 30 stood at Pounds 21.71m. That compared with Pounds 19.98m a year earlier and with Pounds 22.24m at end-December 1992.</p>

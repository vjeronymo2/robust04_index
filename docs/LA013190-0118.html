			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: DAVIS SHOULD GET HIS DUE: HALL OF FAME  </P> <P> Al Davis did not announce where -- if anywhere -- his football team would be  moving before last Saturday's vote for the NFL's Hall of Fame. Maybe he  deliberately waited. Or maybe he couldn't have cared less.  </P> <P> I do not know how much making the Hall of Fame means to Davis, or why he hasn't  already made it, or how much his herding of the Raiders from Northern to  Southern California has do to with it.  </P> <P> Furthermore, I haven't lost one minute of sleep feeling sorry for him.  </P> <P> For the record, though, let me make a couple of things perfectly clear:  </P> <P>  -- One, no matter what you think of the man, Al Davis definitely belongs in  the Hall of Fame. His not being inducted is a travesty. He has played an  important part in the rise of pro football to the status of National Pastime  1-A.  </P> <P>  -- Two, no matter when or where Davis moves the Raiders, it is his business.  Why? Because it is his business. He runs it. You wouldn't want somebody telling  you where you had to run your business. It's Al's team; not yours, not mine,  not Oakland's, not L.A.'s. His.  </P> <P> So, when we get the news -- no matter what it is -- I side with Davis. If he  wants to take his team back to the Bay Area, fine. Oakland never deserved being  deserted. If Davis wants to take it to Sacramento, double fine. The state  capital should have a team. It's a big-league sports town.  </P> <P> Where would I prefer the Raiders to play?  </P> <P> Right where they are.  </P> <P> After watching Oakland's fans whoop and holler for the Raiders in an exhibition  game there, I made a remark to the extent of: "If they want the Raiders that  badly, let them have them." Some of the Raider management people took that  personally. They take a lot of things personally. They see enemies under their  beds.  </P> <P> Truth is, the thought of Los Angeles proper not having its own NFL team is not  a pleasant one. If the Coliseum can be streamlined and converted into an  intimate setting, then I say: On with the show. I'll start singing, "Stay" in  Frankie Valli's falsetto, if that's what it takes. Won't you stay, Al?  Pleeeeeeeez stay.  </P> <P> If he does go, though, more power to him. Los Angeles would get in line with  St. Louis, Baltimore and other cities seduced and abandoned. Yet, I don't know  a soul in L.A. who feels sorry for Minneapolis for losing the Lakers, or for  Brooklyn over the Dodger kidnapping, or Cleveland over the hijacking of the  Rams.  </P> <P> So, if the Raiders go, shut up already.  </P> <P> Just don't sit around the way they do in St. Louis and Baltimore and play  make-believe that the next NFL expansion team is definitely coming your way.  Don't kid yourselves. It took Minnesota something like a quarter-century to get  pro basketball back. Some franchises never get recycled.  </P> <P> If the Raiders announce that they are leaving, and spend another season here as  lame ducks, then I suggest not squandering good money on tickets. Otherwise, be  a good loser and wish the next town luck.  </P> <P> I talked to a voter after the Hall of Fame ballots were cast, a guy who said he  voted for Davis and always does. He told me the anti-Al coalition harps on his  "negative contributions" to the game, insisting that these more than balance  out his virtues. Hauling the NFL into court, costing it in the neighborhood of  $150 million, pioneering a stampede of carpetbaggers -- such behavior continues  to be used in argument against Davis' election.  </P> <P> Well, you don't have to like Al Davis to think him worthy of the Hall of Fame.  You can't fault a football man just because he played some hardball. Davis  belongs.  </P> <P> As owners go, George Halas, Paul Brown, Art Rooney and others were more worthy.  I knew George Halas personally, and let me tell you, this guy is no George  Halas.  </P> <P> Yet, he is no Gaylord Perry either. Al Davis played to win but he didn't cheat  to win.  </P> <P> He may not have been in a league with Halas, but he has been a pretty big  contributor to Halas' league.  </P> <P> Davis acts as presenter for many of his former Raider players on Hall of Fame  induction day. Seven, so far. He may be there again soon, when Ted Hendricks  takes the podium.  </P> <P> Someday, somebody will present him. A man with 30 years in pro ball. Former  commissioner of the American Football League. Youngest man, at 33, to hold the  dual positions of coach and general manager. Boss of three Super Bowl  champions. Employer of the NFL's first black coach in the modern era.  </P> <P> I don't mind if Al Davis goes to Oakland or Sacramento. I do mind that he  hasn't yet gone -- except on someone else's behalf -- to Canton, Ohio.  </P></p>

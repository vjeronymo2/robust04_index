			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tengiz Pachkoriya] </F>   [Text] Tbilisi January 24 TASS -- A Georgian top official  has denounced Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba for his  statement barring Georgian refugees who fought on the side of  Georgian troops from returning to Abkhazia.    Ardzinba told Abkhazian television that only those Georgian  refugees who have not "stained themselves with blood" may return  to Abkhazia.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Akaky Gasviani, a  vice- prime minister of the Georgian government-in-exile of  Abkhazia, described Ardzinba's statement as "an attempt to  revise and reconsider the Geneva agreements envisaging the  return to Abkhazia of refugees of all nationalities irrespective  of their participation in combat activities."    He said the Abkhazian leadership "is obviously not happy  about the return of several dozen thousand refugees to the Gali  and other districts of Abkhazia and it is trying, under various  pretexts, to obstruct the process of their return."    Gasviani stressed that Ardzinba's statement "is a new  attempt  to shift the responsibility for the activities of Abkhazian and  North Caucasian militants who robbed and killed civilians in  Abkhazia -- Georgians, Russians, Greeks and people of other  nationalities -- in September-December 1993 to the Georgian  population and Georgian authorities."</p>

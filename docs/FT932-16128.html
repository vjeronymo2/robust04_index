			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Laird improves to Pounds 36.2m - High exposure to German car producers but devaluation helps LAIRD GROUP, maker of car components and industrial products, yesterday reported sharply higher profits for 1992 as investments in plant that supplies new models came on stream. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 21.3m to Pounds 36.2m, on sales up 15 per cent at Pounds 600.7m. The results have been prepared on the basis of FRS 3 accounting principles. Profits from continuing operations rose from Pounds 28.2m to Pounds 39.5m. Earnings on this basis rose 21 per cent to 20.8p. Earnings per share under FRS 3 rose from 12.3p to 18.7p; the company has already declared a second interim of 6.3p, giving a total for the year of 10.5p, up 3 per cent. Mr John Gardiner, chairman, said demand from the auto industry would be lower in continental Europe this year, where Laird has a particularly high exposure to German car producers, but sterling's devaluation would help offset this effect. The fall in volume should to some extent be offset by the increased value added of products being fitted to new models. The big increase came in the sealing systems division where operating profits rose from Pounds 13.8m to Pounds 23m on sales up 26 per cent at Pounds 223.9m. Industrial products, which are also mainly directed towards the auto industry, rose sharply to Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 12.7m) on sales up 17 per cent at Pounds 178m. Profits in the service industries division, however, fell from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 7.8m on sales up slightly at Pounds 179.8m. The US printing operations suffered a setback and the group had to reorganiseits plastics distributiondivision. Following last year's rights issue, interest charges fell from Pounds 8.4m to Pounds 6.8m and gearing was about 10 per cent. COMMENT On the face of it, Laird's markets look less than healthy. German car production could well be down 20 per cent this year. Even if the group is appearing on the 'right' models, like the new Astra, VW and Peugeot, the group cannot avoid the effect of a slow down in car production elsewhere in Europe. What is more, Laird's US sales indicate that the market is not recovering as robustly as some have suggested. As a result, profits are likely to be flat at Pounds 36m this year, giving earnings of 18.3p, stripping out the Pounds 5m settlement proceeds from a 10-year old litigation. This puts the shares on a market rating of about 15 times. Laird is, however, one of the few motor component companies not to have recovery already factored into its share price. Should recovery not emerge on cue, the company's sound dividend and yield premium might yet look tempting for investors wanting exposure to motors.</p>

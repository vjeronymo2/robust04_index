			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: Allied-Signal gains 75% in third quarter ALLIED-SIGNAL, the US technology group undergoing a restructuring, yesterday reported a 75 per cent increase in third-quarter net income, excluding a large charge taken a year ago, led by much better results from its automotive components business. It reported net income of Dollars 140m, or 99 cents a share, compared with Dollars 80m, or 58 cents a share, before a restructuring charge which turned last year's net into a loss of Dollars 540m, or Dollars 3.94 a share. Sales rose to Dollars 2.94bn from Dollars 2.87bn. Mr Larry Bossidy, who set the shake-up going when he became chairman in 1991, said the company expected its full-year earnings to exceed the high end of its previous forecast of Dollars 3.60 to Dollars 3.85 per share. The third-quarter operating margin was 7.4 per cent, up from 5.1 per cent a year ago, while productivity rose 5.9 per cent in the first nine months of the year and return on equity was up from 9 per cent to 17 per cent. The automotive business produced net income of Dollars 39m, up from Dollars 20m, thanks to 'strong sales and profits in the automotive aftermarket and the North American light and heavy truck markets, as well as productivity gains'. Higher sales and profits for car and light truck brakes, filters and spark plugs, turbochargers and heavy vehicle equipment were offset partially by lower sales and increased losses in Brazil. The aerospace business reported net income Dollars 3m higher at Dollars 55m, which the company attributed mainly to productivity improvements, while engineered materials saw profits rise to Dollars 55m from Dollars 37m For the nine months the company reported net income of Dollars 412m, or Dollars 2.93 a share, against Dollars 227m, or Dollars 1.67, last year, excluding charges.</p>

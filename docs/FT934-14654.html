			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Observer: Talking Turkey Official visits by European heads of state are seldom cancelled at short notice. All the more embarrassing, then, if the trip is supposed to celebrate a landmark anniversary in diplomatic relations. So a number of eyebrows were raised when President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey decided to call off at the 11th hour a visit to mark the arrival in London, 200 years ago, of the first Turkish ambassador. Apparently the president, who was due in Britain this week, was upset to learn that neither the prime minister nor any member of the royal family would be attending the banquet he planned. His patience seems finally to have snapped when he was informed that, should he wish to touch down in London later than 4pm, he could not expect a red carpet welcome at the airport. The Foreign Office swears that it is domestic concerns which prevent the president from travelling abroad. An official did have to agree, however, that the carpet impasse sounded 'very British'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze has declared  that last week's appointment of the Lieutenant-General Varden  Nadibaidze, the former deputy commander of a group of Russian  troops in Transcaucasia, to the post of republican defence  minister, starts a new stage in building up the Georgian armed  forces. "New professional approaches are essential. That's  precisely what guided me in nominating Nadibaidze to the  office," Shevardnadze remarked and described the new minister as  "an experienced specialist, a good organizer, versed in army  matters and weaponry."    He emphasized that "without cooperation and friendship with  Russia at this stage it is impossible to man a truly national  Georgian Army to guarantee the country's independence." This,  in his words, is clear from the experience of the last few years.    Turning to a scandal in Georgian parliament on 28 April,  when  the Vice-Speaker Vakhtang Rcheulishvili splashed water out of a  glass into the face of the Popular Front's leader Nodar Natadze,  Shevardnadze declared that there are forces in parliament today,  wishing to rekindle instability in the country. He dismissed  these attempts as unnecessary and unfeasible.    In conclusion, he called Georgian citizens for unity and  concord.</p>

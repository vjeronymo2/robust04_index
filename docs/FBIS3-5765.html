			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kim Kyong-won, president of the Social Science </F> Institute: "Korean-U.S. Relations Without Anticommunism"]    [Text] "Korea offers the worst investment conditions for  foreign businesses." "The Korean people distrust all  foreigners." "The Korean Government does not want foreign  corporations that have invested capital in Korea to succeed in  business." These are the American complaints often heard these  days. In the latter half of the 1980's, when surpluses in  Korean trade with the United States grew, the United States  strongly pressured Korea to open its markets.    There is a critical difference in the American mood between  now and then. In the 1980's, the United States had called on us  to open the market under the premise that the two countries  would continue to maintain a close alliance. Now what it says  is different. It now makes a brave show of nerves, saying that  if Korea should ever reject American businesses, they would  depart Korea, for there are many other countries welcoming them,  for instance, China, Vietnam, and so forth.    They say that if Korea does not want to maintain close U.S.  relations, they would be compelled to regard the Korean-U.S.  alliance ties maintained to date just as "a chance occurrence in  history, and that there is not necessarily any reason for  maintaining the alliance ties any longer."    Why have things turned out like this? The most important  reason, in my view, is that communism has fallen and the Soviet  Union has collapsed. Up to now, Korean-U.S. alliance ties have  been based on the common perception of threat -- they were both  facing a "communist threat."    Of course, the Korean-U.S. security relationship is still  maintained as it is because of the threat from North Korea.  From a long-range viewpoint, the fall of world communism has  rendered anticommunism meaningless, and Korean-U.S. relations  without anticommunism have made new "adhesives" necessary.  Unlike in the past, the United States, in particular, is now in  the position that it has to regard economic interests more  seriously than military considerations. For this reason, it is  looking for a new bonding agent in its economic relations.    How should we cope with this situation? First of all, we  should consider where the most important interests lie. Russia  is roaming amid confusion; China is growing at a horrible speed,  and Japan is now standing on the crossroads of maintaining the  existing situation or reform. At this point, the United States  is the only superpower in the world and is located outside the  Northeast Asian region. In what shape should we build our  relations with the United States to make them most conducive to  the political independence and survival of our nation in the  future? On this question, we should form a forthright,  clear-cut, national consensus. Otherwise, our foreign policy  will become adrift without any distinct direction and economic  and national security policies will be in danger of conflicting  with each other.    To state the conclusion first, it is essential for Korea to  maintain relations with the United States, the superpower  outside the region, although it might be important to keep  relations with Northeast Asian countries. The Republic of Korea  needs a geopolitically steady balance of power in Northeast  Asia. Without U.S. participation, a stable balance is  impossible in today's circumstances. There is no denying that  Korea needs the United States.    Second, we must seriously think about the economy. Our  self-reliance does not dictate that we should reject, based on  emotionalism, whatever is called for by a great power. That is  not our national identity either.    When foreign businesses create employment opportunities  here,  is that indeed a minus factor for us? If Korea should close the  market only to protect domestic industries, could such a  protected industry be competitive with foreign business  corporations in the world market? Will it be possible for us to  develop high technologies, which require enormous sums of  investment capital, ourselves? The economic "space" called  China is now increasingly broadening to an extent hardly  imaginable. To make inroads into that economic sphere, will it  not be to the advantage of our businesses to establish strategic  ties with American businesses?    If the answers to those questions are that we also need  American businesses, we should open the door to the Korean  economy on our own, without waiting for the U.S. calls. Before  opening the markets, we should resolutely carry out "change and  reform," without wasting time, in order to change those things  that need changing first.    Finally, we should explain our position to foreigners  fairly,  squarely, and clearly in a straightforward manner. If we decide  to open the door, we should also explain if we need to make  necessary preparations for market liberalization. Importance is  attached to some indirect and implicative expressions in the  Oriental culture. In the West, particularly in the American  culture, we need to bear in mind that clear-cut and direct  expressions are taken seriously.    There is no mistake that building new Korean-U.S. relations  without anticommunism will be one of our most difficult tasks  ahead. I believe, however, that it will be the most worthwhile  work. Our relations with the United States based on  anticommunism had been inescapable, but were not necessarily  desirable. Now both Korea and the United States have finally  come to participate jointly in the positive work for prosperity  and freedom.</p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIDERS RETURN TO OAKLAND  </P> <P> An open letter to Davis and the Raiders:  </P> <P> So you're going home again -- bon voyage! But there seems to be some dissent on  the part of the good people of Oakland, who decry the millions being spent to  bring your football team there to the detriment of the serious civic problems  of the homeless and schools. They do have a point.  </P> <P> If you really want to make points with your local citizenry (other than those  you rack up on the football field), how about contributing some of your revenue  to really help Oakland cope with these problems and win yourselves some  much-needed goodwill as well as more people to watch your team play?  </P> <P> It's your ball now, first and 10.  </P> <P> IRVING GOTTSCHALK  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

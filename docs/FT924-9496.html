			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Sweden gives enterprise boost Sweden plans to set up a new SKr2.5bn (Pounds 276m) fund to support the development of new companies, Christopher Brown-Humes reports from Stockholm. The scheme, based on a successful German model, aims to help the companies get access to finance at a time when the country's crisis-hit banking sector is often reluctant to provide support. It will start operations on January 1 1993. The new scheme complements a venture capital project for small and medium-sized businesses, which was unveiled last month.</p>

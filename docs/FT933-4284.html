			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Equipment failure hits Cluff FAILURE of equipment, which interrupted production at Freda Rebecca, Zimbabwe's biggest gold mine, for seven weeks contributed to a 28 per cent drop in midway pre-tax profits reported by Cluff Resources, the UK-based gold company. Very high interest rates in Zimbabwe also affected the result and pre-tax profits dropped from Pounds 915,000 to Pounds 661,000 for the period to June 30. Turnover fell from Pounds 6.97m to Pounds 6.67m and gold output was down from 35,625 troy ounces in the first half of 1992, when production was held back by power cuts associated with Zimbabwe's drought, to 28,166 ounces. Mr Algy Cluff, chairman, said both mills at Freda Rebecca were back in full production following repairs to a motor which drives one of them and that the company's gold output this year was expected to reach 65,000 ounces against a previous target of 70,000. Cluff's interest payments would ease considerably once it completed a large gold loan being negotiated in Zimbabwe - the first ever permitted by that country's central bank. The loan should be completed later this month. Some of the proceeds, about USDollars 12m (Pounds 7.9m) would fund underground development at Freda Rebecca, taking annual capacity to nearly 100,000 ounces during 1995. Aberfoyle, the Zimbabwean industrial and farming group in which Cluff recently acquired a 70 per cent stake, would make a positive contribution to results, said Mr Cluff. Cluff's net earnings in the half year were Pounds 278,000 (Pounds 238,000), equal to 38p (33p) per share.</p>

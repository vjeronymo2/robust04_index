			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Lower interest costs lift Eldridge Pope CONTINUED cost-cutting and a reduced interest burden helped Eldridge Pope, the Dorset-based brewer and wine shipper, lift interim profits to Pounds 203,000. Mr Christopher Pope, chairman, said: 'There is no room for complacency but progress in recovery is being maintained.' The shares, quoted on the USM, rose 8p to 101p. The outcome for the half year to March 31 was struck after interest charges reduced to Pounds 917,000 (Pounds 1.17m) and compared with a loss last time of Pounds 84,000, restated for FRS 3. Turnover improved to Pounds 20.5m (Pounds 20.2m). Mr Pope said that sales of cask ales and food had been strong but spending elsewhere, particularly on amusement machines, was 'restrained'. Losses from the group's share of the Highcliffe Hotel in Bournemouth were reduced from Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 156,000. An encouraging start to the second half saw profits in April marginally ahead of budget; costs remained under tight control, Mr Pope said. The interim dividend is 1.4p (1.31p), uncovered by earnings of 0.86p (0.4p restated losses).</p>

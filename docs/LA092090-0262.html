			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> LAUREN BACALL TO BE HONORED  </P> <P> The International Museum of Photography is honoring the sultry-voiced Lauren  Bacall with an award for her illustrious film career.  </P> <P> Bacall will be given the George Eastman Award "for distinguished achievement in  American film" at a fund-raising gala at the George Eastman House on Nov. 9.  </P> <P> Previous recipients of the award include Gregory Peck, James Stewart and  Lillian Gish.  </P> <P> Bacall, who was born Betty Joan Perske, began her career in the 1940s in the  movie "To Have and Have Not" with Humphrey Bogart. Her come-on in that film to  Bogart, who became her husband, has become movie legend.  </P> <P> "If you want anything, just whistle," Bacall's character coyly intones. "You  know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? Just put your lips together . . . and  blow."  </P> <P> Bacall starred with Bogart in "The Big Sleep," "Dark Passage" and "Key Largo."  In 1970, she won a Tony award for her stage performance in the musical  "Applause." More recently she played roles in "Murder on the Orient Express,"  "The Shootist" and "The Fan."  </P></p>

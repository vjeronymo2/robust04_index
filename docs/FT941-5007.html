			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Russia and the IMF resume crucial loan talks Russia and the International Monetary Fund resume crucial loan negotiations in Moscow today with both their reputations on the line, Reuter reports from Washington. Moscow wants IMF endorsement of its credentials as a pro-reform government, while the Fund is seeking to justify its position as lead manager in helping Russia remake its economy in the capitalist mould. Reaching agreement will not be easy. International monetary sources rate the chances of the two sides striking a deal on an economic reform programme that the IMF could back with a Dollars 1.5bn loan as no better than 50-50. Moscow's commitment to reform has been questioned following the departure of key reformers from the government in January, and the IMF has found itself criticised by the US and others for not doing enough to encourage Russian reforms. The IMF has already lent Russia Dollars 2.5bn, but has held back further credits because of doubts about Moscow's willingness to press ahead with economic reforms.</p>

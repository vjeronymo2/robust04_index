			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The State Department accused Nicaragua's Sandinista government of harassing  reporters, opposition figures and election observers, and it called for a halt  to such activity so that balloting set for next February can be credible.  Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Washington is "very concerned about  the way things are going in Nicaragua. Sandinista harassment . . . whether done  through brute force or through the use of transparent legalisms, must cease."  Among the incidents cited by Boucher was an attack on two correspondents from  La Prensa last month in the city of Leon.  </P></p>

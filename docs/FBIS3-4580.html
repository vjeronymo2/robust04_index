			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television in Japanese at  2230 GMT on 19 February in its "News 2001" program carries a  live 39-minute interview with Yuichi Ichikawa, general secretary  of Komeito, by FNN announcers Yuji Kuroiwa and Kaori Matsuyama,  political commentator Kennichi Takemura, and Keio University  professor Yoshiaki Kobayashi at the FNN studios.    Kuroiwa asks Ichikawa about a realignment of the political  parties and a cabinet reshuffle. Ichikawa responds: "I think  it is nonsense to talk about a realignment of the political  parties at the present stage. I have never consulted the prime  minister about a cabinet reshuffle, but it is up to the prime  minister." Ichikawa criticizes Chief Cabinet Secretary  Takemura, saying: "At news conferences, the chief cabinet  secretary has spoken of policy differences between the prime  minister and his cabinet. The chief cabinet secretary has also  spoken about important policy matters before the government and  ruling coalition parties discuss them. His actions have created  a rift within the ruling coalition parties, and this has been  repeated on several occasions."    Commenting on the timing of a cabinet reshuffle, Ichikawa  says: "I believe the cabinet will be reshuffled when the package  of political bills are put into effect. There is a possibility  the cabinet will be reshuffled before Diet deliberation of the  1994 budget bill begins."    Discussing the scope of the cabinet reshuffle, Ichikawa  states: "The cabinet reshuffle will not be confined to the  replacement of the chief cabinet secretary. I believe many  other cabinet members will be replaced."    Discussing the formation of a new party, Ichikawa states:  "Currently there is the opposition Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP). We intend to fight in the elections by forming a new  party which can take over the reigns of government."    Asked by Kuroiwa about the possibility of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), Sakigake (the Harbinger  Party), and Komeito being merged into a new party, Ichikawa  cites the difficulty involved in forming the present coalition  government, but does not rule out the possibility, adding that  the "SDPJ should have policies compatible with the key role it  is playing in the coalition government."    Commenting on Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura's statement  that Sakigake, the SDPJ, and the Democratic Socialist Party  should field unified candidates in the next election to counter  candidates running on the Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and  Komeito tickets, Ichikawa accuses Takemura of making such a  statement, stating: "The chief cabinet secretary is in a  position to hold the ruling coalition parties together. What is  at issue is that he is going against the unity of the ruling  coalition parties."    Asked by Kuroiwa about Ozawa's vision for building Japan  into  an ordinary nation, Ichikawa replies: "Ozawa's vision envisions  the far future."    Discussing Japan's future contribution to the international  community, Ichikawa says: "I believe Japan can make the  contribution based only on the five principles of the PKO; this  contribution can win the people's understanding."</p>

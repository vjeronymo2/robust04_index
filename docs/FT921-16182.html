			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Observer: Out of account There is a touch of irony about the dismissal of Robson Rhodes as auditors of Yorkshire textile group John Foster &amp; Son. Although the board had previously requested the accountancy firm to resign, it refused on the highly principled grounds that auditors are responsible to shareholders, not directors. Yet when shareholders turned up at the group's AGM last July, a certain party was noticeable only by its absence. The Robson Rhodes partner due to attend had put the wrong date in his diary and failed to show. As a result, the auditors' report to shareholders had to be read out by Foster's finance director] The change of auditors nevertheless raises the question of how four of the Big Six firms invited to tender as replacements could offer audit fees at about 65 per cent of their predecessor's level. After all, their charge-out rates are presumably not much different from those of Robson Rhodes, 14th by fee income. So what's the answer - a cut in hours . . . reallocation of the work to lower-grade staff . . . ? Surely they couldn't have been offering a loss-leader on such an important function.</p>

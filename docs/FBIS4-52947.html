The  president spent a great deal of time visiting agriculture,  handicraft, and industrial establishments as well as peasant  patriots."    In Hai Hung Province, President Le Duc Anh visited Me So  Village in Chau Giang District and Hung Dao Village in Tu Loc  District. In these villages, he listened to reports on the  efforts of local people to improve local agriculture production.

The president visited the Hai Duong Water Pump Production  Plant and the Hai Duong Ceramic Company, two production units of  the central government located in Hai Hung Province. He  commended these two economic units for their efforts to compete  with imported products. "In these units, President Le Duc Anh  reminded party cadres and government officials to strictly  implement the principles of publicity and democracy in  production management and income distribution. He urged them to  concentrate the collective strength of party committees, the  workers' union, and the youth union on production development.  He reminded them that they must not forget their obligation to  the state and their responsibility to the local area, which is  in addition to the need for improvements in the material lives  of the cadres and workers.    "Apart from the visits to agricultural and industrial  production units, President Le Duc Anh held a working session  with Hai Hung province leaders to listen to reports on the  provincial socioeconomic situation by Comrade Pham Van Tho,  member of the party Central Committee and secretary of the  provincial party committee; and Nguyen Van Du, chairman of the  Hai Hung Province People's Committee. He hailed the Hai Hung  party committees and government for gaining a thorough  understanding of party resolutions before skillfully applying  them to the local, practical situation, by means of which they  scored comprehensive victories in economic development in Hai  Hung, manifested in a relatively high economic development rate  and progress in the poverty alleviation work."    President Le Duc Anh also asked many questions about the  local situation. Speaking to key provincial leaders at a local  meeting to disseminate Resolutions No. 04 and 07 of the party  Political Bureau, he expressed his joy at the socioeconomic  achievements of the Hai Hung party committees and people. He  said:    [Begin recording] "President Ho Chi Minh always called for  unity in our party and people. In his statement, he compared  unity in the party and in the organization with the apples of  our eyes. Therefore, the motto: Unity, Unity, Great Unity and  Success, Success, and Great Success is both a formula for and a  decisive factor in our party's success in the national  liberation and renovation undertaking. The entire people can  unite only when the party unites itself. Only unity can help us  overcome all challenges; this is the fundamental issue that  leads to success. Unity can also lead to creativeness from the  people. I urge the party committee and people to continue  extending their success on the basis of the recorded  achievements to take this province to a new step, contribute to  national modernization and industrialization, and fulfill the  goal of making the population prosperous, the country strong,  and society just and civilized. I wish you all good health" [end  recording]    Before leaving the province, President Le Duc Anh visited  the  provincial specialized school for talented students. There, he  urged the Hai Hung party committee, government, and people to  pay more attention to the education service.

I  wish President Le Duc Anh good health." [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ICN TO PAY LESS FOR FLOW LABORATORIES  </P> <P> ICN Biomedicals, a Costa Mesa supplier of biotechnology research and medical  diagnostic products, said Tuesday that its price for acquiring Flow  Laboratories has been reduced from $41.5 million to $37.6 million.  </P> <P> Flow Laboratories is a supplier of life sciences research products that was  acquired by ICN in November, 1989.  </P> <P> The adjustment in the purchase price was based on a financial review of Flow  Laboratories by an independent auditing firm, said Jack Sholl, an ICN  spokesman.  </P> <P> "The acquisition of Flow Laboratories was intended to provide ICN Biomedicals  with international sales, marketing and distribution capability that it did not  have before, particularly in the European economic community." Sholl added.  </P></p>

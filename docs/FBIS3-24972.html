			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued on 4 February by Territorial </F> Administration and Security Ministry; place not given]    [Text] This morning at about 0815, following an incident  between Ghanaian security forces and smugglers, gunshots were  heard on the Ghanaian side of the Aflao border town. The  shooting, which was heard in Lome, provoked a movement of panic  among the peaceful people of our capital. As our security  forces posted around the Protestatnt High School were getting  ready to face any threat, there was another serious incident in  which one person was wounded.    The government hereby reassures the people and asks them to  go about their normal business. One may recall that during two  recent meetings between Togolese and Ghanaian security  officials, it was agreed that every effort would be made to  prevent shooting in order not to cause panic among the people on  both sides of the border.</p>

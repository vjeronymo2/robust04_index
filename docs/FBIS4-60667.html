			<p>BFN     [Text] The closure on the Gaza Strip was lifted this  morning, and Palestinians are being allowed to enter Israel  under the conditions enforced last week. The closure was  imposed last Friday, following the terror attack near the Erez  checkpoint in which reserves soldiers Moshe Bukra and Erez  Ben-Barukh were killed. Since the attack the Palestinian police  have set up roadblocks on the approach roads to entrance from  the Strip and are stopping and examining local vehicles.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Arts: Where have all the classics gone? - Personalities or minimalism is what the CD buying public seems to want There will be fewer classical CDs among the presents around the Christmas tree this year. Figures for sales of recorded music included in the PSI's yearly Cultural Trends, published last week, show trade deliveries of classical albums have dropped a quarter since 1990 and their market share down to 9.2 per cent after two years over 10 per cent. Although the statistics may look discouraging, there is no surprise here. The success of the World Cup gala with the 'three tenors' - Carreras, Domingo and Pavarotti  -was a one-off. What is more interesting is a cultural trend that no statistics can measure. The public's taste in classical music has changed dramatically in a way that has implications for the whole industry in the future. To see how, we need only ask the ghost of Christmas past. Look at the best-seller lists for the winter of 1973. Karajan had recently recorded two opera sets, Puccini's La Boheme and Lehar's The Merry Widow. Both were old favourites aimed at the present-giving season and record shops as far afield as Glasgow, Leeds, Manchester and London reported brisk sales. Other records to feature were Previn conducting Rachmaninov's Second Symphony and a complete set of Beethoven's Piano Concertos played by Ashkenazy. All good, solid classics. Now jump ahead 20 years. The profile of what we are buying has changed beyond recognition. A recent best-sellers list from the HMV record shop includes all manner of hits. For a start, there are two discs by Cecilia Bartoli, the young and extremely attractive mezzo, and another by Ute Lemper, who is only a little way behind in both categories. As it is unlikely that the public has suddenly formed a craving for arie antiche or the songs of Kurt Weill, one can safely conclude that the personalities are the attraction. It cannot be a coincidence that both ladies are familiar from television. After tasting success with classical artists such as Pavarotti and Nigel Kennedy, the cannibalistic mass media are on the look-out for new bodies on which to feed. This year, however, has been dominated by quite another phenomenon - the music of Gorecki, Part, Tavener, Nyman and Glass, representing minimalism of every hue. There is no doubt in my mind that this is a passing fad. But where has it come from? The mere fact that the classical record industry can be thrown this way and that by passing fashions like its pop counterpart is in itself a new phenomenon. There are people who have not grown up with classical music, but want to investigate what it might have to offer. Reared on the short attention-span which is all that is expected by other forms of entertainment today, they buy discs of compilations ('Essential Opera' or 'Concerto Sampler') and are attracted by sound-bites on the radio to music that demands no concentration. Gorecki may be pleading for political tolerance, Tavener and Part may be searching for religious truth, but that is not why they have become popular. Their music is easy to absorb. It is culture on a sugar-lump. Without the boom in sales during the 1980s caused by the advent of the compact disc, the choice of music available on recordings would never have advanced this far. Suddenly record companies could afford to be adventurous. When Virgin recorded Tavener's The Protecting Veil, nobody could have predicted its mass appeal. When Elektra-Nonesuch unearthed Gorecki's Third Symphony, it was a shot in the dark. Gorecki was unknown then. It was marketing - especially the dissemination of the music through radio, including the newly-formed Classic FM - that did the trick. This broadening of the repertoire can be seen on all sides. The popularity of early music has long spread beyond the university cities and we think nothing today of finding a set of Venetian Vespers holding its place among the best-sellers. Names such as Paul McCreesh and the Gabrieli Consort, the King's Consort, and Trevor Pinnock are regulars in the classical Top 10. Who would have thought that there was a large market for 20th-century music? Yet the first-ever recording of Britten's Gloriana has done well this year. Decca is also said to be enjoying good sales from its 'Entartete Musik' series, devoted to music banned by the Nazis. Even works by James MacMillan, Hugh Wood and Harrison Birtwistle turn up on the lists. No wonder BMG has set up the Catalyst label for young composers and Sony is looking to start one. But what is missing here? - the very category that was the mainstay of the classical best-sellers lists in 1973, the big-name conductor and orchestra playing the great classics. Record companies are unwilling to discuss in public the profitability or lack of it enjoyed by their major artists, but in private some are ready to admit that they have famous conductors and orchestras on their books that simply do not sell. In the eyes of the public, the giants of music have died out. As a member of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra remarked to me recently, 'Karajan was the last tyrannosaurus among conductors'. In part, it is their success that the present generation of conductors is having to fight against. If the consumer wants a recording of a Beethoven symphony, he can still have Karajan or Klemperer, Bohm or Jochum on disc and  -what is more - at half the price, thanks to the industry's readiness to repackage old recordings at a discount. That is where the big companies are making their profit these days. New recordings of the standard classics are more often than not undertaken in the hope that they will provide similarly profitable re-issues in the future. Sometimes, the enormous cost of hiring today's top conductors and orchestras means that the company knows it will never make a profit on the recording, even before it is finished. All this must point to ever greater change in the classical consumer's record-buying habits, ever greater flexibility on the part of record companies trying to chase those purchases. The need to anticipate the next passing fad or to light upon the next hit in the right neglected corner of the repertoire will certainly keep company executives on their toes. What will be top of the classical charts in 20 years? If only they could ask the ghost of Christmas future.</p>

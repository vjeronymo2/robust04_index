			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / International Company News: SA watershed for black business  -Nail starts trading in Johannesburg today New Africa Investments Limited (Nail) begins trading on the Johannesburg stock exchange today. Its arrival marks the most significant achievement of black business in South Africa to date and highlights the continued weakness of black economic clout in the country. The formation of Nail, the brainchild of Dr Nthato Motlana a Soweto-based medical doctor turned businessman who used to be President Nelson Mandela's personal physician, is an important initiative by any standards. Dr Motlana and a group of partners have put together a number of recent black initiatives and rolled them into a single company. Nail's biggest asset is a 30 per cent controlling share in Metlife, South Africa's fifth largest life assurer, and it controls The Sowetan newspaper, the country's highest circulation daily, and holds a large stake in MTN, a cellular phone network. Total assets amount to about R7bn (Dollars 1.9bn). The company's listing marks a watershed for black business but critics charge that its formation owes more to white desperation to build up a class of black capitalists than any inherent business acumen on the part of Dr Motlana and his associates. 'All it does is help establish a new black elite without providing any real benefits for the masses,' says one cynic. Some of the charges carry more than a grain of truth. Certainly nearly all the transactions leading to the formation of Nail have been facilitated by white conglomerates aware that, given the new political climate, blacks have to be seen to have a genuine stake in the economy. The takeover by a black consortium of The Sowetan last year from Argus Newspapers, former Anglo-American subsidiary, was managed on very generous terms, while the money for the first 10 per cent of Metlife taken by Dr Motlana and his partners was provided through a loan, now repaid, from the state-run Industrial Development Corporation. Meanwhile, Sankorp, the Afrikaner-run insurance group that used to own Metlife, will retain 20 per cent of the new company and a seat on the board of directors, and existing white management is being kept on at both Metlife and The Sowetan. However, Sankorp officials deny they will be seeking any managerial role in the new company and emphasise the decision to sell Metlife was made for sound business reasons. 'We will fulfil our role in corporate governance,' notes Mr Attie du Plessis, a Sankorp executive director. 'But we will not interfere in the day-to-day life of the group. We have faith in the directors and the underlying companies.' The fact that ulterior motives might lie behind the conglomerates' willingness to engineer the necessary deals, makes their generosity good financial sense in the current climate. 'The black sector of the life assurance market is growing at 50 per cent a year,' notes one broker. 'Although Metlife's share of the market has dropped from 80 per cent to 40 per cent over the past five years, it's still in a better position to benefit from the growth than any other company.' Also, charges that Nail benefits only a tiny core of black investors are not entirely justified. In addition to having 8,500 individual black shareholders, the National Council of Trade Unions has taken a 13.7 per cent share of the new company, and other union groups are likely to take up a further 20 per cent in the near future. Sizeable though Nail might be, compared with the bigger life assurers or the leading banks and mining houses, it is one medium-size black fish in a pond filled with big white ones. However, given apartheid's success in preventing blacks from accumulating capital or skills to build up their own companies, initiatives such as Nail remain the only viable way of developing large black business in South Africa.</p>

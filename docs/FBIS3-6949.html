The businessmen appreciate the Bank of Thailand's policy of  allowing qualified Vietnamese companies and Thai-Vietnamese  joint ventures to be listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand in  the future.    They say the move will be an incentive for local firms to  invest more outside Thailand.    Dr Som Chatusiphithak, chairman of the Thai Bankers'  Association, and Wichian Techaphaibun, vice-president of the  Board of Trade of Thailand have backed the central bank's  decision to expand loans through the Bangkok International  Banking Facilities (BIBF) scheme.    They say both moves will boost Thailand's push to become a  regional financial centre.    The two share the view that it is time the Thai Government  offered investment perks for local businessmen to expand their  investments abroad, not just providing such privileges for local  investment as at present.    Difficulties over monetary regulations include the allowable  limit of funds to be taken out for investment abroad, says Mr  Wichian, who is also the president of Bangkok Metropolitan Bank.    Thanin Chiarawanon, chairman of the Charoen Phokphan Group,  says that even where the two countries have something in common,  such as in agricultural goods, Thailand should not consider  Vietnam as a rival in exporting. However, the government should  promote and support local businessmen to invest here to make  Vietnam partially a production base.    Wikrom Kromadit, president of Bangpakong Industrial Park 2  Co, echoes this view. He says the Board of Investment should  act as an agency to encourage investment abroad, like the Japan  External Trade Organisation.    He sees better prospects for bilateral ties after the Chuan  visit, but he thinks real action or real investment from  Thailand is much needed.    Mr Wikrom says his Long Binh Industrial Estate project, for  which the contract was signed during the Chuan visit to Vietnam,  will, if completed, become the hub of Thai investment in Vietnam.    He aims to provide several services including seeking  Vietnamese partners and investment consultancy over rules and  regulations here.    Many Thai products, for example canned pineapple, canned  tuna  and other canned seafood products, have a good reputation in  foreign markets, and it is thus possible to shift the  manufacturing base to Vietnam while using the same Thai brand  names.    During the visit, there were two agreements on tourism  cooperation an agreement between the Federation of Thai  Industries and Vietnam's State Committee for Cooperation and  Investment; and four joint investment contracts between Thai  firms and Vietnamese government agencies. Mr Chuan witnessed  the signing of the contracts.</p>

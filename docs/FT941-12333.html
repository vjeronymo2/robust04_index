			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Arts: Mayerling - Covent Garden A cemetery at deadest night; sleeting rain; light glinting on the oilskins of gravediggers as a coffin is lowered into the ground; a grief-stricken coachman, a priest and two mourners. Between this mysterious beginning to Mayerling and the same scene which ends the ballet, lies MacMillan's potent study of love frustrated, destroyed and destroying. Returned on Friday night to the Covent Garden repertory, it is the boldest among his full-length creations. The tragedy is political as well as emotional: MacMillan's choreography tells us about the Archduke Rudolf's despairs, and through them we learn of the disintegration of a family and a dynasty. Friday's performance was scheduled to bring us Zoltan Solymosi as Rudolf and Leanne Benjamin as Mary Vetsera. Solymosi was injured at the dress rehearsal, and Adam Cooper was called in to take over a role he first assumed (in similar circumstances) during the Royal Ballet's European tour last summer. This unscheduled London debut thus became more than usually arduous - albeit Cooper was able to perform with Viviana Durante as Mary, with whom he has danced the role before. It is proper to view his interpretation as something like a dress-rehearsal under hair-raising conditions. That Cooper pulled it off at all is remarkable. It would be idle to pretend that the first scenes were anything but sketchy, yet he grew into the role, and the last act was proof of his right to the ballet. We saw here a terrible exhaustion of spirit, a man driven to the limits of emotional endurance. Pallid, distraught, Cooper made Rudolf a haunted figure, hunted to death by his own anguish. Viviana Durante's Mary is a reading whose physical daring suggests the girl's sensual alertness. Durante shapes the choreography with a fine, true line, phrasing small scenes with delicacy (the little solo when Countess Larisch has taken her letter for Rudolf was exquisite), and giving the most impassioned sequences a broad dynamic sweep. It was also admirably responsive to Cooper's view of Rudolf. Among the ensemble I thought some dramatic fences were rushed and technical edges untidy, but Natalie McCann was very touching as Rudolf's hapless, prim bride, and Fiona Chadwick knows  -and shows - that Larisch is the only woman to understand Rudolf. The present run of performances will bring a welcome recording of the ballet for television, with Irek Mukhamedov and Viviana Durante. The staging now incorporates slight textual emendations that Sir Kenneth MacMillan was contemplating at the time of his death just over a year ago. The opening court dances are edited; the Empress Elizabeth no longer has a solo in the second act. Most important, the song in the Hofburg scene - cut in an earlier revival - is restored. It is a crucial moment for Rudolf and the very core of this extraordinary ballet.</p>

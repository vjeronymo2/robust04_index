			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gaja Petkovic: "Guarantees of the Almighty"] </F>   [Text] In connection with a column presenting an  interview with General Ratko Mladic (NIN, 7-18 January 1994), we  were contacted by reporter and military commentator Gaja  Petkovic, the former chief and managing editor of NARODNA  ARMIJA. We are publishing his somewhat abridged and edited  contribution.    In April 1992, NARODNA ARMIJA informed its readers that  "because of the successful conduct of war operations," 13  colonels had received special promotions to the rank of general,  that 519 active military officers had received special  promotions to higher ranks, and that 2,040 members of the  Yugoslav People's Army [JNA] had been decorated for wartime  services, 226 of them posthumously. Most of them, certainly,  were honorable people, competent officers and heroic soldiers  (although many of them did not know the goals of the war, nor  could they understand, at least in the beginning, that the war  that they were waging was not actually "their" war).  Unfortunately, there were also those others....    The explanation of Colonel Ratko Mladic's special promotion  said, among other things, that he was being granted the rank of  general "for exceptional conduct and action in carrying out  combat missions of particular importance for the armed forces  and the country's defense, as well as for successful command and  leadership, initiative, and personal bravery."    At that time Ratko Mladic was chief of staff of the JNA's  Knin Corps. What that "exceptional conduct and action in  carrying out combat missions" looked like in practice is best  illustrated by a detail from a book by Misha Glenny, a prominent  BBC correspondent for Eastern Europe, The Fall of  Yugoslavia, published in London in 1992.    ``After he showed a weapon that he had personally captured  from the defeated Croatian and Slovene fighters, General Mladic,  who obviously enjoyed the attention of his listeners, giggled  while he prepared to play us a recording of a recent telephone  conversation between him and the head of the Croatian Ministry  of Internal Affairs in the nearby port of Split, one of the most  militant HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] bases. Although  they had not expected each other in the places they were in, it  turned out almost immediately that they were old acquaintances:    `Is that you, Mladic?'    `Yes, old enemy, what do you want?'    `My three guys disappeared somewhere near here... so I would  like to know what happened to them.'    `I think they are all dead.'    `One of their parents is here in connection with it. Then I  can tell them for certain that they are no longer alive?'    `Yes, certainly, I give you my word. By the way, how is your  family?'    `Well, not bad, thanks. And yours?'    `Fine, we are doing well.'    `I am quite glad to hear it. By the way, since we are  already  in touch, we have about 20 bodies of your people here near the  front; we killed them. We put them in a mass grave, and now they  are stinking to high heaven. Could you perhaps come to collect  them, because they are becoming really unbearable....'"    "The friendship between the opposing merchants of death on a  large scale was one of the most horrible phenomena that I  observed during the war," Glenny commented.    Who actually is General Mladic?  <H5>  Tito's Apprentice </H5>   Ratko is a war orphan. He was born in the village of  Bozinovici, near Kalinovik, in March 1943. He does not remember  his father, but feels clearly, and today stresses emphatically,  that he died a heroic death in 1945, attacking the village in  Herzegovina in which the Croatian fascist leader Ante Pavelic  was born. Mladic began his military career in an unusual way--by  apprenticeship. As a 15-year-old, he left village life and  headed for Serbia, for Zemun, where he graduated from a defense  industry school, and then (when it was possible) enrolled in the  ground forces' military academy. The military career of Second  Lieutenant Ratko Mladic began in 1965. He was a platoon  commander in Skopje, a battalion commander in Kumanovo, a  brigade commander in Stip, the Pristina Corps commander's  assistant for logistics, chief of staff of the Knin Corps, and  then its commander. In all of those duties Mladic displayed  impeccable loyalty to the communist regime, its commander in  chief Josip Broz, and Yugoslavism, and he always successfully  met high standards of moral and political suitability, which  made possible for him an exceptionally rapid rise through the  ladder of the military hierarchy. At that time Mladic did not  talk about any sort of "Serbdom," about "Serbian military  traditions," the "Serbian national interest," or a "unified  Serbian state." He was clever and morally adept enough to know  what he should say at what time.    When he had completed all his military work in Croatia, on  orders from the JNA military leadership he was transferred to  Bosnia-Herzegovina, in order to fight on his native soil as a  born Bosnian (since Yugoslavia "did not participate in the war"  in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina), and in order to "liberate"  it heroically, as an already proven fighter without fear or  fault.    The fact that it is claimed now and then, especially abroad,  that while fighting in Croatia Ratko Mladic "remembered the  past, his deceased father and his unhappy childhood, and let  loose his inborn sadism" can but does not have to be accepted.  The same thing could also apply to the claims that for  everything that happened "in Gospic and Zadar, as well as other  areas in which his units fought, Mladic is one of those most  responsible for the war crimes that happened on the territory of  Croatia." With respect to the war in Croatia, however, it  remains an indisputable fact that the former Yugoslavia's  Secretariat for National Defense, responding in writing to a  report by the international organization Helsinki Watch on  violations of the rules of humanitarian law by the JNA (whose  general Ratko Mladic was), admitted that such violations had  occurred, and "that those violations in this conflict were  committed by individual members of the JNA or members of other  armed units under the JNA's responsibility...." The response  then states that proceedings had been initiated before military  courts against several dozen military personnel "who had  committed robberies," "crimes against the civilian population,"  "rapes of women of Croatian nationality," and so forth.    The above-mentioned response by the Federal Secretariat for  National Defense to Helsinki Watch also contains other  admissions of violations by the JNA of the rules of humanitarian  law. Thus, among other things, it is emphasized that a multitude  of camps were formed for the "reception" of prisoners, that  those camps were also located "outside of Serbia... in Knin,  Bileca, Stara Gradiska," that "one cannot deny that (in those  camps) there were cases of excessive behavior and attempted  physical abuse of the prisoners," and that "several individuals  who performed guard duties were replaced" for that reason (!).  The military leadership also admitted that "the report states  quite correctly that during the armed conflict in Croatia many  religious and health care facilities suffered (churches,  hospitals, and so forth)," and that the same situation as with  Vukovar also existed "in many other places (Zadar, Sibenik,  Vinkovci, and so forth)."    Can Ratko Mladic, like many other conceited warlords in this  war, really believe that he will succeed in evading his  undoubted responsibility for the crimes of members of the army  that he led throughout the war in Croatia and which he headed?  In response to a question from NIN's reporter (on 12 February  1993), however, about whether he was upset by the fact that the  Americans, Croats, and Muslims had declared him a war criminal,  Mladic said: "I would be concerned if a list were published in  France or the United States of the war criminals who committed  crimes near Dien Bien Phu, in Vietnam, in Cambodia, and in other  places." Such careless reasoning is simply striking, when he  virtually equates his actions in the war in Bosnia and Croatia  with the crimes that were committed so many years ago by  professional killers in Vietnam and Cambodia!  <H5>  "The Burning of Sarajevo" </H5>   It was only when he arrived in Bosnia as a JNA lieutenant  general that Mladic liberated all his destructive energy and let  loose his warlike passions. Everything contributed to that  behavior of his. Two magnates, Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo  Tudjman--the inviolate "gods of war" in this region of ours--had  already (according to many reliable claims) reached an agreement  on the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina. A third magnate, Alija  Izetbegovic, balancing between the international community,  primarily the Americans, and Islamic fanatics, and often  courting Tudjman as well, decided that he would not allow them  to do anything like that. The Serbian side found an executor for  its destructive business in a God-given figure for something  like that--Ratko Mladic.    During the initial period of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  the Serbs were superior in heavy artillery. Mladic's army was  the only one that had (truly respectable) heavy artillery.  Naturally, the militant general could not help but make maximum  use of that chance. Everywhere around Sarajevo, he deployed  dozens of large-caliber steel barrels (76, 105, 122, 130, and  155 millimeters, 128-millimeter Plamen and Oganj multiple rocket  launchers, and 60, 81, 82, and 120-millimeter mortars), and, in  accordance with the plan of vengeance whose ideological creators  sat in Belgrade and in Pale, he began the long-awaited war feast.    Actually, Mladic knew quite well that no one, objectively,  was in a position at that time to offer him any serious  resistance, and so he roared where it was actually necessary,  and also where there was no military or any other justification  at all for anything like that. The cost of destroying Sarajevo  was no longer important at all. What was important was to "teach  a lesson" to Alija and his followers. That is why Sarajevo was  destroyed, burnt, and demolished for months, and its people were  butchered and killed. In moments of rage, and even instinctive  hatred of the enemy, the air force was also summoned "to help."  And the enemy? To the extent to which he was capable of doing  anything serious at that time, he did not turn the other cheek.    Muslims, Serbs, and Croats suffered equally from Mladic's  artillerymen and their shells. In the beginning, admittedly, the  JNA used its transport aircraft to save citizens of Sarajevo,  primarily those of Serbian nationality and the family members of  active military personnel. Close to 100,000 Serbs, however, were  left in their homes in Sarajevo to attempt, sharing the fate of  their fellow citizens of other nationalities, to await the end  of the war. Mladic's artillerymen were thus also the killers of  their own people. Together with their general, they also earned  awards, decorations, and promotions on the basis of Serbs'  wartime suffering. If he ever does answer for the war crimes on  the territory of the former Yugoslavia, however, the most  serious accusation against Mladic, of course, will be because of  Sarajevo.    According to the testimony of an officer responsible for  organizing communications in Pale, Mladic taped many of his most  unpopular measures in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Thus, often  carried away by the rage and brutality characteristic of him, he  invented the previously unknown commands to artillery units:  "Burn," "roast."  <H5>  "Idiotic Statements" </H5>   Mladic's behavior almost infallibly leads to the conclusion  that he is a person who, when the military situation requires,  can be both a cynic and a sadist. Here is one example: "Even one  life lost in this insane war is a lot. The losses on our side  were not high.... I do not know about the casualties on their  side, but I think that they were massive.... They would have  been even higher if we had not spared them!"    After the failure of British Lord David Owen, cochairman of  the Conference on Yugoslavia, to persuade the leadership of the  Bosnian Serbs in the Bosanka villa in Belgrade to accept the  Vance-Owen maps (on the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina into 10  provinces), General Mladic, in response to a reporter's comment  that Owen had left the meeting quite angry, said "with a  characteristic sly expression on his face," "Not at all, he was  a refined and mild person, who cannot get angry. It must be that  this Belgrade sun got in his eyes, and so it seems to you that  he is angry." And in response to a reporter's question about  what was the biggest obstacle to peace, Mladic said: "The  biggest obstacle to peace is war!"    The law always lay in a mace for Ratko Mladic. He knew how  to  draw it even when political decisions were involved. As the  already "glorified" commander of the Knin Corps and a person who  had learned not to listen to anyone, as soon as he arrived in  Bosnia, in Pale, he demanded "that the political leadership of  the Bosnian Serbs immediately and unconditionally put itself  under his control and not adopt any political decisions without  the permission of (his) military command" (!). Somewhat later,  when the Americans and the EC, because of the more frequent  shelling of Sarajevo, requested permission from the UN Security  Council for carrying out airstrikes against the Bosnian Serbs'  artillery positions, Mladic threatened nothing more or less than  "bombing London and Washington"! General Manojlo Milovanovic,  chief of staff of the Serbian army in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina, took his militant commander under his  protection. Milovanovic said that General Mladic was not  thinking of a conventional bombing of the capitals of the United  States and Great Britain, but was instead talking about bombing  "from within." Serbian "kamikazes" had already been "installed"  in the above-mentioned areas and were only awaiting instructions  from Pale, the general concluded!    Because of his generals' "idiotic and irresponsible"  statements, as he called them, Karadzic suffered a great deal of  unpleasantness. On 17 May 1993 he was forced to refute Mladic  publicly. He said that the general "reacted emotionally when he  stated that he would bomb London and Washington, and that he was  not authorized for anything like that."    After the successfully conducted operation Lukavac-93  (Mladic  would say of it, "it encompassed the area from Gorazde to  Ivan-Selo; its goal was to link Herzegovina with the other areas  of the republic of Srpska and territorially link up the Serbian  people from Kupa and Korana to Timok!"), the general triumphed  again. In July 1993 he sent the Muslims an arrogant message:  "They should not dream that anyone else will protect them. They  will protect themselves if they abandon their weapons! If they  give them up, they can live in the territories that we leave  them. Even that is a lot for them.... It is up to Alija and  those who advise him to think about what they will do. I have  left Sarajevo for last!"    In all of his statements, in any case, almost every inch of  Bosnia-Herzegovina is originally Serbian! In February 1994 he  would also utter this judgment regarding Srebrenica: "It has  been a big Islamic and Turkish stronghold since their arrival in  this region.... That settlement was erected on Serbian land, and  so by the rule of inheritance (!), it does not belong to them  (the Muslims), even though they were the majority population  there.... If it had not been for the interference of the  international community, they would have paid the price for  everything that they have done to the Serbian people until  now.... The Srebrenica Turks committed the biggest crimes  against the Serbian people in the suppression of the rebellion  against the Turkish governor!" Or: "We had very strong clashes  for the village of Osmace," Mladic recalled on the same  occasion. "It was a large Muslim village in which no Serb had  ever set foot until we liberated it."    Mladic was able to say of the Serbian, Croatian, and Muslim  mothers who protested against his hatred, sadism, and wartime  madness and those of all the others, as well as of the  organizers of antiwar demonstrations: "During that time (from  1991 to 1993--author's note) a terrible destructive movement  developed... attempting to embody some sort of love movements,  mothers' movements... They were allegedly some sort of  conscience of the Serbian people.... They are well-rehearsed  quasipolitical animals" (!).  <H5>  Warlord Stepa's Cap </H5>   Generals, whose political outlooks as a rule are very  limited, who rely in every matter primarily upon military force  and power, often try to interfere in politics and to have the  main say in it. Such people usually hang up their epaulets very  soon. Political history is full of such examples, but the  freshest ones are precisely those which have to do with the  fates of some of the generals in the UN forces on the territory  of the former Yugoslavia. Will Ratko Mladic also suffer that  fate?    Radovan Karadzic, we would say, did not completely succeed  in  curbing Mladic from publicly stating his own views on the war in  Bosnia and talking about its cases very frequently.    Two statements which are, to put it mildly, unusual, are  associated with his first (and probably last) official visit to  Geneva: "During my visit to Geneva," Mladic said, "I watched  various West European TV channels. They have a very controlled  system. In the first part of their news broadcasts, they give  everything that is wonderful in their country.... And poverty in  the West is even worse, but they do not show it. The West has  realized that the human brain has limited capacity and so it  moulds it like well-mixed dough."    The general's second statement has to do with his "concern"  about the fate of the world: "During my visit to Geneva, in the  negotiations, I noticed (!) great concern among ordinary people  over what is happening in our country. People are frightened....  The war which happened to us can easily spread to them,  especially if there were some sort of foreign military  intervention in our region."    Finally, let us also say this. General Mladic was also able  to offer these "international guarantees" to the head of an  internationally recognized state (more or less), Alija  Izetbegovic: "What I guarantee (you) is the same thing as when  the Almighty gives you a guarantee."    At one time, when politicians on both sides of the Drina,  and  also many outside this area, assessed that at the given moment  it was advisable--politically, diplomatically, and  militarily--to accept the Vance-Owen plan for Bosnia, because  any subsequent solution could be both worse and more painful for  the Serbs in Bosnia and Yugoslavia, General Mladic was asked (as  we have learned from the well-documented book by Dragoslav  Rancic, Dobric Cosic, a President Without Power) to  be among the first to speak in the Republic of Srpska Assembly,  and to use his prestige to influence the militant delegates to  accept the plan. In contrast, those who know claim, "during his  45-minute speech he advanced the `crowning arguments' and  definitively destroyed all doubts in connection with the fate of  the peace plan." Mladic, they say, personally prevented Republic  of Srpska Assembly deputies from going to Belgrade and  participating in the work of the "all-Serbian parliament" at  which a decision was being made on the same issue.    The extent of Mladic's hotheadedness and willfulness, but  also of his insufficient ability in maters in which the mind  prevails, is very illustratively confirmed by these few  sentences from Cosic: "...The military leadership of the Bosnian  Serbs also bears the responsibility for Herzegovina. They did  not give the people of Herzegovina everything that we sent them.  Mladic even wanted a counteroffensive, which would make the  situation in Herzegovina worse...." Asked what influence he had  over Karadzic and Mladic, Cosic answered, "Modest,  insignificant. Many of my efforts have failed so far. We were  able to reduce some disasters. No war has ever been rationally  conducted, however, including this one. Peace is a vital  interest for us. The longer the war, the more dishonorable the  compromise." How visionary these words of Cosic's were, which  were uttered almost a year ago, is best confirmed by today's  events (February 1994). Mladic, however, wanted war then, as  always before. And he has had it! For how long?    In mid-August 1993, the well-known English reporter Robert  Fox published a lead article in the London Daily Telegraph about  the 30 most dangerous "warlords." "Some of them," Fox said, "see  themselves as saviors of their nations, others are common  gangsters, and yet others are sadistic opportunists...." As many  as 16 well-known international correspondents were involved in  the compilation of Fox's list of "warlords," which also included  five of "ours." One of the places also belonged to General  Mladic:    "Ratko Mladic: based in Pale; territory 65-70 percent of  Bosnia; forces 70,000-100,000 men, plus tanks, artillery, and  aircraft.... The person who decides on war and peace in Bosnia.  A tactical genius, but according to officers who have negotiated  with him, also a madman. One representative of the UN describes  him as a sadist, a psychopath, and an extremely dangerous  individual...."    At one time Vuk Draskovic asked, "Do we really want the  world  to understand us through such politicians and such conduct of  the war? I will not admit that Serbs are the ones who put  Warlord Stepa's cap on their heads and then think that they also  have Warlord Stepa's head under the cap, babbling from TV  screens, `We do not take prisoners, we kill them all!'" Although  I do not care for Mr. Draskovic, I must admit that there is  nothing to add to this.</p>

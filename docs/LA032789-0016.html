			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: LIBRARY GETS LAPLACE PAPERS  </P> <P> The Bancroft Library at UC Berkeley has acquired 25 boxes of scientific and  personal papers that belonged to Pierre Simon Laplace, one of France's top  scientists at the time of the French Revolution. The papers are the literary  remains of a fire at the Laplace home in Normandy in 1925, and historians  believe they should reveal much about the work of Laplace, an astronomer,  mathematician and physicist who is credited with major achievements in  celestial mechanics and probability theory.  </P> <P> UC Berkeley history professor Roger Hahn, who is writing a biography of  Laplace, was largely responsible for arranging the acquisition with a grant  from the Flora Lamson Hewlett Memorial Fund. The papers will be housed at the  Bancroft Library on the Berkeley campus.  </P> <P> Included in the collection, which will be open to scholars, are Laplace's  manuscripts on a wide range of scientific endeavors and personal papers that  could add much to the understanding of that critical period in France's  history. Laplace was a minister under Napoleon Bonaparte and a founder of the  Legion of Honor.  </P></p>

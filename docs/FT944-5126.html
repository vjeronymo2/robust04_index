			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Survey of Thailand (8): 'Our democracy is on trial' - Interview / Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai talks about his aims, hopes and fears MR CHUAN LEEKPAI, the Thai prime minister and Democrat Party leader, has surprised his political allies and enemies alike by surviving at the head of a fragile five-party coalition government for more than two years; if he continues for another two years this would be the first time a democratically-elected government in Thailand - a country notorious for coups d'etat - has completed a full term in office. But some of his critics say Mr Chuan has survived merely by avoiding hard decisions. Recently the coalition's Palang Dharma party fired its cabinet ministers, including the foreign minister, and imposed a new batch of ministers on Mr Chuan. Victor Mallet and Peter Montagnon asked Mr Chuan how he coped with this and other issues. Q: How do you deal with this political system where you are not able freely to choose your own cabinet? What is your style of government? PRIME MINISTER: I know that it's a very difficult system but I think Thailand will have to live with coalition governments for quite some time, so we must try not to make that weakness a limitation on the ability of a coalition government to work and last. I think a democratically elected government has to prove that it can work efficiently, that it can handle the problems of the country quickly without giving in to mob rule or influential groups. From my experience I believe that some governments tend to create excitement for the media and the people to satisfy them in the short term but in the end create more problems for the government. I was determined not to have that happen, which I think is the reason why we were heavily criticised during our first months. As for the reshuffle in the Palang Dharma party that was not something that was the wish of the government; it was to do with the internal problems of the party. And we have a kind of gentleman's agreement that on matters of personnel we would leave it to the judgments of individual parties unless there are very, very good reasons for me to exercise a veto right. Some of these changes will force me to work harder because a lot of the ministers will have to start from the beginning, but it's necessary to keep the administration going and I think that despite the anxiousness of the people in general about these changes we can carry on working together. Q: But the government is criticised for not being decisive enough in tackling problems, such as Bangkok's traffic. What decisions are you taking? The traffic problem is not a new problem. It didn't start with this government and it's a result of past neglect. As for old (mass transit) projects with contracts already signed, we may or may not agree with these projects but we have no other option but to support their implementation, otherwise there will just be more delays and the problem that the government would be breaking the contract. Over the last two years, there are many projects and measures that we are implementing, otherwise the traffic would be much worse than it is today .. We are the first government to focus on the decentralisation of economic activities and therefore help ease the growth of Bangkok. By creating jobs in rural areas we have managed to prevent about 100,000 or 200,000 people from migrating to Bangkok. The decentralisation policy I think will be seen as a success clearly in the next two to three years when the growth of Bangkok will be reduced and factories in Bangkok will be moved out. The decentralisation we're talking about is on all fronts, not just political power but for instance education, financial institutions, these are all going to be decentralised and we will not allow Bangkok to grow the way it's done in the past. Q: What effect will the shortcomings of the education system have on Thailand's competitiveness? During the last two years we've now managed to extend education so that about 92 per cent of primary school leavers in the latest educational year are going on to secondary school. And I believe that although we do have problems it is within our capabilities to upgrade our education system and remain competitive. But there are shortages in some areas, such as engineers and the sciences. We have too many social science graduates. Q: What will Thailand have to offer Thai or foreign investors that can't be found more cheaply in the future in other Asian countries? The fact that companies like Toyota, Honda, Mitsubishi, even Chrysler decided to choose us as a centre for their production shows that they see some advantages. So if the tax system is quite favourable and other factors are comparable, we have an opportunity. We are quite a big market here with 60m people and also with considerable purchasing power, and geographically we are at the centre of the south-east Asian region. And the established market system that we have had for a long time and a democratic form of government will also be contributing factors. The one weakness we may have is that we've never been a colony so we're not very good at foreign languages. Q: How are you tackling the growing gap between rich and poor? It is true that in Thailand and other countries in the region the tax system has failed to catch the rich people. But overall during the last one and a half years the group of people who are the poorest - the farmers - have had their incomes considerably increased. And we have helped the very poorest, that is the landless farmers. We have managed to push our land reform programme. That is the most perceptible change that we have created in rural areas. We're not going as far as these schemes in European countries. We're merely supporting farmers to be able to stand up on their own with the supplementary income; and their children will be absorbed by the growth of the industrial sector so the proportion of people employed in the agricultural sector will be steadily reduced. It's just that those who remain must be able to make a living. We have allocated budget for three years now - 69 per cent of the budget will now go to rural areas. We have to continue the trend of allocation in the budget and because the fiscal position is rather healthy we have some room for manoeuvre for this purpose. We will stick to these priorities and we hope that the next government would then continue and may see results. In any case we will put this objective in the eighth development plan in a way that would, I guess, commit future governments to this course. I think the approach is broadly accepted and there is very little opposition - it just depends on the determination of the people who come in to implement it, because usually the people who form policies are based in Bangkok. Q: At the half-way point, how do you rate your chances of being the first elected government to survive a full four-year term? In a parliamentary system, parliament can always dissolve and there could always be changes. For a coalition government made up of five political parties, I'm satisfied with two years. For the remaining time it's important to support the system. Once the system is widely accepted any future changes will then go according to democratic rules. I can assure you that there will be no extra-constitutional forces leading to the fall of this government - that is what I've been determined to maintain. Q: Some say this would be a good time for you to call an election. Do you think so? I know that generally there are such feelings, but whatever we have we don't have enough money to fight some of the other parties in some areas. So I'm not thinking of dissolution at the moment. I'm trying to think how to fight vote-buying in the future. This problem will get worse. I've been in politics for 25 years and I can see the trend. There is more vote-buying now. Q: Why is that? Isn't Thailand becoming wealthier and more sophisticated? Because there are more businessmen in politics. In the past they used to be lawyers and teachers and these are not people who buy votes. There are more businessmen and some of these people believe money can buy everything so they use the buying system. That is a cause for concern. Q: Have you been able to reduce corruption in general? I'm trying very hard. The majority of the cabinet attach great importance to this but we are worried about officials at lower levels particularly with the budget for rural areas.</p>

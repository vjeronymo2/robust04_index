			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / International Company News: Bugatti to seek market listing in New York Bugatti, the Italian luxury carmaker which owns Lotus of the UK, is to seek a stock market listing in New York this autumn. Bugatti's chairman, Mr Romano Artioli, told international journalists that the company would seek more than Dollars 100m of financing through a US flotation. Bugatti, which is registered in Luxembourg but based near Modena, would float its shares in New York rather than Milan because it was a more sophisticated market, Mr Artioli said. He said Credit Suisse First Boston would advise Bugatti on the sale. The car manufacturer re-launched the Bugatti name last year with production of the fastest sports car in the world and produced 80 cars in 1993. They sell for L460m-L550m (Dollars 272,000-Dollars 325,000). Bugatti is 100 per cent family-owned although it is believed outside finance was needed for the L150bn re-launch. It is not known how much Bugatti paid General Motors for the Lotus group.</p>

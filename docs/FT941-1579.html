			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Reorganised Wace at Pounds 15.9m Wace, the pre-press and specialist printing group, yesterday confirmed that new management had put the business back on an even keel following the sudden departure of its chief executive in 1992. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 15.9m in the year to December 31, compared with losses of Pounds 28.4m caused by substantial property write-downs and restructuring provisions. Turnover grew from Pounds 321m to Pounds 336m. Mr Frans ten Bos, chairman, said: 'While economic prospects remain uncertain, there has been an encouraging start to the year but there is no clear evidence of increased activity in our major markets. However, there are good opportunities to reduce further our cost base and rationalise our businesses.' Wace spent Pounds 3.1m on reorganisation and redundancy and cut the workforce from 5,038 to 4,621, with most jobs being shed in the US. Mr Trevor Grice, chief executive, said Wace had a lot of little business which he had been 'clustering' into larger units. This focusing would continue, although at a less rapid rate. Mr Grice said tighter financial and operational disciplines helped to generate Pounds 23.3m of cash. This, together with the proceeds of a Pounds 6.2m share placement, reduced group borrowings by Pounds 29.5m to Pounds 59.2m. Gearing is still high, at 100 per cent, but Mr Grice said the group had agreed with its bankers that it would be better for shareholders if gearing was reduced by cashflow, rather than a rights issue. The group said that uncertainty resulting from the planned sale of Wace USA at the beginning of the year was largely responsible for its trading profits falling from Pounds 9.02m to Pounds 8.44m. However, once it was announced that the business would remain within Wace, performance had recovered - particularly in the second half. Earnings per share were 11.6p, compared with losses of 44p. A proposed final dividend of 2.5p gives a total of 3.5p (2.25p), a rise of 56 per cent. COMMENT These figures were well received and the shares rose by 4p to 247p - a long way from the 48p they touched at the end of 1992 following the sudden exit of Mr John Clegg. With his successor, Mr Grice, firmly in the saddle, analysts can focus on more traditional questions - when will the advertising cycle turn, and is there a long-term threat to pre-press, as agencies and other customers do more work in-house? Wace is highly geared operationally for any upturn in demand, but that still looks elusive. On forecast profits of Pounds 22m this year, the shares are on a prospective multiple of 17. They have had a good run, but could still have further upside if and when advertising volume improves.</p>

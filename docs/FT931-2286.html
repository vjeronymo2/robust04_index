			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: A problem with deadlines - Business Expansion Schemes / The Budget and You AFTER THE party comes the hangover. The Business Expansion Scheme binged on non-recourse loans in the weeks leading up to the Budget, as they allowed investors to exit from their investments after only six months. But the chancellor's decision to outlaw any loans connected to BES shares, with effect from the midnight before, caught several sponsors unawares. One, BZW, is still unsure of whether it allocated in time for the deadline. Oriel Residences, sponsored by Downing Corporate Finance, and Residences At Bristol, sponsored by Hodgson Martin, had failed to meet the deadline and intends to repay investors' money. The Oriel scheme was relaunched yesterday without a loan option, and will now be known as Oriel Cash-backed. After five years, it will guarantee an exit price of Pounds 1.15 for every Pounds 1 invested now. Investors in the original Oriel company are being invited to vote for the company to be wound up, and their cheques have not been cashed. Yorkshire Flexible, sponsored by Capital for Companies, had raised and allotted Pounds 9m before the Budget deadline. Another Pounds 3m was received on Tuesday, but the cheques were not cashed and investors have the option to withdraw. They would still receive tax relief, but would be unable to accept the loans which were central to the package. Anyone buying BES shares from Budget day onwards is barred from using them as security for any kind of loan. You will not even be able to take out a bank loan with BES shares as security, if those shares were bought on budget day or after. If you invested in the BES and shares were allotted to you before the chancellor's deadline, you can borrow against them without losing tax relief. However, the guidelines for deciding when shares have been allotted are controversial. According to the Inland Revenue, it will not be necessary to receive share certificates by the relevant date. Normally, tax inspectors will decide that shares have been allotted when a shareholder's name has been entered in the register of members, and this can normally be done very quickly using computers. However, this decision is at the discretion of individual tax inspectors, which could lead to confusion - as has happened in the case of BZW, which raised Pounds 25m to finance Barclays repossessions via the Gracechurch BES companies last month. While this mess remains to be tidied up, the rest of the BES industry has returned to schemes which require investors to hold on their shares for five years. These are unaffected by the budget. Schemes now fall into two broad types - those which seek to assure an exit after five years by contracting to pay investors a fixed price, and those which offer no attempt at a guarantee but aim to maximise capital growth. According to the Allenbridge Group, 14 contracted exit schemes were on the market by the end of the week. The strength of the guarantor is vital when assessing these schemes. 'Cash-backed' offers, where a separate sum of money is placed on deposit so that it can reach the contracted exit price after five years, may also be attractive. Allenbridge lists a further 24 assured tenancy companies without any guarantee. As this week's problems have demonstrated, BES investment is not for the uninitiated. Main BES advisers are Allenbridge Group (071 409 1111) and BESt Investment (071 613 0032).</p>

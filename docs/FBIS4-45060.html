			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nadira Foudad: "Neighborhoods Take Charge of </F> Themselves"; first paragraph is L'OPINION introduction]    [Text] Citizen participation in the management of  public affairs through the association movement is a a new  feature in our country.    The citizens have long been accustomed to putting up with  the  rules and practices of the single-party system when it comes to  managing and taking responsibility for social concerns. Under  that system, any initiative outside the official institutions of  the state was not permitted, and the citizens found themselves  subject to all kinds of favorable or unfavorable measures  adopted by the government on the strength of its social  prerogatives. The continuation of that code of management in our  country for more than a quarter of a century is at the origin of  the citizen's lack of concern over any public action not  affecting him directly. Despite that attitude, which has become  an undeniable social reality, the process of setting up  neighborhood committees and rural centers, which was begun  precisely for the purpose of involving the citizens in the  management of public affairs, has had a more or less favorable  impact on the population.    The legislative elections in December 1991 enabled the  members of the former FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] to control  most of the APC's [People's Communal Assemblies] across the  country. As a result of the weakness and deterioration of the  services they were providing, the Ministry of Interior and Local  Communities decided to establish 10,000 neighborhood committees  and rural centers as part of its operation for "citizen  participation in the management of local affairs." That  operation was launched in the form of directives and  instructions issued to local authorities. The purpose is to  involve the citizen in his problems of an administrative or  social nature, examples being sewage, drinking water, repairs to  streets and sidewalks, trash collection, street lighting, the  opening of trails, and the construction of youth centers, as  well as contributions to the embellishment of his neighborhood.  As of now, 2,000 projects and miniprojects are already under way.  <H5>  How To Set Up a Committee </H5>   To set up a committee, residents of the same neighborhood  hold a general meeting and elect 15 people, all of whom are from  that same neighborhood. Those 15 elected individuals then  constitute the neighborhood committee. As elected  representatives, they draw up the minutes of the meeting and  submit them to the DEC [local executive office] for approval and  also so that premises in the neighborhood can be assigned to  them. The committee will manage the neighborhood both  administratively and socially. It will be regarded as the  spokesman for the citizens and as the safeguard for protecting  the property of the citizens and the state.    According to a summary of the statistics submitted by the  various governorates and communes, 3,667 neighborhood committees  and rural centers are planned. The budget made available for  that purpose in 1994 by the Common Fund for Local Communities  (FCCL) totals 500 million dinars [DA].    According to the same summary, the number of communal  coordinating boards totals 630, with 203,986 members. They  represent an estimated population of 3,847,042.    In that regard, 1,500 agreements totaling DA176,367,819 have  been signed nationwide, and 2,023 additional agreements are  under study.    According to a report evaluating the projects submitted by  the departments concerned, it should be noted that in the Alger  Governorate, the operation for "citizen participation in the  management of local affairs" is proceeding satisfactorily.    In that governorate, 17 projects have been targeted. They  are  concerned with the repair and embellishment of green spaces and  playgrounds. The total subsidy granted is on the order of  DA47,888,730 and covers seven agreements signed with  neighborhood committees.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Principal Neighborhood Committees in Algiers                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Neighborhood Committee                |Address                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Casbah                                |11 rue Med Haddad, Bab El Oued        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |El Moustakbel                         |6 rue Staoueli, La Casbah             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |El Khettabi (formerly Pasteur)        |1 rue El Khettabi, Algiers            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Lafarge                               |Rue Amoura Abdelkader, H.

The population represented totals 252,100. Here are some figures  for a number of other governorates:    Bejaia: 126 neighborhood committees approved    Jijel: 170 rural committees approved    Blida: 65 neighborhood centers approved    Bouira: 417 neighborhood committees approved    Tizi-Ouzou: 436 neighborhood committees approved    Setif: 237 neighborhood committees approved    Chlef: 127 rural centers approved    Tlemcen: 339 rural committees approved    Constantine: 222 neighborhood committees approved    Medea: 480 neighborhood committees approved    The reluctance and distrust being displayed here and there  by  certain fringes of the population in response to this operation  are due to a misunderstanding of the nature of the operation's  objectives. In addition, there is reason to point out that in  certain conservative regions--especially in the rural  areas--disinformation is being spread with such intensity that  the operation is perceived as being a new form of social  organization dictated by the government to replace existing  customs and traditions. That interpretation has caused  considerable reluctance among many citizens in those regions.    Apart from the security aspect and the constraints of a  methodological or bureaucratic nature, the impact of the  operation remains considerable. An explanatory guide will be  issued in the near future as appropriate. Later, the  neighborhood committees will be converted into local advisory  councils.</p>

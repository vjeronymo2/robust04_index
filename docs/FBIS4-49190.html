			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 4 May (AFP)--Beijing on Wednesday slammed  as "unacceptable" and "unfair" US threats of retaliation if  China fails to take corrective action over violations of US  patents and copyrights within 60 days. "It is unfair for the  American side, in disregard of the tremendous efforts and  positive progress China has made in protecting intellectual  property rights, to threaten trade retaliation," a Foreign  Ministry spokesman said. "This is unacceptable to the Chinese  side," he added.    U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said in Washington  on  Saturday that China, together with India and Argentina, was one  of the worst violators of U.S. copyrights.    "If a solution to U.S. concerns has not been reached with  these countries within 60 days, or by June 30, they will be  named `priority foreign countries' and investigations of their  practices will be immediately initiated under section 301 of the  Trade Act," Kantor said.    By putting off a decision until June 30, Washington has  effectively separated the copyright issue from the controversy  surrounding renewal of China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) trade  status with the United States.    The decision on MFN, expected by June 3, has been linked to  Beijing improving its human rights record.    While foreign countries welcomed the promulgation in 1991 of  China's first copyright law, many have continued to criticise  the authorities here for turning a bind eye to violations and  failing to extract sufficient compensation in cases that are  brought to court. However, the spokesman stressed that China  had recently taken "major measures" to strengthen enforcement  procedures. "China has already sent investigation teams to look  into specific cases of U.S. concern and have rectified the order  of some enterprises concerned," he said.    Vice Premier Li Lanqing said last month that China would  also  beef up patent protection by issuing a series of amendments to  its 1984 Patent Law in the near future.    A government spokesman said Wednesday that China's top  legislative body -- the standing committee of the National  People's Congress -- would review punishments handed out to  copyright violators in a further bid to curb "rampant"  infringements.    While the 1991 copyright law has improved the situation,  "piracy of books, audio and video tapes, and computer software  has become quite rampant in recent years, in attempts to reap  huge profits," the XINHUA news agency quoted Shen Zhengrong,  National People's Congress spokesman, as saying. "This has  affected China's foreign trade and cultural and scientific  exchanges and cooperation with foreign countries," Shen said,  adding that copyright violators should be severely punished.</p>

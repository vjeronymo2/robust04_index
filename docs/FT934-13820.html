			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Brunei default on debts alleged A GROUP of Labour MPs last night accused the High Commission of Brunei in London of failing to honour debts incurred by sponsored students from the Sultanate. In a motion tabled under parliamentary privilege, the MPs called on the Sultan of Brunei to 'meet the debts owed by his High Commission to landlords and other debts in the United Kingdom'. The MPs, led by Mr Nigel Griffiths (Edinburgh South), said the commission had failed to honour payments owed to the landlords of properties rented by their students. They added that promissory notes issued by the High Commissioner in the name of the Sultan were 'worthless'. The High Commission failed to honour the securities it had given to creditors. The motion said that the High Commissioner had failed to answer correspondance from solicitors and MPs and warned all universities of the 'financial unreliability' of the High Commission.</p>

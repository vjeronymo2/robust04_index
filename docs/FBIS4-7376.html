			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 26 (KCNA) -- The famous work of the  great leader President Kim Il-song "Answers to the Questions  Raised by the Japanese NHK News Coverage Group" was reported by  U.S. papers.    INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE April 19, carrying the answers,  said President Kim Il-song has been leading Korea for nearly  half a century.    The paper quoted President Kim Il-song as saying that the  United States is putting pressure on the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea which has no nuclear weapons on absurd charges  while trying to dismiss with the word "withdrawal" the question  of the nuclear weapons it has actually shipped into South Korea  and that the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula can be solved  only through direct talks between the DPRK and the U.S.    On the same day WASHINGTON POST, reporting a detailed gist  of  the work of the great leader, stressed that President Kim  Il-song is the most veteran head of state in the world.</p>

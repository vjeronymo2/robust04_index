			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Technology: Notepad/notebook with the flip of a lid - Worth Watching A personal word processor with a traditional keyboard and a liquid crystal screen which accepts hand-written script has been launched in Japan by Sharp. The WD-A770 has been designed with a 'swing-top' lid: when the keyboard is used the machine sits open resembling a standard clam-shell notebook machine; when the user wants to write on the notepad the screen is pulled forward and laid on top of the keyboard, screen uppermost. Using a pen the screen is used like a notepad, for creating illustrations or for editing, or highlighting text. Various thicknesses or modes of writing are built into the software. Sharp: Japan, 06 625 3007.</p>

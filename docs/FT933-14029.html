			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Government stops ferry merger BRITAIN'S TWO biggest ferry operators, P&amp;O European Ferries and Stena Sealink, were yesterday refused government permission to merge their cross-Channel services in a bid to fight competition from the Channel tunnel. The two had planned to merge their car ferry services on the Dover to Calais route into a single, high-frequency operation in readiness for the expected opening of the tunnel next summer. Mr Tim Sainsbury, minister of state for industry, said the government was not prepared to contemplate a merger before the tunnel opened because this would reduce competition. He added that a fresh approach to the director-general of fair trading at a later date would be welcome, but he would expect any application to depend on new information such as traffic data. 'I would not expect such information to become available before autumn 1994,' he said. The ferry companies, which face a slump in business on the Dover-Calais route when the Channel tunnel opens, believe their best chance of surviving the competition is to co-ordinate timetables, prices and booking systems and to rationalise capacity on the ferry route. This is the third time since 1989 that the companies have been refused permission to pool their services. They said they were bitterly disappointed at the decision. Mr Sainsbury said yesterday that he would ask the director-general of fair trading if there was scope for restricted collaboration on interchangeable tickets, timetabling or capacity reduction. But Lord Sterling, chairman of P&amp;O, said the decision 'defied rational explanation'.</p>

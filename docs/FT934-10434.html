			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / People: Finance moves George Cracknell has become executive vice-chairman of First National Finance Corporation, the consumer credit group, following the retirement as chief executive of Tom Wrigley. Martin Mays-Smith, the chairman, explains that the group's structure has been changed on Wrigley's retirement in order to give the managements of the two operating subsidiaries, FNB, the consumer finance subsidiary, and FNCB, the commercial lending bank, more room to run their own businesses. In July, FNFC, which had earlier in the year found itself in breach of banking covenants, narrowly avoided collapse by securing a refinancing deal for its Pounds 1.1bn debt owed to 107 international banks. Wrigley had been discussing his retirement for some time, but wanted to stay until the re-financing deal had been agreed; the announcement coincided with the group's financial year end on 31 October. The change of structure exactly suits Cracknell, who had been a non-executive director of the group since February, and expects his new post to take up three to four days a week. Now aged 60, he retired in June from Barclays, where he had been deputy managing director in the banking division, and did not want to take on another 'six day a week' job. He was recommended to Mays-Smith as a non-executive director at the end of last year by Sir John Quinton, the former chairman of Barclays bank. The two organisations go back some way together; Barclays was involved in the rescue of FNFC in the mid-1970s, and Cracknell became a non-executive in succession to Roy Vine, a former vice chairman of Barclays Bank UK, who had been a FNFC director for 11 years. 'He is only quite recently out of the frontline, so he knows his way around,' Mays-Smith says of Cracknell. 'He has a very good reputation, and an up-to-date knowledge of all the banks too, which is quite useful in our current predicament.'</p>

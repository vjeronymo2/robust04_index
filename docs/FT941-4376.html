			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Abbey questions takeover anomaly Sir, The Lex Column ('Abbey National', March 5) raises some important issues about takeovers of building societies by public companies, and the benefits which these could produce for the members, as owners of the society. However, there is a serious obstacle to such acquisitions under the law as it stands. The directors of a building society may reject an approach from a third party without even referring it to their members. Unlike a bid for a public company, where control over whether to accept an offer for their shares lies with shareholders, that third party is not able to gain access to the individual members. Consequently, the members may never know that they could have unlocked the value of their ownership - either at the price originally suggested by the third party or at a higher one subsequently required to win the members' approval. This seems to be an anomaly which sits oddly with current concern that boards should be accountable to the owners of the business. The government is currently considering deregulation proposals which would give building societies additional freedom of action. It should at the same time also consider building society corporate governance issues. Peter G Birch, chief executive, Abbey National, London NW1 6XL</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Voting unlikely to settle problems of the Punjab / A look at prospects for next month's poll A POWERFUL group of people in India argues that the Punjab elections, set for February 19, are not an answer to the troubled state's problems. This opinion is strengthened by the fact that the dominant factions of Akali Dal, the Sikhs' main political party, have decided to boycott the poll. Without the Akalis, elections will be a farce. The Akalis want to be a part of the political process: all their factions have long demanded that democracy should be restored. But fear of the Sikh militants demanding full independence for the state forced the boycott. This month, the militants' underground committee let it be known that it did not recognise the Akalis in the affairs of the religious community and directed them to boycott the poll. Its warning of 'dire consequences' might have amounted to a death sentence. The boycott was promptly announced. Many political parties - with elections at last scheduled after 56 troubled months, to elect 13 members to the New Delhi parliament as well as the state legislature - had wanted to field common candidates in recognition of the impossibility of campaigning freely, intimidation of candidates being a fact of life. This may have been proposed originally by the Congress party in Delhi. But the policy was reversed when the party found itself needing Punjab's 13 MPs to help secure a majority at national level. With the main national parties now fighting each other, a clear outcome appears to be impossible. The political package that the Indian government has in mind for Punjab, therefore, has an uncertain future, at best. It contains the transfer of Chandigarh, the common capital of Punjab and the state of Haryana, to Punjab, and a greater sharing of river waters. However, this over-simplifies the problem by suggesting that the Sikhs will be satisfied with concessions they have long rejected as peripheral. There seems to be no attempt to tackle questions even Sikh moderates consider central, such as an apology for the central government's 1984 storming of the Sikhs' Golden Temple and the prosecution of people involved in the riots that year in which thousands of Sikhs were killed. Moreover, other demands have since emerged, involving security-force excesses and civil-rights abuses. These grievances have been ignored for so long that even moderate Sikhs feel there is something to be said for an independent state. But this, says the national government, cannot be considered. However, nine years of violence cannot be wished away by holding an election. If there were a clear choice between the democratic process and violence - which there is not, since the militants have excluded themselves - the elections would mean something. As it is, the poll is to be held because the national government, after maintaining for 56 months that free and fair elections could not be held, has nothing else to offer. There is no real Punjab policy.</p>

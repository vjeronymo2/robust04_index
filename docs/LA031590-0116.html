			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KOLLEK CITES A LETTER FROM BUSH  </P> <P> Jerusalem's Mayor Teddy Kollek said Wednesday that President Bush has written  to him promising that the United States supports a united Jerusalem.  </P> <P> Jerusalem "must never again be a divided city," Bush wrote in the March 13  letter distributed at a news conference here.  </P> <P> Last week, Bush made a statement apparently lumping East Jerusalem, which  Israel regards as its sovereign territory, with the West Bank, which is under  Israeli military occupation.  </P> <P> Asked at a news conference at the Israeli Embassy whether he believed Bush's  letter canceled the President's earlier statement, Kollek said: "That is my  strong impression."  </P> <P> Bush, however, said in his letter: "It is also our view that the final status  of this most special of cities should be decided by negotiation. . . . There is  thus no intention on our part to focus now on the final status of Jerusalem."  </P></p>

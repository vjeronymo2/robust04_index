			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: First-half reverse for Wallenberg company INVESTOR, the Swedish investment company controlled by the Wallenberg family, reports a SKr2.08bn (Dollars 404.7m) first-half profit (after financial items), which compares with SKr2.64bn for the same period of 1991. The company's share portfolio was valued at SKr22.1bn, of which SKr6.82bn derived from its stake in Astra, Sweden's pharmaceuticals conglomerate and SKr3.65bn from Stora, the largest forestry group in Europe. Investor also announced that Saab-Scania, the Swedish vehicle and aerospace group which it owns outright, achieved an increase in its first-half profits (after financial items) to SKr1.26bn from SKr564m. Net sales fell by 8 per cent over the same period to SKr13.29bn from SKr14.52bn. There was a substantial improvement in the group's order book to SKr22.9bn from SKr12.9bn, mainly due to the orders received for the JAS 39 Gripen fighter aircraft. The return on capital employed rose to 12.1 per cent from 9.4 per cent. Saab-Scania expects second-half results to be lower than for the first half and overall profits for 1992 to be at the same level as last year when the group made SKr1.71bn. The group's prediction is more pessimistic than the one it made in the spring. The group suffered a 25 per cent drop in aircraft sales to SKr1.77bn from SKr2.37bn. The order book increased to SKr22.4bn from SKr11.7bn, of which SKr6.6bn was for civilian aircraft and SKr15.8bn for its military aircraft. Its combitech division experienced a slight decline in orders to SKr1.07bn from SKr1.18bn. Incentive, the Wallenberg dominated engineering based industrial company announced a slight drop in its first-half profits (after financial items and including its associated companies) to SKr654m from SKr671m.</p>

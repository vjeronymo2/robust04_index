			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (9): For more than just farmers / Profile of Credit Agricole Twenty minutes into the conversation, Mr Lucien Douroux, the chairman of Credit Agricole, heaves a sigh of relief as the questioning shifts away from the bank's agricultural loans. 'At last,' he says, raising his hands in a mix of exasperation and delight. Past history and the legacy implied by its name have helped fuel two misconceptions about Credit Agricole, which celebrated its centenary in September: that it is still subsidised by the French government, and predominantly involved in agriculture. As a result, its officials believe it has often been misunderstood - particularly by Anglo-Saxon journalists, but more importantly by potential clients, which some insiders concede may have periodically prejudiced its chances of gaining business outside its traditional sphere of operations. Certainly Credit Agricole stands apart from its competitors in a number of ways - not least the modern headquarters hidden behind the Montparnasse station south of the Seine, in stark contrast to the ornate offices of most of France's other large banks located more centrally around Place de l'Opera. At a time when most French banks are laying emphasis on cutting back on the number of branches, Credit Agricole remains proud of its extensive network: with 8,400 outlets serving 15m personal customers, it is the largest numerically in the country. Like rural English churches, it has some branches which open only on certain days of the week with staff rotating between a succession of centres. It also operates some 10,000 'green points' or banking centres in butchers' and bakers' shops in small villages. Modern art celebrating the furrow in a farmer's field, photos of the countryside liberally illustrating its annual report, and the persistent refusal to change its name - with all its valuable long-standing associations - do nothing to help change its image and reflect its broader portfolio of activities today. There is no doubt that Credit Agricole remains pre-eminent in rural areas and in loans to farmers. Its literature continues to talk about its link to the soil, its roots and its regional strength. It continues to hold about 80 per cent of the market share of farmers' business against its competitors. 'That is a stable percentage, one we intend to retain,' says Mr Douroux. 'It's an activity we know well and where we have a lot of expertise. It is not an easy sector to understand. We have advantages.' Nevertheless, Mr Douroux says that the agricultural sector is becoming increasingly uncertain in the light of reforms to the common agricultural policy and the changing policy of Gatt. Equally, the proportion of the French population that is employed in farming - and their contribution to the economy - is in continuing decline. At the same time, Credit Agricole has come under new competitive pressures. Financial deregulation in the 1980s altered the environment. The bank was privatised in 1988 - converted into an unquoted joint stock company with 10 per cent of the shares held by employees and the remainder by the network of regional banks that make up the co-operative structure. 'We have no state support and no privileges,' says Mr Douroux. 'We are just one bank among others. In the past there was a monopoly and it was right, just as using oil-lamps were right at one stage. But it's over.' It still dominates in providing state-subsidised low interest loans to agriculture - a legacy of the 19th century. But it must now bid in the annual auction against other banks which want the business. On the other hand, it can now function more freely. In the past, tight government controls on credit in general, and on the operation of the bank in particular, restricted its expansion into other areas. It was allowed to provide services to small and medium-sized companies only in 1981, and to larger companies in 1991. Just 5 per cent of its customers are farmers, who represent 15 per cent of outstanding loans. Two-fifths are domestic loans - mainly for mortgages. Small business and local authorities are also important parts of the portfolio. As to the future, Mr Douroux highlights three areas. The first is to improve productivity by reducing costs. The regional banks controlling Credit Agricole are being enlarged and regrouped. Where there were 94 in 1986-87, there are 68 now, and it is estimated that there will be just 35-40 by the turn of the century. Mr Douroux talks of a 'progressive reduction' of costs each year. The second target, he says, is 'to reinforce our basic activities: loans to households, agriculture, local authorities, and small and medium-sized businesses.' Finally, he aims to develop some new markets, primarily in existing areas of strength in other countries where domestic clients are expanding, or in specialist niches such as private banking, capital markets and treasury management. He also wants to extend partnership through buying stakes in and working more closely with other co-operative banks in Europe 'to provide a full array of services,' using local stakes. But he stresses that many banks have made too many mistakes by expanding abroad. 'Our main strength is domestic,' he says. 'We will continue to develop our international network, but not too fast.'</p>

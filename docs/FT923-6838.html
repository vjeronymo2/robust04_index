			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Letter: Clinton's borrowing plans are defensible Sir, Stephen Roach's criticism of prospective Clinton deficits ('Clintonomics: a clear sense of deja vu', August 18) does not look at the alternatives and, hence, misses the point. President Bush is on the verge of catering to the nation's tax phobia by offering further tax cuts without any constructive proposal to work the supply side. For Mr Bush, supply side economics has become tantamount to capital gains tax cuts and, for his rightwing supporters, deficits are the best weapon for strangling big government. Governor Clinton puts social peace and productive potential at the centre of his national strategy. These are investments and, by the precepts of classical public finance, borrowing to invest is perfectly sensible. It would surely make little sense to wind up with an economy that had its accounts balanced but also had more illiteracy, yet poorer skills, more unemployment and more riots such as those in Los Angeles. Mr Bush repeatedly tells Americans that they deserve tax cuts and that he will balance the budget - if only he has a co-operative Congress. After a decade of growing deficits under the Reagan-Bush banner, that is like saying give me flying pigs and I will have an air show. Mr Bush has less claim to credibility on this count than any politician on the globe - certainly far less than Governor Clinton, who understands that the chance for budget balancing was missed in 1988, at full employment, and must be seized at the next best opportunity. Unlike Republicans, he does not believe that taxes will kill America, but that joblessness, illiteracy and disillusion will do so. With deficits to come for many years, whoever is in the White House, the issue is not the deficit but what it will buy. Republicans say deficits are an investment in cutting the size of government: big deficits create and maintain pressure to cut spending, and make for lower taxes now and less government later. In other words, have your cake and eat it. Democrats recognise that someone has been eating America's cake. Unless there is a change of course, America will become unrecognisable.

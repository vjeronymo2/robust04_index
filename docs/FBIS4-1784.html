			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 2 April (AFP)--China's leading dissident  Wei Jingsheng has been detained by police for the second time in  a month while attempting to return to Beijing from the nearby  city of Tianjin, a friend of Wei's said Saturday. Wei's car, in  which he was travelling with his secretary Tong Yi, was stopped  by police Friday afternoon on its way to the capital, the friend  said, adding that Wei was removed from the car and driven away.  [passage omitted]    Wei's secretary, Tong Yi, said Saturday that she "hoped" he  would be released after 24 hours as happened after his previous  detention one month ago. "But it is possible that the police  would renew his detention for another 24 hours," she said,  adding she did not know where the dissident was being held. She  said Wei was detained around 5:00 p.m. (0900 GMT) on the road  from Tianjin to Beijing, about 20 km (12 miles) southeast of the  capital.    Another friend of Wei's confirmed he had received a  telephone  call from him Friday morning, informing him that the dissident  planned to return to Beijing during the day.</p>

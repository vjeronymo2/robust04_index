			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY FINDS WAY TO CASH IN ON RAIDERS  </P> <P> The county Board of Supervisors, while still hoping to woo back the Los Angeles  Raiders, agreed Tuesday to sublease county land for a parking lot that could be  used by Irwindale if that city builds a proposed football stadium as the team's  new home.  </P> <P> Under the plan outlined by Supervisor Pete Schabarum, Irwindale would pay the  county either $400,000 or -- if it is higher -- 14% of the annual gross parking  receipts from Raider games and other events where parking fees are charged.  </P> <P> Irwindale would also agree to provide $10 million over the next decade to  finance the construction of a charro, or Mexican rodeo, facility to be operated  by the county Parks and Recreation Department.  </P> <P> Supervisors said the arrangement would enable the county to benefit financially  if the Raiders should move while leaving them in a position -- if the move  should collapse -- to persuade the team to continuing playing at the Los  Angeles Coliseum.  </P> <P> Board Chairman Ed Edelman cast the dissenting vote. "I for one don't want to  aid them in getting out of the Coliseum," he said.  </P> <P> The proposal is subject to approval by Irwindale officials and the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers, which owns the county-leased land.  </P></p>

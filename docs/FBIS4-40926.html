			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 15, RIA -- [AGENCE] FRANCE PRESSE  reported today, citing Western military sources and an anonymous  representative of the Bosnian Army, two Russian mercenary  pilots, employed by the Serbs, joined the Moslem Bosnian Army.  They landed their Mi-17 helicopters at the headquarters of the  3rd Corps of the Bosnian Army in Zenic, bringing along presents  designed to show their good will, said a Bosnian officer. The  two Russian pilots do not intend to take part in hostilities in  Bosnia. It is the first case when Russians fighting on the side  of the Serbs turned over to Moslems, the agency writes.

			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MATURE TRAVELER: TOYING WITH CHRISTMAS IN VILLAGES OF BAVARIA  </P> <P> "Christmas Customs in Bavaria" is one of six new programs added to the  fall/winter educational tours targeted for the mature traveler by Interhostel.  </P> <P> Scheduled Dec. 4-18, the trip will include stops in Bamberg, Munich and  Garmisch-Partenkirchen, with side trips to Nuremberg and other Bavarian  villages.  </P> <P> A visit to a crib-building school, where Nativity scenes are produced, is set  for Bamberg. In Nuremberg, excursions include trips to toy and candy factories  and the famous Christkindlmarkt.  </P> <P> In addition to visiting the Zugspitze peak in the Wetterstein Mountains of the  Bavarian Alps, King Ludwig's Schloss Linderhof and Oberammergau, Interhostel  will deliver a program of lectures and seminars on the Christmas customs, art,  history and culture of the region.  </P> <P> The tour includes accommodations (first-class hotels with private bath), all  meals, sightseeing and entertainment. Land price is $1,195 per person, based on  sharing a twin-bed room, plus air fare from your home city.  </P> <P> Interhostel's other new fall/winter tours, all highlighted with education,  entertainment and sightseeing, include Nairobi (Oct. 9-25) and Rome (Nov.  1-15). Other Interhostel tours for fall/winter will go to London, Australia,  Fiji and New Zealand.  </P> <P> For more information and reservation information, call (603) 862-1147, Monday  to Friday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. PDT, or write to Interhostel, University of  New Hampshire, 6 Garrison Ave., Durham, N.H. 03824.  </P> <P> Christmas shopping is also the theme of Mexico West Travel Club's Sept.  25-to-Oct. 2 tour to Mexico City, Puebla and Oaxaca. Cost is $625 per person  double, with a $25.50 saving on Mexicana Airlines for those 65 and over.

That's better than the tour's normal $13.50  after the senior discount.  </P> <P> To get the special September-only rate, seniors must have a September Senior  Citizen Discount Coupon. These can be obtained free by calling (818) 777-3771.  </P> <P> Senior group leaders can get them for all tour members and also arrange for  tour groups of 40 or more seniors to be pre-boarded onto tour trams, without  waiting in line.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> Courtyard by Marriott, the new moderately priced chain of the Marriott Corp.,  gives 10% discounts to members of the American Assn. of Retired Persons or  those aged 60 and over.  </P> <P> That's the year-round discount off regular rates, but it's best to check  whether the senior discount is lower than the $39 to $49 weekend rate offered  by many of the 100 or so Courtyards now open. Normal rates are $55 to $85  double.  </P> <P> All Marriott Courtyard hotels have fold-out sofa beds for additional sleeping.  On weekends, up to four people can share a room without additional per-person  charges.  </P> <P> In Las Vegas, the Vagabond Inn says that if you arrive on a Sunday, Monday or  Tuesday and spend two nights, you can get a third night free.

Call (800) 634-6541.  </P> <P> Those Social Security check-stretching seniors might be interested that 184  penny slot machines are still available in Las Vegas. They're in the Union  Plaza, Gold Spike, Western Hotel and Hotel Nevada. And in the Western Hotel  there's a penny progressive that recently paid off $95,172.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> Heading for Seattle? The Warwick Hotel, 4th and Lenora streets, offers those  ages 60 and up a single or double room for $70 (plus tax), including free  parking and a $5 dinner voucher.

Statistics from the General Administration of Customs show  that the total trade volume between China and Japan last year  reached 39.04 billion U.S. dollars.    Hong Kong, the Chinese mainland's biggest trading partner in  1992, now is second on the list, followed by the United States.    The mainland's trade volume with Hong Kong and the United  States last year was 32.54 billion U.S. dollars and 27.65  billion U.S. dollars respectively.    The figure for Sino-U.S. trade in 1993 rose by more than 10  billion U.S. dollars over the preceding year.    The volume of indirect trade between the Chinese mainland  and  Taiwan province rose to 14.39 billion U.S. dollars, placing the  province fourth on the list, one position ahead of Germany.    China's trade ties with Germany developed at a steady pace  and bilateral trade volume last year surpassed 10 billion U.S.  dollars for the first time. Germany is also China's largest  trading partner among the European Economic Community countries.    Although trade volume between China and the Republic of  Korea  (ROK) last year failed to reach 10 billion U.S. dollars as was  expected, ROK still has become China's sixth largest trading  partner, surpassing Russia, which dropped from sixth to seventh  place.    The trade volume between China and ROK last year was 8.22  billion U.S. dollars, some 540 million U.S. dollars more than  the figure for that between China and Russia.    The eighth and the ninth trading partners of the Chinese  mainland in 1993 were still Singapore and Italy, with which  China's trade increased steadily.    Canada, China's tenth largest trade partner in 1992, was  replaced by Britain on the list. Trade between China and  Britain last year was 3.59 billion U.S. dollars.    According to customs statistics, China registered a trade  deficit with all top ten trading partners except for Hong Kong,  the United States and Britain.    The Chinese mainland faced a deficit of 11.47 billion U.S.  dollars last year in its indirect trade with Taiwan province,  while its trade deficit with Japan was 7.47 billion U.S. dollars.    The statistics also show that China enjoyed a favorable  balance of trade with Hong Kong, the United States and Britain.    China's trade surplus with Hong Kong and the United States  last year was 11.58 billion U.S. dollars and 6.27 billion U.S.  dollars respectively.</p>

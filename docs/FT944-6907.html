			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Inquiry looms for Berlusconi Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the embattled Italian prime minister, faces a second turbulent week with an interrogation by Milan magistrates over allegations of corruption against the backdrop of a threatened general strike on Friday. He originally had been expected to be questioned by Milan's anti-corruption magistrates over the weekend; but his lawyer was said to be unwell and the appointment was put back until this week. The delay has permitted the prime minister time to ensure greater secrecy surrounds the encounter, which is likely to take place at a secret location in Milan. Mr Berlusconi was angry at the way news of him being under investigation for corruption while running his Fininvest business empire leaked out last Tuesday. He is now anxious to protect the full secrecy of the interrogation and head off the Milan judiciary's tactic of allowing interrogation extracts to be leaked immediately to the media. Political analysts have warned that, should any compromising information emerge, it would be hard for Mr Berlusconi to sustain his policy of refusing to resign. Mr Berlusconi insisted all last week he had done no wrong while running Fininvest, Italy's second largest private business group. He has accused magistrates of political vendetta. However, the magistrates' move follows recent admissions by Paolo, his younger brother, and by Mr Salvatore Sciascia, the head of Fininvest's tax department, that L330bn (Pounds 132m) was paid between 1989-92 in bribes to officials of the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police, to ensure favourable inspections of company books. The Milan magistrates have hinted they have further evidence up their sleeve. They, too, have admitted in interviews their credibility is at stake. It would be surprising if incriminating evidence against Mr Berlusconi was found but did not leak quickly. But, if the magistrates exercise their usually astute political judgment, such information would be unlikely to be made public until after the issue of Friday's general strike is resolved. This would create too explosive a situation.</p>

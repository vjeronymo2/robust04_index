			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Foo Choy Peng] </F>   [Text] Despite the focus on China's loss-making  enterprises, a survey by management consultants McKinsey and Co  shows that the mainland's top three corporations in the key  industries are as good as Asia's best performers.    "We've done some benchmarking by taking the most relevant  competitors for the Chinese companies," said Trevor MacMurray,  managing director of McKinsey's Hong Kong office. A comparison  in the steel industry, for example, showed that the performance  of the top three Chinese companies matched those of the top  Asian competitors. Mr MacMurray predicted that some Chinese  industrial names would make it big in the international arena in  the next five to 10 years as they pursued aggressive overseas  expansion.    McKinsey, which is working on a pilot project involving four  key state enterprises in Shanghai and backed by the World Bank  has done benchmarking for the energy, telecommunications,  consumer goods and financial industries.    "Again, in the energy sector, the Chinese enterprises have  good technical capability, particularly in exploration and  production," said Mr MacMurray, adding that the problem the  industry faced was the shortage of funds. He predicted that  with the reforms of the state enterprises, China would  ultimately have an industrial structure similar to those  elsewhere, where the market was dominated by multiple players.    At present, there were many state enterprises producing 30  or  40 products to serve a local region rather than focusing on a  few products which they could produce efficiently. The state  enterprise reform meant they would have to run their own  distribution and marketing system, which would force them to  understand the pricing structure of products. Mr MacMurray said  a difficult aspect of the reform was the separation of the  corporations' social obligations. "The social costs can well be  over a third of the total costs of running the business. As you  can imagine, it has a lot of social implications, so it's not  easy."</p>

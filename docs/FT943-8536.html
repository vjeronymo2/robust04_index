			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Suharto seeks to quadruple per capita income Indonesia aims to quadruple per capita income over the next 25 years, through industrial development, President Suharto said yesterday. In a speech to mark Indonesia's 49th independence day he said that to achieve the target (from Dollars 650 per capita income now) gross domestic product growth rates would have to average 7 per cent a yearagainst average annual GDP growth of 6 per cent over the past 25 years. 'The industrial sector has become the prime mover of development,' Mr Suharto said. 'It is industry that becomes the main vehicle for technological development which can eventually lead us to emerge as a modern nation.' A debate continues between thosewho want government to channel more funds into heavy industry and technocrats who argue that many of these industries would find little comparative advantage in Indonesia. President Suharto, who has ruled over Indonesia's 14,000 islands over the past quarter century said reducing poverty would be one of the main future challenges and industrial development would help solve this. Indonesian academics say the growing gap between rich and poor in a country of 190m people, represents one of the biggest threats to political stability. In turn Mr Suharto said political stability was necessary to ensure continuing growth. In a reference to the recent forced closures of three leading political publications, Mr Suharto said that openness did not mean unlimited freedom. 'Even democracy has its rules,' Mr Suharto said. 'Without rules and without their observance, what will emerge is anarchy, not democracy.' In June the government closed two popular weekly magazines, Tempo and Editor, and a weekly tabloid, DeTik, for their reporting on the debates raging between the ruling elite about the acquisition of a fleet of former East German warships. The papers were accused of ex-acerbating the debates by pitting politicians against each other. The president said Indonesia would continue to deregulate its economy and to reduce the bureaucracy. However this 'certainly does not meansetting up a liberal economic system that allows free competition,' he said. Many Indonesian industries remain heavily regulated and protected largely because they are controlled by politically well-connected businessmen.</p>

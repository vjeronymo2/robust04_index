			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Lilley tackles EC on TV ownership THE government is to make a formal complaint to the European Commission over alleged discrimination against British television companies by other EC member nations. The decision follows an appeal by Central Independent Television to Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary. Central argued that whereas under UK legislation an EC company is able to own 100 per cent of a British ITV company in every other EC country there were some restrictions or conditions on foreign ownership of television channels. In France, the Irish Republic, Greece and Spain a British company can only own 25 per cent of a television company. In Portugal, the proportion is 15 per cent and in Belgium and Germany a British company can only own a minority stake. In the Netherlands no foreign ownership of private television companies is allowed. In Denmark and Luxembourg there are conditions on the nationality of directors, although in Italy restrictions take the form of setting a minimum capital requirement of Dollars 260m (Pounds 144m). The DTI has been collecting evidence on the issue with a view to making a formal complaint. 'The UK will be making a complaint to the commission in the near future on the apparent discriminatory provisions in broadcasting legislation of certain other member states,' the DTI says in a letter to Central. The letter, written on behalf of Mr Lilley, adds that the UK is keen to see that any restrictions apply equally to all EC companies without favour to domestic ventures. When the 1990 Broadcasting Act was being drawn up the implications of foreign ownership of British commercial television companies was considered. The Home Office decided that any provisions limiting EC ownership of ITV would breach the Treaty of Rome. From 1994, hostile takeovers of the 16 ITV companies are permitted although the new owner would have to take on existing financial and programme obligations. Central is particularly alarmed that it could be a takeover target for overseas broadcasters without being able to counter-attack. Not only is the Midlands company the second largest in ITV, it retained its franchise unopposed with a bid of just Pounds 2,000 a year and should become one of the most powerful in the ITV network.</p>

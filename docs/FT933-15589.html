			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Murdoch threat to close NY Post MR RUPERT Murdoch, who has been managing the troubled New York Post since March 29 with the aim of eventually buying it, is threatening to close the tabloid tomorrow if he cannot reach agreement by then with its unions on cost-cutting measures. Mr Murdoch's News Corporation is running New York's smallest and raciest tabloid under a deal with the bankruptcy court which controls the Post's fate. The agreement, which runs until the end of August, gives him permission to walk away from the management contract, after a three-day notice period, if he and the paper's 11 unions cannot agree on terms which would make the Post economically viable. On Tuesday, Mr Murdoch gave the court the required three-day notice of intention to end the contract at 4pm on Friday. A spokesman for News Corporation said the Post was losing about Dollars 330,000 (Pounds 220,000) a week and Mr Murdoch had spent some Dollars 8m since he emerged in late March as a potential saviour for the paper. Union officials have said that while they are prepared to make some concessions, Mr Murdoch has been asking for too much. News Corporation's pressure on the unions follows a June 29 ruling by the Federal Communications Commission, the government agency which oversees the media industry, allowing him to own both the Post and a television station in New York. Federal regulations normally forbid ownership of both a paper and TV station in the same market, but Mr Murdoch received a waiver after receiving widespread political support in New York and making clear that he would shut the paper quickly if he did not receive the green light. If he backs out of the management contract, the paper's fate would once more be in the hands of the bankruptcy court, which might be unable to find an alternative buyer. If Mr Murdoch's talks with the unions succeed, he will then have to negotiate precise purchase terms with the court.</p>

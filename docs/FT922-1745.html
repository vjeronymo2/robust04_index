			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: TSB back in black - The Week Ahead TSB, the sixth largest UK banking group, is forecast to make a return to profits when it announces its half year results on Thursday. A year ago, TSB dismayed the markets by unveiling pre-tax losses of Pounds 150m after Hill Samuel, the merchant bank bought by the group in 1988, made a loss of Pounds 319m after bad debt provisions of Pounds 344m. This time around the news from Hill Samuel is still expected to be fairly grim, but reduced provisions and improved profits on the retail side should mean a pre-tax profit for the group of between Pounds 77m and Pounds 100m. This is still way below the Pounds 175m pre-tax in the first half of 1989, but the market is more worried about further bad news than hopeful of a return to good times at TSB. Airtours, the holiday company, is likely to report an interim pre-tax loss of Pounds 7.25m on Tuesday, up from a loss of Pounds 6.2m in the comparable period because of an expansion in the number of holidays on offer. Traditionally, its first-half is always far weaker than its second. On that basis, and notwithstanding any collapse of demand or excessive discounting, the company should make an increased full-year profit of Pounds 36.5m compared with Pounds 27.5m. Three more regional electricity companies are expected to announce bumper profits this week. On Wednesday, London Electricity should report pre-tax profits of around Pounds 145.5m, up 41 per cent on last year's pro forma result. Both Southern Electric and South Wales Electricity results are due on Thursday. Analysts expect an increase of around 50 per cent from Southern, giving pre-tax profit of close to Pounds 160m. South Wales Electricity, the smallest of the 12 companies, is expected to report a comparatively modest rise of just below 30 per cent, giving pre-tax profits of just under Pounds 75m. Three water companies are due to report next week. Wessex Water is likely to show a 17 per cent increase in fiscal 1992 profits to Pounds 77m on Tuesday. Yorkshire Water is forecast for a 10 per cent increase to Pounds 125m on Thursday. Southern Water is pencilled in for a 14 per cent rise to Pounds 111m on Friday.</p>

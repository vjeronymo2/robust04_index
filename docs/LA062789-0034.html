			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRICE SAVERS CHALLENGES PRICE CO. ON OWN TURF;  </P> <P> DISCOUNT WAREHOUSE CHAIN DARES TO GO WHERE NO OTHER RIVALS HAVE GONE BEFORE  </P> <P> With the start of construction last week on a cash-and-carry outlet in Vista,  the Price Savers Warehouse chain has plunged ahead in a market where others in  the discount warehouse industry have so far feared to tread.  </P> <P> When its new store opens in November, Salt Lake City-based Price Savers will  become the first competing chain to challenge San Diego-based Price Co. on its  home turf. The 100,000-square-foot store at California 78 and Emerald Drive,  which will be Price Savers' 15th outlet, should do about $50 million in sales  its first full year of business, company officials said.  </P> <P> Up to now, other major discount warehouse chains, notably Costco Wholesale,  PACE Membership and Sam's Wholesale Clubs, have conceded the San Diego County  market to the four Price Clubs now open in San Diego, San Marcos, Santee and  Chula Vista. Price, which has 42 Price Clubs in all, will open a fifth local  location this summer in Southeast San Diego.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Too Entrenched  </P> <P> Despite the obvious appeal of the county's affluent and fast-growing  population, competing wholesalers viewed Price as too strong and too entrenched  to consider coming in, industry sources said. Price Co. founder Sol Price  originated the discount warehouse concept in San Diego in 1976 and later guided  the chain to its current position of industry leadership.  </P> <P> An example of Price's predominance is that a typical Price Club location  averages more than $110 million in annual sales, twice the average per-store  sales of the best-performing competing chain. And Price is thought to be  particularly strong in San Diego, and thus understandably protective of its  turf, said Ward Lindenmayer, an independent stock analyst from San Francisco  who follows the retail industry.  </P> <P> "Let's face it, there are easier fish to fry that wanting to go right into the  home territory of the oldest and best-managed warehouse firm, particularly in  San Diego, where Price has an established and well-known name," he said.  </P> <P> "It's as if Macy's were to open a department store in downtown Seattle, which  is Nordstrom's home turf," Lindenmayer said. "I guarantee you that Nordstrom  would behave a little differently than they do in other markets, probably  getting more aggressive on pricing and raising their visibility,  advertising-wise, in an effort to protect its turf."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Price Savers is entering the San Diego County market with both  feet. In fact, the membership-only chain is looking to nail down two more  locations over the next year in the central and south parts of the county. The  Vista store will employ about 150 people.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Can't Explain It  </P> <P> "I really can't explain why we are the first" discount chain to challenge Price  in San Diego County, Price Savers chief financial officer Richard Eisinger said  Monday. "We have no inside information, no easy explanation for it."  </P> <P> He declined to comment on the competitive aspects of going up against Price in  San Diego, saying only that its rival is "good, honest competition."  </P> <P> Eisinger said Price Savers chose the Vista location for its high demographics  -- population growth and income levels -- and because the North County coastal  area is without a discount warehouse outlet. The nearest Price Club store to  the Price Savers site is in San Marcos, 5 miles east on California 78.  </P> <P> Membership for both chains is restricted to government employees, business  owners, credit union members and other selected groups.  </P> <P> San Diego is not the first market in which Price Savers has challenged Price  Co. head-on. By opening two stores in the Phoenix area last summer, the chain  became Price's first competitor in that market as well. Eisinger said both  outlets are "doing well."  </P> <P> Reached by telephone Monday, Price Co. Executive Vice President Giles Bateman  declined to comment on Price Savers' entry into the San Diego market.  </P> <P> Closely held Price Savers was a subsidiary of Kroger Co. of Cincinnati, a  supermarket and food processing company, until April, when the company was  bought by five of its top managers, including founder and chief executive  Thomas Grimm, with financing assistance from Goldman Sachs. Kroger retained a  small interest in the chain.  </P> <P> With only 13 outlets now open, Price Savers has grown at a "methodical pace"  relative to other chains, Eisinger said, but still is the fifth-largest  cash-and-carry discount chain -- after Price Co., Costco, PACE and Sam's  Wholesale.  </P> <P> The cautious approach has paid off, he said. Unlike some of its competitors,  Price Savers has been profitable over the past two years. It will book sales of  about $700 million this fiscal year, or about 27% more than 1988, he said.  Sales growth at stores open a year or more will be between 18% and 20% this  year.  </P> <P> The chain obviously has a liking for California. Of its 13 outlets, five are  located in Southern California: Irvine, Montclair, Stanton, South Gate and City  of Industry. Over the next several months, new Price Savers will open in  Roseville and Rancho Cordova, both near Sacramento. The chain plans to grow to  19 outlets in total by the end of next year.  </P> <P> Price Savers is the anchor tenant of the 30-acre Vista Gateway Regional  Shopping Center. At the ground-breaking ceremony Friday, City Manager Morris  Vance said the shopping center as a whole should generate up to $1 million in  tax revenues for Vista by 1992, thanks in large part to Price Savers.  </P> <P> The city offered Price Savers and the shopping center developers favorable  terms on the city-owned land in order to help attract the chain, Vance said.  </P> <P> "Price Savers is going to present Price Club with some good competition," Vance  said. "They lay out their merchandise in a better way. I walked into the Irvine  (Price Savers) store and I could tell where things were."  </P> <P> Still, Kent Rademacher, Price Savers' regional manager based in Stanton, has no  illusions about competing with Price Clubs.  </P> <P> "If you ask your typical San Diegan where the nearest Price Club is, they could  tell you. I doubt if he or she could tell you where the nearest K mart is,"  Rademacher said. "Just like McDonald's is a household word to kids, Price Club  is a household word to business members."  </P> <P> "People are naturally going to ask, 'Why should we shop with you? What's going  to be different?' "  </P></p>

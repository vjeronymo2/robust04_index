			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Buba waits YESTERDAY'S DECISION by the Bundesbank to postpone cutting interest rates is not that significant. None the less, the Bundesbank's gradualism is creating something close to hysteria. It is criticised for strangling the European economy and for acting in ways likely to destroy hopes of European monetary union. These are serious charges. How might the Bundesbank answer them? A part of that answer is that the European economy may be in recession, but overall European inflation is still well above the 2 per cent targetted by the Bundesbank. The case for easing may be strong for Denmark and reasonably so for Belgium, France, Ireland and the Netherlands. But these are regions of an EC economy whose weighted rate of inflation last year was 3.5 per cent. Another part of the answer is that the EC is in a monetary policy limbo. The Bundesbank is Europe's central bank de facto, but de jure it is responsible for Germany alone. It is as if the Federal Reserve were to stabilise prices in Texas. Worse still, the Bundesbank has a vested institutional interest in making the transition to Emu as difficult as possible for the rest of the EC. The fox is in charge of the chicken coop. Little wonder feathers are flying. Yet there is no reason to assume a conspiracy. The conflicts created by the Bundesbank's dual responsibility are inescapable. It would, for example, probably have tightened monetary policy more sharply if it had not had to worry about the European reaction, particularly in the period leading up to the Maastricht negotiations. Had it tightened faster, it might have cut rates more sharply as well. Similarly, every time the Bundesbank is seen to cut rates in response to European political pressure, the longer the wait until the next reduction is likely to be. The most relevant criticism is whether the Bundesbank is using the right economic analysis. In particular, is it taking proper account of the international repercussions of its own decisions? The Bundesbank notes, for example, that some 80 per cent of German bank credit to the non-bank private sector is at long-term interest rates. Since German long- term interest rates have fallen by almost 2 1/2 percentage points since the autumn of 1990, it argues that it should be commended. This argument underplays the international effects of German interest rate decisions. The raising of the German discount rate by three quarters of a percentage point last July was, for example, motivated by concern over the growth of broad money (M3). But its result was to shake the ERM almost to pieces. The consequent exchange rate intervention led to still further growth of German M3. It also led to substantial increases in short-term interest rates in many European countries. The resultant European slowdown helped push German industrial output down by over 4 per cent between last June and January 1993. It is unreasonable to expect the Bundesbank to ease monetary policy faster than needed to achieve monetary stability in Germany. Should that not be fast enough to save the ERM, then it is for politicians to decide whether the way German monetary policy is made should be changed. What can be expected of the Bundesbank, however, is that it take full account of all the consequences of its actions for German price stability. It may now be failing to recognise the strength of the disinflationary forces it has introduced into Germany via the effects of its policies elsewhere in Europe.</p>

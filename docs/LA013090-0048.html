			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: IT'S A ZOO OUT THERE, ESPECIALLY AT GARDEN  </P> <P> With one-tenth of a second to play at Madison Square Garden on Jan. 15, the New  York Knicks' Trent Tucker took an inbounds pass and made a three-point shot  that beat the Chicago Bulls, 109-106. The Bulls protested the game, claiming  the clock was started late.  </P> <P> Will the Bulls' protest be upheld? Said Rod Thorn, NBA vice president of  operations: "I recognize it's impossible to catch a ball with two hands and  shoot it in one-tenth of a second.  </P> <P> "If somebody had thrown a lob pass toward the basket and a player had tipped it  in, that's a horse of a different color. But in this case, the referee should  have taken the bull by the horns and waved off the basket." It is assumed no  pun was intended.  </P> <P> Add Bulls: Michael Turner, a University of Chicago astrophysicist, said of the  controversy: "A lot of things can happen in one-tenth of a second. A star  explodes every tenth of a second in the universe, and light travels at 186,000  miles per second and can circumnavigate the globe. The only thing I can't think  of is a three-point shot with that much time on the clock, unless, of course,  you're playing in New York."  </P> <P> Last add Bulls: The Bulls' Michael Jordan blames the Detroit Pistons' Isiah  Thomas, president of the NBA players' union, for vetoing the proposed  $1-million one-on-one showdown between Jordan and the Lakers' Magic Johnson.  </P> <P> Said Jordan: "I wonder what Isiah's position would be if he were playing Magic.  But, of course, if he were playing Magic, no one would want to see it."  </P> <P> Trivia time: On Jan. 30, 1971, who scored 28 points to lead UCLA to a 74-61  victory over UC Santa Barbara, starting the Bruins' record 88-game winning  streak?  </P> <P> Designing woman: Track star Florence Griffith Joyner attended a news conference  in Indianapolis last week to introduce the uniforms she designed for the  Indiana Pacers. The uniforms are navy blue, yellow and white. Griffith Joyner  favored a Laker look -- a purple dress and gold shoes.  </P> <P> Haskins update: Texas El Paso basketball Coach Don (the Bear) Haskins says he  probably will not return to the bench this season because of a severe case of  laryngitis.  </P> <P> Haskins said his voice has improved recently, but he is fearful of returning  courtside because he tends to yell during games. Assistant Coach Norm  Ellenberger has guided the Miners in Haskins' absence.  </P> <P> Haskins said he watched the Miners lose a road game on television recently. Did  he get excited?  </P> <P> "I even screamed at the TV set," he said.  </P> <P> Oski update: Oski, the University of California mascot who was suspended by the  school after he tossed a two-layer cream cake onto the laps of visiting Oregon  State fans on Jan. 7, has been reinstated.  </P> <P> Kathy Rittler Andrews, spirit coordinator at Cal, said Oski "apologized and  knew he was wrong. He was very upset with the whole situation. (He) wasn't  using common sense."  </P> <P> Grass is greener: How popular is soccer outside the United States? A West  German merchandising company recently reached an agreement with Italia '90  organizers to sell the turf from Rome's Olympic Stadium after the World Cup  final.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Curtis Rowe.  </P> <P> Quotebook: The Kings' Luc Robitaille, on the possibility of playing with the  Pittsburgh Penguins' Mario Lemieux: "A fire hydrant could score 40 goals  playing on Lemieux's line. He is amazing the way he moves the puck. I'd be  all-world on his line." GARR KLUENDER  </P></p>

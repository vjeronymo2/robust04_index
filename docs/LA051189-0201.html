			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 15 PROJECTS NEED NEIGHBORS' OK  </P> <P> The Torrance City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved an interim procedure  that will require 15 Torrance property owners to win approval from their  neighbors before they can begin work to tear down or substantially rebuild  their homes.  </P> <P> The 15 projects were left in limbo last week when the council adopted an  emergency ordinance that limits the floor area of single-family dwellings to  60% of lot area. The projects, which exceed that limit, now cannot proceed  until neighbors either approve plans or fail to comment after being notified by  letter.  </P> <P> If a project is controversial, the matter may be appealed to the City Council,  a process that planning officials said can take several months.  </P> <P> Several property owners objected to the new procedure, but Mayor Katy Geissert  defended the approach. "It's been a tough issue," she said. "There are people  who are really up-tight on both sides. . . . We are honestly trying to be  fair."  </P> <P> The interim procedure will apply only to those 15 projects. Any new proposals  that exceed the 60% limit will be unable to proceed until the city completes a  study on permanent size and height limits for single-family homes.  </P></p>

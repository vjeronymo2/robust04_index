			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dmitriy Volkogonov, advisor to the Russian </F> president on questions of defense, by Yuriy Rubtsov; place and  date not given: "Armed Forces Are a State Institution"]    [Text] [Rubtsov] Dmitriy Antonovich, the immediate reason  for our conversation was the fact that a number of organs of the  mass media put out information on a fundamental reorganization  of our defense department which is allegedly in preparation.  According to these reports, the president "should" assume direct  control over the Armed Forces.... Does this information have  any basis in fact?    [Volkogonov] I was informed that the other day a foreign  radio station had likewise already chimed in with the chorus of  Russian publications. Journalists are phoning in, including  foreigners. They are all asking the same question: Is it true  that in the next few days the Defense Ministry will be  fundamentally reorganized to become a civilian department, with  the General Staff left to deal with the specifically military  issues?    I would like to state definitely that all this is no more  than a rumor. No official decisions on this matter are known to  me personally. What is more, I think that there won't be any.    I think that in principle -- true, this is only my own  personal view -- in three to four years, or five, or maybe by  the turn of the century, the ministry probably will go civilian.  As in all civilized societies it will be made up of civilians,  of various specialists who will deal with political, technical,  financial, economic, and international questions and hand over  both operational and combat issues to a body like the Joint  Chiefs of Staff. But I think that Russia will preserve its  indigenous tradition, continuing to call this body the General  Staff.    Such a division will be of benefit. But it will only become  possible when our society becomes very stable and governable.  It is not right to resort to this kind of reorganization at  present, indeed it is simply dangerous. This is something for  the future.    I would recommend that when all the necessary prerequisites  are in place this should be done gradually, step by step, by  filling the Defense Ministry with civilian specialists and  handing over particular functions to them. Maybe we should  introduce an additional post, that of civilian deputy minister  with responsibility for, say, finances or technical, engineering  or medical questions. Other such steps should be carried out,  but only gradually. Our history shows us that extreme  discontinuity always leads only to confusion, chaos, and to the  people's losing faith.    So I think that the time is not yet right for this major  reorganization of the defense department about which people are  writing and speaking. Society and the Army are not ready for it  yet. I repeat, this is something for the future.    One other thing you have to bear in mind is this. We are  often blamed because the military reforms are proceeding in a  feeble and slow manner, that they are not really visible, so  people claim. You can make a quick sketch of any diagram with  "boxes" representing components of a military system, but this  is not enough for a reform. The crux of the matter is that the  main motive force in reforming the Army is financial, economic,  material. The person who has control over force -- and this is  only possible when, unlike today, the country has a stable  economy -- will be able to carry out a real reform. You see, it  does not in any way come down to combining some organs and  splitting up others and transferring cadres here or there, as  even some military men think. What kind of a reform is that!  You will only get a real reform when, and I repeat, society has  a suitable material and financial impetus.    [Rubtsov] As an advisor to Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, you  clearly know, do you not, what the president's evaluation of the  Defense Ministry is?    [Volkogonov] The Ministry is today in a position to  discharge its obligations normally, and is actually doing so --  this is the president's evaluation in a nutshell. The Army  played an important role in averting a civil war. Although the  Army does, of course, have many problems which should be  resolved. Here gratifying changes can be noted....    [Rubtsov] What do you have in mind?    [Volkogonov] Society has become noticeably more governable  since the well-known events in October. In the last few days I  have spoken to important statesmen, in particular to Yegor  Timurovich Gaydar, and they pick this out as a clear trend. The  vertical structure of executive power has become noticeably  strengthened, and the government's role has increased, as have  those of the president and the executive structures in the  provinces. In time all this will, I think, also be reflected in  the Army in many areas starting with conscription and ending  with material security. Such changes will in turn stimulate the  development of the military reform.    [Rubtsov] Dmitriy Antonovich, how from this viewpoint do you  regard the problem of "the Army and politics."    [Volkogonov] I already had the occasion to express my  opinion on this question prior to the recent elections. Now  that it is known that the election results in a number of  regions, including several military garrisons, turned out to be  -- not to beat about the bush -- discouraging, this topic for  discussion seems particularly topical.    I never could agree that the Army, as one of the state's  most  important instruments, can stand outside politics. Yes, it  should stand outside party politics, but it cannot stand outside  state politics. It should maintain the same course as the  government and president/supreme commander in chief are  steering, a course of security, an official course promoting  military organizational development, reform, and so on.    [Rubtsov] If this matter were completely cleared up, it  would certainly be easier for the military themselves....    [Volkogonov] It would also, of course, be easier for the  commanders and their assistants with responsibility for  education work with personnel. Even so, the fear of breaking  some rule, of overstepping the mark led to people being  abandoned to their fates from a spiritual viewpoint. As a  result quite a few servicemen cast their votes in the election  on the basis of their mood at the time. It would seem that it  is already clear: The idea that "the Army stands outside  politics" was understood in a one-sided, legalistic manner;  however, several leaders continue to cling onto it.    In this connection, I would like to express my own ideas  about the role of the comparatively new organs working with  personnel....    [Rubtsov] Incidentally, the editorial office is receiving  many questions on this....    [Volkogonov] Previously two organs, two institutions  characterized our system: the security organs and commissars.  In the days of Stalin both organs tarnished their own  reputations. I know from my own experience that the commissars  stuck to those ideological aims which drove us up a historical  blind alley. In many respects they are guilty of causing the  present situation in society. I do not absolve myself of  personal responsibility in this matter.    After August 1991 the absolutely correct decision was made  that old-style ideological indoctrination was no longer  thinkable in the Army. But at the same time the conclusion was  reached at the Defense Ministry -- and this has been reflected  in the president's and government's decisions -- that some  organs are nevertheless necessary to specially take on the  education of personnel. I am convinced that the fact that quite  a few former political workers are employed in these organs  should not cast doubt on them.    It would, in my view, be all the more wrong to put these  weak  -- at the moment "feeble" -- organs dealing with personnel  "under the knife" in the light of the results of an  "unsuccessful" poll rating.    We do not have an equivalent for the educational organs, we  are unprepared to do without them, and we have neither the  practice nor the experience of doing so. Some people say that  the Russian Army did without such organs and no harm was done.  But after all, how many decades did it take to make the system  which we had in Russia when the 1917 October Revolution broke  out, to get the necessary experience and practical work under  our belts. And what is happening now? We will just destroy,  eliminate what we have, and this will only lead to a future  weakening of our spiritual potential. We will only achieve one  thing -- we will radically cut down our degree of organizational  influence on the educational processes in the Army.    A few people are attempting to blame only the old political  workers for what has happened. I must say that any attempt to  sow disharmony among officers is not only unconstructive but  also dangerous. There were all different kinds of commanders  and political workers. It is not right to lump them all  together. But it is necessary to sort out each individual case.  If a man fails to do his work properly, fails to "make out," he  should be discharged or found a position commensurate with his  knowledge and experience, or he should be taught, educated.    In my view the personnel organs should, proceeding from  state  policy, undertake the education of servicemen in the spirit of  Russian history, Russian statehood, and the Russian Armed  Forces. They should pay a great deal of attention to morale  problems: military ethics and military valor. They simply must  be at the heart of the work to inculcate the best qualities of  the Russian soldier in our personnel. I consider that it is  precisely these organs which should most of all engage in  patriotic education. We have been called on to revive  democratic patriotism, a patriotism which is not nationalistic  or chauvinistic but democratic, taking into account not only our  own interests but those of other peoples as well.    These organs should, of course, explain state policy, the  supreme commander in chief's policy, and government policy.  With regard to both foreign and domestic affairs, for example  what kinds of reforms are in progress here.    I think that these organs, especially at the highest level,  should take particular care of the subunits involved in the  technology of propaganda. Without this we are deprived of a  modern means of fighting for people's consciences.    These organs will in one form or another be necessary to  promote the new Russian Constitution. You see, it is the  Constitution itself which should, in my view, be the basis of  the moral and legal education of the Russian Army's personnel  today.    What about the cultural organs? We have so many officers'  messes, clubs, libraries, and ensembles; if we let all this go  there will be nobody involved professionally in this area, and  everything will collapse. The claims you hear that only the  commanders will be equal to all this are, in my view,  superficial.    It is just as important to help the Russian Federation Armed  Forces Humanities Academy to determine more quickly its role in  the creation of the necessary psychological climate in the Army  and Navy, and in arming the relevant workers with the most  up-to-date information and methods. Managing the spiritual life  of people in uniform is a complex task.    There must be no vacuum in the area of public consciousness.  Gaps which appear will be filled immediately with anything at  all -- all sorts of national-socialist prejudices and  chauvinist, pseudo-patriotic views. I think it unnecessary to  take a long time to explain what the consequences could be.    The Army is a state institution, and all the transformations  going on in it presuppose a wise, balanced approach and  circumspection.</p>

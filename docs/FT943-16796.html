			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Fuller attacks cross-border trade after flat showing Mr Anthony Fuller, chairman of Fuller Smith &amp; Turner, the west London-based brewer, yesterday reiterated his call for the chancellor to reduce excise duties to combat rapidly-expanding cross-border beer trade. 'Any cut would be passed on to the customer and the Treasury needn't suffer in the long term. 'Imports equate to 9 per cent of total French brewing production; the enormous quantity of beer, legal and illegal, coming into our area from Calais is now equivalent to five breweries of our size starting up in our trading area during the year,' he said. Mr Fuller was speaking as the USM-traded group reported a marginal decline in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 8.26m to Pounds 8.02m, for the 12 months to April 2, on turnover of Pounds 82.5m (Pounds 81.9m). The outcome, prepared under FRS 3 and against 53 weeks last time, was struck after losses of Pounds 306,000 from property sales and masked a slight improvement to a record Pounds 9.23m at the operating level. Mr Michael Turner, managing director, described the performance as 'disappointing'. Tenanted trade volume fell 7 per cent while managed houses showed a 3 per cent dip. Free trade was up 6 per cent, although this growth reflected large national and wholesale accounts; traditional free trade fell 7 per cent. 'Competition hotted up. The big brewers are offering legendary discounts. We need more sanity in the free trade,' Mr Turner said. On a brighter note, exports, which account for 7 per cent of Fuller's own beer sales, jumped 28 per cent following a buoyant showing in the US and the opening of markets in Scandinavia. Capital expenditure amounted to Pounds 7.4m (Pounds 9m) but is anticipated to approach Pounds 12m in the current year. Gearing dropped from 9 per cent to 6 per cent. Earnings per share emerged at 22.93p (23.33p) or 24.19p excluding the exceptional. The final dividend is increased to 5.25p lifting the total to 7.77p.</p>

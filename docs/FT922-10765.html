			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Lloyd's council to discuss help for Names THE COUNCIL of Lloyd's of London, the insurance market's ruling body, will today discuss a plan to help Names worst affected by recent insurance losses. Several hundred Names  - whose assets provide the market's capital base  - face bankruptcy as a result of losses in the 1989 underwriting year. Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, said yesterday that Lloyd's was examining the possibility of providing retrospective help by means of a levy on all Lloyd's Names. But he said today's discussions by the 28 members of the council would be exploratory. 'I don't expect a ready-made decision,' he said. 'There is nothing cast in concrete but I do hope to have a view as to whether anything should happen.' This would be the first time the issue of whether members should help Names 'stranded along the way' has been discussed in the market. Mr Coleridge stressed: 'You can't change the idea of how Lloyd's works in one meeting.' It was likely that any proposal would be widely discussed among agencies, brokers and underwriters on the market and would be submitted to a referendum of Names. A prime purpose of any plan would be the end of litigation affecting Lloyd's. More than 2,000 Names are party to legal actions against their agents or Lloyd's itself. A group representing a number of Names associations  - the Lloyd's Names Associations Working Party  - chaired by Mr Peter Nutting, a member of the Lloyd's Council, says the insurance market must take action to avert 'a major solvency and liquidity crisis'. The group, set up earlier this month, suggests that Lloyd's should obtain more information on the circumstances of those Names who have suffered most. It is putting forward proposals to reduce litigation, rescue Names suffering from catastrophe-reinsurance losses and enable as many Names as possible to continue underwriting. It advocates: A cap on losses retrospective to 1987 or 1988. The cap could be about 30 per cent to 40 per cent of a Name's premium income limit (the amount of capital Names deposit with Lloyd's), according to one leading member of the group. The setting up of a fund to compensate and cap the losses of Names involved in litigation. Payments from the fund would be allocated by mediation. Errors-and-omissions insurers, which cover agencies against the cost of legal awards for negligence, could be asked to contribute to this fund. The creation of a central loan facility of at least Pounds 1bn, from which Names would be allowed to borrow to fund losses. The loans would then be repaid from future profits. The council is also expected to approve regulatory changes needed to pave the way for the introduction of reforms recommended by the Rowland task force last January. But implementation of the reforms, which are designed to improve the efficiency of the market and strengthen the rights of Names, could take longer than originally envisaged. Mr Coleridge said Lloyd's would need to consult a number of regulatory bodies to see how the changes would affect the market's trading position. 'We want to be certain that the whole thing is in order,' he explained. 'We don't want to introduce the reforms and then find we've brought the whole temple down.' The council had been expected to approve a stop-loss scheme which would introduce a market-wide levy to finance the excessive losses of individual Names. It is understood that changes needed for the setting up of members' agents pooling arrangements  - unit-trust type devices allowing Names to spread their trading activities more widely  - may not be in place to allow them to operate next year.</p>

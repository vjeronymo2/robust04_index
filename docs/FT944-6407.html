			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / The country that went out into the cold: Norway's prospects outside the EU A cartoon in the popular newspaper Verdens Gang yesterday morning captured the mood of Norway's defeated pro-European campaigners: As the big ship Europa steams towards the horizon, a rope towing a little dinghy snaps. In the dinghy, a jubilant Norwegian shouts 'Hurrah]' The threat of isolation - of Norway being cast adrift from its Nordic and European neighbours - was supposed to have been the trump card in the attempt of Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Labour party prime minister, to win Monday's referendum on joining the European Union. But the threat fell on too many deaf ears. Twenty-two years after Norway voted against joining the then European Economic Community, the electorate again decided by only a marginally smaller majority - 52.2 per cent this year against 53.4 per cent in 1972 - to go it alone. In many regions, an even bigger majority voted against membership than in 1972. Crucially, Mrs Brundtland failed to deliver a clear Yes in her governing Labour party and lost the women's vote. She failed in her strategy of winning over the vital northern fishing communities through an agreement with Brussels on fish resources endorsed by Mr Jan Henry Olsen, the fisheries minister who previously had been a Euro-sceptic, and by obtaining for Norway the EU fisheries portfolio. Yesterday there was little doubt that the No vote had placed Norway in a more precarious economic and political position than it faced in 1972. This will be all the more difficult for the government to manage now that its domestic political authority has been undermined by the referendum defeat. 'This means that our economy faces new and demanding challenges,' said Mr Sigbjorn Johnsen, the finance minister. 'The situation calls for a continued stable course in economic policy to strengthen confidence in the Norwegian economy.' In the short term, Norway's oil-dependent economy is strong, with growth of 4.5 per cent expected this year. But growth is expected to weaken to under 3 per cent next year. In the longer term, the problems are much deeper. In 1972, the country was entering an oil bonanza that was to make Norway one of Europe's richest countries and its biggest oil producer; now oil revenues are due to fall sharply from 1997 onwards as oil runs out. Natural gas will take up a good deal of the slack, but the country, which relies on oil and gas for 16 per cent of gross domestic product, will have to depend increasingly on its hitherto weak onshore industrial base for employment and government revenues. Manufacturing industry currently accounts for 15 per cent of GDP, considered a minimum level for modern industrialised economies. Norwegian industry, which has its main markets in the EU, has the benefit of the European Economic Area trade accord with the Union. But now that fellow members Austria, Sweden and Finland have elected for full EU membership, the EEA only applies to Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, raising a question mark over the EEA's long-term status. Norway will also stand outside the economic policy-making process in Brussels. Already yesterday, Norway was in the awkward position of being excluded from an EU energy ministers' meeting, despite its predominant position in the energy sector. 'The No we have gotten means that we lose the possibility to be in the place where the important economic framework conditions are made for the development of industry and value creation for Norway. The result will be uncertain jobs, reduced value creation and thereby weakened economic fundamentals for our welfare system,' warned Mr Diderik Schnitler, president of the Confederation of Norwegian Business and Industry. A big fear is that Norway will now lose out on investment. Outside the oil industry, Norway already attracts very little direct foreign investment and foreign oil companies such as Shell, Esso and Mobil are diverting capital to new petroleum provinces which offer better incentives. At the same time, local industrial giants Norsk Hydro, a diversified conglomerate, Kvaerner, the engineering and shipbuilding company, and Hafslund Nycomed, the pharmaceutical specialist, have warned that their tendency to invest overseas over the past decade will be reinforced. Politically, Mrs Brundtland's worst fears have been realised by the No vote. With Norway staying out of the EU while Sweden and Finland join Denmark as members, a split has opened up within the ranks of the four principal Nordic countries. Inevitably, the priority for Denmark, Finland and Sweden now will be to co-ordinate first on EU-related issues. More seriously, Norway as a Nato member bordering Russia will not be able to become a full member of the Western European Union, which is set to become the new pillar of western European security policy. Mrs Brundtland fears that Nato's commitment to Norway's security will be downgraded or at least weakened. Domestically, the No vote has raised a question mark over the future of Mrs Brundtland, who is in her third term as prime minister. Although she has pledged to stay in office, she may in the months to come have to consider retirement after failing to achieve what would have been her crowning triumph. Her government is not under immediate threat, despite being in a minority, thanks to the divisions within the opposition parties. Ms Anne Enger Lahnstein, leader of the main opposition Centre party and the principal winner of the referendum campaign, has made no serious play to unseat the government. But Mrs Brundtland is likely to come under pressure from anti-EU ranks within the Labour party for a cabinet reshuffle to include their leading figures.</p>

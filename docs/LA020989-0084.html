			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH'S CAPITAL GAINS TAX CUT PLAN DETAILED  </P> <P> President Bush, preparing to present his budget to Congress today, will propose  restoring a tax break for capital gains but limiting it to stocks and similar  investments held for at least three years, Administration officials said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> For the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, Bush will project a deficit of about  $98 billion, sources said, slightly higher than the $92.5-billion deficit that  former President Ronald Reagan had projected.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Head Start Funds  </P> <P> Behind the higher deficit is Bush's plan to spend more for education, child  care, environmental protection and the homeless. His budget reportedly includes  more money for the Head Start program for disadvantaged preschoolers and tax  credits to offset some of the costs of adoption and of child care for the  working poor.  </P> <P> The proposed capital-gains tax cut, which would be phased in over several  years, is designed to deliver on one of Bush's strongest campaign promises. It  is aimed at encouraging investors to favor long-term investments over quicker  deals.  </P> <P> But the tax cut is likely to encounter stiff opposition from many Democrats in  Congress, who argue that the revival of a lower capital-gains tax rate would be  a boon to the wealthy and widen the budget deficit.  </P> <P> Bush will respond that his proposal, far from losing tax revenues for the  government, would actually raise about $5 billion next year by encouraging  additional profit-taking. And in subsequent years, aides said, it would produce  extra revenues by contributing to economic growth.  </P> <P> Moreover, Bush is expected to run into roadblocks from lawmakers reluctant to  make significant changes in the tax code so soon after agreeing to the sweeping  1986 tax revision, in which the capital-gains tax break was ended as part of a  package that dramatically lowered overall tax rates.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Called 'Unacceptable'  </P> <P> "At a time when virtually every segment of our country is being asked to  sustain a sacrifice of one form or another," said Senate Budget Committee  Chairman Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.), "it is simply unacceptable to be considering tax  breaks for the very wealthiest segment of the American population."  </P> <P> Under current law, all capital gains are taxed at ordinary income-tax rates,  15% for the majority of taxpayers and 28% or 33% for more affluent individuals.  </P> <P> Bush's plan calls for a 15% tax rate on long-term capital gains for those in  the 28% and 33% tax brackets and a 9% rate for those who pay 15% on their other  income.  </P> <P> To prevent tax-shelter operators from taking advantage of the lower rate, the  Administration would exclude real estate and other assets subject to  depreciation. The plan would also exclude investments in collectibles and  similar items from the tax break.  </P> <P> Bush's plan, if adopted, would be phased in so that investors would not be  discouraged in the early years from taking their profits.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Timetable Not Clear  </P> <P> Although the exact timetable was not clear, investors initially would be  eligible for the lower capital-gains rate on investments that they had held for  just one year. The required holding period would be lengthened in subsequent  years.  </P> <P> As part of its effort to win approval of the plan, the Bush Administration is  expected to argue that lowering the capital-gains tax rate and lengthening the  holding period would discourage politically unpopular corporate takeovers. The  reason is that the tax change would encourage investors to hold their stocks  rather than sell them to corporate raiders.  </P> <P> Bush's budget for fiscal 1990 will include spending of roughly $1.16 trillion,  sources said. The $98-billion deficit, though greater than that proposed by  Reagan on Jan. 9, would still fall under the $100-billion ceiling mandated by  the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.  </P> <P> Bush's spending blueprint would add more than $250 million in education  spending to Reagan's earlier request, sources said, with most of the money  going to the Head Start program.  </P> <P> New tax breaks intended to encourage support of families and to fulfill his  promises to conservative elements of the Republican Party would be added. These  include an additional $1,000 child-care credit for low-income families with  children under the age of 5.  </P> <P> Also expected is a tax deduction of up to $3,000 to help cover the cost of  adoptions, with an emphasis on families that adopt children with special needs.  </P> <P> Budget officials also said that Bush will propose to spend more than Reagan had  planned to clean up nuclear weapons plants. One Administration source agreed  with a report in the New York Times that Bush will ask for $360 million more  than the $1.4 billion Reagan had requested in his final budget for all of the  Energy Department's waste-management programs.  </P> <P> But other aides, questioning the figures, said that the Energy Department  sought only $315 million next year in actual spending on weapons plant cleanup.  Arguing that the department is in no position to double the program so quickly,  they suggested that Bush may intend simply to increase the $315-million  spending plan for fiscal year 1990 to $360 million.  </P></p>

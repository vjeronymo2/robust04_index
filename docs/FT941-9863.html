			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Clinton and Yeltsin 'working together' US President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin yesterday agreed to work together to end the bloodshed in Bosnia, according to Mr Clinton, speaking after a telephone conversation with Mr Yeltsin, Reuter reports from Washington. 'We had a very good talk, and we agreed that we had the same long-term objective, which is achieving a just peace agreement, and the same short-term objective, relieving the shelling of Sarajevo, and we agreed there would be further discussions today at the UN,' Mr Clinton said. However, the United Nations Security Council, which was scheduled to meet on Bosnia late yesterday, postponed its meeting until Monday. The meeting is expected to discuss differing viewpoints, but not to issue any resolutions. Russian parliamentary leaders have bitterly criticised Nato's threat of air strikes in Bosnia. Mr Yeltsin has made no public comment on the ultimatum, but he is clearly under pressure to prevent any use of force against the Serbs, traditional Russian allies.</p>

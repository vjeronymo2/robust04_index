			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Zimbabwe group aims to buy blocked funds A ZIMBABWE tourism company is trying to buy blocked funds from former Zimbabwe residents or foreign companies to finance its equity investment in the Victoria Falls Safari Lodge and timeshare scheme. The company, Glynn's Holdings, has been advertising internationally for sellers of blocked funds who wish to remit their cash immediately, rather than having to wait until the funds, which are held in 4 per cent 12-year or 20-year 'divestment bonds', reach maturity. Glynn's is reported to be seeking sellers of Dollars 10m worth of the bonds, of which there is an estimated Dollars 60m which has been blocked in Zimbabwe by exchange controls over the years. With the Zimbabwe dollar having devalued from 66 US cents when exchange controls were tightened in 1984 to 15 cents today, many holders have been only too happy to sell out.</p>

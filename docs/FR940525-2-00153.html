			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, many of the commentators discussed their views on CSE's preferencing pilot in commenting on the BSE proposal and made certain conclusions about the effects of the BSE's proposal based on the experience with the CSE preferencing pilot. Although the Commission believes the discussion is useful, we note that the CSE differs in market structure and in the details of the preferencing system. Under the CSE's pilot, preferenced dealers have priority over same-priced market maker or professional agency interest entered prior in time when the preferenced dealer is interacting with the public agency market and marketable limit orders that he or she represents as agent. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 50 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Further, the CSE system does not currently provide for exposure for orders that would allow for potential price improvement on incoming orders. Instead, price improvement on the CSE is only possible if the CSE dealer either (1) unilaterally improves the price before sending the cross to the CSE for execution, or (2) voluntarily exposes the improved order to the national consolidated quote system for possible improvement before filling it at the ITS/BBO. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 50 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28866 (February 7, 1991), 56 FR 5854 (February 13, 1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The BSE has attempted to design its proposal to enable customers to receive best execution of their orders while stimulating competition among specialists. As previously stated, the proposal does not alter the auction market principles of priority, parity, and precedence. In addition, limit orders will continue to be executed in accordance with traditional auction market principles. Under the BSE proposal, all limit orders will be represented and executed strictly according to time priority according to the order of their receipt in Beacon, irrespective of which specialist they are sent to. Further, all market and marketable limit orders will continue to receive a 15 second exposure for possible price improvement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 51 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Before an incoming preferenced order is executed against the specialist, Beacon scans its limit order book. If there is a contra-side order on the book, Beacon will match up the two orders and execute without the specialist's participation (unless the specialist opts to improve the price). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 51 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Division of Market Regulation, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Market 2000: An Examination of Current Equity Market Developments, Study V (1994) (``Market 2000 Study''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The BSE proposal also is designed to provide for potential quote competition. The only time the BSE's proposed preferencing feature can force a non-designated specialist with clearly established priority on the BSE floor to yield priority to a preferenced competitor, so that it may trade as principal with the incoming preferenced order, is when (1) the ITS/BBO is greater than the BSE BBO, and (2) there is no contra-side agency order priced equal to or better than the ITS/BBO (i.e., all limit orders at the price have been depleted). The BSE asserts that this will enhance quote competition and, at a minimum, add liquidity at the ITS/BBO. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission recognizes that BSE specialists currently quote at the best ITS price only 5% of the time. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 52 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposal, however, allegedly provides an incentive for specialists desiring to attract order flow to quote more often at the ITS/BBO. If the BSE's assertion is correct in that the specialists will be motivated to compete for priority on the floor, then liquidity could be enhanced at the ITS/BBO. In addition, if the specialists are simultaneously bidding at the same price, the sizes will be aggregated for purposes of disseminating the BSE quote. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 53 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In sum, the proposal potentially could add depth at the ITS/BBO if the BSE specialists begin to quote at the best ITS price more frequently than is the practice today, and thereby improve the overall quality of the BSE market place. Although it is unclear whether the BSE proposal will have this result, the Commission intends to carefully evaluate the effects on the quality of the BSE market from this potential ``quote competition'' and whether the majority of preferenced orders are executed by the affiliated specialist when quoting at less than the ITS/BBO. As indicated above, the Commission expects the BSE to provide sufficient evidence confirming the existence of enhanced quote competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 52 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Conversation between Jack Fitzgerald, Executive Vice President, Bill Lee, Senior Vice President, Karen Aluise, Assistant Vice President, and Ken Meaden, Assistant Vice President, Boston Stock Exchange, and N.

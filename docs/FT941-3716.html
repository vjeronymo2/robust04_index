			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Observer: Corking good time Cabinet ministers are displaying a remarkable lack of candour in some of their parliamentary answers, despite William Waldegrave's assurances last week that MPs are misled only in times of national emergency. Labour MP Roland Boyes has been trying to tease out the inner secrets of the ministerial drinks cupboard. To be specific, how many bottles of whisky, gin, sherry and port have been consumed in ministerial offices - at taxpayers' expense - over the past year. The Treasury's Anthony Nelson, standing in for his beer drinking chancellor, concluded rather pompously that 'disaggregated information of this sort could only be obtained at disproportionate cost'. Could it mean Treasury ministers have guzzled so much of the stuff - while awaiting the green shoots to finally surface - that they're unable to keep count? A similar dead bat was played by Michael Howard at the Home Office. All he would say was that the amount, whatever it was, is included in his department's overall entertainment budget. Education secretary John Patten at least tried to show he has a sense of humour: 'The information at this level of distillation is not readily available.' But Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney general under fire for his part in the Scott inquiry, is clearly in no mood either for jokes or parties at the moment. His answer to Boyes: 'None'.</p>

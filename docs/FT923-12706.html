			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Market confused over level of Russia's base metal exports RUSSIA'S ATTEMPTS to change the way base metals are exported this year have created greater confusion and uncertainty among traders, who have no clear idea about how much metal is being produced and shipped, reports Reuter. The consensus is that exports will be below 1991's record levels, but estimates of totals vary because shipments to the West in the first half of the year have been erratic. Yesterday, Mr Vitaly Shevelyov, deputy director of Raznoimport, said in Moscow that Russian exports of aluminium and nickel were currently 25 per cent down on year-ago levels. 'They could be 25 per cent down - why not? - or I would not be surprised if it was 10 per cent higher,' a physical trader commented. Last year, shipments of Russian aluminium totalled about 800,000 tonnes, while the West bought some 115,000 to 120,000 tonnes of nickel. This year Russia has set a target for its aluminium exports of 615,000 tonnes, while nickel shipments are expected to drop to about 100,000 tonnes. But many traders see a different picture. 'There are infrastructure problems, no money to buy spare parts for plants. Exports could fall by as much as 50 per cent this year to nearer 400,000 tonnes,' one said. A physical metals merchant estimated that only about 40 to 50 per cent of last year's total metal exports will eventually come out. However, Raznoimport's Mr Shevelyov, while giving no figures, said that metals output was the same as last year. Russian marketing officials in London agreed, but said exports might fall. One marketing agency said, 'We (ourselves) expect to export around 100,000 tonnes of aluminium this year, much the same as last year. That includes around 40 per cent of LME 99.7 (per cent purity) metal and other ore grades from 99.5 down to 99 per cent (non-LME).' Mr Stephen Briggs, analyst with Metals and Minerals Research Services, estimated that exports were slightly lower in the first half of this year 'because of the bureaucratic jumbles in January and February . . . But they are likely to be higher in the second half as they need the revenues'. In January, Russia imposed new licensing procedures and export tariffs on base metals, as well as allowing plants and producers to market their own output if they wished. This had mixed results: the tariffs were revised several times, barter increased and many different organisations appeared to market metal and by-pass old centralised agencies. 'The switch to capitalism caused more problems . . . metal and money has simply been lost,' one trader said. A physical merchant added, 'It's very hard to get real deals done. Transportation is a nightmare. You're not having alumina go into the plants and you're not getting metal coming out . . . We are buying aluminium from different people, different organisations and different smelters.' Latest moves by Russia are designed to bring some order into this chaos. From July 1, organisations wishing to export non-ferrous metals have had to register with the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. But traders doubt if this will help.</p>

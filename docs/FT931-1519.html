			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: A&amp;P falls Dollars 189.5m into red GREAT Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, the US supermarket operator in which Germany's Tengelmann group holds a majority stake, yesterday reported a Dollars 189.5m loss after tax in the year to February 27. The loss contrasts with a Dollars 70.7m profit in the previous 12 months, and comes on sales of Dollars 10.5bn, down from Dollars 11.6bn in 1991-92. Much of the deficit is explained by a Dollars 151.2m write-off of A&amp;P's investment in Isoceles, the UK company which bought out Gateway in a leveraged deal, and a Dollars 90.1m charge related to accounting changes. However, even at the operating level, A&amp;P posted sharply lower profits - down from Dollars 203.9m in 1991-92, to Dollars 44.3m last year. In the final quarter of the year, A&amp;P said it saw 'a reversal of the company's previous sales decline, particularly in Canada', and added that it had 'commenced its new financial year with an improving sales and bottom-line performance'. Nevertheless, the company still reported a Dollars 40.1m loss after tax in the final three months, compared with a Dollars 16.1m profit in the same period a year earlier. The operating profit fell to Dollars 18.9m from Dollars 46.4m. Final-quarter sales were Dollars 2.38bn compared with Dollars 2.74bn. A&amp;P shares fell Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 23 3/8.</p>

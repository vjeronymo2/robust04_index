			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi on Interior Ministry, </F> Business Links"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 26 -- It may be possible for two  people to head the Interior Ministry, according to Silvio  Berlusconi, who on Tuesday [26 April] shrugged off growing calls  that he divest from his financial empire.    Berlusconi, who according to all observers will be given a  mandate tomorrow to form a new government, told reporters one  solution to the political wrangling over who will control the  Interior Ministry may be to separate "what concerns local  administrations from the ministry's other competences," adding:  "I think a solution may also be found in this direction."    The Northern League has been clamoring to be given the  Interior Ministry portfolio in a new right-wing government led  by Berlusconi's Forza Italia and presumably including the  neo-Fascist National Alliance; the coalition may also include  right-wing Christian Democrats (renamed Christian Democratic  Center) and the tiny party led by Marco Pannella.    Berlusconi also replied to persistent questioning about his  continuing ownership of the Fininvest Group by saying that "good  sense" should be enough to avoid any conflicts of interest.    "I still do not have a convincing solution but I would say  that the solution probably lies in good sense," he said,  referring to growing calls, especially from the opposition, for  legislation making it impossible for the head of government to  control any part of the media.    Fininvest controls three of the country's most popular  television networks, a major publishing house, advertising,  construction and insurance groups.    According to Berlusconi, a government is "under the eye and  judgment of all every day" and therefore passing judgment on  only one person in that government "would not be logical."    Berlusconi said he believed his "personality" and his "civic  passion" should be sufficient guarantees against conflicts of  interest.    He apparently believes the system does not need improving  and  said, referring to the guarantees his personality and commitment  have to offer: "If it is not possible, then there will be all  the members of government who will be able to judge my every  move, then there is parliament, with its opposition, which has  the task of controlling and watching the action of the  government and of the majority." In addition, he then said,  pointing to the reporters from his own and competing networks,  "there is you, protagonists of information, and there is the  public."    Furthermore, the president may always refuse to sign an act  of parliament, preventing it from going into effect, Berlusconi  said. In other words, "being submitted to a daily and severe  examination by an infinite plurality of subjects is a total  guarantee for a government," he explained.    As for television and radio, Berlusconi said a watchdog body  already exists, with "very precise rules and regulations"  concerning election coverage. As for the businesses themselves,  the only thing to be watched closely, is "illicit earnings,"  which can emerge immediately simply through "criticism."    The likely head of Italy's next government said that placing  his holdings in a blind trust would not be feasible and that all  the other solutions proposed so far, including that of an  ombudsmanship, "are not a good solution."    Berlusconi said forcing him do divest would in effect  sanction a law saying that "whoever is a businessman cannot  govern," and that "taken to its extreme, this could mean that  whoever owns an apartment cannot govern, or that that whoever  owns any company at all cannot govern."    Since "everyone is a holder of interests," according to  Berlusconi's thought, the only thing to be watched is whether  "one's government activities bring illicit gains" through  conflicts of interest. Berlusconi said the entire issue of his  mass media holdings has been "blown out of proportion" by his  political adversaries and that what counts is "the judgment of  voters."</p>

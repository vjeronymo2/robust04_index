			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN TO CHALLENGE U.S. SHIFT IN FSX DEAL  </P> <P> Japan is preparing to ask the Bush Administration to soften its bid to change  the terms of a controversial agreement for joint U.S.-Japanese development of  the new FSX fighter plane, intended to be an advanced version of the American  F-16, U.S. officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The message will be delivered by Japanese Vice Minister of Defense Seiki  Nishihiro, who is flying here today to meet with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney  and Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser.  </P> <P> Despite Nishihiro's sub-Cabinet rank, his visit is intended as a signal of how  much political importance Japan attaches to the FSX deal. He will be traveling  here as the personal envoy of Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.  </P> <P> U.S. officials said that, if the two governments cannot come to agreement on  the terms, Japan probably will seek to fill its defense needs temporarily by  manufacturing more F-15 fighters, which it now co-produces under U.S.  franchise. It then would develop a new fighter on its own.  </P> <P> But the officials said that the rejection would have a major impact on broader  U.S.-Japanese relations. Japan almost certainly would begin viewing the United  States as an unreliable supplier of technology. And the sense of alliance  between the two countries would be undermined, they said.  </P> <P> Approval of the FSX project would mark the first time that the United States  and Japan have joined forces to develop a new military weapons system for  Japan. Critics fear that it also will give Tokyo the technology it needs to  build a civilian aircraft industry to compete with that of the United States.  </P> <P> The developments came as congressional opponents, including several  Republicans, intensified their criticism of the agreement in the face of Bush's  decision to go ahead with the deal, pending some changes in the agreement that  the two sides negotiated last year.  </P> <P> Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), one of the most vocal critics of the  arrangement in recent weeks, called the accord "a bad deal for America and for  American workers." And Sen. Alan J. Dixon (D-Ill.) said he is "disappointed"  that Bush is not scuttling the deal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bush Sure of Congress  </P> <P> Bush Administration officials said that, despite the opposition, the President  still is confident that Congress will not overturn the FSX deal.  </P> <P> The Administration says it plans to formally notify Capitol Hill of the accord  as soon as Japan has agreed to the proposed changes. The two houses would have  30 days to express disapproval, either by resolution or by formal legislation  designed to block the deal.  </P> <P> Bush told the Japanese on Monday that he wants Tokyo to guarantee in advance  that it will allocate a major part of the eventual production work on the new  FSX -- U.S. officials cited a minimum of 40% of the total -- to American firms  and workers.  </P> <P> And he wants the accord to spell out the existing technology that will be used  in the project so that the United States can better claim access to new spinoff  advances developed by the joint project.  </P> <P> Earlier, Kichiro Tazawa, head of Japan's defense agency, said after a Cabinet  meeting in Tokyo that the United States should "respect the joint-development  memoranda of understanding" that the two sides developed after 18 months of  negotiations.  </P> <P> The original accord "is not something that should be changed, and we want to  ensure that it is not changed," Tazawa said.  </P> <P> U.S. officials said that rejection of the FSX would probably benefit some  American companies, such as New York's Grumman Corp. and Calabasas-based  Lockheed Corp., which would probably obtain some contracts if Japan decides to  go it alone on its own fighter.  </P> <P> But they said that the total U.S. share in such a case would be nowhere near  the 40% that American firms such as General Dynamics Corp. of St. Louis already  are guaranteed during the development of the FSX fighter.  </P></p>

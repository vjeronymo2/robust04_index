			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Company News: Unisys surprises with net income of Dollars 48.3m UNISYS, the long-struggling US computer manufacturer, yesterday reported much better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, boosting hopes for a successful turnround after years of heavy losses. Many analysts had projected a loss for the quarter but the company unveiled net income of Dollars 48.3m, or 11 cents a share. In the same period last year Unisys recorded net losses of Dollars 98.2m, or 79 cents. The result was the second consecutive quarterly gain for the company, which last year reduced its workforce by 10,000 and consolidated operations in an effort to return to profit-ability. First-quarter revenue slipped to Dollars 2.01bn, compared with Dollars 2.06bn in the year-earlier quarter. However, the company pointed out that revenue had increased slightly after the elimination of first-quarter 1991 revenue of Dollars 62m from its Timeplex subsidiary, which the group had sold last June. 'We are very pleased with a solid first quarter which exceeded plans in all key areas. The results are a clear indication that our turnaround actions and product and marketing programmes are on track,' said Mr James Unruh, chairman and chief executive.</p>

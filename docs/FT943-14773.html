			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Engineering board retained to 1998 The Engineering Construction Industry Training Board is to be retained after an extensive review, the government announced last night. It is to be reconstituted until the end of March 1998. The government said company and workers' representatives had 'made it clear that without the collective funding made possible by having a statutory training body the industry would be unlikely to satisfy its future skill needs'.</p>

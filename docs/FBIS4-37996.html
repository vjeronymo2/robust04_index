			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 25 (AFP) -- A night-time calm over  the city of Aden was shattered early Saturday [25 June] when  northern troops attacked a suburb, wounding 12 civilians, and a  southern soldier was killed in fierce frontline fighting.    Northern rocket and shell attacks stopped late Friday  bringing an uneasy calm to the battered city after a day in  which 14 civilians died and 42 were wounded, hospital officials  said.    But the brief lull in the north's siege ended when the  northern suburb of Dar-Sa'd, close to the frontline, came under  attack early Saturday. All 12 casualties came from the  district, hospital officials said.    One soldier was killed and seven others wounded in fighting  at Bi'r Ahmad, about 15 kilometres (nine miles) northwest of  Aden, where northern troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih were reported to be advancing on Friday.    They had taken the school in the middle of Bi'r Ahmad Friday  after occupying the entrance to the village on Thursday.    Southern reinforcements were sent Friday to Bi'r Ahmad to  try  to stop the northern advance which threatens to cut off Aden  from its refinery at Little Aden, 15 kilometres (nine miles)  away, and the power station at Hiswah, 10 kilometres (six miles)  away.    A southern military spokesman said in Aden late Friday that  the north "was continuing its desperate attempt to advance on  Aden," adding they had "suffered hundreds of dead and wounded  and lost 12 assault tanks."    UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali blamed the north on  Friday for the bombing of Aden and called on Sanaa leaders to  declare an immediate ceasefire.    Southern leaders have said that 376 civilians have been  killed in Aden and the surrounding area since June 11 and 861  wounded, in a toll obtained Friday by AFP.    Fighting between Salih's men and those loyal to his southern  rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid broke out on May 5, ending a four year  uneasy union between the former tribal, conservative North Yemen  and the Marxist South.</p>

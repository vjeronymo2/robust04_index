Applicability and Principle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.1&blank;Applicability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.1.1&blank;This specification contains requirements for the design, performance, and installation of instruments for continuous opacity monitoring systems (COMS's) and data computation procedures for evaluating the acceptability of a COMS. Certain design requirements and test procedures, established in this specification, may not apply to all instrument designs proposed for installation after the effective date of these specifications. In such instances, approval for the use of alternative design requirements and test procedures shall be obtained from the Administrator prior to a demonstration of conformance with these specifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.1.2&blank;Performance Specification 1 (PS&hyph;1) applies to COMS's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installed on or after the effective date which is the date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgation of these specifications. The COMS's installed prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the effective date are required to comply with the provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and requirements of PS&hyph;1 as promulgated on March 30, 1983  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (48 FR 13322).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.1.3&blank;A COMS installed before the effective date of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications need not be re-tested to demonstrate compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with these PS's unless specifically required by regulatory action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other than the promulgation of PS&hyph;1. If a COMS installed prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the effective date is replaced or relocated, this PS&hyph;1 shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply to the COMS replacement or as relocated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.2&blank;Principle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.2.1&blank;The opacity of particulate matter in stack emissions is continuously monitored and corrected to a stack exit pathlength by a measurement system, based upon the principle of transmissometry. Light, having specific spectral characteristics, is projected from a lamp through the effluent in the stack or duct, and the intensity of the projected light is measured by a sensor. The projected light is attenuated because of absorption and scatter by the particulate matter in the effluent; the percentage of visible light energy attenuated is defined as the opacity of the emission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.2.2&blank;This specification establishes specific design, performance, and installation criteria for the COMS. Prior to installation, source owners and operators must provide verification that the COMS has met the design specifications. Prior to installation, it is recommended that the COMS installation location be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory authority. Then, the owner and operator calibrates, installs, and operates the COMS for a specified test period. During this specified test period, the COMS is further evaluated to determine conformance with PS&hyph;1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 2.1&blank;Angle of Projection (AOP). The angle that contains all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the radiation projected from the lamp assembly of the analyzer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at a level of greater than 2.5 percent of the peak illuminance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.2&blank;Angle of View (AOV). The angle that contains all of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the radiation detected by the photodetector assembly of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyzer at a level greater than 2.5 percent of the peak detector  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.3&blank;Calibration Drift (CD). The difference in the COMS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> output readings from the upscale calibration value after a stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of normal continuous operation during which no unscheduled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance, repair, or adjustment took place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.4&blank;Calibration Error. The difference between the opacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> values indicated by the COMS and the known values of a series of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calibration attenuators (filters or screens).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.5&blank;Centroid Area.

Dozens of mortally dangerous diseases hide  in its folds. The first victims are generally overpopulated  cities. Knowing this, Moscow's public health physicians have  sounded the alarm. Several days ago under pressure from them,  the capital's mayoralty allocated an emergency 37 million rubles  to the city center of the Russian Federation State Committee for  Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight. Can the risk of mass  epidemics be bought up for this price?  <H5>  Little Boy Nicknamed Louse-Ridden </H5>   I am well acquainted with a family that has been in a state  of panic for a week now. The papa and mama are from families of  physicians; flies are not allowed to fly in their home. They  recently experienced what they perceived as a family scandal if  not tragedy: The school nurse discovered lice in their  9-year-old son. The little boy was immediately nicknamed  Louse-ridden, and suffering from the ridicule of his classmates,  he flatly refused to attend his classes.    His clothing, bed linen, toys -- in a word everything that  could become a breeding ground for lice -- were ``burned'' in a  disinfection chamber. But what should be done with the expensive  soft furniture, the parents agonized. Put it in the disinfection  chamber? It was too large. The alternative was similar -- burn  it.    ``There is the suspicion that our son picked up the lice  when  we were returning by train from our summer vacation,'' said the  child's father. ``Moreover, the body louse is a carrier of  typhus. Thank god, everything turned out all right.''    During the summer migration, up to 3 million persons pass  through Moscow train stations daily. Public health physicians  acknowledge that from there, dangerous diseases are spread  throughout the city.  <H5>  Train Station or Vagrant's Apartment? </H5>   The Kursk train station is, tentatively speaking, divided  into about two equal halves: the cashier's room and the waiting  rooms. Chaos now reigns in the former, where straight rows of  plastic chairs were recently placed. Bundles of travelers'  belongings now tower. After laying down newspapers, they sleep  alongside the newly arrived. Hardly any distance away, under the  stairwell, one vagrant treats another to cologne. In their own  way, they are both reminiscent of exhumed corpses. The sharp  odor of long-unwashed bodies mixed with the aroma of cheap  perfume makes the air 5 meters around them thick like a wet rag.    From time to time, the sweepers chase the people from their  seats with prods and verbal abuse in order to clean the food  scraps and various paper trash from the concrete floor.    Those who were fortunate enough to buy tickets gain access  to  the chairs located in the waiting rooms. Their guard, consisting  of train station workers, is unyielding in front of the  ``unticketed''; however, the vagrants find gaps nevertheless. I  noticed several ragamuffin people covered with scabs staggering  like apparitions between the rows.    On the platform, I approached the crew leader of the train  that just arrived. ``Do passengers complain about the dirt in  the cars often?'' ``It happens. Everybody rides.''`` But where  do you disinfect your bed linen? At the train station's bathing  and delousing centers?'' ``What bathing and delousing centers! I  don't remember when they were operating at train stations...''    At the Kazan train station, security guards from the firm  Pravoporyadok [Law and Order] checking tickets at the entrance  to the train station's buildings are no obstacle for vagrants  because a hole of impressive size was made long ago in the  grating separating the cashier's room from the waiting room.    Only at the Savelovsk train station were there almost no  vagrants.    At the entrance of the Pavelets train station, however, I  stumbled upon a whole line of people who had lost their human  appearance.    As later became clear, the train station's administration  had  given specialists from the international association Physicians  Without Borders one of its rooms. The associates of this  nongovernmental organization had voluntarily taken it upon  themselves to provide all medical, legal, and psychological aid  within their power to Moscow's homeless.  <H5>  What Physicians Without Borders Can Do </H5>   The experience of Physicians Without Borders may be termed  unique. Working in accordance with its own program The Homeless  since November 1992, they have become the only individuals in  the country with the slightest bit of scientific information  about those people that fate has cast to the very bottom of life.    According to the association's estimates, the number of  homeless persons in Moscow may exceed 150,000 (according to  official data, they numbered 30,000 as of January 1992). These  people who are unable to observe elementary hygiene rules (often  through no fault of their own) are becoming potential carriers  of diptheria, cholera, typhus, tuberculosis, and other extremely  dangerous diseases. Social pariahs despised by everyone, they  prefer to not seek help at state medical institutions. And the  services of private physicians are, as is well known, beyond the  means of even citizens with residence permits.    After having worked at the Kursk and Pavelets train stations  for several months, the association specialists accumulated  statistical data about the most characteristic ailments for  vagrants. Half of them suffer from wounds and trophic ulcers,  and a third (all in all) suffer from tuberculosis and pneumonia.  One hundred percent are infested with lice! A total of 2,500  homeless persons were examined.    `` `Ambulance' physicians generally refuse to come for  vagrants because the subsequent disinfection of their ambulance  takes several hours,'' says Aleksey Golikov, associate of the  association. ``We therefore take the most seriously ill to  hospitals in our own two minibuses.''    By agreements reached with six hospitals, Physicians Without  Borders send those under their care there for treatment. In  exchange for the inconveniences, they supply medical personnel  with scarce drugs.    After having been treated, the vagrants are returned to the  train stations -- where else? There they live for years; they  collect empty bottles, panhandle, and engage in petty theft.  Some even raise something similar to a family. A family  consisting of a husband, wife, two children, and the wife's  mother have already been living at one train station for a long  time.    After having returned home, the homeless quickly acquire  their previous bouquet of illnesses. To put it briefly, the  circle is completed.    ``Moscow's government acknowledges that the homeless problem  exists, but its first reaction is to try to drive then from the  train station,'' believe the association specialists. ``But  cutting off vagrants' access to the train stations during the  cold part of the year is sentencing them to certain death.''    Like now, before the onset of the winter cold spells, the  mayoralty is making fitful attempts to keep the risk of an  epidemic to a minimum in a manner contrary to humanitarian  principles. And for this, they have allocated 27 million rubles  that will be used to repair two delousing stations -- on Red  Guard Boulevard and Bauman Street.  <H5>  Purgatory for Outcasts </H5>   Moscow now has a single delousing station equipped with a  powerful disinfection chamber. As a rule, vagrants are sent here.    The shabby building of the disinfection station is located  at  the city's edge. One must travel far to reach it -- first by  subway and then by overcrowded bus.    The disinfection procedure costs money -- about 1,500  rubles.  But vagrants sent by Physicians Without Borders have their  insects removed at the expense of the organization. They are  sent twice weekly -- on Wednesdays and Thursdays. It must be  said that only half of those receiving a referral use it -- an  average of 20 persons each week. Can the bathing and delousing  center really not handle this influx of patients?    ``The point,'' says Grigoriy Ostanin, the center's chief  physician, ``is that in the event an emergency situation  develops in Moscow it is impossible to conduct mass disinfection  of the population. Let us say an outbreak of cholera puts us in  a hopeless situation because medical standards call for a  separate bathing and delousing center for this disease.''    Public health physicians have also been deprived of reserves  such as as municipal baths. Previously, they were equipped with  disinfection chambers and divided into what were called  ``dirty'' and ``clean'' halves. In recent years, nearly all of  the capital's baths have been transformed into commercial saunas.    Disinfection chambers and railroadmen have been managed  similarly. Not one is operating at any of Moscow's train  stations even though in April the municipal commission on  emergency situations demanded that the Moscow railroad  administration renovate them.    ``For this and other reasons,'' states Ostanin, ``the  situation regarding Moscow's sanitary condition may become  critical at any moment in time.''    According to data from the analytical department of the  Russian Federation State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological  Oversight, the number of diptheria patients in the capital more  than doubled during the past year, the number of persons with  scabies and syphilis doubled, and the number of persons with  tuberculosis increased by one third. And the most frightening  thing is that these diseases are more lethal among children than  among adults.    But I nevertheless remain doubtful: Why reconstruct the  bathing and delousing centers if potential disease carriers  prefer to bypass them on account of 7 versts? (Several dozen  vagrants arriving for sanitary treatment weekly is a meager  number compared with the tens of thousands that stubbornly  ignore the procedure). Perhaps all this is being done in the  event of mass epidemics of diptheria, cholera, and typhus? Then  it would seem that this would be directly acknowledged. And it  would become clear that the homeless remain the problem of 12  associates of Physicians Without Borders and the Ministry of  Railways security guards who drive vagrants from the train  station.    In the meantime, typhus, tuberculosis, and cholera are  classified as what are termed ``socially significant  infections,'' and vaccinations against them will not save you.  And then there are the many others who, as doctors confirm, have  weakened immunity because of a decrease in their standard of  living. The unbelievable congestion in public transportation, at  stores, and at train stations and the poor sanitary condition of  the streets increase the likelihood of outbreaks of epidemics.  And in such a situation, vagrants become one of the main risk  factors.    The vagrant problem must obviously become an object of the  most careful attention. A special integrated government program  is needed. But as is well known, the government has more  important concerns.</p>

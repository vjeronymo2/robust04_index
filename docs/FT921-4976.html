			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: Canadian Imperial Bank rises 11% IMPROVED lending margins helped Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce post an 11 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings, in spite of a rise in loan loss provisions. Canada's second biggest bank lifted earnings to CDollars 221m, (USDollars 187.2m) or CDollars 1.01 per share, in the three months to January 31, from CDollars 199m, or 98 cents a share, a year earlier. Return on common equity fell to 13.5 per cent from 14.2 per cent as a result of a large increase in preferred share financing. Return on average assets improved to 0.71 per cent from 0.67 per cent. Net interest income rose to CDollars 922m from CDollars 818m, reflecting a widening in interest rate margins to 3.05 per cent from 2.8 per cent. The protracted domestic recession has led the bank to raise loan loss provisions to CDollars 188m from CDollars 128m. CIBC said it estimated loan losses for the year at CDollars 750m, compared with CDollars 613m in fiscal 1991. Non-performing loans totalled CDollars 2.1bn, up from CDollars 1.9bn three months earlier. Most of the increase was outside Canada. CIBC is the last of Canada's big six banks to report first-quarter earnings. In most cases, lower interest rates have offset higher loan losses to produce an improved bottom line. The Canadian banks continue to boast strong capital positions and relatively attractive returns compared to many of their US counterparts. The strongest first-quarter performance came from Bank of Nova Scotia, which lifted net earnings by 24 per cent. Toronto-Dominion Bank, which was the most highly-regarded Canadian bank throughout the 1980s, has been hit by its heavy exposure to Ontario and Quebec, and by a number of soured international ventures. TD's first-quarter earnings dipped by 9 per cent.</p>

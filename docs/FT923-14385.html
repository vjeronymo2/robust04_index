			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Securiguard ahead 20% HELPED BY a substantial cut in interest charges, Securiguard Group raised interim pre-tax profits by 20 per cent. Turnover in the 28 weeks to May 17 moved up to Pounds 88.8m (Pounds 84.9m) but trading profit fell to Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 3.77m). Interest took Pounds 792,000 (Pounds 1.32m) to leave the pre-tax balance at Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 2.16m after an exceptional charge of Pounds 287,000). Mr Alan Baldwin, chairman, said the continuing focus on credit control and cash collection contributed to the interest savings and that progress was expected to be maintained in the second half. In the UK, the security division's results were down on last year's outcome which was temporarily boosted by the Gulf crisis. Indications were that it would achieve second half profits similar to last time. Cleaning and maintenance lifted profits 16 per cent from turnover up 6 per cent; the communications side had mixed trading and personnel services reduced losses significantly. Earnings per share rose to 8.6p (7.2p) and the interim dividend goes up to 3.5p (3.2p).</p>

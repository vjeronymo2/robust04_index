			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar slips in wake of rate cut THE DOLLAR again slipped on the foreign exchanges yesterday, undermined by last week's half a percentage point cut in US interest rates and uncertainty over the US economy, writes James Blitz. On a day with no important indicators emerging from the US, the tone of dollar trading was set by last Thursday's cut in US interest rates. Many dealers wonder whether the US is entering a triple dip recession after the fourth consecutive month of declining housing starts and rising unemployment. The dollar ended the day at DM1.5130 down from a previous close of DM1.5170. There is every reason to think that the dollar could now test its low of DM1.4405, last seen in February 1991. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi International in London, believes that dollar depreciation could even be part of the US authorities' strategy, aimed at boosting export growth. He said that the room for manoeuvre in US fiscal policy is now limited by the Dollars 400bn budget deficit, while monetary policy is also hampered by the fact that interest rates are at their lowest point for 29 years. 'The only other instrument the US authorities have to hand is exchange rates,' he says. The D-Mark remained strong in European trading, despite suggestions that Germany will come under heavy pressure at this week's G7 meeting in Munich to reduce interest rates. Mr Nicholar Brady, the US Treasury Secretary, recently said that he would welcome a cut in German and Japanese rates and that Germany's recent moves on fiscal policy make this a more likely prospect. However, dealers remained sceptical that Germany will yield, and the D-Mark ended up against the French Franc at DM29.68 per 100 Francs from a previous close of DM29.70. It was helped by continuing turmoil created by the French lorry drivers' dispute. Sterling suffered more, dropping half a pfennig to DM2.8900. The lira fared better, supported by the latest rise in Italian interest rates. It closed at L756.10 to the D-Mark from a close on Friday night of L757.50. Sterling's already weak position was further undermined after the Bank of Portugal gave a clear signal yesterday that Portuguese interest rates will start to fall. The Bank cut the remuneration rate on bank's obligatory deposits with the central bank from 15.375 per cent to 14.5 per cent. Because the Portuguese escudo is the strongest currency in the European Monetary System's grid, its reduction in rates will lower the effective floor to which sterling, the weakest currency, can fall before central banks must intervene.</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Bond storm falls on UK 'The role of the central bank is to think - indeed worry - about inflation before ordinary people start talking about it.' These words were delivered by Professor Mervyn King, chief economist of the Bank of England, in a lecture to the Institute for Fiscal Studies this week. His remark has two important implications: first, that if a central bank (or finance ministry) is not prepared to court unpopularity during a recovery, it is shirking its responsibilities; second, that ordinary people should worry about the possibility of higher short-term rates of interest before they hear their friends talking about inflation. In the UK, the time to start thinking about what higher base rates might mean is now. The immediate background is what a Hollywood producer might call the bloodbath on Lombard Street. Since just before the quarter point increase in the short-term rate of interest, announced by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, back in early February, bond markets have tumbled everywhere. The prices of 10-year bonds have fallen 11 per cent in France, 9 in Italy, 8 in the US and Germany and even 4 per cent in Japan. Yet nowhere in the group of seven industrial countries, except for Canada, have bonds been battered as brutally as in the UK. The prices of 10-year gilts have fallen 15 per cent, while yields have gone from a reasonably cheap 6.4 per cent, to an expensive 8.5 per cent, in these four months. Moreover, the decline in gilts has been accompanied by an almost identical proportionate decline in the FTSE-100, a greater fall than in the other G7 economies. Speculative positions Mr Greenspan was the matador who slew the bond market bull. He did so by triggering a global margin call on speculators. While the unwinding of speculative positions is, no doubt, the immediate cause for the correction, more fundamental reasons can also be identified. These include faster than expected growth in the US, economy, signs of recovery in continental Europe, rising commodity prices (though from historically very low levels) and relatively rapid monetary growth in several economies, notably Germany. The most important implication is that no compelling reason can be found for expecting markets to regain what they have lost, at least in the near future. Before February, bond prices were being pushed up by the prospect of early capital gains. Now prices are being held up mainly by investors looking for yield. Unfortunately for borrowers, their desired yields are painfully high. Against current rates of inflation, real yields run from some 3 per cent in Japan to 6 per cent in the UK, presumably because investors have rather greater confidence that current rates of inflation will last in Japan. Italy and Canada alone have higher nominal yields than the UK. Confidence gained The latter's poor reputation is hardly surprising. As Professor King notes, over the past quarter of a century, inflation in the UK has averaged 9 per cent a year. Now, judged by the gap between the yield on index-linked and on conventional gilts, expected inflation is half that level. This is a striking measure of confidence gained. But it is also a measure of how far confidence falls short of the government's target of 1-2 1/2 per cent inflation 'by the end of this parliament'. Since its trough in January the yield on index-linked gilts has risen by just over one percentage point, to 3.9 per cent, while the yield on 10-year conventional gilts has risen by a little over 2 percentage points. Thus, perhaps half of the total increase is due to higher real rates of interest, presumably caused by prospects for improved global growth, while half is due to what might be called an increased inflation premium. The question is what the particularly adverse shift in the UK bond market means for British government policy. It means, first of all, that the UK government lacks credibility more than do most other G7 countries. This is worrying enough in itself and particularly worrying for such a large borrower. One implication is that the government needs to borrow as much as possible in inflation-hedged instruments, such as index-linked gilts. It means, still more, that the government has to err on the side of caution. Narrow money is growing at more than 7 per cent a year. The tax increases do not seem to have halted the growth in domestic demand, though higher long-term interest rates will themselves have a deflationary effect, notably on housing. The economy is growing at just a little above its probable long-run potential, about as fast as the authorities can permit. Whatever one's view of the economy's potential output, experience in the second half of the 1980s demonstrates the inflationary costs of converging upon it too quickly. The conclusion is simple: the next shift in base rate must be up. The question is not if, but when. The answer is sooner rather than later.</p>

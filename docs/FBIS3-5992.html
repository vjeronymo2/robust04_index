The radical group had the world's reluctant  backing and while Bangkok was aware of the Mao-inspired madness  that had gripped Cambodia over the previous three years, the  decision to help the group was justifiable in the service of  Thailand's national interest. [passage omitted]    The Khmer Rouge which boycotted the election continues to  wage war against the internationally-recognized government in  Phnom Penh and most of the world still believes they are  receiving support from venal Thai generals. [passage omitted]    Part of Thailand's image problem stems from the way the  international press covered the Cambodian election. While the  Khmer Rouge were belligerent and uncooperative, refusing to take  part in the election, massacring ethnic Vietnamese and holding  UN officials hostage, they were for the most part a sideshow.  The real story was the murderous war the Cambodian People's  Party was waging against Funcinpec. Nevertheless, foreign  audiences, who for the most part had been introduced to the  Cambodia tragedy by the 1984 movie "The Killing Fields", seemed  to only want to know about the Khmer Rouge.    The result was acutely embarrassing for Thailand. The  military's support for the Khmer Rouge, which had been an open  secret in Southeast Asia for more than 10 years, was dredged up  and examined for international consumption. The close business  links, the Khmer Rouge safe houses, border sanctuaries, the  rapacious logging and gem mining operations, it all came out and  did little to support Thai claims that it was working for peace  in Cambodia. [passage omitted]    The issue was rekindled once again on Wednesday when U.S.  Ambassador to Thailand David Lambertson bluntly said Washington  wants "the Khmer Rouge to be cut off." The envoy noted that the  policy of the Thai government was very clear but, citing the  massive arms cache found near the border in December, said the  "implementation of that policy has been less than clear"    Lambertson's comments provoked furious denials from the  Foreign Ministry but it seems unlikely the noises coming out of  Bangkok are going to alter the world's perception of its  relationship with the Khmer Rouge -- at least as long as  well-founded reports continue to come out of Cambodia of cross  border incursions. In the coming days, many observers expect the  Cambodian army to launch a fierce assault on the Khmer Rouge's  main base at Pailin, which sits across the Thai border.    The timber and gem-rich district is the main commercial  center for the rebels. And for many observers it also typifies  the uncomfortably cosy relationship between Thai businessmen,  the Khmer Rouge and Thai military officers who oversee the  border area. Army chief Gen. Wimon Wongwanit has vowed to  repulse any Khmer Rouge intrusions that result from the  offensive if the government gives its approval. His approach is  the correct one. While it is not a Thai fight, the Khmer Rouge  have served their purpose as far as Thailand is concerned. They  refuse to discuss peace and their presence along the border has  resulted in the death and maiming of Thai villagers. Thailand  helped revive the Khmer Rouge once, this time they should be  allowed to perish if that is to be the order of things in  Cambodia.</p>

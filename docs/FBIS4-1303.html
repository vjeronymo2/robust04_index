			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria April 25 SAPA -- About 900 South African  National Defence Force [SANDF] troops will provide a guard of  honour at the inauguration of South Africa's new president in  Pretoria on May 10.    South African Defence Force Chief Commandant-General Georg  Meiring said in Pretoria on Monday the new SANDF would play an  important role in the elections and inauguration of the  president and deputy presidents of the government of national  unity.    The army will co-ordinate the SANDF's participation in the  ceremonies in Cape Town and Pretoria from May 6 to 10.    Troops consisting of members of different forces in the  SANDF  will line the route in Church Street from the Presidency to the  Union Buildings for the inauguration on May 10.    They will wear South African army camouflage uniform,  trimmed  with red and white, and will withdraw as soon as the president  has passed by.    The army will provide a guard of honour at the Union  Buildings. A 21-gun salute will be fired and a South African Air  Force fly-past will honour the new president.    Heads of state and other foreign dignitaries arriving at  Waterkloof Air Force Base in Pretoria will be greeted by Air  Force and Medical Services guards of honour. Dignitaries  arriving at Jan Smuts Airport near Johannesburg will be met by  an army guard of honour.    Gen Meiring said this would be the first large-scale  ceremonial appearance of the SANDF.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General of Aviation Viktor Kot, </F> commander in chief of the Russian Air Force, by Major Sergey  Babichev; date, place not given: "Air Force Acquires New Image.  Colonel General of Aviation Viktor Kot, Commander in Chief of  the Russian Air Force, Discusses Some Results of Last Year's  Combat Training and Aviators' Tasks This Year"]    [Text] [Kot] I will not hide the fact that last year was  a difficult one for us. Not everything was done as we planned  and as we would have liked. Nonetheless there is some cause for  satisfaction. I think that the main task was accomplished: The  combat readiness of the Air Force matches the requirements of  the time.    The High Command focused its main efforts on implementing  the  plan for the organizational development of the Air Force, which  made provision for improving the organizational structure and  the command and control system, and on creating combat ready  aviation groupings on Russia's new borders. A fundamentally new  approach to the use of the Air Force was sought. It was  essential to arrive at a balanced ratio between combat and  support components. To some extent we have achieved this.    [Babichev] It was pointed out when the Defense Ministry  summed up the results of 1993 that flying time had dropped in  the Air Force. What impact has this had on the state of combat  readiness?    [Kot] The country's economic difficulties have affected the  combat readiness of the Air Force and the Armed Forces as a  whole. Irregular supplies of fuel and lack of the requisite  quantity of spare parts prevented the flight training plan from  being implemented in full.    But when talking about figures for overall flying time you  must bear in mind that in this period there has been a  tremendous drop in the number of Air Force personnel, flight  personnel included. The size of the aircraft pool has dropped as  a result of obsolete aircraft being removed from the arsenal.  You could not therefore have expected overall flying time --  compared with last year -- to remain the same with that kind of  reorganization of the Air Force.    Nonetheless throughout the past year we tried to keep  personnel's air combat proficiency at the requisite level.  Exercises conducted in conjunction with other branches of the  Armed Forces demonstrated that we were successful in this.    As well as tackling combat training tasks last year  military-transport pilots transported over 10,000 [as published]  people and over 11,000 tonnes of national economic freight. We  delivered technological equipment to the Surgut oil men, metal  working machines to the Norilsk mining and metallurgical  combine, and humanitarian freight from Germany. Residents of  various parts of the country experienced military-transport  aviation's aid.    Logged flying hours and lasting skills have always been the  basis of successful flight operations. Regrettably, pilots'  average flying time is in fact a long way from well-founded  norms. I myself am a pilot and know where this can lead.  Nonetheless, in 1993 we managed to somewhat reduce the number  of air crashes.    While being aware of the acuteness of problems of material  and technical support for the Air Force and their adverse effect  on flight safety, I must admit that they are not responsible for  the chronic accident rate. Most of the accidents in the air  could have been averted had personnel acted competently.  Accidents and crashes are primarily due to flagrant deviations  from procedures for organizing flights and carrying out missions.    When analyzing the results of the year we would note that,  despite all the difficulties inherent in the situation, around  90 percent of aviation regiments operated accident-free. The Air  Force High Command has not created any special conditions for  them. This convinces us that it is possible to avoid accidents  and disasters when flying. All that is needed is systematic  preventive work by all categories of airmen.    [Babichev] You broached the question of the reduction in  personnel. It is a topical subject, one that worries many  people, sometimes giving rise not only to well-founded demands,  but also to misinterpretation....    [Kot] That's true. I would like to point out right away  that it is primarily the Air Force managerial apparatus that is  being cut back. Authorized strength has been cut by 34,200  servicemen in total.    The Air Force remembers the grim wholesale cadre cuts during  the late fifties and early sixties. The result being thousands  of shattered lives and a drastic slowdown in aircraft  development. It subsequently took the Air Force almost 25 years  to take wing again. The present reduction in officer cadres has  had virtually no impact on the activity of combined formations  and units. It is primarily officers who have completed their  legally prescribed term of service and who are socially secure  who are being discharged. We are not ordering those people to  stay on if they have decided to leave military service for some  reason and find themselves a post in civilian structures.  Admittedly, there are fewer of them around now. The reverse is  already starting to happen. Many people have become  disenchanted after working or attempting to work for commercial  structures and are asking to be reinstated in the ranks of the  Armed Forces.    [Babichev] What is the reason for this, in your view?    [Kot] I primarily think that this is happening because  officers are more secure than they were before and, second, it  is hard for a military man -- after several years serving in a  team of officers where he always met with understanding,  experienced mutual assistance, and felt confident in the future  -- to get accustomed to new relationships, different ways of  achieving objectives, and the individualism that exists in a  civilian environment. Part of my job is to talk to officers who  have had an opportunity to compare life in and outside the Army.  Many of them are profoundly convinced that by no means everyone  can find a niche on civvy street. We take an understanding view  of those who are determined to continue serving in the Air Force.    When thinking about the future of the Air Force, we pay  particular attention to young officers. Despite the acute  housing problems almost every one of them, on entering a line  unit after graduating from school, gets a place in an officers'  hostel. Where possible family men are given apartments. What  is more a relocation allowance -- which did not previously exist  -- to some extent helps overcome material difficulties.    [Babichev] The problem of servicemen's social security has  always been among the most acute. Not least for those returning  home from nearby foreign countries and further afield. How do  things stand now in the Air Force with the troop withdrawal?  What has been done for the "returnees"?    [Kot] In 1993 around 200 units were withdrawn from nearby  foreign countries and further afield, including two formation  command elements, four combined formation command elements, 17  Air Force regiments, and support units. People's futures and  tremendous work involved in accommodating the withdrawn units  and personnel and preserving the tremendous material assets and  equipment lie behind these figures.    We are doing everything to ensure that every servicemen  feels  that there is a reception waiting for him at home. Thus, in the  past year around 6,000 apartments have been built under the  capital construction plan, over 900 finished apartments have  been bought with state budget money, over 200 with  extrabudgetary funds, and over 600 apartments procured through  foreign firms' efforts.    While aware that these figures will not alleviate the  acuteness of the housing problem, we are working for the future.  The situation is as follows: At the beginning of 1994 families  without apartments total around 30,000 people.    [Babichev] Viktor Sevastyanovich, in the new year of 1994,  it  is evidently not only the housing problem that is worrying Air  Force command. What else affects combat readiness?    [Kot] We are most concerned over the good repair of the  aircraft fleet and the problem of further improving aviation  technology and arms. The drop in defense order appropriations  and the lag in the indexation of the allocated funds are forcing  us to seek new approaches to resolving these problems.    We are focusing our main efforts on top-priority  developments  of fifth-generation aviation complexes and buying spare parts to  maintain the aircraft fleet in a state of good repair.    We are not complaining about the problems, but seeking ways  to resolve them. The leadership of the Air Force High Command  realizes the importance and complexity of the tasks set by the  defense minister for the new training year and is taking steps  to carry them out.</p>

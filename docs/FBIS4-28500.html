			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, June 8 (YONHAP) -- North Korea reaffirmed  Tuesday that the dispute over its nuclear program can be settled  only through dialogue with the United States, clarifying that it  will not accept an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  resolution calling for special nuclear inspections in North  Korea.    The chief North Korean delegate to the IAEA, Yun Ho-chin,  who  is attending an IAEA Board of Governors' meeting, held a press  conference to warn that his country may withdraw from the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT).    Yun said, "If the IAEA adopts a resolution again, it will be  as much as telling us to leave the NPT system."    He then criticized the IAEA, claiming it is manipulated by  powerful nations and has distorted the technical problems  related to replacement of fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor in  Yongbyon in order to pressure North Korea.    North Korea has already proved through experiments that it  is  possible to recount the history of the reactor operations, Yun  said.    Pyongyang notified the IAEA of the technical point at issue  in an earlier letter, but the U.N. watchdog agency is ignoring  the notification, he added.    North Korea sent a message to Hans Blix, director-general of  the IAEA, on Monday saying it would quit the NPT if it came  under U.N. pressure over its suspected drive to develop nuclear  weapons.    The message, signed by Pak Yong-nam, general-director of the  General Department of Atomic Energy, warned that if the IAEA  took the North Korean nuclear issue to the U.N. Security Council  and continued to resort to pressure, Pyongyang would no longer  feel the need to subject itself to the "unreasonable binds" of  the NPT.    Meanwhile, the IAEA Board of Governors met for a second day  Tuesday to discuss nuclear safeguards. Delegates from the  United States, Japan, Australia and Canada are likely to draw up  a draft resolution Wednesday urging Pyongyang to accept special  inspections, according to a diplomatic source here.</p>

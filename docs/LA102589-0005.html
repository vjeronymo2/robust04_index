			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STAR TO ASK FOR DRUG PROGRAM IN LIEU OF JAIL  </P> <P> Kelsey Grammer, a star of the long-running television show "Cheers" who faces a  cocaine possession charge, is scheduled to appear in Van Nuys Municipal Court  on Thursday to request permission to attend a court-ordered drug-abuse  education program.  </P> <P> Grammer, 34, who plays Dr. Frasier Crane, the comically egotistical  psychiatrist on the popular NBC series, has been charged with one felony count  of possession of cocaine stemming from his arrest April 14 by Los Angeles  police.  </P> <P> The actor is seeking the court's permission to attend the drug-abuse education  program, which is offered to people charged with first-time felony drug  offenses, said Rion O'Brien, a Van Nuys Municipal Court clerk.  </P> <P> If he successfully completes the program, which lasts for several months,  Grammer would be eligible to have the cocaine possession case dismissed and the  arrest cleared from his record after six months, O'Brien said.  </P> <P> The cocaine charge would otherwise carry a maximum sentence of three years in  jail, but the sentence on a first offense is typically three to six months,  said Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrew W. Diamond.  </P> <P> The actor was scheduled to appear in Van Nuys Municipal Court on Tuesday for  the hearing but did not show up. His attorney, Robert L. Diamond, told Judge  Aviva K. Bobb that his client apparently was confused about the date of the  hearing and whether he had to be present.  </P> <P> Bobb issued a warrant for Grammer's arrest but stayed it until Thursday, when  Grammer's attorney said he would be present in court.  </P> <P> Grammer was driving east on Riverside Drive near Whitsett Avenue about 7:15  p.m. when he was pulled over for having expired license plate tags. According  to the police report, Grammer had no driver's license but only a learner's  permit in his possession.  </P> <P> A computer check turned up a speeding ticket and Grammer was taken to the Van  Nuys police station. He dropped a small packet containing about a quarter of a  gram of cocaine, worth about $25, on the seat of the police car before entering  the station, prosecutors said.  </P> <P> Grammer, of Van Nuys, has no prior criminal record and the Los Angeles County  Probation Department has found that he is a suitable candidate for the  drug-abuse education program, O'Brien said.  </P></p>

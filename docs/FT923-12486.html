			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / International Company News: KIO to negotiate interim rescue package for Ercros MR ALI Rashaid al-Bader, president of the London-based Kuwait Investment Office (KIO), will travel to Spain next week to negotiate an interim rescue package for Ercros, the troubled chemicals group in which the KIO has a controlling 39 per cent stake. The package, which is designed to give Ercros a 90-day breathing space while a comprehensive restructuring is worked out, is likely to include participation from the KIO, the company's lenders and the Spanish government. Talks between the three parties are understood to be well-advanced with officials indicating that progress has been 'very positive'. KIO is understood to be willing to provide approximately half of the support needed in a package which would include rescheduling some loan payments by Ercros's creditor banks and a degree of Spanish government support. Analysts estimate that assistance of between Dollars 60m and Dollars 80m would be needed to keep the company ticking over for the desired three months. Mr Claudio Aranzadi, the industry minister, and his aides, have all hinted in the last two days that KIO has agreed to help Ercros. While the government is trying to portray this as a change of opinion by KIO, agreement on shared financing of a package would be a reversal of the government's refusal to make funds over to Ercros. It remains unclear where Madrid, which has said it cannot legally subsidise Ercros, will find the money to match the offer KIO seems likely to make. It does have emergency industrial funds available and Ercros's main creditor is the state-controlled Banco Exterior, which might be persuaded by the government to relax pressure on the group for immediate repayment of its loans. KIO's participation in an interim rescue package would help to allay growing concern in Spain about the strength of its commitment to its Spanish investment portfolio, which has been valued at between Dollars 2.9bn and Dollars 4.4bn. KIO is the largest foreign investor in Spain but has run into a political storm since Ercros, which has debts of Dollars 2.15bn, filed for protection from its creditors earlier this month after KIO refused to rescue it.</p>

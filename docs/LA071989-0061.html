			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DANA URGES STEPS TO SAVE BURN CENTER  </P> <P> Fearing that the threatened closure of a burn center at Torrance Memorial  Hospital will leave the county with only two similar facilities, Supervisor  Deane Dana announced a set of recommendations Tuesday to address the region's  latest hospital crisis. It calls for taking steps to increase lobbying efforts  in Sacramento.  </P> <P> "This facility and this service are vital to our community," Dana said in a  motion he plans to introduce next week. "With large amounts of industry as well  as unforeseen accidents, this service is one that must always be available  locally."  </P> <P> Robert Gates, director of the county Department of Health Services, sent the  supervisors a memorandum earlier this month alerting them that the hospital is  considering closing its burn center "because of escalating uncompensated cost  of treating uninsured burn patients."  </P> <P> The escalating cost of treating the poor and uninsured has also been cited by  hospitals that have left the county's crumbling trauma-care network.  </P> <P> Dana noted that shutdown of the Torrance facility would leave the county with  only two burn centers, Sherman Oaks Community Hospital and County-USC Medical  Center.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Salam Hijab from Cairo] </F>   [Text] [Syrian] Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' has  underlined the importance of the subjects which the foreign  ministers of the Nonaligned Movement will discuss in their  conference that will start tomorrow.    Answering reporters' questions on arrival at Cairo  International Airport this afternoon to lead the Syrian  delegation to the 11th conference of the foreign ministers of  the Nonaligned Movement, al-Shar' said there are international  and regional issues, as well as issues of concern to our Arab  region. These include political and economic issues, he said.    The foreign minister added: One important subject at the top  of the conference agenda is the Arab-Israeli conflict and the  peace process and its developments, as well as our assessment of  that process and the Israeli aggressive practices and  intransigent positions.    Asked if there has been any progress in the subject of peace  with Israel on the Syrian track, the foreign minister stressed  that there is no progress thus far. He explained that the  reason for that is Israel's attempt to evade the foundations of  the peace process and the requirements for peace. Israel, he  added, also attempts to gain time, thinking that this will be to  its advantage.    Al-Shar' said: We believe this opportunity should not be  missed. Israel will be the biggest loser if this opportunity is  missed.    Asked if Syria supports secession in Yemen, the foreign  minister said: We do not support the secession of any Arab  territory from an Arab state.    He added: We are pained by what is happening in Yemen, and  what is happening should not have happened.    Al-Shar' stressed that Syria supports Yemen's unity and a  quick end to the fighting there. He said the end of fighting  should coincide with a concern for preserving the Yemeni unity.</p>

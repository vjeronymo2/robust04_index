			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pools concession may help lottery THE GOVERNMENT yesterday agreed to allow football pools companies to offer larger jackpots in a move intended to allay some of the industry's fears about the consequences of introducing a national lottery. Bowing to cross-party pressure, Mr Peter Lloyd, a home office minister, said there was 'a good case' for allowing pools companies to 'roll over' prize money from one week to another under limited circumstances. Mr Lloyd also told MPs the government intended to review restrictions on the sale of lottery tickets in bingo clubs and other leisure outlets. It 'may well' come back with proposals to amend existing rules which prohibit the sale of tickets in betting shops, bingo clubs, casinos, and amusement arcades, he said. As the National Lottery Bill paving the way for the new lottery approached its third Commons reading, Mr Lloyd said the government would bring forward proposals to override the current prohibition on rolling over pools prize money when the measure reached the Lords. He said the proposals would be designed to give pools companies 'similar freedom' to that granted to the national lottery, which he expected to roll over its prize money once or twice a year. Rejecting less restrictive proposals put forward by Sir Malcolm Thornton, the Tory MP for Crosby, and supported by Labour, Mr Lloyd said these would not create a level playing field and could result in 'spiralling jackpots'. As part of its review of ticket sales restrictions, the government would 'give favourable consideration' to proposals submitted by Mr Peter Fry, the Tory MP for Wellingborough, that would allow local lottery tickets to be sold in bingo clubs. It would be up to the organisations running the lotteries to decide where their tickets should be sold if current restrictions were lifted, Mr Lloyd said. In the case of pubs, the government has said it will allow pub operators to decide whether or not to sell lottery tickets. Home office officials said the review would start 'within months'. Earlier, MPs voted down by a majority of 90 (259 votes to 169) a proposal by Mr David Alton, the Liberal Democrat MP for Liverpool Mossley Hill, that the headquarters should be set up in an area that would suffer job losses directly attributable to the lottery.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: A McAlpine seeks Pounds 25m Alfred McAlpine yesterday joined the growing rank of housebuilders to launch rights issues to finance land purchases for expansion. The construction company is seeking to raise Pounds 25m through the issue of 12.6m new shares at 205p on a 2-for-9 basis. McAlpine made a Pounds 894,000 pre-tax profit during the six months to end-April, compared to a Pounds 2.48m loss last time. Turnover increased from Pounds 241.3m to Pounds 316.6m. Earnings per share were 0.7p (losses of 3.3p). The share price fell 18p to 241p. The company is changing its year end to December 31 and is expected to announce its interim dividend policy when it publishes figures for the period to end-June. McAlpine plans to increase housing output to 1,800 homes this year, compared with 1,259 in 1992. It expects to have spent Pounds 80m purchasing land by the end of this year, increasing net investment in the housing division by Pounds 30m. In the latest period it spent Pounds 48.7m on land. Mr Oliver Whitehead, chief executive, said this had led to a sharp rise in borrowings which, before the rights issue, were expected to average Pounds 75m to Pounds 80m this year, representing gearing of about 50 per cent. Proceeds from the rights issue should reduce gearing to a more appropriate level of 30 per cent. Mr Whitehead said the company's land holdings had increased by 47 per cent to 4,400 plots. Sites had been bought on the basis of an estimated gross margin of 18 per cent. The housing division, which completed 568 (509) private sector homes, made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 300,000 loss). The average selling price of a home increased from Pounds 78,000 to Pounds 88,900. The construction division incurred a Pounds 1m pre-tax loss (Pounds 500,000 profit); aggregates, slate and asphalt made a Pounds 800,000 profit (Pounds 200,000 loss); the US reported a Pounds 500,000 loss (Pounds 100,000 profit) with a good performance from minerals offset by a disappointing result from contracting. COMMENT It is not a good time to be launching a rights issue with sentiment running against the stock market and housebuilders and construction companies in particular. Nonetheless, there is sufficient value in the shares at a theoretical ex-rights price of 234p, based on last night's close, to get the issue away - albeit without much enthusiasm. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 13m this year followed by Pounds 21m next year would put the group on a prospective p/e of 11 on 1995 profits at the ex-rights price. The shares, however, are unlikely to improve in the present climate.</p>

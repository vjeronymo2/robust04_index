			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec seems set to keep 24.2m b/d output ceiling MINISTERS FROM the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries could move towards maintaining their existing oil production ceiling of 24.2m barrels a day when they meet later today. The ministers heard reports yesterday that output by Opec's 13 members in October was actually much higher than this ceiling at 25.04m b/d, chiefly because of increases in output by Iran and Kuwait. A return to the September ceiling centres on Iran's willingness to accept a production cut. Opec figures put Iranian oil production for October at 3.8m b/d - well above its previous output level of 3.4m b/d. Kuwait's new oil minister Mr Ali Ahmad Al-Baghli has also boosted the emirate's production close to 1.4m b/d  -approaching its target of 1.5m b/d by the end of the year. The producers' club expects demand for its oil to rise to 25.64m b/d in the first quarter of next year with 640,000 b/d of this to be met from stocks. A re-imposition of the September ceiling would therefore imply cuts from existing production levels, which some delegates believe would send a message to the market that Opec is ready to support prices. However, some producers want deeper cuts in output to be made in an effort to improve price levels. Algeria's delegation felt Opec's economists were being too cautious in their estimate for the draw on stocks during the first quarter. 'If Opec is willing to avert the risk of a drastic price deterioration in the first quarter, a more normal stock draw of 900,000 b/d to 1.1m b/d should be enforced on the market,' the Algerians told yesterday's meeting. Algeria's new oil minister, Mr Hacene Mefti, wrote to the president of Opec at the beginning of November urging him to call on other members of the club to exercise production restraint. However, world prices have slipped by about Dollars 2 a barrel since October as members have continued to produce more than their allocated levels. Ministers broke up into small groups throughout yesterday evening in an effort to massage the figures and draw up a compromise acceptable to all member nations. They will also consider a request by Ecuador later today to leave the organisation.</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SMOKELESS TOBACCO USE IS CONDEMNED  </P> <P> Researchers hope a study of 1,100 baseball players will keep other boys from  using smokeless tobacco, which their study strongly links to lesions in the  mouth and receding gums.  </P> <P> "The prevalence was much greater than we had thought," said Paul Robertson,  dean of dentistry at the University of British Columbia. The study of major and  minor league baseball players for the last two years during spring training in  Arizona will conclude next year.  </P> <P> Baseball players were chosen because they are known to be great users of snuff  and chewing tobacco and are role models for the adolescent males who make up  smokeless tobacco products' biggest market, Robertson said. Ninety-five percent  of the players, coaches and managers took part in the voluntary physicals, and  about 60% were smokeless tobacco users.  </P> <P> The players rinse their mouths to remove all traces of smokeless tobacco before  they are checked, "so the data is unbiased, which makes the results even more  frightening," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Growths and Lesions  </P> <P> About half of the current users had lesions or growths in their mouths at the  site where they used smokeless tobacco, Robertson said. The gum tissue also had  receded in users.  </P> <P> "The amount of receding gums was more than twice what we found in the baseball  players who did not use smokeless tobacco. It's site-specific. Where you hold  the smokeless tobacco is where you have the damage," he said.  </P> <P> Robertson said the gum recession is permanent, but researchers still don't know  what happens to the lesions over time.  </P> <P> "If you quit, the lesion goes away," he said, displaying slides of the growths  found in players' mouths. "What we don't know is if you don't quit, how many of  them go on to become cancer of the mouth.  </P> <P> "We know that some do; we don't know how many."  </P> <P> Robertson said researchers believe they may be seeing fewer problems among the  baseball players than they would in the general population because of the  athletes' greater fitness and health awareness.  </P> <P> Chris Klose of the Smokeless Tobacco Council in Washington said about 10  million to 12 million Americans use smokeless tobacco. "The council's position  is that smokeless tobacco has never, ever been scientifically proven to be the  cause of any human disease," Klose said.  </P> <P> About 67,000 Canadian males age 15 or older use chewing tobacco and 38,400 use  snuff, according to the Health and Welfare Department. The National Cancer  Institute estimates that 3 million Americans younger than 21 use smokeless  tobacco.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Use of Snuff  </P> <P> Seventy percent of the players in the study use snuff, 20% use chewing tobacco  and 10% use both, said Robertson.  </P> <P> The research project, which includes physicians, dentists, epidemiologists and  psychologists, originated at UC San Francisco, where Dean John Greene is "an  avid baseball fan." Robertson, a Houston native and also a baseball fan, came  to Vancouver from San Francisco about a year ago. Both universities are now  cooperating.  </P> <P> "As smoking has become more and more socially unacceptable, there has been a  tremendous increase in the last decade in the use of smokeless tobacco," he  said, adding that the potential for addiction is the same as cigarettes. "It  would appear that quitting smokeless tobacco is as difficult as quitting  smoking, but we don't know that and that's one of the things we have to ask."  </P></p>

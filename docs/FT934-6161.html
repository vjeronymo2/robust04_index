			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Warning over Uruguay Round Britain and Germany yesterday warned that failure to reach agreement on the Uruguay Round of trade talks on December 15 would have 'intolerable' consequences for the developing world, perpetuating recession in western Europe and leading to protectionist measures by individual countries. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, also issued grim warnings about the level of unemployment and uncompetitiveness in Europe. If European Union countries did not tackle, and come up with solutions at next month's EU summit, both leaders said Europe would be unable to respond to the challenges posed by Asian economies. Speaking after the one-day Anglo-German summit in Bonn, Mr Major and Mr Kohl said a trade agreement was 'achievable'. But without naming countries, Mr Major said several countries had to show more 'flexibility'. 'Market access, agriculture, and audio visual issues, which affect both the US and France are now the main stumbling blocks to a deal,' a British official said, adding that Bonn and London are 'extremely worried about any failure. It will do nothing to stimulate our own economies.' British officials confirmed that US president Bill Clinton telephoned Mr Major on Wednesday evening to discuss the trade talks. They said Mr Clinton wanted Britain to ask Bonn how far German officials would be prepared to put pressure on France into making compromises over the Uruguay Round. French and German leaders meet next week. Apart from Gatt, which dominated the summit, British and German officials said EU countries would have to adopt greater flexibility and training schemes to increase competitiveness and create jobs. 'By the year 2000, the output of Asia will exceed the output levels of the European Community countries combined,' said Mr Major. The issue of unemployment and competitiveness will be the main agenda items during the European Union summit meeting early next month. Both leaders also ruled out increasing public expenditure. 'Sound finance, low inflation and flexibility on the labour market, and reducing barriers to part time work' are the basis for growth,' Mr Major said.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brussels uncorks wine reform plan The European Commission yesterday adopted a regulation aimed at draining Europe's 'wine lake' once and for all, through measures to eliminate surplus output now running at about 35m hectolitres, nearly a fifth of EU production. The new wine regime will inaugurate a second phase of the 1992 reform of the common agricultural policy, from which Mediterranean products were largely excluded. The measures, which Brussels wants in force for the 1995-96 wine year, will offer member states a range of financial incentives designed not only to 'grub up' or permanently abandon wine production, but to increase the quality of wine. Mr Rene Steichen, EU agriculture commissioner, said yesterday 'we have to act quickly and we have to spend a lot of money' to get the wine market back into balance. Without reform, he said, the EU would spend Ecu1.5bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in 1995-96, more than half of it on distilling surplus wine. The revamped regime, he claimed, would by contrast cost Ecu1.2bn, with the bulk going on regional programmes to support permanent structural reform. EU wine output in 1992-93 totalled 195.5m hectolitres, against a new reference target for output of 154m. The main countries affected would be Italy, dropping from 68.1m in 1992-93 to 49.7m; France, from 64.9m to 51.8m; and Spain, from 36.9m to 29.2m. The reform offers wine producers a one-off payment of Ecu7,000 a hectare - where the average yield is 50hl a hectare - for grubbing up vineyards. Less radical measures, ranging from the harvesting of unripe grapes to commercial and quality improvements in the sector, would attract smaller amounts, co-financed by the EU budget and member states. Where quotas were exceeded incentives would diminish proportionately. Member states and regions within them will be able to choose how to spread the burden and what form of production control best suits them. 'Member states may make a regional distribution of their national reference programme,' the Commission said, but 'they must do so in the case of regions which submit a programme' to Brussels. Mr Steichen refused to be drawn on whether the financial impact of the 1992 CAP reform, plus the new changes in the pipeline, will break the farm budget in the three years from 1995 to 1997. He acknowledged that the EU was heading for an Ecu1.3bn deficit on farm spending next year, largely as a result of agri-monetary adjustments - costing Ecu1.8bn - to compensate farmers for the strength of the D-Mark and Dutch guilder.</p>

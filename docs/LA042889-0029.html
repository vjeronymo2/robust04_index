			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS;  </P> <P> UAL, DELTA, USAIR REPORT ROBUST 1ST QUARTERS  </P> <P> UAL Corp. and Delta Air Lines Inc. reported record first-quarter profits  Thursday while USAir Group Inc. turned a profit after suffering a significant  loss a year ago.  </P> <P> </P> <P> UAL Leads the Pack as Its Profits Double  </P> <P> Chicago-based UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, the nation's largest  carrier, led the pack, reporting that first-quarter profit from continuing  operations more than doubled to a record $65.4 million, compared to $27.9  million for the year-ago period. The results exclude a gain of $548.5 million  from the sale of operations in the first quarter of 1988.  </P> <P> Operating revenue rose to $2.33 billion from $2.06 billion a year ago.  </P> <P> UAL said United Airlines had the highest load factor of the major carriers in  the quarter as well as much improved revenue yields. The company noted that it  made the gains without the extensive benefits that other airlines reaped from  the strike by Texas Air Corp.'s Eastern Airlines unit.  </P> <P> United Airlines on Wednesday ordered up to 370 aircraft from Boeing Co. for  $15.74 billion, the largest such order in U.S. history, indicating that it  expects further growth. UAL shares closed up $1.50 at $131.50 in trading on the  New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> Separately, UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf told the company's annual meeting in  Washington that although he has discussed acquiring some of Eastern's assets he  did not think United would ultimately be a buyer.  </P> <P> Eastern, crippled by a machinists strike that began March 4 and pushed it into  bankruptcy proceedings, is seeking to sell off assets and reorganize as a  smaller carrier.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Delta's Net for Period Is Company Record  </P> <P> Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines Inc. said its net income rose 51.5% to $85.0  million in its first quarter, compared to $56.1 million in the year-ago period.  It attributed the gains to sharp growth in passenger revenue, boosted partly by  the Eastern Airlines strike.  </P> <P> Delta said good economic conditions, continuing benefits from a merger with  Western Air Lines and growth in domestic and international operations also  contributed to the increase.  </P> <P> The company said the profit was a record for the period. Operating revenue rose  19% to $2.04 billion, compared to $1.71 billion last year.  </P> <P> "The key to the increased earnings was the 20% growth in passenger revenues,"  Thomas Roeck, chief financial officer, said in a statement.  </P> <P> "The strike against a major competitor during the month of March resulted in  increased revenue passenger miles," he said, "but traffic growth was strong in  January and February prior to the strike, and in many markets not affected by  the strike."  </P> <P> He said passenger traffic increased 13% in Atlanta, one of the areas most  affected by the Eastern strike.  </P> <P> "Yet traffic for the first three months of the year was up 8% in Dallas-Fort  Worth, 37% in Honolulu, 15% in Los Angeles and 10% in Salt Lake City -- all  markets where Eastern is not a competitor," Roeck said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> USAir Posts a Profit; Had Loss a Year Ago  </P> <P> Washington-based USAir Group Inc. reported a first-quarter profit of $15.5  million contrasted with a loss of $18.8 million in the year-ago period.  Operating revenue rose 18% to $1.48 billion, compared to $1.25 billion a year  ago.  </P> <P> The company said the results reflected significant improvements in yield at  both USAir and Piedmont, increasing benefits of last year's merger with Pacific  Southwest Airlines, which has resulted in the expansion of long-haul flying  linking the West Coast with the Midwest and Northeast, and improved scheduling  efficiency.  </P> <P> Both USAir and Piedmont also benefited during the quarter from the disruption  of most operations at Eastern.  </P> <P> Included in the consolidated results are USAir Group's principal operating  subsidiaries, USAir and Piedmont Aviation and four wholly owned commuter  airlines. Piedmont was acquired by USAir Group on Nov. 5, 1987, and will be  merged with USAir on Aug. 5, 1989.  </P></p>

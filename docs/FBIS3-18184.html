After his meeting with Slovakian Premier Vladimir Meciar in  his office, Cetin told reporters that Bosnia-Herzegovina, which  was the victim of the conflict in the region, had actually  voiced a request for Turkey's participation in the forces,  besides the request made by Turkey to Western countries on the  issue.    Cetin recalled that Turkey had been a country which had an  active stand towards the issue since the beginning and was the  only country which supported the Bosnians since then.    "We spent intensive efforts to bring Croatians and Bosnians  together and we went to Sarajevo at a time no one had the  courage to do so. We issued a Sarajevo declaration there. We  believe, as stated by our premier, Turkey's contributions are  vital for a lasting peace in the region," he said</p>

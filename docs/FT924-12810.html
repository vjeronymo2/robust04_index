			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / International Company News: CWS chief hits out at government MR LENNOX FYFE, chairman of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, delivered a blistering attack on the government's economic policy when reporting a sharp drop in interim profits at the weekend. He said prospects of any real upturn in the retail sector still seemed very far off. 'Indeed, the UK economy over the last month appears to have been propelled by an indecisive government over the abyss into a state of free fall,' he said. The UK's biggest co-operative organisation, which has retained its strong links with the Labour party, blamed the severity of the recession for a fall in trading profits from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 5.3m in the six months to June 27. Sales rose from Pounds 1.43bn to Pounds 1.49bn. The CWS, which is the UK's biggest farmer as well as a food manufacturer, wholesaler to the rest of the co-operative movement, and a significant retailer, said there had been some encouraging developments - particularly in retail, travel and funeral services, and agricultural businesses.</p>

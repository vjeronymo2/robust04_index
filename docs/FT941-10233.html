			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Revival of US demand helps Ford lift earnings to Dollars 719m Ford Motor yesterday under-scored the revival of US vehicle demand and its own market share gains by reporting fourth quarter earnings of Dollars 719m (Pounds 479m) compared with a loss of Dollars 840m in the same period of 1992. Ford's European automotive operations, including Jaguar, the UK luxury car subsidiary, posted a slightly reduced net loss of Dollars 960m in 1993 - its third successive heavy annual loss. However, excluding Jaguar, the European operations 'could be profitable' in 1994, the carmaker forecast. Ford made Dollars 669m from its vehicle operations in the US, a Dollars 797m improvement on 1992, but that was partially offset by a Dollars 372m loss in its international operations. Its financial services group earned a record Dollars 422m, up from Dollars 197m a year ago. The results were towards the top end of analysts' forecasts, but the shares fell Dollars 1 to close at Dollars 68 1/2 . Detroit's Big Three motor manufacturers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler  -are all benefiting from a steady growth in North American demand and less intense competition from Japanese rivals, whose cars now cost significantly more in the American market than US ones. Mr Alex Trottman, Ford's chairman, said the company was 'in good shape for 1994. We have strong new products and we expect better economic conditions'. But there remained a lot to do to increase efficiency. Ford's fourth-quarter earnings at Dollars 1.30 a share compared with a Dollars 1.85 loss a year ago when the European operations took Dollars 419m of restructuring charges. Sales and revenues rose from Dollars 25.4bn to Dollars 27.84bn. The company had a one-time Dollars 73m gain in North America from the sale of its vehicle seating business, while overseas results were hit by a Dollars 109m restructuring charge at Jaguar and another of Dollars 57m in Australia. These were partially offset by a Dollars 59m reduction in German tax rates. For the full year, Ford reported earnings of Dollars 2.5bn, or Dollars 4.55 a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 7.4bn, or Dollars 15.61 a share in 1992 which was due mainly to changes in accounting methods. Its automotive operations made Dollars 940m in 1993, compared with a Dollars 1.53bn loss the previous year, while financial services earned Dollars 1.59bn, up from Dollars 1.03bn.

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Japan's surplus just won't lie down: But the figure bears some close examination FOR Japanese trade ministers visiting Washington the agenda may change from one year to the next but the underlying issue is always the same - the size of Japan's trade surplus. It is no different for Mr Eiichi Nakao, the latest chief of the ministry of international trade and industry (Miti), who sets off for the US today. He will be faced by complaints from the Administration of President George Bush over semiconductors, construction, auto parts and rice. Congressmen will add political spice to the trip with moves of their own - including a proposed ban on imports of Japanese rice wine to match the Japanese ban on foreign rice. But all this will be a reflection of the persistent underlying imbalance in trade. After falling by more than 40 per cent since 1986, Japan's surplus is rising again. In each of the past three months, the surplus has been higher than for the same months last year. The Dollars 8.72bn surplus recorded in March was the highest since December 1988. Mr Paul Summerville, an economist with Jardine Fleming, the securities company, forecasts that after falling from a peak of Dollars 90bn in 1986 to Dollars 54.6bn in the year to March 1991, Japan's trade surplus will rise in 1991-92 to Dollars 66.5bn. Japanese Ministry of Finance officials deny that an upward trend is in the making. But Miti is worried. One senior official said this week: 'We are afraid this trend might continue this year. It's very important to keep the surplus under control.' The figures continue to provoke howls of protest from Washington. But, in truth, European producers have more reason to worry than Americans. While the surplus with the US fell by 11 per cent over the last year, the surplus with Europe grew by the same percentage. Also, both changes are dwarfed by the growth of the surplus with Asia which soared 47 per cent to Dollars 24.8bn - exceeding the surplus with Europe for the first time. Both short-term and long-term economic forces are at work. The Gulf crisis boosted the cost of oil and gas last year - increasing Japan's fuel import bill for 1990-91 by 35 per cent to Dollars 61.4bn. Now that oil prices have dropped again below Dollars 20 a barrel, the cost of Japan's fuel imports will probably fall markedly in the current year - expanding the trade surplus for the next few months, though not beyond that. The recent slow-down in Japanese consumer demand will also depress imports in the current year. Consumers buying luxury goods were the great force behind the expansion of imports in Japan in the late 1980s. But the turmoil in Tokyo's financial markets last year is dampening appetites. European companies are particularly badly affected since luxuries - including German cars, French wines and Italian jewellery - account for a significant part of their sales in Japan. Imports from the EC rose 20.5 per cent last year, but this year's increase could be much smaller. In March imports were up just 0.4 per cent. Mr Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist of Nomura Research Institute, says the decline in the growth of luxury imports is a natural result of the cyclical easing in consumer demand. This is true. But it will do nothing to improve Japan-EC relations at the crucial time when the community is establishing new rules for governing entry to its markets after 1992. Alongside these short-term changes a significant long-term shift is taking place: Japanese exporters are successfully redirecting their energies towards Europe and Asia. Politics has played a part in this shift, with Japanese companies responding to criticism from Washington. But economics has been the driving force. In comparison with the US, Europe is still an under-developed market for Japanese companies. In three important countries - France, Italy and Spain  -severe restrictions are applied to Japanese goods. Asia offers even more potential. Asia late last year overtook North America as the main destination for Japanese exports. Given the high growth rate of many Asian economies, Asia's importance as a market seems certain to continue to expand. Mr Summerville forecasts that by the end of the decade Asia will absorb 45 per cent of Japan's exports. 'For the first time in 250 years, the most important Asian economic decisions are being made by Asian companies and Asian consumers.' The long-term growth of Asia will not reverse the decline in Japan's trade surplus from its peak in the mid-1980s. But it will probably means that after increasing this year, the surplus will not fall by much in 1992 or thereafter. Certainly, the surplus is unlikely to start shrinking again at the rate it did in the late 1980s. Nomura Research Institute forecasts that by 1995 the trade surplus will still be Dollars 60bn. That figure may sound unacceptably high to some politicians in the US and in Europe. But it could be is misleading: by 1995, the surplus will be much more equally spread among different countries. Also, the current account surplus will amount to a much smaller proportion of Japanese GNP than it did at its peak in 1986. Then it was 4.5 per cent; in 1990 it was 1.2 per cent. By 1995, it could fall below 0.5 per cent.</p>

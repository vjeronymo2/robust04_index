			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Bosnia threatens to boycott talks: Izetbegovic demands end to Serb advance on Sarajevo MR Alija Izetbegovic, the president of Bosnia, yesterday said he would boycott peace talks in Geneva if Serb forces pressed forward with their assault on Sarajevo. Bosnian radio said Serb forces breached defence lines in three places on Mount Igman, an important Moslem stronghold. Fighting was also reported in Hadzici, just west of Sarajevo, where UN officials spotted 16 Serb tanks last week. The Serb advance is aimed at forcing Mr Izetbegovic to accept the republic's ethnic partition, which he opposes as a legitimisation of 'ethnic cleansing'. However, in an apparent retreat on his position, Mr Izetbegovic - who faces growing international pressure to reach a peace settlement - last night said that Bosnia might have to be divided along ethnic lines to end the bloodshed. In an address carried by Bosnian radio, he said: 'We should not accept a permanent division of Bosnia. But without great concessions in terms of ethnic division, there is no way to get peace in the near future. 'Maybe we could solve this dilemma if we are ready to continue fighting (against Serbs and Croats) for one more year. But if we want peace now, concessions are inevitable.' A week ago Bosnia's collective presidency drafted a peace plan calling for preserving Bosnia intact as a federal, multi-ethnic state with equal rights for Serbs, Moslems and Croats. Serbian and Croatian leaders, meeting in Geneva at the weekend, denied attempts to carve up Bosnia between them and said their proposal for a loose confederation of three ethnic mini-states was the only way to lasting peace. President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, in a statement after talks with Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators for former Yugoslavia, said speculation on a two-way division of Bosnia was 'unfounded'. But Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has given tomorrow as the deadline for the Bosnian government to accept partition along ethnic lines. If not, he told a Belgrade newspaper yesterday, the government faces 'total defeat'. The presidents of Serbia and Croatia plan to return to Geneva tomorrow or on Wednesday if the mediators succeed in convening a new round of talks on a confederal peace plan for Bosnia involving all parties. The Bosnian Serbs and Croats support the plan and some members of the collective Bosnian presidency have said they would discuss it. Mr Izetbegovic reiterated that peace talks could not take place while Serb forces tightened their stranglehold on Bosnian government targets. 'We cannot go there if offensive activities in Bosnia continue, especially against Sarajevo,' he said after talks with Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russian President Boris Yeltsin's peace envoy. In an interview with a Belgrade newspaper, General Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb commander, warned: 'It is up to Alija and those who advise him to think what to do. I have left Sarajevo to the end.'</p>

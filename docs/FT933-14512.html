			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Fierce battle ahead as MPs weigh reform THE PARLIAMENTARY battle over Sunday trading will be a fraught game of bluff and tactical manoeuvring between the competing lobby groups that may well end up with the rules on opening hours unchanged. With ministers still wincing at memories of the government's ignominious 1986 defeat when it tried to deregulate opening hours completely, the Home Office is putting the onus on MPs to decide how Sunday trading should be reformed. The bill will be formally presented to the Commons in the legislative session beginning in November. The first main debate, or 'second reading' will be on the principle of reforming the 1950 Shops Act. The battle proper will not come until the bill is considered in detail by a committee of the whole Commons. The Speaker will decide the order in which MPs vote on the four options selected by the government - but probably with total deregulation first. Once one option wins a majority, the others will fall. A special feature of yesterday's bill is that if, as seems entirely possible, no option wins a majority, the government would be able to ask the Commons to vote again at a later date without the need for the entire legislation to be re-considered. That could be after a general election. In the meantime, the 1950 Act would continue. The House of Lords will also vote on the same options. If it chooses a different version to the Commons, MPs will have to vote again. The government has separated the issue of employee protection. But Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs, and possibly some Tories, will propose amendments to enhance the rights of future employees who work on Sundays, as well as the rights of existing employees. Conservative MPs will almost certainly be whipped to vote against them. But if employee rights are not improved, opposition MPs could vote against the bill on its third and final reading, even if they back the reform option eventually selected. Together with those unhappy about the option chosen, they may defeat the bill. Mrs Joan Ruddock, who speaks for Labour on home affairs, said: 'That will always be the threat that hangs over the government - that the whole legislation may end up being voted down at the final stage if they don't satisfy us all on protection of future, as well as existing, workers.' Government business managers have yet to decide if Tory MPs will have a free vote on third reading.</p>

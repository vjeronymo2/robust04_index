			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Bupa off sick list with Pounds 36.5m BUPA, Britain's biggest private healthcare group, which has been reorganising under a new management team since losing Pounds 38.2m in 1990, yesterday reported a 1992 pre-tax surplus of Pounds 36.5m, against Pounds 1.3m last time. 'We are off the sick list and much, much stronger,' said Mr Peter Jacobs, chief executive. Bupa, a provident association, is Britain's biggest health insurer and private hospital operator with nearly half the insurance market and 30 hospitals with 1,900 beds. Reserves rose from Pounds 311.8m in 1991 to Pounds 349.1m last year, in spite of a property revaluation which led to a Pounds 14.4m decrease in reserves in 1992. The insurance side's solvency ratio rose from 39 per cent in 1991 to 44 per cent last year. The UK health insurance operations, which lost Pounds 26.7m in 1991, managed a small Pounds 1.7m profit.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Dr. Ilyas Farah, official in charge of the </F> Cultural and Information Bureau of the National Command of the  Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, at the Party Preparation School,  date not given: "The Hope and Challenge Session"]    [Excerpts] Dear comrades, students of the Hope and  Challenge Session.    In the name of the Cultural and Information Bureau and on  behalf of the comrade bureau directors and members, I am pleased  to extend our congratulations to you on the conclusion of your  28th session. In as much as it is an occasion to express your  joy, it is also an occasion to recall your experiences during  the short period of this course and to conclude lessons for the  future. [passage omitted]    "Hope and Challenge" is the title of a strategy that stems  from historical awareness of the events in the present phase --  crucial events in rare and extraordinary circumstances. This  historical, principled awareness exposes weak analyses and  political theories that judge events in the superficial  traditional way that sees the near and distant Arab future only  through U.S. and Zionist analyses and the influence of Western  propaganda. They portray the Arab situation as a vacuum that  cannot be filled by a nation with history or created by struggle.    Therefore, the comrade graduates of this course are called  upon, now that they have acquired qualitative ideological  weapons from the spirit of the Mother of Battles, to face these  political and ideological challenges with historical logic  backed by scientific thought, struggle spirit, and cultural  heritage. The speech by the comrade leader on the third  anniversary of the 30-state aggression crowns all the  intellectual efforts exerted after the Mother of Battles to  provide full answers to the questions presented by Arab destiny  and the national, Arab, and international future.    You, comrades, are humanity's vanguard on the path of  straightening out ideology and cleansing souls and spirits of  all the corruption in the universe, thereby declaring the  inevitable downfall of the cultural structure, which lacks moral  bases and human spirit. You are the builders of a new  civilization, just as your forefathers were the first builders  of civilization. As in the dawn of human history, Iraq today is  a great teacher of history, civilization, and struggle. It is a  living embodiment of the spirit of the vision, and the immortal  meanings of patriotism, nationalism, and humanitarianism. This  is a starting point for a decisive, historical transformation in  the life of the nation and the modern world.    Congratulations to you and to Iraq for alerting mankind to  the reality of a changing conspiratorial world, foiling the  electronic war game, and exposing U.S. victory claims by  preventing the evil 30-station aggression from undermining our  great principled steadfastness, cultural struggle, and material  and spiritual reconstruction whose miracles have been achieved  on the land of Iraq under the leadership of the hero of Iraq and  the nation comrade leader Saddam Husayn. [passage omitted]    Comrades, the theorization taking place today about the  superior American way of life, "the Zionist era," and "the  American age" or "Americanism" is only a distortion of  civilization and an expression of delusions based on half  truths. This is in addition to its inherent weaknesses, moral  regression, and cultural alienation .    "Americanism", which seeks to generalize the American way of  life, is founded on three bases:    1. Superiority, challenge, and violence as reflected by the  cowboy mentality, to quote Quincey Wright.    2. Bigotry based on race and Protestant religious values.    3. Expediency which believes in the relativity of values and  uses success as a standard for truth.    These bases make the American feel he is the master of  standards. The double-dealing that permeates U.S. morality, the  exploitation of freedom as applied to money matters and the  media, and the compromise of values make everything in the  American way of life, even honor and sovereignty, subject to  bargain and compromise. Under such pragmatism, life itself  becomes a series of deals.    Thus, war is a deal; peace is a deal; persuading others to  surrender and accept established facts is a deal;, publicizing  and marketing liberal democracy and human rights to turn  political and economic institutions into annexes for the U.S.  capitalist system is a deal; considering religion, patriotism,  and nationalism as fundamentalism which must be avoided;  publicizing Western secularism and internationalist trends;  opening up fronts against nationalism, Arabism, and Islam;  advocating common strategies to fight Arab awakening and to  Americanize and Judaize life in the world are all deals.    There is only one starting point for facing this aggressive  American model which serves Zionist aims: namely, the Mother of  Battles' spirit, rationalism, renewed unity principles, true  democracy, and socialism based on lessons learned from world  experiments which express true human tendencies and address the  needs of national awakening. The Mother of Battles embodies the  alternative Arab cultural model which can, in a balanced and  integrated manner, interact with ideology and technology,  revolution and wealth, and Man and his humanitarian mission,  because the Mother of Battles is a spark from the mission's  spirit, the Ba'thist spirit.    You, the sons of the Mother of Battles, have the  responsibility to build this new cultural model and to defend it  with intellect, struggle, construction, creativeness and by  raising the nation's struggle power to the point where it can  settle the historic confrontation in favor of Arabism and human  civilization. You are qualified to assume this responsibility.  I congratulate you and wish you great success in your struggle  tasks under the principled historical leadership of leader  comrade Saddam Husayn, may God preserve him. Peace be upon you.</p>

			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Home agents say more cuts needed ESTATE AGENTS, battered by the impact of the recession and stagnant house sales, are praying that interest rates will come down in the near future to boost the housing market. Some were reporting an upsurge in telephone inquiries yesterday as potential clients reacted with cautious optimism to the latest market developments. Mr Richard a Brassard of south London agents Courtenay said he welcomed the prospect of higher inflation as a result of a weakening pound. 'The house market will not get going unless there is inflation. The idea that you can go on having low inflation at the cost of stagnation is crazy.' Estate agents fear that without still lower interest rates, potential buyers will still be unwilling to complete a deal. In the south-west, where property values are down by an average of 35 per cent on their peak levels of four years ago, properties are selling, 'but only if people accept it's 1992 and not 1988', said Mr Ian Fraser of Fulfords, an estate chain with 22 offices throughout the region. 'As long as people are prepared to accept a reasonable price, there is every chance a property can be sold reasonably quickly,' he said. On Tyneside, noted for its resilience in the face of long-standing high unemployment and restructuring of the local economy, the events of the week had little impact. Mr Stan Morville, managing partner of Dollery Waller, a north-east agency, said there had been a '30-minute reaction' to Wednesday's turmoil. Within half an hour of the proposed increase in the base rate to 15 per cent, a couple of potential buyers had rung to say they would not proceed. The next day they phoned back to say they had changed their minds again. 'Whatever mortgage rates are, they always reach a level of public acceptability,' he said. 'There are always those who have a need to move and they get out and get on with it. Until this week's cock-up, we were getting back there.' In the London area, which has seen the heaviest fall from peak prices, every technique is being used by estate agents to try to get the market moving, but it is lower interest rates that would be most effective. Ms Annie Allan of a Folkard &amp; Hayward branch in south London, said: 'The vendor has become worldly wise and is prepared to wait . . . people are waiting to see how much further the market is going to fall.'</p>

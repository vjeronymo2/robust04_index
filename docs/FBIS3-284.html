What will its  activists do with the legacy of their founding father, President  Houphouet-Boigny? These crucial questions were raised by  PDCI-RDA Secretary General Laurent Dona-Fologo at a meeting with  members of the party's political bureau at the party house in  Cocody yesterday afternoon.    This is the party's first meeting since the death of  President Houphouet-Boigny. On the occasion, Mr. Dona-Fologo  announced that the PDCI-RDA will hold its extraordinary congress  in April as stipulated in Article 25 of the standing rules. The  congress will focus on the vacant party chairmanship post and  the need to fill that prestigious post. [passage omitted]</p>

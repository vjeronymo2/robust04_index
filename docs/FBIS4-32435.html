			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Warsaw, 23 Jun--On 23 June in Warsaw, Foreign  Ministers Andrzej Olechowski and Teodor Melescanu signed  agreements between Poland and Romania on avoiding double  taxation on income and property; mutual promotion and protection  of investments; and cooperation in science, education, culture,  and sports.    Also signed was the protocol on cooperation between the  foreign ministries of both countries. Minister Olechowski said  that "he strongly feels that relations between Poland and  Romania do not reflect the needs and positions of both states in  Europe." According to him, agreements signed on Thursday form  the basis and make the commitment to widen Polish-Romanian  cooperation. [passage omitted]    According to Melescanu, Romania can use Poland's experience  in integration with West Europe, and "mutual efforts in this  direction are in Romania's interest." He stressed that Poland  and Romania are the most important countries in Central Europe  and could play an important stabilization role in this region.</p>

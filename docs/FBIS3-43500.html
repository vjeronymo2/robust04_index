The two leaders spoke briefly to the press, expressing  notably their deepest condolences to the Ivorian people on the  death of the dean of African heads of state, His Excellency  Felix Houphouet- Boigny. Concerning the franc zone summit in  the Senegalese capital, Equatorial Guinea's president was  categorical, affirming that his country is ready to accept other  economic measures like structural adjustment, but not CFA  devaluation. According to him, devaluation will not contribute  anything concrete to the African economy, in particular to  Equatorial Guinea, which joined the franc zone in 1983.    The Central African head of state said that Africa needs a  consensus and a spirit of unity to find an adequate solution to  the problem of the franc zone and the corollary issue of GATT.  According to President Patasse, Africa's economic, industrial,  and social fabric has been sorely tested for a very long time  and as a result it would be premature to talk of a CFA franc  devaluation. The Central African Republic is against devaluation  at this time when Africa is more than ever feeling its way, he  stressed. [passage omitted]</p>

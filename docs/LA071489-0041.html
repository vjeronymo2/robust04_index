The program has provided one full-time  psychiatrist and a part-time social worker to aid those with the disease.  </P> <P> Veterans Administration officials said the program is not being discontinued  altogether but is being moved to a downtown outpatient facility at 4th and Hill  streets. The protesting veterans argued that facility is highly inconvenient  for them.  </P></p>

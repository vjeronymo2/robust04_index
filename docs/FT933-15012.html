			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Motoring: A coupe in disguise HOW DOES one describe the five-door Subaru Impreza? It is about the size of a Ford Escort and looks like a cross between a saloon and an estate. But it is really a hardtop coupe with no centre pillar (B-post, in motor industry-speak) and a load-carrying bustle behind. Press the power window switches and the glass disappears into the frameless doors. At least, it does into the front ones, but the hardtop coupe effect is spoiled by rear side windows that retract only partly because the wheel arch gets in the way. Go round to the back and lift the curvy tailgate. The fair-sized boot turns into an estate's load space when the rear seat backrests fold forward. As the cushion does not swing up, the floor is not flat. Uniquely for road-going 4 x 4s, Subarus come with either five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. Those with manual gears have a two-range box giving 10 speeds forward and two in reverse. Who needs twin-range, four-wheel drive in a road car? If you have tried re-starting on a steep, wet hill when towing a horse trailer, you will not need to ask. The same goes if you live off the beaten track in an area where snow falls most winters. You will know the safest way to drive down a really slippery slope is to put a 4 x 4 vehicle in low-range first gear and forget about the brakes. In normal motoring, my test 1.8-litre manual Impreza went well. It hummed quietly along motorways at a business driver's speeds, rode firmly and flat on country lanes, and parked easily - power steering is standard. So, too, are electric windows and mirrors and other useful things like headlamps with washers and a power-operated levelling system, a tilt steering wheel, and adjustable driver's seat. Now that the cheapest Audi quattro - admittedly, a 2.8-litre V6 - is listed at Pounds 22,560, the Impreza looks remarkably affordable. An entry model, 1.6-litre, dual-range, manual five-door is Pounds 12,499, a 1.8-litre Pounds 12,999, and a 1.8-litre automatic (which does not have dual-range transmission) Pounds 13,999. If you want the flat-four engines and all-wheel drive, but not the odd estate-cum-hardtop styling, there are 1.8-litre Impreza four-door saloons at Pounds 12,499 (manual) and Pounds 13,499 (automatic). Average fuel consumption of the Imprezas should be around 31-33 mpg (9.1-8.5 l/100km) for the 1.6-litre and 1.8-litre manuals, 30 mpg (9.4 l/100km) for the automatics. I have promised myself another go at one in conditions when having all-wheel drive could make all the difference between completing a journey and getting stuck.</p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSED ARMS PACT LAUNCHES STRATEGY DEBATE  </P> <P> The prospective agreement in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks with the Soviet  Union sounds like an arms controller's dream come true.  </P> <P> As formulated in principle by former President Ronald Reagan and Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the treaty promises to cut almost in half the  long-range nuclear arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union. It could  save the United States an estimated $2 billion a year in the short term and  even more in the long term.  </P> <P> Yet the treaty, as it is expected to emerge in final form from the talks that  were resumed last month in Geneva, already is the subject of intense criticism  and debate.  </P> <P> Whatever the outcome of that debate, any strategic arms cuts on the scale  envisioned in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) will require the  United States to make vast changes in its national security planning and its  nuclear arsenal -- changes that represent a priceless opportunity to correct  past mistakes or, critics warn, to make dangerous new ones.  </P> <P> "Clearly," said Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), chairman of the House Armed Services  Committee, "our entire targeting doctrine needs to be rethought in light of the  START reductions."  </P> <P> Some arms control experts, including former Secretary of State Henry A.  Kissinger, complain that the treaty, as conceived, would contain terms that  could actually make a nuclear war more likely rather than less likely.  Kissinger and others argue that, depending on how the weapons reductions are  carried out, the Soviets could have an incentive to launch a first strike.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wiping Out the Peace Dividend  </P> <P> Also, the Pentagon is contending, much as it did when the first Strategic Arms  Limitation Treaty was negotiated in 1972, that it will need a variety of  sophisticated and more costly weapons as a result of a new treaty -- more than  wiping out any so-called peace dividend.  </P> <P> "START has clearly put us in a bind," admitted a senior national security  official in the Bush Administration. He said it has exposed contradictions in  U.S. policies toward controlling the arms race, acquiring new nuclear weapons,  choosing Soviet targets for U.S. nuclear weapons and deterring nuclear war.  </P> <P> These issues converge at a time when Cold War pressures appear to be subsiding,  partly because of budget constraints at home and partly because of Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's warming smiles abroad.  </P> <P> But experts across the political spectrum agree that ironing out the  contradictions and unresolved disputes embedded in U.S. strategy becomes more  rather than less urgent as the Cold War wanes.  </P> <P> That military buildups undertaken without coherent plans have often proved  wasteful is a historical truism. Defense specialists warn, however, that a  weapons "build-down" such as that now envisaged in START could be disastrous  without a coherent strategy for obtaining weapons suited to the post-START  world and without developing effective plans for using them against Soviet  targets.  </P> <P> The START talks, which began under President Reagan, were delayed until June by  Bush Administration officials so they could examine how the talks had  progressed.  </P> <P> "We have had some reservations about whether, if we conclude the present  agreement strictly in accordance with its present direction, we could get it  ratified (by the Senate)," Secretary of State James A. Baker III said.  </P> <P> When the START talks resumed, the United States sought to speed up work on  verification measures, even though it did not know what the agreement's precise  terms would be. And Bush emphasized that beyond weapons reduction, the goal of  any agreement would be to "enhance security and strategic stability."  </P> <P> He then reaffirmed the key principles negotiated so far, seeming to brush aside  the concerns expressed by some members of his national security team.  </P> <P> As approved last year by Reagan and Gorbachev, the treaty would limit the  United States and the Soviet Union to 1,600 delivery systems each -- that is,  intercontinental missiles and bombers. The United States now has about 2,000  missiles and bombers; the Soviet Union has about 2,500.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Accountable' Nuclear Weapons  </P> <P> These delivery systems could carry no more than 6,000 "accountable" nuclear  weapons -- that is, weapons such as warheads that count against that ceiling  and sub-ceilings under it. The result is that considerably more than 6,000  weapons will be permitted, in fact, on both sides.  </P> <P> Of these 6,000 weapons, no more than 4,900 could be ballistic missile warheads.  These warheads, because they are fast-flying and accurate, are most capable of  delivering a surprise attack aimed at knocking out the other side's hardened,  or fortified, missile silos.  </P> <P> Bombers, because they are slow and can be recalled after takeoff, will be  discounted: If they carry only bombs and short-range attack missiles, rather  than ground-hugging cruise missiles, they will count as only one weapon.  Because the United States has about 200 B-52 and B-1 bombers, each of which can  carry between 12 and 16 bombs and short-range nuclear missiles, between 2,400  and 3,200 of these nuclear weapons would not be subject to the treaty's limits.  The situation with the Soviets is similar.  </P> <P> The United States has about 13,000 long-range nuclear weapons and the Soviets  have about 12,000. START would reduce these totals by 25% to 30% overall, to  between 8,000 and 9,000 on each side, although it would reduce the number of  the most dangerous weapons -- the ballistic missile warheads -- by 40% to 50%.  </P> <P> Despite the START treaty's obvious appeal, some experts are critical of some of  its provisions because they could have the effect of leaving the Soviets with  relatively more nuclear warheads aimed at U.S. missile silos than they have  now.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. Silos Targeted  </P> <P> At present, the Soviets have about three warheads targeted on every U.S. silo.  Under START, this ratio could go as high as 9 to 1, according to arms  specialists Edward L. Warner III and David A. Ochmanek, authors of the new book  "Next Moves." This would be the outcome if the United States reduced its forces  under START by eliminating mostly land-based missiles -- a pattern it might  follow to avoid cutting back its relatively impregnable submarine-based  missiles.  </P> <P> Kissinger argues that in a crisis, having so many missiles available to use  against U.S. silos could tempt the Soviets to launch a surprise attack in the  hope of wiping out this country's land-based missile force.  </P> <P> Warner and Ochmanek, among others, are less concerned about this possibility.  U.S. missile silos are already vulnerable to Soviet attack, they reason, and  even if the Soviets had more warheads to aim at U.S. missile silos, they would  not waste more than three on each target.  </P> <P> Besides, the Soviets would realize that even if they could wipe out all U.S.  intercontinental missiles, they would still have to contend with missiles  carried by submarines and bombers.  </P> <P> Congress would probably reject a treaty that appeared to increase U.S.  vulnerability, unless it was assured that START reductions will be structured,  and new weapons will be purchased, to avoid this liability.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Soviet Targets  </P> <P> Of even greater concern to some experts is the impact of the treaty on the  other side of the equation: the U.S. targeting of strategic locations in the  Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Part of the U.S. nuclear force is aimed at Soviet nuclear weapons sites. START  would eliminate more of these warheads -- eight or 10 times more, by some  calculations -- than the Soviet missiles at which they are targeted.  </P> <P> This would leave a major shortfall of U.S. weapons to cover all the targets  they now threaten. Thus one apparently inevitable consequence of the START  treaty would be that some Soviet sites now targeted by U.S. missiles would have  to be dropped. Or at the very least, the number of U.S. weapons now allocated  to particular targets would be reduced.  </P> <P> For example, where current U.S. targeting plans might call for firing three  warheads at each hardened Soviet missile silo to ensure its destruction, only  two warheads might be allocated to each target after START takes effect.  </P> <P> But such reevaluations might turn out to be a plus, many specialists believe,  by forcing the Air Force to end many wasteful targeting practices that it now  follows.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Empty Tank Farms, Barracks  </P> <P> The Pentagon might decide, for instance, that it is no longer necessary to  cover all Soviet missile silos for purposes of a retaliatory U.S. strike,  because -- if the United States were responding to a Soviet attack -- most  Soviet missiles would already have been launched. Similarly, if the Soviets  were to launch a surprise attack, the tank farms and troop barracks now on U.S.  targeting lists would be largely vacated in advance.  </P> <P> "It's a plausible first response (to START) not to aim any longer at empty  places," said a highly experienced retired military officer who continues to  consult on such issues. "That way we need not suffer a reduction in coverage  and of damage expectancy."  </P> <P> Some experts have long argued that the Pentagon should have made this decision  decades ago, thereby reducing its demand for nuclear weapons and avoiding the  present vastly overbuilt stockpile.  </P> <P> A separate controversy revolves around the number of missiles each side should  be allowed to have. The treaty as now being negotiated would limit each side to  1,600 missiles and bombers, but Warner and Ochmanek argue that the United  States would be better off with a somewhat higher limit -- perhaps 1,800 or  2,000.  </P> <P> Brent Scowcroft, President Bush's national security adviser, appeared to favor  a higher ceiling before he joined the White House team.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Difficult for Surprise  </P> <P> The rationale for this view is that having more missiles for the Soviets to aim  at would reduce the ratio of Soviet weapons to U.S. targets, making it more  difficult for Moscow to succeed in any surprise attack. That in turn would  reduce the Soviets' temptation to start a war.  </P> <P> To these experts, it is far more important that the treaty limit warheads  rather than the vehicles that carry them. Some go so far as to suggest that  there should be no limit on missiles at all, that limits should apply only to  warheads.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration has decided not to seek a higher ceiling, in part  because it could be politically dangerous to appear to be moving in the wrong  direction by seeking to keep more missiles rather than fewer.  </P> <P> To the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Strategic Air Command, the United States  must compensate for the reduced arsenal it would have under a START treaty by  modernizing its remaining strategic forces. In their view, all necessary Soviet  targets could be covered adequately in the post-START world and the Soviets  deterred from launching an attack if more accurate, powerful and flexible  weapons are acquired.  </P> <P> The problem, in an era of budget deficits, is that the shopping list is long  and very expensive. Here is what the Pentagon says it would need if the treaty  becomes effective:  </P> <P>  -- A new ICBM program, already the subject of considerable controversy. The  Pentagon originally wanted 50 new MX missiles on rails, each armed with 10  nuclear warheads. Cost: $15 billion. Congressional Democrats as well as many  experts, including Scowcroft, then a private citizen, favored building 500  single-warhead Midgetman missiles, to be mounted on special trucks. Cost: $27  billion or more.  </P> <P> A compromise has been worked out in which the existing 50 MXs now in silos will  be put on rails in the early 1990s, at a cost of about $5.4 billion. Meanwhile,  work is being accelerated on Midgetman, aiming for deployment in the late  1990s.  </P> <P>  -- The B-2 stealth bomber. This is a particularly high Air Force priority. It  would cost about $70 billion for 132 planes. The Pentagon delayed the program  for a year because of budgetary and technical problems. Initial operation of  the plane is now scheduled for 1992. But despite a dramatic test flight last  week, funding for the B-2 still remains a subject of dispute in Congress.  </P> <P>  -- Other modernization programs. These include more Trident missile  submarines, at $2 billion each, an air-launched cruise missile using stealth  technology, at $7 billion, and more secure command and control systems, at an  undetermined cost.  </P> <P> "If the modernization program should be stopped," the SAC commander, Gen. John  T. Chain, warned in an interview at his headquarters at Omaha, Neb., "then I  will go (to Congress) to testify against the START treaty, and so will the  Joint Chiefs of Staff."  </P> <P> The fight over which missile to buy -- the MX or the Midgetman -- for the  post-START arsenal dramatizes a basic disagreement within the national security  community over what types of nuclear weapons and what capabilities will be most  important.  </P> <P> The dispute ostensibly revolves around money. Midgetman is roughly twice as  expensive for each warhead delivered. But the root disagreement is over which  weapon would best deter a Soviet attack in a post-START world of drastically  reduced arsenals.  </P> <P> One school, made up primarily of civilian arms experts and congressional  Democrats, insists that the new missiles should be configured to survive any  Soviet attack and still retaliate. A recent Brookings Institution study  concluded that the survivability of weapons would grow in importance as the  arsenals are reduced.  </P> <P> The other school, centered in the military and among conservative politicians,  prefers weapons that can better fight wars and destroy the enemy's weapons,  even if they are less safe from a first strike. Gen. Larry D. Welch, the Air  Force chief of staff, has said that "survivability has been overplayed. . . .  The real issue is capability."  </P> <P> This dispute reflects the tension between advocates of two strategies for  fighting a nuclear war:  </P> <P>  -- The retaliatory strategy of assuring the Soviets that the United States can  ride out any Soviet attack and, in retaliation, destroy much of Soviet society.  </P> <P>  -- The war-fighting strategy of being able to knock out Soviet weapons before  they can be used on the United States.  </P> <P> Proponents of both strategies have long recognized the need for making  intercontinental ballistic missiles mobile as the growing number and accuracy  of Soviet missiles through the 1970s made U.S. silo-based ICBMs increasingly  vulnerable to a surprise attack. A Soviet attack in which two or three SS-18  warheads were targeted on each U.S. missile silo would destroy between 66% and  95% of the U.S. ICBM force, according to Pentagon estimates.  </P> <P> U.S. submarine-launched missiles and many bombers would be expected to escape  and be able to retaliate. But the consensus of military and civilian experts is  that the land-based missile leg of the U.S. triad of nuclear forces should not  be permitted to become significantly weaker than the others.  </P> <P> The most credible solution to this problem, mobility, has already been embraced  by the Soviets. They have deployed 10-warhead SS-24 ICBMs on rails and  single-warhead SS-25s on trucks.  </P> <P> Paradoxically, the U.S. proposal for a START treaty would ban mobile ICBMs,  even though the Bush Administration wants to build both rail-mobile and  road-mobile ICBMs. The Administration has promised to withdraw this prohibition  element from the START negotiations once it gets assurance from Congress that  lawmakers will fund its two-missile program.  </P> <P> In the end, the United States probably will not be able to afford both missiles  indefinitely and will have to choose. The choice may come at the bargaining  table in Geneva, where the superpowers probably will examine whether to ban  multi-warhead mobile missiles, including the MX and the SS-24, as part of the  START treaty.  </P> <P> Or it may be made unilaterally in Washington, if the Administration can resolve  its internal ambivalence on which type of mobile missile to support. The White  House emphasizes the survivability of new weapons, and this indicates that it  favors the Midgetman; Defense Secretary Dick Cheney initially backed the MX.  </P> <P> The military's insistence on weapons that are better at war-fighting than  surviving is partly instinctive -- "shooting first at whatever is shooting at  you," as one general said -- and partly fear that political leaders will  equivocate rather than act decisively in times of crisis.  </P> <P> For example, the Pentagon put 50 MX missiles, each with 10 warheads, into fixed  silos last year, although they are just as vulnerable as the three-warhead  Minuteman missiles that they replaced. Also, they are more attractive as  targets because they carry more warheads and are more accurate.  </P> <P> One four-star general reportedly declared that he wanted the MX even if it had  to be "put in the Pentagon parking lot," i.e., above ground, where it would be  extremely vulnerable.  </P> <P> But there is more to the Pentagon's preference for power over survivability in  nuclear weapons. The less survivable the weapons, the faster the United States  must respond in a crisis. And a strategy of faster U.S. reaction means more  certain and more punishing retaliation against the Soviets, while a policy of  riding out a surprise attack before retaliating opens the way to all kinds of  problems and potential failure.  </P> <P> Many U.S. weapons might never be launched, military leaders believe, because  many command and control systems might not survive an initial attack. And  decision-making by political leaders could be paralyzed. Still other problems  could develop.  </P> <P> As a result, military leaders tend to favor acting before a full first strike  has been absorbed and, in the meanwhile, to develop weapons capable of  delivering the most devastating blows possible.  </P> <P> Critics, of course, note that such a strategy calls for weapons capable of  hair-trigger reaction, which could bring war closer and increase the risks of  catastrophic mistakes.  </P> <P> With so many complex issues to be resolved, experts say, the START treaty will  leave in its wake years of debate and decision-making, far more than the arms  limitation agreements of two decades ago.  </P> <P> And while the risks are certain to be emphasized, the opportunities should be  at least as great.  </P> <P> START would make it possible for the Bush Administration to resolve wasteful  and contradictory tension within existing policies: to create a smaller but  equally deterring nuclear force structure, to plan more efficient use of the  smaller number of nuclear weapons and to coordinate U.S. arms control policy  with U.S. weapons acquisition policy.  </P> <P> No Administration since the dawn of the nuclear era has had a better chance to  reform U.S. deterrent doctrine. Whether President Bush is able to do so may  become a major factor in determining his place in history.  </P></p>

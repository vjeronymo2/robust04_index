			<p>BFN     [Text] Chief of the Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army press  service, Serzh Arushanyan suggested that Azerbaijan was trying  to bring about a change in military actions and to improve the  situation on the front's sections when utilizing Afghan  mujahideen with military experience.    Arushanyan stressed in an interview with INTERFAX that Baku  was after not only a military, but also a political purpose --  to internationalize the conflict and give it a religious  character in order to confront Christian Armenia and  Nagorno-Karabakh and the Moslem world.    Stepanakert had several months before stated there were  mujahideen in the Azerbaijani Army. One was taken prisoner by  the Karabakh troops on 22 April.    However, the Azerbaijani Defense Minister affirmed on 5 May  that no foreigners were serving in the Azerbaijani Army.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Lusaka peace talks are set continue today.  Contrary to what was expected, there was no plenary meeting  yesterday. The mediators took turns meeting the two sides in a  bid to find some kind of agreement. Diplomatic sources have  said, though, that no such agreement was forthcoming and the  mediators would have to make similar efforts today.    Jardo Muecalia, the National Union for the Total  Independence  of Angola [UNITA] representative in Washington, said yesterday  that he was optimistic about the outcome of the Lusaka peace  talks. He also expressed the hope that the Luanda government  would change its attitude. Asked to comment on the talks,  Ambassador Muecalia said progress had been made with regard to  military and political issues. He noted, however, that such  progress had only been possible thanks to the many concessions  UNITA has made. He added he hoped the government would also  make concessions.</p>

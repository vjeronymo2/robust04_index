			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA BOOTS MOORPARK OUT OF WSC LEAD  </P> <P> A generally accepted baseball strategy is to hit it where they ain't, but  Ventura College's Dan Madsen gained by hitting it where they were.  </P> <P> Madsen hit a snake-tickling ground ball that went just under Moorpark shortstop  Dan Smith's glove and then skipped below left fielder Jason Jones' glove.  Madsen just kept running.  </P> <P> "My speed isn't too great, not good at all," said Madsen, Ventura's catcher and  No. 9 hitter.  </P> <P> Yet, by the time Moorpark returned the ball to the infield, Madsen had followed  David Eggert home with what proved to be the winning run in Ventura's 8-3  Western State Conference victory Saturday afternoon at Moorpark.  </P> <P> Madsen's single and Jones' subsequent three-base error ignited a five-run fifth  inning that helped knock Moorpark (17-9, 12-4) out of the WSC lead.  </P> <P> After losing two conference games this week, Moorpark trails first-place Cuesta  by a half-game and second-place Canyons by percentage points.  </P> <P> Ventura, which has beaten the conference's top three teams, remains mired in  the middle of the pack with a 7-9 WSC mark.  </P> <P> "We're so inconsistent," Madsen said. "We'll play games like this, and the next  time we'll give up 12, 13 runs."  </P> <P> For the second time in 10 days, Ventura (15-12) beat a WSC opponent on its  opponent's field to knock that school out of the conference lead.  </P> <P> "What a roller-coaster ride we're on," Ventura Coach Gary Anglin said. "We're  out searching for answers because of our lack of consistency . . . We're a  one-pitcher team right now."  </P> <P> That one pitcher, sophomore right-hander Mike Teron, had missed his last two  starts because of shoulder trouble, but he scattered seven hits in nine strong  innings Saturday.  </P> <P> Teron (7-2) struck out five, and had the Moorpark batters hitting them where  his fielders were.  </P> <P> "It seemed every time we hit the ball hard, they had us played right," Moorpark  Coach Ken Wagner said. "Teron, when he is on, is as good as anybody."  </P> <P> Moorpark starter and loser Willie Leighton (5-3) was nicked for two runs in the  first inning, but retired 11 consecutive batters before the fateful fifth.  </P> <P> With Ventura leading, 2-1, Eggert led off that inning with a single. He was  headed for second on a hit-and-run play when Madsen's grounder bored a hole in  the Moorpark defense and unleashed a flood of runs.  </P> <P> "That got us down a little bit, but that shouldn't have gotten us down," Wagner  said. "You've got to bounce back."  </P> <P> Madsen's hit was followed by four singles and three more runs before Teron was  thrown out at third to end the inning.  </P> <P> Ventura pushed its lead to 8-1 with another run in the sixth, and Moorpark  scored single runs in the sixth and seventh.  </P> <P> Leadoff hitter Smith was the only Moorpark player with more than one hit, and  the Raiders had no extra-base hits.  </P> <P> Ventura, which remains in contention for one of five conference playoff spots,  was led by Gabe Diaz, who had two doubles and a single.  </P></p>

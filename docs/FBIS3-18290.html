			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The memorandum with our country's legal arguments  that was released by Greece today describes the measures against  Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] as the  last means to protect our national interests. An initial  discussion on the measures will be held at the European Union  [EU] Commission on Wednesday [2 March]. Our Brussels  correspondent Nikolaos Belos reports.    [Begin Belos recording] The memorandum with Greece's legal  arguments on the measures against Skopje has been in the hands  of the EU Commission as of yesterday evening. The memorandum  was submitted by the Greek Government through diplomatic  channels.    According to a statement made at noon today by the  Commission's spokesman, the memorandum will be examined by the  legal department, which will give its opinion in the next few  days as to whether the case against Greece should or should not  be brought before the European Court. The spokesman further  noted that an initial discussion on the Greek measures will be  held at the Commission's regular weekly meeting on Wednesday.    Greece's eight-page memorandum stresses that the government  found itself in a difficult position in adopting the measures  against Skopje as a last resort to protect its national  interests. The national interests were jeopardized because of  the aggravated situation caused by the unacceptable  intransigence of Skopje and its insistence on expansionist  claims. The memorandum describes Greece's decision as a  political action for the protection of national sovereign  rights. It also outlines the country's legal arguments with  regard to the international and EU law.    Among other examples of intergovernmental measures adopted  by  the EU in the past, the memorandum notes the economic sanctions  against Argentina in connection with the Falklands, sanctions  which were demanded by Great Britain. Another example that  Greece cites in the memorandum is the EU's economic measures  against Southern Rhodesia, whose aim was to exert pressure on a  third country.    The memorandum stresses in conclusion that the measures  adopted by the Greek Government to defend its fundamental rights  do not seek nor do they serve an economic goal but constitute an  exercise of legal political pressure and fall within the  possibilities of divergence which the EU law recognizes that  member states can resort to.

			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> And speaking of the market for Dali art: A federal grand jury indicted a  Honolulu-based chain of art galleries and its two top officials on fraud  charges, claiming the gallery sold fake Salvador Dali artworks during the past  12 years. The indictment last week charged Center Art Galleries-Hawaii owner  William Mett, 46, of Kailua, and vice president Marvin Wiseman, 44, of Waikiki,  with 93 counts of mail, wire and securities fraud in Dali sales to 36  customers. Assistant U.S. Attorney Les Osborne said Mett and Wiseman have  agreed to surrender at their arraignment, probably this week. In a written  statement Thursday, Mett said he was innocent.

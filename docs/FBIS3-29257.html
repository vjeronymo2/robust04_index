Ronald  Dellums, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, left  for North Korea on Tuesday (EST) as Pyongyang offered to accept  international inspection of its nuclear facilities, a  congressional source said. Dellums "left for North Korea  today," said the source, who is well versed in Korean affairs.  Asked over the phone if the congressman had left for Pyongyang,  his press secretary said, "I can neither confirm nor deny it."    The secretary said he had been told to refrain from making  any comments on news reports of Dellums' visit to North Korea,  adding that the congressman would not comment on the reports  now. The congressional source said the schedule for Dellums'  visit was delayed somewhat because North Korea was late in  advising him of the date of arrival in Pyongyang, seemingly  because of preparations for Kim Chong-il's birthday celebration.    THE NEW YORK TIMES reported Tuesday that Dellums would fly  to  Seoul first and then proceed to Pyongyang through Panmunjom,  quoting a State Department source.</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> KEITH EDGES WALKER TO WIN CORONADO VOTE  </P> <P> Susan Keith, chairwoman of the Coronado Planning Commission, appeared to have  won a narrow victory Tuesday night over three other candidates in a race for a  vacant Coronado City Council seat, according to unofficial results released by  the San Diego County registrar of voters.  </P> <P> With 100% of the votes counted, Keith led Greg Walker, a jewelry store owner,  by 29 votes, or 2,217 to 2,188. However, an official at the registrar's office  said 27 absentee and 14 provisional ballots remained to be counted. A  provisional ballot is one that needs to be validated by making sure that a  voter is properly registered.  </P> <P> Two other candidates, Donald Zub, a former Navy SEAL and construction worker,  and Louis de Beer, an engineer and computer consultant, trailed badly with 172  and 153 votes, respectively.  </P> <P> Keith is expected to fill the seat left vacant when Councilwoman Mary Herron  was elected mayor in November. Herron defeated incumbent R.H. Dorman. Keith  will serve for the remaining two years of Herron's council term.  </P> <P> The registrar's spokesman said 42.8% of Coronado's 11,190 registered voters  turned out in the special election.  </P></p>

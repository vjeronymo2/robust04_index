			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Interest rate cut triggers big gains in equities - Market Report Two large takeover bids, a smaller bid, bumper profits from one of the market leaders and, to cap it all, a surprise cut in UK interest rates helped the London stock market's recuperation process after Monday's steep fall. Adding to an early bout of optimism was Wall Street's good performance overnight plus gains in the Far East's two most important markets, Tokyo and Hong Kong. However, after the initial burst of enthusiasm, the London market began to have second thoughts about the background to the interest rate cuts, and these worries, combined with a shaky opening performance by Wall Street and an abrupt about-turn in gilts, took the gloss off the market's performance. Long-dated gilts ended the day showing losses of around  3/8 , having been up by some 1 1/4 points at midsession. Nevertheless, driven by the weight and importance of the day's news, turnover in the equity market again topped the 1bn shares mark, eventually reaching 1.02bn, continuing the exceptionally high volume levels seen in recent months and ensuring that the City's securities houses are still earning good profits from the market. Second-line stocks accounted for 655.8m shares, or 64 per cent of the turnover total. Traders preferred to ignore suggestions that some of the market's biggest marketmaking houses, wrongfooted at the end of last week and on Monday when equities plunged in the wake of Wall Street after US interest rates were increased, had again been caught out by a sudden shift in the market. The FT-SE 100 Index finished a busy session a net 21.1 ahead at 3,440.2, while the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which was given a push by the two bids, for Westland Group and LWT, advanced strongly to close 54.5 higher at 4,131.6. Share prices began the session in fine form, bolstered by the good performances from the leading international stock markets in the US and the Far East. Adding to the good news was GKN's bid for Westland and Granada's increased offer for LWT. Opening some 27 points higher, the FT-SE 100 began to wilt after an early flurry of support, but then raced ahead as the Bank of England signalled a rate reduction of  1/4 percentage point. The cut in rates triggered some big support across the market, lifting the 100 index to a day's high of 3,471.7, up 52.6, by around midday, and the 250 index by more than 60 points. Later, however, Wall Street's uninspiring opening, and weak international bond markets, saw share prices gradually drift back to close on an uncertain note. Some dealers were perplexed at the timing of the rate cut, and pointed to the continuing political difficulties facing the Conservative government, although it was also noted that the Governor of the Bank of England had said the rate cut was decided last week. Others, however, remain convinced that the gloom mongers in the market will be proved wrong. 'The cash market felt good all day and was only dragged down from its best levels by gilts and the future, said the head of trading at one of the top UK securities houses. Reuters, the media group, spurted ahead after delivering top of the range results and a share split seen as increasing the stock's marketability. Redland responded to a UBS buy recommendation, while BT shares were unsettled by the latest price-cutting move.</p>

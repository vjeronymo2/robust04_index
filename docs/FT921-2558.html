			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Waste dump row blows up MEXICO has criticised the US for planning to go ahead with building nuclear and toxic waste sites on the Texas-Mexico border without appropriate consultation, Damian Fraser reports from Mexico City. Mexico's foreign ministry said the sites would violate the 1983 La Paz environmental co-operation accord. It has told its ambassador in Washington to solicit 'urgently and formally' information on the building of the waste dumps, and rejects 'whatever suggestion' that the decision to build the sites is part of the exclusive jurisdiction of Texas. The row comes just after the US and Mexico agreed a joint border environmental plan meant to herald a new spirit of ecological co-operation and defuse fears that the proposed Nafta agreement would further pollute the border area.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow, May 26 (ITAR-TASS) -- The ROSSIISKIE VESTI  newspaper singles out a report on the recent decrees by  President Boris Yeltsin, repealing quotas and licences on  exported goods and services. The newspaper notes that all firms  and organisations operating on world markets will work on equal  terms.    Efficiency of their deals will be determined not by quotas  set by beaurocrats but by demand and supply.    The newspaper runs a commentary on whether Russia joins  NATO's "Partnership for Peace" and on what conditions. Writing  about the discussion of this issue in Brussels where Russian  Defence Minister Pavel Grachev is now on a visit, ROSSIISKIE  VESTI calls as justified a thesis that cooperation with  industrialised nations is a priority question for Russia.    "If we are invited to military cooperation," the newspaper  notes, "may be it would be good to link this issue with opening  European markets for Russian goods."    The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper carries an interview with  Director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service Sergey  Stepashin, which he gave on the eve of a meeting between Boris  Yeltsin and the service's leadership (to be held on Thursday).    Stepashin criticises "some newspapers, radio stations and TV  companies" which have turned, in actual fact, into ordinary  commercial firms. He calls on them to reject "good profits" if  information suggested to them "smacks of bad taste or is  supplied by shady people".    Speaking of the "classic" presence of Western secret  services  in Russia, Stepashin expresses confidence that nobody plans to  destroy Russia. However, "many do not want this huge state,  when it takes to its feet, to become a rising political and  economic competitor to Western countries".    Writing about the Russian-Ukrainian Government talks on the  Black Sea Fleet in Moscow, the same newspaper singles out a  desire of the sides "not to declare simply agreement in the  spirit of contacts between the presidents but to come to a real  agreement".    This means, the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA continues, that  "politicians in Kiev start understanding the danger of  protracting the fleet's crisis, since the fleet's problem,  coupled with the political crisis in the Crimea as well as  relations between Kiev and Simferopol, can turn into a dangerous  detonator for aggravating the situation".    Noting that the talks on the Black Sea Fleet are not over,  the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper points to the need for greater  caution in forecasting their results, since experience shows  that the sides repeatedly came to an understanding on the Black  Sea Fleet, which would be later interpreted in their own  individual ways.    "Let us hope that this will not be the case with the present  talks," the daily says.    The TRUD newspaper writes about growing unemployment in the  Russian Federation. Referring to data from the Russian Labour  Ministry, the newspaper notes that "real joblessness is assessed  between two and six million people now".    In this connection, the daily prints readers' letters  demonstrating how national industry "dies away". One of them  reads: Russia's only factory producing trolleybuses in the city  of Engels works part-time.    All grounds around the factory are packed with ready-made  machines, since there are no purchasers. This is despite the  fact that Russian cities are in dire need of new trolleybuses.    This situation has developed due to the fact that the  government stopped subsidies to public transport, and local  authorities have no funds to replace old machines.    The PRAVDA newspaper censures a television report on  Wednesday that there is only one million jobless people in  Russia. "The concealment of real data on unemployment," the  newspaper notes, "can aggravate a social eruption brewing in  Russia."    Referring to information of the international labour  organisation, PRAVDA writes that there are some seven million  jobless in Russia, and the figure will rise to ten million by  next december.    The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper writes about fires  inflicting huge material damage on the country. According to  the daily, "the quantity of damaged areas rose by 50 per cent  last year as against the previous figure.    Fires afflicted 15 million hectares in the forest and  non-forest zones, destroying timber and other materials worth  110 billion roubles. Moreover, fire-fighting operations  resulted in a damage worth 200 billion roubles.    The St. Petersburg-based NEVSKOYE VREMYA newspaper informs  its readers of a scandal which erupted at the end of a  conference at the Svetlana Joint Stock Society, one of the  largest in the city.    The conference which discussed the results of a labour  contract between the local and the management over the past  year, lasted three days and ended in a no-confidence vote in the  factory's managing director Vladimir Bashkatov who was accused  of "red-tape and ducking talks with the trade union".    If the manager is not sacked, it was announced that some  workers will go on a hunger strike right at workshops.</p>

Quoting its own source, YONHAP reported  that the anti-establishment underground movement operated  secretly from late 1991, mainly with students from the Kim  Il-song University, but that the North Korean university  students who took part in the underground organization were  arrested by the authorities because moves by Chinese students  studying in the North, who were part of the organization, were  exposed by the Chinese Embassy in Pyongyang in early 1992.</p>

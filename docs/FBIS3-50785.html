Backwardness and poverty have  existed in that beloved part of the Republic for many decades.  In the past five years, we have worked hard and have invested  many resources to correct this situation.    This has been possible because of many different social  organizations that have maintained a constant dialogue with the  government, and this dialogue has been fruitful. Nevertheless,  a different kind of organization has emerged in Chiapas State.  National and foreign experts on violence, who have nothing to do  with the efforts being made by the people of Chiapas, have  inflicted a painful blow against a region of this state and  against the heart of all Mexicans.    This is why it has been correctly said that we must  establish  a distinction between two situations that exist in Chiapas: The  armed aggression from a violent group, and the situation derived  from the poverty and shortcomings in that region.    There is no Indian uprising in Chiapas. There is an action  by a violent armed group that is acting against the peaceful  state of the communities, public peace, and government  institutions -- that is, against all those things that the  Mexicans have been working to build for generations, and, for  this reason, those things we appreciate so much.    The violent ones are carrying out discredited actions. In  countries where this type of violence has existed, the result  has been destruction and backwardness. An action like this has  never produced social progress for the poor or democratic  progress in any country. The events in Chiapas sadden all  Mexicans, because even after recognizing inequalities, for many  years Mexicans have worked to open the way for respect,  dialogue, and peace.    Attacks on Indians, on people from those cities, on  policemen, on soldiers from the National Army are wrong. In  addition, it is not fair to make attempts on anyone's life.  They are all Mexicans; they deserve the greatest respect. At  the same time, it is disturbing that, by taking advantage of  this situation, some are trying to damage the name of Mexico,  which has taken so much time and effort to build.    Attempts to undermine the country's prestige would not  contribute to resolving social or economic problems and would  not produce political progress. Therefore, this is an action  that goes against national interests. This armed group is  against Mexico.    The objectives of the armed group in Chiapas have not been  secured. Several Indian and rural communities have rejected  these people. Many Indian and peasant communities of Chiapas  have demanded protection from the Mexican Army and have offered  to participate in efforts to avoid the aggression.    We are making firm progress, although the situation is still  delicate because the aggressors have continued attacking our  soldiers. They can continue producing isolated actions of  violence. No country can avoid this, but they will fail.    The resoluteness of the Mexicans united against violence  will  defeat them. They were offered a dialogue from the very  beginning of the confrontation. They responded with more acts  of violence. We again reiterate our offer for dialogue.    The roads of participation are open to everyone. New avenues  may be opened if we persevere in our way of doing things, in our  tradition of working in peace and united. No one wants a Mexico  in which liberties are reduced in an effort to guarantee  security. No one wants to suspend constitutional guarantees in  that region of Chiapas.    Violence does not generate more freedom or democracy but,  rather, hatred and political narrow-mindedness.    The Army and the state's security forces are fulfilling  their  duties in accordance with the law.    The government's actions have had two purposes: the first,  to protect the lives of the civilian population; and the second,  to reestablish normalcy in the region -- normalcy Chiapas  residents are so fond of -- normalcy that will allow us to  devote all of our efforts to promoting more justice. To achieve  the first objective, we have protected the personal safety of  citizens and the security of communities. To achieve this  second objective, those criminals who have been arrested are  being placed under the custody of the Attorney General's Office,  which takes its authority from local authorities.    The most important priority has been to protect the civilian  population and to restore the possibility of a peaceful solution  to the conflict. To protect the civilian population of this  area from the difficulties they are experiencing, we have  launched programs to deliver food, blankets, and medicine, and  other public health programs are under way to deal with  emergencies, prevent diseases, and reestablish medical care in  the hospitals damaged by the attackers. Army personnel are  protecting and distributing much of these badly needed supplies  in this area.    The actions of the government of the Republic are within the  framework of the Constitution. The law will be applied  strictly. The authorities' firm action will not be exercised  against the communities, which we respect and support, or  against the many organizations that work hard in the area in a  dedicated manner and with which we have held dialogues.    For those facing conditions of poverty, and for those who  have participated in these actions because of deceit, pressure,  or even desperation -- for these people who end their violent  and illegal actions, we will seek honorable treatment, and we  will even consider granting a pardon. The government of the  Republic has the unyielding determination to resolve this  conflict and fully reestablish the state of law in this part of  Chiapas with a clear and firm commitment, respecting human  rights.    My fellow Mexicans: There is clear commitment to respect for  human rights. There is a national consensus in favor of peace.  In light of the events that have taken place in Chiapas State,  this Monday I asserted, before the Permanent Commission of the  Congress of the Republic, that within no region of Mexico are  differences so great that they preclude our capacity for  dialogue, nor is there enough distance to undermine our  fundamental unity. This will always be the way things are.    At the same time, I want to express my gratitude for the  responsible support stated today by all the political forces of  the country -- support against violence. Once the fighting  concludes in the area of conflict in the state of Chiapas, this  region will continue to advance in its objectives of more  justice for Indian communities and in favor of those who need  more. By standing united, we Mexicans will continue to progress  and will be able to make Mexico's democratic life stronger for  the wellbeing of everyone and, above all else, for the  well-being of our children. Thank you, very much.</p>

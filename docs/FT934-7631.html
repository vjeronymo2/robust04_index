			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / SPD's leader wins key support MR Rudolf Scharping, the youthful leader of Germany's opposition Social Democrats (SPD), yesterday won vital support from his party conference for his middle-of-the-road platform to regain power in next year's national elections. After a debate lasting into the early hours of the morning, he persuaded his wavering supporters in the SPD to back a resolution to allow electronic eavesdropping of private homes in the campaign against organised crime. He won clear endorsement of the use of German troops in UN peacekeeping operations - although equally clear rejection of any use of the military in combat operations outside the Nato area. He also gained a big majority for a tough economic programme, focused on the fight against unemployment, but stressing heavily the need for strict control of state spending. The three vital resolutions, on the economy, internal security and foreign policy, represented a clear move by Mr Scharping to present his party as a pragmatic alternative to the ruling conservative-liberal coalition headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl.

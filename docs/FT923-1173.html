			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Observer: Becalmed What is going on at Sir Nigel Broackes' Trafalgar House? The shares of the embattled conglomerate slipped to 50p yesterday - capitalising the group at around Pounds 250m - and Lord Matthews, Sir Nigel's old partner, tells me that he is as puzzled as everybody else at the decline of his old employer. It is almost 10 years since he and Trafalgar's newspaper interests were spun off, yet he retains as lively an interest as ever in the affairs of the conglomerate. 'If the business is going to continue, then the shares are a ridiculous price,' he tells Observer from his farm in Jersey. However, what worries him is that he has seen no sign of Trafalgar's directors buying shares at current depressed levels. According to Directus, the Edinburgh-based firm which monitors directors' share dealings, it is 9 months since Trafalgar's directors bought shares at levels more than double the current price. Sir Nigel and his family sold a chunk in May, at around 133p, and since then nothing. Lord Matthews says this makes him 'very cautious'. The company, which normally reports its full year figures in December, is not yet in its close season which would prevent directors' dealing. One possible explanation is that the directors know of some potentially price-sensitive deal - such as a large asset sale - which prevents them underscoring their confidence in the business by topping up their stakes.</p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMERCIAL SCENE: DEVELOPER CREATES NEW FIRM, SEEKING PROJECTS  </P> <P> Developer Alan Lowy has created Pacific Prime Properties Inc. to replace  troubled Lowy Development Corp.  </P> <P> Within the last year, Lowy's company was forced to bow out of several  construction projects and take two partnerships into bankruptcy. All the  projects are now sold -- with the exception of a deep hole at 4848 Wilshire  Blvd. in the Park Mile area of Los Angeles that was set to become a  60,000-square-foot office building.  </P> <P> Parkmile Associates Ltd. filed for Chapter 11 protection in February after  lender ITT Commercial Finance filed a notice of default on its $3.18 million  loan. Lowy says he expects to sell the property within the next 45 days for  between $2 million and $2.6 million, with ITT taking a hit for the balance.  </P> <P> Lowy pre-leased most of the planned office project before construction began,  but financial difficulties with other projects in downtown Los Angeles dried up  his financing, he said, leaving him little choice but to fold.  </P> <P> The longtime Los Angeles developer said he is searching for projects in Orange  County and the Antelope Valley with new partner Howard Fuhrman. Fuhrman  recently left his post as vice president-finance at Janss Corp.  </P> <P> "I've tried very hard to protect my reputation through all of this," Lowy said.  "I hope people still feel good about me personally."  </P></p>

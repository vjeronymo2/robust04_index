			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: Nortel strengthens Matra ties Northern Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications equipment maker, is cementing a two-year alliance with France's Matra Communications by raising its stake in the group, from 20 to 50 per cent. During the next year or so, Northern will invest about USDollars 140m in Matra, and convert an existing USDollars 150m exchangeable debenture into equity. These commitments will raise Northern's total investment to about USDollars 430m. France's Lagardere media and industrial group, formerly Matra-Hachette, owns the remaining shares in Matra. The focal point of Northern's interest is Matra's cellular business, which is based on the European GSM standard. Nortel-Matra Cellular, a joint venture, recently won a USDollars 100m contract in Taiwan, in what is believed to be one of the largest deals so far for GSM equipment. Part of Northern Telecom's capital injection will reinforce the capital of the two groups in this venture. The venture has recently won contracts in Tunisia and from Mercury in the UK, and plans to use the new cash to recruit an extra 150 engineers for its French-based research centre. Matra also has a 20 per cent share of the French private branch exchange (PBX) market, and has given Northern a window to several other parts of the European telecoms business. 'We're now seeing some fruits of the alliance,' a Northern official said.</p>

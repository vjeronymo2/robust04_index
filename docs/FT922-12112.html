			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / NatWest expects operationsin US to return to black NATIONAL Westminster Bank's US operations are on course to make after-tax profits of more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 57m) this year, having made cumulative losses of Dollars 860m since 1989. This was confirmed by Mr John Tugwell, chairman of the US subsidiary, NatWest Bancorp, who said yesterday he expected 'Dollars 100m to Dollars 120m profit for the year'. The bank has suffered since 1989 from exposure to the depressed New Jersey property market. But Mr Tugwell said reserves to cover future loan losses were now more than adequate. He added that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates US banks, had agreed that NatWest Bancorp had a 'surplus of tens of millions of dollars' in its loan-loss reserve above the amount needed as cover against losses. NatWest's gross income in the US is more than Dollars 1bn, compared with expenses of Dollars 650m. It would therefore make a pre-tax profit of Dollars 350m in the unlikely event there were no loan losses. However, Mr Tugwell said even a profit of Dollars 350m would not represent an acceptable return on the capital NatWest had invested. 'We have to get to Dollars 400m in the long term,' he said. But he hinted that NatWest was not keen to dispose of its US business in the near future. He said the US operation would not have to pay tax on the next Dollars 1bn of profit because it was able to carry forward for tax purposes the losses it had been making. But any bank which bought the US business would not have the benefit of these tax losses, under US tax rules. So he said it made sense to 'keep (the business) until it has made Dollars 1bn of profits'. Nevertheless, senior New York bankers say both Chase Manhattan Bank and Chemical Bank, two of the biggest US banks, are interested in acquiring NatWest's network of 270 branches. Mr Tugwell said he was interested in buying bank branches to add to the existing network of 270. 'We need a greater concentration of branches,' he said. He would also like to acquire credit card businesses. He became chairman of NatWest Bancorp last year and, since then, has changed the bank's system of assessing credit risk, made 'dozens' of senior staff changes and retrained staff.</p>

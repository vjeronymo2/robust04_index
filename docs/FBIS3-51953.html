			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by J.C.] </F>   [Text] Although a code of ethics, which every member of the  next government will be asked to sign, has not yet been drafted,  President-elect Carlos Roberto Reina announced the names of his  cabinet members yesterday and confirmed that two ministries will  be occupied by members of the National Party of Honduras [PNH].    It became clear that the new public administration is  willing  to implement a moral revolution and that crimes will not go  unpunished, and thus, many people could be investigated after  the current government completes its term.    President Reina presented seven ministers in the company of  National Congress President Carlos Flores, former President Jose  Azcona, and banker Jorge Bueso Arias.    The new cabinet consists of Efrain Moncada Silvia,  government  and justice minister; General Reynaldo Andino Flores, national  defense and public security minister; Cecilio Zavala Mendez,  labor and social welfare minister; Zenobia Rodas de Leon Gomez,  public education minister; German Aparicio, communications and  public works minister; and Rodolfo Pastor Fasquelle, culture and  tourism minister. Reina announced that PNH member Carlos  Medina, minister of the recently created Environment Ministry,  will stay in that post.    The president also announced the following will serve as  ministers without portfolio: Guillermo Bueso as coordinator of  the economic cabinet; Dante Ramirez as coordinator of Central  American integration issues; and Jorge Bueso Arias as  coordinator of advisory issues.    To complete his team, Reina confirmed the following  nominees:  Ernesto Paz Aguilar, foreign minister; Delmer Urbizo Panting,  economy and commerce minister; Juan Ferrera, finance and public  credit minister; Guillermo Molina Chocano, coordination, budget,  and planning (Secplan) minister; Enrique Samayoa, public health  minister; and Ramon Villeda Bermudez, natural resources minister.    As for the decentralized institutions, he only presented  Ubodoro Arriaga Ireheta, Hugo Noe Pino, who was ratified as  president of the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH), and Lucio  Izaguirre, as his private secretary. [sentence as published]  <H5>  The Day Is Not Far Away </H5>   Reina said he fulfilled his promise to establish an  integration government by appointing Juan Ferrera as finance  minister and Carlos Medina as environment minister. The two are  PNH members.    When asked about the nomination of Andino Flores as defense  minister, the president said that in the future a civilian will  occupy that post, "and I have already discussed this with the  Army High Command, which will soon be under my leadership as  commander of the Armed Forces."    "The day is not far away for the appointment of a civilian  in  that post," Reina said.    Two days before his installation, the president said other  positions at decentralized institutions will be announced in due  time.    Reina also explained that later on he will be providing  details concerning the press minister and that there will be no  presidency minister. These are the only two ministries that  have not been presented. He explained that his brother, Mario  Reina Idiaquez, will be in the Presidency Office, but he will  not bear the title of presidency minister.    Reina said upon return from the United States that he has  tried to spread the idea that America and the world are headed  for a convergence and that the most important issue at the turn  of the century will be the agenda shared throughout the  continent by democrats.    Reina stressed the "huge responsibility" of fulfilling the  campaign promise of a moral revolution, which will be faced by  himself and the people who will join him in the new government.    Reina explained during a news conference that as  president-elect, as the head of the Central Executive Council  [Consejo Central Ejecutivo] and as a citizen, he had suggested  the names of possible Supreme Court justices to the deputies,  whose duty it is to elect that body.    Although he made it clear that he knows the deputies alone  have the final word, he said: "I urge my friends to support  these candidates. I presented the names to them at a meeting,  and I cannot disclose them, because I do not want any  interference regarding the respect the executive branch should  maintain for the legislative and judicial branches."    "What I would never tolerate is a Supreme Court that does  not  meet the requirements for a moral revolution. I would never  tolerate that," he said.    Concerning economic measures, Reina said he will stick to  his  decision against additional taxes, which, he said, is a decision  only he can make and which must not be based on suggestions or  outside pressures from anyone. Thus, he expects to maintain  safe and sound his desire to carry out a moral revolution.    Reina confirmed that one of the problems with which his  government must deal is the fact that the international  organizations have declared the country ineligible for loans,  but Hondurans "will face these difficulties united, with a  united party and a united people."    Although flattering figures have been mentioned during  Rafael  Leonardo Callejas' government, Reina said "surprising figures  are gradually emerging, but I have entrusted the economic  cabinet to the best people I could find, and it is up to them  and to all of us to deal with the crisis."    One of Reina's strongest campaign promises was the guarantee  that he would combat corruption, which he said "would not be  easy." In view of this, he has asked every Honduran to get a  full understanding of the Ethics Code which will be published,  "because if these challenges are not met, it will be impossible  to help the people."    Reina added that he invited the former presidential  precandidates to yesterday's meeting so that they could express  their views regarding the resolution, although that is the  president's duty.    Asked why he only appointed one woman to a key position,  Reina said women will be appointed to other important posts and  that proof of this is that there are many female mayors,  although there will be no battle between the sexes.    A cabinet is not for four years, Reina said, and women may  be  appointed if any of the current nominees fail; therefore, there  is not a shred of prejudice in the appointments.</p>

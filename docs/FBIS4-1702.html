			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 1 (XINHUA) -- China's trade  system, in wake of institutional decentralization and more  foreign direct investment, is now "significantly more open" than  the U.S. and Japan, the World Bank said today.    "Despite a complex array of tariff and nontariff barriers to  trade, China has become a relatively open economy, with evidence  of considerable tariff redundancy," the bank said in a recently  concluded country study report.    The study, entitled "China: Foreign Trade Reform", noted  that  the people's republic, now the 11th largest exporter in the  world, has made "dramatic progress" in reforming its trade  system in recent years.    Import penetration in certain sectors in China, the study  said, is "extremely high", standing at 28 percent of the gross  value of industrial output of China's machinery and transport  equipment sector in 1990.    "The present is an opportune time for China to embark on a  substantive program of trade liberalization," the report said,  stressing that the importance of trade planning in China has  been "declining".    Since 1979, when the world's most populous country began its  market-oriented reforms, China's exports have increased ninefold  and imports more than sevenfold.    "The promotion of external trade has been central to China's  efforts to modernize its economy," the study said. China's  economy, it said, has become "significantly more open than the  U.S. and Japan."    The share of merchandise trade in China's gross domestic  product went from 10 percent in 1978 to 31 percent in 1991, with  imports accounting for 15 percent. China "appears to be more  than twice as open as India and Brazil," it said.    In 1978, the study said, trade in China was monopolized by  12  foreign trade corporations and there was no foreign direct  investment.    But by 1992, over 3,600 such corporations competed for  export  business and over 90,000 foreign direct investment projects had  been approved with a contracted value of 58.1 billion U.S.  dollars, the study said.    In the 1980s, the study said, China's exports outperformed  those of most other countries, including such newly  industrialized economies as Malaysia. China now exports about  17 percent of the gross value of industrial output of its  overall manufacturing sector.    According to China customs statistics, China's trade surplus  with the United States, Hong Kong and Germany in 1992 were  respectively 15.4 billion, 7.8 billion and 1.6 billion dollars.    During the same period, China's trade deficits with China's  Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea stood at 10.4 billion, 5.5  billion and 1.2 billion dollars respectively.</p>

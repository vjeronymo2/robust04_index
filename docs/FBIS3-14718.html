The Iranian embassy was reacting to the news that the Cesty  publishing house intends to publish a Czech translation of "The  Satanic Verses."    In an interview for NOVA television, a transcript of which  the Iranian embassy gave CTK, Djoneidi said that the publication  of Rushdie's controversial book in the Czech Republic was not  yet definite. He also said he did not believe the Czech  Government inclined towards damaging good relations with Islamic  countries. Relations between the Czech Republic and Iran were  good, he said, and were expanding in all directions.    Asked about Iran's response to the possible publication of  the book in the Czech Republic, Djoneidi pointed to the official  stance of the Iranian Government, according to which the work is  politically motivated blasphemy against Islam and Muslims.    "The publication of such an insultive book is not  acceptable,  but the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran will not take  any measure to cause violation of international law, practice  and any other internationally recognized norms," Djoneidi said.    The translation and publication of "The Satanic Verses" is  "the most outrageous act against Islam and Muslims all over the  world, he said, adding that the book had been banned in many  non-Islamic countries as well as Islamic ones, because it had  been "recognized to be contrary to well known freedom  principles." When the book was regarded as blasphemous by more  than a billion Muslims throughout the world, it was an "obvious  act of violation against the Universal Declaration of Human  Rights as well."    Another publication of the book, Djoneidi said, could only  help "flame up the wickedness of the author and policies  oriented against Islamic countries."    "Such an assault on Islamic values could certainly endanger  world peace and security, and, of course, the responsibility for  any possible backfire would lie with the assaulters," the  Iranian spokesman said.    Asked by NOVA whether the death penalty was the only  punishment with which the writer and any publishers were faced,  or whether it could be substituted by other penalties, such as a  financial one, Djoneidi also stressed that the religious decree  (fatwa) which had been issued by the highest Iranian religious  authorities was out of the reach of the government.</p>

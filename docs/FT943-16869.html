			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / European road plan widened The Department of Transport has added 17 new sections of road to the British part of a controversial Europe-wide network intended to improve communications within the European Union. Many of the roads in England, Wales and Scotland added to the trans-European road network (Tern) are linked with ports. The original Tern network was agreed last October but prompted protests from some towns which felt they had been neglected and from other communities fearful that inclusion in the list would lead to large increases in traffic. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said the revised list had been drawn up after consultation with local highway authorities, freight transport groups and environmental organisations. The list will be put to the European Commission and the Council of Ministers for their final approval. Roads to be added to the network in England include the M27 between Southampton and Portsmouth, the M62 and M58 between Liverpool and the M6, the A120 between the A12 near Colchester and Harwich, and the A20 between Folkestone and Dover, the M25 between junctions 3 and 5 and the eastern section of the M42. In Scotland the A77 between Ayr and Stranraer, the M8/A8 Glasgow to Greenock and the A82/A87 from Glasgow to Uig on Skye have been added, and in Wales the A477 between St Clears and Pembroke Dock and the A465/A40 Heads of the Valleys route from the M4 near Swansea to Raglan.</p>

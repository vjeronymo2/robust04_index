			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town May 22 SAPA -- Safety and Security  Minister Sydney Mufamadi says he is "extremely concerned at  increasing indications of an escalation of violence in  KwaZulu/Natal and the East Rand". In a statement on Sunday, Mr  Mufamadi said every possible step had to be taken by both the  state and civil society to avoid a repetition of the destructive  cycle of violence experienced before the elections.    "Now that South Africa has a democratically elected and  representative government, absolutely no reason whatsoever  exists for the kind of political violence which has ravaged our  country in the past.    "This madness must stop. It cannot be allowed to destroy or  blight the future of our people," he said.    Mr Mufamadi added that the Ministry of Safety and Security  and the South African Police service were engaged in an  intensive analysis of the current situation in order to develop  a comprehensive strategy to prevent South Africa from falling  victim to another destructive cycle of violence.</p>

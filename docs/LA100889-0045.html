			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GOOD HEALTH MAGAZINE  </P> <P> It's easy to see why doctors are so taken by Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Apart  from providing a way to avoid repeated exposure to X-rays, which carry an  accumulating risk (albeit slight) even in small doses, it reveals aspects of  the body that can't be visualized by the most sophisticated CT scanners. It  shows the subtle differences between the brain's white and gray matter. It  reveals the smallest lesions in the spine and brain stem. It is fast becoming  the method of choice for detecting herniated disks, knee injuries and tiny  blood vessel blockages.  </P> <P> MRI is especially useful in neurological examinations. At Huntington Medical  Research Institutes, Dr. William G. Bradley reports that nearly a third of  patients over 60 who had undergone cranial scans at his unit showed indications  of vessel blockages in the brain, yet they displayed no external sign of any  problem. Such "mini strokes," as Bradley calls them, are unlikely to have been  picked up by a CT scan. (Don't say "cat" scan; using that abandoned term will  mark you as a medical illiterate.)  </P> <P> MRI can also detect small tumors and other abnormalities of the central nervous  system, which until now could only be revealed by biopsy -- a surgical probing  that doctors and patients understandably prefer to avoid when the suspect  tissue happens to lie within the brain or spinal cord. It can also resolve very  faint areas of inflammation in the brain, such as those associated with viral  encephalitis, a sometimes deadly disease if it isn't caught soon enough. An  especially compelling demonstration of MRI's diagnostic power is its ability to  spot, at a very early stage, the minuscule brain plaques that are the mark of  multiple sclerosis, a degenerative disease of the central nervous system .  Though MS can't be cured yet, early detection can lead to a more comfortable  management of the disease with the help of drugs to ease some of its symptoms.  </P> <P> In spite of MRI's advantages, however, CT scans aren't likely to disappear  soon. They remain the preferred diagnostic method for certain skeletal  disorders such as arthritis because X-rays are better able to visualize the  knots of calcification characteristic of that ailment. They also retain an edge  over MRI in diagnosing changes in blood flow caused by arterial blockages or  bleeding in the brain. And scans work more rapidly and are much less expensive  than MRI. A CT unit can be purchased for a few hundred thousand dollars, a  fraction of an MRI unit's cost. The difference is reflected in the bill for  each service. A typical X-ray session runs from $200 to $300, while an MRI  workup can range from $600 to $1,500.  </P> <P> Even so, many doctors feel the extra money may be well spent. Apart from  sparing the patient exposure to X-rays, MRI often identifies illnesses earlier,  thereby avoiding the expense of further tests, and sets the stage for quicker  treatment, increasing the chances of success. And for smaller hospitals  reluctant to foot the full bill for acquiring an MRI unit, there is a  money-saving alternative. They can share with like-minded hospitals a mobile  unit, such as GE's MAX scanner. Resembling an outsized Winnebago, these  MRI-systems-on-wheels come self-contained with magnets, computers and dressing  rooms. The unit pulls into a hospital's parking lot, plugs into the power  supply, cranks up its magnets and, in short order, starts receiving patients.  When the unit is finished with the hospital's patient load, it moves on. .  </P> <P> One such mobile -- shared by five hospitals in Cape Cod, Mass -- was recently  observed in action at the Falmouth, Mass., community hospital. As patients  entered the van, most weren't aware they'd stepped outside the hospital walls.  An airport-type docking gate had been installed at the rear of the building to  accept the unit. The patients had been shown a film on MRI or had been told by  their doctors what to expect. The technicians simply reminded the patients to  remove anything sensitive to magnetic fields, such as credit cards, mechanical  watches, even intrauterine devices (IUDs) and false teeth. (Loose metal objects  can become dangerously hurtling missiles if they're caught in the magnet.)  Anyone with a pacemaker or other type of ferromagnetic material in his body,  such as joint pins and surgical clips, would automatically be excluded. So  would pregnant women, unless the doctor deemed the examination essential; even  though there is no known risk to the fetus, physicians are cautious in their  use of the procedure.  </P> <P> Not all people take to lying quietly in what may seem like medicine's version  of a culvert. The first patient turned out to be severely claustrophobic. Only  minutes into the examination, she insisted on leaving the machine. The  technicians complied. "We never compel a patient to stay," explains Dr. James  Condon, head of the hospital's five-man radiology group. About 5% of patients  who undergo scanning discover they can't tolerate the confines for the hour or  so it takes to do the imaging. Frederic Golden  </P></p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Receiver sells rump of RFS Industries Price Waterhouse, receiver to RFS Industries, the former British Rail-owned engineering company, has sold the last of its businesses to a management buy-out, saving 350 jobs at the Doncaster-based company. RFS was a Pounds 5m management buy-out from BR in 1987, and was the first privatisation of its rolling stock manufacturing operations. However, the company used its revitalised finances to expand into new businesses, and having drastically over-extended itself, went into receivership in December 1993. The company's core rail passenger rolling stock and bogie design operations were sold in May to Bombardier Eurorail for an undisclosed sum. This represented about 80 per cent of group turnover. The remaining overhaul operations are being sold to the MBO. RFS employees will own 33 per cent of the company, with the remainder taken up by backers, including Yorkshire Fund Managers and Sun Life.</p>

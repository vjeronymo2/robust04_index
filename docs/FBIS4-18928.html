			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Peter Sturm editorial: "Saber Rattling in Pyongyang"] </F>   [Text] Time seems to have stopped on the Korean Peninsula.  The communist state in the north [DPRK] has isolated itself from  the outside world and is playing cat and mouse with it on the  nuclear issue. North Korea has again refused to give inspectors  of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] access to a  nuclear facility where nuclear weapons are allegedly being  developed. In addition, the regime in Pyongyang is spreading  slogans that are supposed to suggest that war is imminent. Even  though similar things were heard a year ago, this does not  necessarily permit the conclusion that this time, too,  everything will end peacefully.    In South Korea [ROK], reaction to the tension produced by  the  north is rather calm, but concern is not hidden. Seoul cannot  be interested in an armed conflict with the north because it is  just on the point of becoming a developed industrial state. In  addition, the capital city, with its 10 million inhabitants, is  only a few kilometers away from the demarcation line. While  South Korea relies on "persuading" the north, the United States  is demonstrating firmness. Washington has initiated the  deployment of antiaircraft missiles in South Korea. One also  speaks of a potential reinforcement of troops. The joint  U.S.-South Korean military maneuvers, which are now to be held  after all, are to be seen as a means of symbolic pressure. All  this, however, should not give rise to the assumption that the  United States is determined to engage in a war, if necessary.    Experiences from other areas of the world can be transposed  only to a limited extent. If, however, a state is like the  Stalinist-Communist North Korea, one may conclude that it is not  consolidated internally. This is not changed by the militant  rhetoric that is used by the regime toward the outside. In the  view of the Asian neighbors, this rather shows a rising degree  of weakness.    Not least thanks to its growing economic capacity, South  Korea, on the other hand, has managed to establish normal  relations with all real and potential allies of Pyongyang in the  region. Even though China is opposing sanctions, its support  for North Korea seems rather half-hearted. The countries in  Indochina are paying tribute to the alleged ideals of Socialism  only as a justification of their rule, but they are hardly  interested in cooperation with North Korea anymore.    Nevertheless, the saber rattling of the rulers in Pyongyang  has directed general attention to the relations of military  power in Korea. It turns out that the north has more weapons  than the south in practically all categories. However, what do  such figures tell? Since Stalin's time at the latest, it had  been part of the Soviet Union's military doctrine to have as  much as possible of everything. Not only in this respect does  "Great Leader" Kim Il-song prove to be an eager pupil of the  former Soviet despot. The only thing that would be illuminating  would be a comparison of the fighting power of the armed forces  of North Korea and those of South Korea, which will, however,  hardly be possible because of North Korea's isolation.    History knows many examples of dictators, whose arms quickly  dissolved as a result of pressure from the outside. From the  viewpoint of the regime in Pyongyang, a military conflict, which  no one can want, would mean a weakening of the -- at least  partly -- self-chosen isolation, but probably also the end of  Communist rule as such. Kim Il-song's power is, not least,  based on isolating his subjects from all information coming from  the "hostile" surroundings. For this purpose, Kim is  cultivating a unique personality cult. He likes to present  himself as the great resistance fighter against the former  colonial power Japan, knowing that this is well-received by  patriotic Koreans in the north and the south. However, the  scarce information that is available on this topic says that  Kim's "achievements" in the anti-Japanese resistance fight were  rather modest. If his fellow citizens were deprived of that  illusion, too, the foundation of the regime would be even worse  off. How important such myths for totalitarian states are is  shown by looking at the history of the Soviet Union. The rule  of the CPSU [Communist party of the Soviet Union] would probably  have collapsed much earlier, if the bolshevik leadership could  not have written the victory in World War II on its flag.    If the government in Pyongyang acted at least half-way  reasonably, it would have to do everything to avoid a war.  However, it is difficult to rely on that, given a regime whose  representatives have become prisoners of their own propaganda.  Nevertheless, the militant drumming in North Korea should be  received with a certain measure of skepticism. Prudent action,  which avoids unnecessary provocation, should be the common  guideline for the United States, China, Japan, and South Korea.  Perhaps North Korea would indeed be more accessible, as it has  repeatedly indicated, if it were finally recognized by  Washington.    Crises often reach a point where there does not seem to be  any way back. However, at the moment one cannot yet speak of an  unavoidable military conflict with North Korea. There is still  the hope that coordinated international pressure will bring the  rulers in Pyongyang to their senses.</p>

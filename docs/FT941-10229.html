			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Merger for Essex and Suffolk Water Two water companies controlled by Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez of France are to be merged, in a culmination of the rationalisation process set in train by the industry regulator three years ago. Essex Water and Suffolk Water, which distribute clean water to those regions, yesterday said the merger would 'improve the existing standards of service to customers' and provide greater efficiency. The enlarged company will have turnover of about Pounds 45m. Profits after tax in 1993 were approximately Pounds 18.6m at Essex and Pounds 4.3m at Suffolk. It is proposed that Essex offer 55 new shares for every 100 Suffolk with a cash alternative of Pounds 10. Suffolk's 11.5 per cent redeemable debenture stock holders will be offered Pounds 101 of new debenture stock for every Pounds 100 held.</p>

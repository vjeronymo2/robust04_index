			<p>930423 FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Freegold output behind Anglo American climb IMPROVED gold output from the Freegold mine helped the gold mining operations of South Africa's Anglo American group to record a 3.5 per cent increase in attributable profits to R209.8m (Dollars 66.2m) in the three months to the end of March, from R202.7m in the December quarter. Anglo American, the world's largest gold producer, lifted production by 1 per cent to 67,091kg from 66,399kg in the previous quarter. The average revenue rose by 2 per cent to R34,705 per kg from R34,040 per kg reflecting the benefits of hedging and a firmer gold price. Total costs rose by 2 per cent to R1.79bn from R1.75bn, with average unit costs 1 per cent higher at R26,731 per kg against R26,387 per kg. Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of Anglo American's gold and uranium division, noted that the attributable profits were 27 per cent higher than the quarterly average in 1992 of R165m. He was cautiously optimistic about the group's prospects. He said there was more of a positive attitude in the market towards gold, and there was 'definite scope now for gold to move into the Dollars 350 to Dollars 370 an ounce range.' This would benefit Anglo American's mines, he said, as no mine, taking any 12-month period, had more than 50 per cent of its production hedged. Freegold, the holding company for the group's Free State operations, achieved a quarterly production record of 30,054kg, up from 28,950kg in the December quarter. Its attributable profits rose by 22.8 per cent to R92.7m from R75.5m on the back of increased production, lower unit costs and a 2.6 per cent increase in the average price of gold. The group's Transvaal mines all performed solidly. Vaal Reefs's production was virtually unchanged at 18,901kg, but attributable profits fell to R55.6m from R61.8m as last quarter's figures included a dividend from Southvaal Holdings. The directors said Western Deep Levels had had its best first quarter in years, but attributable profits dropped to R32.6m from R40.1m due to a sharply higher tax charge.</p>

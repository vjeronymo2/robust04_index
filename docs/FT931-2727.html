			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Arts: Disappearing famously - Cinema HOFFA (15) Danny DeVito CANDYMAN (18) Bernard Rose CRUSH (15) Alison MacLean SOUNDS AND SILENTS I am 20 minutes into Hoffa, the David Mamet-scripted bio-epic about the controversial American union leader who 'vanished' mysteriously in 1975, and already my mind feels like Jack Nicholson's make-up. Wodges of mental putty seem to prevent the air getting to my brain-cells. When I move my head, it is weighed down by the world's stresses. And I seem to be hearing voices from another epoch: the monotone snap-crackle-platitudes of Warner Brothers bio-pictures of the 1930s and 1940s. After JFK and Malcolm X here is another attempt by American film-makers to process recent history into a Virtual Reality helmet. You put it on and it feels as snug as the face-puffing prosthesis sported by Mr Nicholson. And you are right there, insists the film, as the young Hoffa pummels America's grumbling pre-war truckers into the close-knit Teamsters Union. You feel the terror of Armand Assante's hot breath and Italian accent as our fund-seeking hero beds down with the Mafia. You are there with the TV cameras watching Hoffa row with Attorney General Robert Kennedy, played with cowlick and stammering nasal twang by Kevin Anderson. And you watch the growing friendship between Hoffa/Nicholson and co-star Danny DeVito, who directs the film as well as playing his fictional best friend, Sancho Panza to the American labour leader's Don Quixote. Make that Jiminy Cricket to his Pinocchio. For history, if not screenwriter Mamet, claims that Hoffa, who famously disappeared in 1975 and is now presumed to be part of the New Jersey Turnpike (courtesy of Cosa Nostra Building And Interment Services), was not above lying, bribing, conniving and embezzling. But instead of his nose getting longer, his chutzpah did. His hatred of the Kennedys exceeded even Malcolm X's. He bullied where he could not persuade. He put his hand in the till of Organised Crime. Finally, when America could stand no more, he was shoved in jail. Several years later he was freed by Nixon - it takes one to pardon one - and after a few years of impotent railing at the usurpation of his union by ex-comrades he vanished into legend. The real Hoffa was last seen at a roadside diner outside Detroit. This allows Mamet and DeVito to sculpt their best scenes from Hitchcockian surmise. These open, close and punctuate the movie: Nicholson and DeVito in a waiting roadster; suspicious chap in diner; final flurry of guns, blood and Mafia removal van. The rest of the film, alas, consists of large, congealed chunks of flashback. As in Chaplin, the use of a retrospective framing device does not so much 'shape' the story as chill and distance it. Hoffa becomes a two-and-a-quarter-hour trip through Memory Mausoleum. Doubly removed by the 'frame' of the movie screen and the 'frame' of the I-remember roadside scenes, the long narrative tableaux become dull with historical ineluctability and dubious reverence. Even when Mamet is frank enough to admit that Hoffa could be nasty when crossed - blowing up a warehouse, sending a set of unidentified severed genitalia to a newspaper editor - the film never quite escapes its woofly piety. For one thing, the screenwriter never concedes that if Hoffa sold his soul it might have been (as many believe) to line his own pockets as much as his union's. For another the violence, verbal and actual, is delivered by Jack Nicholson, a man who exudes charisma even while standing still with a latex-paralysed face reciting make-my-day threats. The film is a soapbox masquerading as a cinema experience. Worst of all are the would-be epic scenes of They-versus-Us confrontation in streets or factory yards. Here, just as the soundtrack's initial splats and crunches are slowly drowned by uplifting music, the particular brutalities of mob violence are engulfed by the inspirational-generic. Note the way the camera cranes celestially upward to turn a fracas into a heroic fresco. So the cinema of holy revisionism marches on, building its gallery of saints and martyrs. No doubt the next blockbusting bio-pic will be about that warm reformer, union organiser and family man Al Capone. He did after all create wealth, establish a fraternity of hardworking entrepreneurs and help supply a needy nation with previously inaccessible beverages. Jack Nicholson and David Mamet, strap on your hagiographic harnesses again . . . ***** If you look in a mirror five times and say 'Candyman', claims the film of that title, a tall man with a hook for a hand will materialise and disembowel you. I have just tried this in my bathroom, urged on by intellectual curiosity, and it failed to work. Should one ask for one's money back? One should perhaps ask for it back anyway. Clive Barker wrote the original story, The Forbidden, from which writer-director Bernard Rose (Paperhouse, Chicago Joe And The Showgirl) has fashioned this screamer that fails to scream. First reason: the film runs out of plot after half an hour, by which time we know all we will know - certainly all we will want to know - about the ghostly gentleman with the limited repertoire of sadism and the background as a murder victim who fell foul of a lynch-mob back in 1890. Not to mention the Ph. D-writing heroine (Virginia Madsen) and her limited range of spooked expressions. Reason two: no one has any reason for doing the things they do. Why did the murderers of the original Candyman, a black artist who made a white girl pregnant, use such an odd combination of brutalities? (Hand-lopping followed by honey-bees). Why does Candyman return to terrorise a Chicago slum tenement? Why does Miss Madsen want to write a life-endangering Ph. D? Why do girl and ghoul end up tussling with each other inside a giant bonfire? (Answer to this one: the Guy Fawkes climax to the English story has been transferred to America and lost all meaning.) A shame after the creepy first half-hour. Here the director tries out his celestial camera angles, turning Chicago into a bird's-eye maze, and the dialogue's Gothic nihilism still has novelty value ('What's blood for if not for spilling?') But as with many horror films, once the explanations and elaborations begin, fear jumps up, asks for its hat and vanishes to another hunting-ground. ***** I find I wrote two short notes on the back of my press hand-out for Alison MacLean's Crush: 'Rilke' and 'Bubbling mud-pools behind credits'. Weird scenery and poetic attitudinising are the chief characteristics of this New Zealand psychodrama. It begins with a bang - a car crash, leaving one healthy survivor (Marcia Gay Harden) and one soon-to-be-embittered cripple (Donogh Rees) - and then spirals into a tale of jealousy, revenge, Rilke-quoting and the go-between antics of a young girl (Caitlin Bossley) who engineers the final death duel in lovely, scenic Rotorua. Debut features from undernourished movie cultures are always welcome. But this one resembles an Antonioni movie hit over the head with a rolled-up New Zealand travel poster. Nothing convinces us, therefore nothing moves us. And the three main characters are skeletally drawn and schematically scripted. When one of them plunged to her death down a waterfall-ribboned chasm, I found myself admiring the palm trees and wondering about the cost of return flights to Auckland. The week's best film experience may not be in a cinema at all. Sounds And Silents is a three-day event celebrating the art of film composing from early music by Satie and Saint-Saens to an exciting new score by Jonathan Lloyd for Hitchcock's reissued silent classic Blackmail. Queen Elizabeth Hall, starting tonight with Blackmail; get busy if you want tickets.</p>

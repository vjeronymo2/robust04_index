			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["International Forum" column by Gu Ping (0657 1627): "More </F> Respect, Less Threats"]    [Text] The United States has adopted diplomatic measures  one after another in Asia within a short period of only a few  days: It reached agreement with Japan to resume trade talks, it  renewed China's most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status and  delinked human rights from trade, it agreed with Vietnam on  mutually establishing official liaison offices, and it is  willing to resume high-level talks with the DPRK. At the same  time, there are reports that the United States is drastically  transferring its officials responsible for Asian affairs.  People with discerning eyes know well that the Clinton  administration is readjusting its Asia policies to improve ties  with Asia.    For some time, the United States has experienced  difficulties  in Asia. In the U.S.-Japanese trade talks, it insisted on  taking a tough stand on "numerical targets." As Japan refused  to give in, economic and trade ties between the two countries  were unprecedentedly tense. On ties with China, the United  States took the question of human rights as an excuse to  wantonly interfere in and condemn China's internal affairs,  which was naturally opposed by China. On the question of the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, the United States  threatened to impose sanctions against the DPRK, while the ROK,  Japan, and other countries intend to resolve the problem through  dialogue and consultations. Moreover, the United States has  also had disputes and quarrels with many other Asian nations on  a series of issues. The United States meddled in the sentence  passed on an American youth by Singapore for damaging public and  private property and forced Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand to  make concessions and accept U.S. requirements on labor,  intellectual property rights, and other issues....    These aggressive U.S. policies have thrown it into a  predicament in Asia. Moreover, they have also invited fierce  criticism from the media at home and upset a number of  government figures. U.S. papers have commented on the failure  of U.S. policy toward Asia, describing it as "a train moving  toward a steep cliff." In a memo to the Secretary of State  written not long ago, a senior official in the State Department  warned candidly that "relations between the United States and  Asia have reached a critical stage." "Unless the principles are  appropriately readjusted, we may damage U.S. influence and  interests."    It is ironic that U.S. Asia policy has run aground at  precisely the time when the United States has continuously  asserted that it "attaches importance to Asia" and intends to  make Asia its "new friend." Since last year, the Clinton  administration has clearly placed "economic security" at the top  of its three major diplomatic goals. For this reason, President  Clinton presided over the unofficial APEC meeting in Seattle  last November in a bid to use Asia's economic prosperity and  huge market to promote U.S. economic recovery and consolidate  its "global leading position." As a matter of fact, the United  States should have maintained good relations of trust with Asia  in order to safeguard its economic and geopolitical interests.  In its contacts with the developing Asian nations, however, the  United States has considered itself to be a "big brother," used  its strength to bully the weak, frequently made indiscreet  remarks on the internal affairs of other countries, and even  tried to impose its ideology and values on others. This cannot  but evoke criticisms and objection from Asian nations.  Moreover, these efforts by the United States in Asia will also  fall through. Such results, which run counter to its desires,  have precisely exposed the problems in U.S. policy toward Asia.    If the United States wants to improve relations with Asian  nations, it must acquire a deeper understanding of Asia's  reality; respect the social systems, cultural traditions, and  values of Asian nations; and get along with Asian countries  based on an equal footing. In a word, unless the United States  forsakes its "dominating" power politics of bullying others  using the advantage of its strength, it will be impossible for  it to restore its Asian diplomacy. It is time to pay more  respect and make less threats to Asian nations.</p>

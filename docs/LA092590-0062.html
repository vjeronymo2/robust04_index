			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO STATE;  </P> <P> LUGINBILL SHUFFLES DEFENSIVE BACKS  </P> <P> In the wake of Ty Detmer's 514-yard passing exhibition Saturday -- the most  passing yards ever allowed by an Aztec defense -- San Diego State Coach Al  Luginbill has decided to make some personnel changes for Saturday's home game  against Air Force.  </P> <P> After practice Monday, Luginbill announced these moves:  </P> <P>  -- Junior Tracey Mao replaces junior Derrick Williams as the starting nickel  back.  </P> <P>  -- Senior Morey Paul will back up Mao, and Williams moves out of the two-man  rotation.  </P> <P>  -- Sophomore Robert Griffith will start at dime back, and he will be backed up  by sophomore Zac Stokes, who has been out with a shoulder injury since the  preseason.  </P> <P>  -- Senior Marlon Andrews and sophomore Gary Taylor will remain as the starting  cornerbacks, but sophomore Damon Piere and sophomore Darrell Lewis will now  play behind them.  </P> <P>  -- Senior Clark Moses, a second-team all-WAC defensive back last year, had  been playing on the second team, but he has been demoted to the scout team.  </P> <P> Injuries to running backs Tommy Booker and Curtis Butts have left the Aztecs  with two healthy backs (Kipp Jeffries and T.C. Wright) and have forced  Luginbill to move H-back Larry Maxey to running back. Butts (neck strain) and  Booker (ankle) are questionable for Saturday. Luginbill said he does not yet  know who will start at running back. . . . Freshman linebacker Jamal Duff  (thigh bruise) is improved and has been listed as questionable. DAVE McKIBBEN  </P></p>

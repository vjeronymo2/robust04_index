			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Approval of attorneys. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Any attorney selected by an FmHA applicant, who will be providing title clearance where the certification of title is based on an attorney's opinion, must submit a completed Form FmHA 1927&hyph;19 certifying to professional liability insurance coverage and fidelity coverage of the attorney and the attorney's employees. The approval official will approve on a case-by-case basis any attorney who is duly licensed to practice law in the state where the real estate security is located and who complies with the bonding and insurance requirements in this section. If the certification of title will be by means of title insurance, any attorney or closing agent designated as an approved attorney or closing agent by the approved title insurance company which will issue the policy of title insurance will be acceptable, and when covered by a closing protection letter, will not be required to obtain professional liability insurance or a fidelity bond, if the closing protection letter is the ALTA form Closing Protection Letter or provides at least equivalent protection to FmHA as the professional liability and fidelity insurance required in paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section. Each approved title insurance company may provide a master list of their approved attorneys and closing agents, addressed to the FmHA State Director, that are covered by its closing protection letters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) An attorney issuing an attorney's title opinion must have in full force and effect an acceptable professional liability insurance policy for errors and omissions. The State Director will determine the appropriate level of such insurance and what level of deductible is permissible according to what is customary in the area and necessary for the protection of FmHA. The State Director will issue a State Instruction specifying this coverage. Required insurance will, as a minimum, cover the amount of the loan to be closed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) An attorney that is issuing an attorney's title opinion or, if title insurance is being obtained, an attorney or closing agent that is not covered by a closing protection letter must have in full force and effect a fidelity type bond. If partners, associates, or members of the staff of the attorney or closing agent have access to the funds in the escrow account, each such individual must either have a separate fidelity type bond to cover any fraudulent or dishonest act or such person(s) may be covered by a blanket fidelity bond. While it is recommended that $50,000 of protection be maintained for each individual person, the State Director will determine the appropriate level of insurance according to what is customary in the area and necessary for the protection of FmHA. The State Director will approve the form of the bond although Form FmHA 1927&hyph;18, ``Fidelity Bond for Loan Closing Attorneys,'' is an optional form that is acceptable to FmHA and may be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Approval of title companies. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  FmHA will approve any title insurance company which issues policies of title insurance in the state where the security property is located if the:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Form of the owner's and lender's policies of title insurance to be used in closing FmHA loans are acceptable to the State Director, and will contain only standard types of exceptions and exclusions approved in advance by the approval official with the advice of OGC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Title insurance company is licensed to do business in the state (if a license is required) and is not Federally debarred or suspended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Title insurance company submits copies of audited financial statements, Form 9 financial statements, or other approved financial statements satisfactory to the State Director, which indicate that the company has financial ability to cover losses arising out of its activities as a title insurance company and under any closing protection letters issued by the title insurance company. The financial statements must also demonstrate that the title insurance company has sufficient resources to reimburse FmHA for any losses caused by fraud or dishonesty by the company and its authorized agents, or failure of the company or its authorized agents to follow or comply with FmHA's written closing instructions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Title insurance company agrees that the title insurance company employee or closing agent who supervises the closing of the transaction will be authorized to receive funds and give receipts for the company's charges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Above listed approval process will be repeated at least every 5 years, or more often if adverse information becomes available, to insure continued compliance by the title insurance company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Responsibility of approval official. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In addition to approving closing agents, the approval official will inform all closing agents used in connection with FmHA closing of their duties and responsibilities under this subpart, applicable state supplements, and any changes or additional requirements which may be imposed. A package containing a copy of this subpart, applicable forms, state supplements, and other pertinent material will be provided to the closing agent as needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Conflict of interest. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A closing agent who has, or whose spouse, children, or business associates have, a financial interest in the real estate which will secure the FmHA debt cannot be involved in the title clearance or loan closing process.

No appeal rights will be given as the closing agent/attorney is not the direct recipient of program benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The applicant will be notified within 5 business days of the rejection. It is the applicant's responsibility to decide whether to continue with the rejected closing agent/attorney, if the reasons for rejection can be removed before any legal costs are incurred, or if another closing agent/attorney will be selected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

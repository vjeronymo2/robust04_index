			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Nicolas Sarkozy, budget minister and </F> official government spokesman, by Paul Amar -- live]    [Text] [Amar] Nicolas Sarkozy is with us in the studio.  Mr. Sarkozy, we have just seen these reports from Sarajevo.  What sadness and what a failure.    [Sarkozy] Yes, we no longer want to see these pictures. It  is no longer a matter for words or speeches. As early as  yesterday evening, speaking through Alain Juppe and Francois  Leotard, the French Government called for two things, two very  precise things. Everyone here in France and abroad must know  that we will do everything to ensure that our demands are met.  First of all we want the siege of Sarajevo to be lifted. In  concrete terms, this means the besieging Serb forces must pull  back 30 km so that they can no longer massacre the civilian  population. Second, we demand that all heavy weaponry, both on  the Serb and the Bosnian side, be placed under the control of  the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR]. This is what we have  demanded. If it does not happen [pauses]... France has  indicated that if this is not done willingly, as part of a  political agreement, then we would have to use all the means at  our disposal, including air strikes.    What has to be quite clear is that military intervention is  not an aim in itself. It would be meaningless to answer  massacres with massacres. Military intervention serves to show  that we want such a solution. France cannot decide on this  alone, and this is why France has called for a meeting of the  council of ministers of the North Atlantic Council, because it  obviously has to be an international intervention. But believe  me, the French position is without any hint of ambiguity, and it  cannot be otherwise.    I would like to make one last point: Our public opinion has  to know that of the 3,000 UNPROFOR troops bravely doing their  job in Sarajevo, 75 percent are French.</p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A SONG FOR VICTIMS OF TIAN AN MEN SQUARE  </P> <P> Hundreds, possibly thousands, of Chinese students were slaughtered at Beijing's  Tian An Men Square one year ago on June 4, 1989. Philip Woo does not want  anyone to forget it.  </P> <P> In commemoration of the massacre, the 33-year-old New York musician composed a  song, "Tian An Men Square," and convinced more than 40 artists and musicians,  including Living Colour's Vernon Reid, Michelle Shocked, Richie Havens and  Valerie Simpson, to participate in a music video, which will be featured on  segments of MTV News tonight.  </P> <P> "This song speaks about the struggle for human freedom in China and the passion  for democracy demonstrated in the protest," Woo said in a telephone interview  from his New York office. "It's important that the memory of these brave  students lives on."  </P> <P> Woo is a third-generation Seattle-born Chinese American with distant relatives  in the province of Guandong, China. As a musician he has played keyboards and  written music for recording artists such as Whitney Houston, Gladys Knight and  Maze.  </P> <P> He founded the nonprofit Project for Tian An Men Square in December and asked  his brothers Roger and John (owners of the New York film design and production  company Woo Art International), to direct and produce the video for the song.  The video fuses broadcast footage of the bloody massacre with studio  performances from the artists, as well as material gathered from independent  sources.  </P> <P> Unlike the one-night "We Are the World" recording date, the Project for Tian An  Men Square took seven sessions and more than a month to complete. The song was  recorded and mixed at several New York studios, each of which donated their  time and materials. A number of Los Angeles artists and musicians were  originally expected to add their voices to the project, but scheduling  conflicts and time restrictions prevented their participation.  </P> <P> "We thought by now that we would have a record distribution deal for the song,  but we don't," Woo said. "Still, we intend to keep pushing. This project is  dear to all of us involved. If we have to put out the record and video  ourselves, that's what we're going to do."  </P> <P> Proceeds from the project, Woo says, will be used to underwrite groups  dedicated to supporting humanitarian, educational and informational goals in  China. The first recipient targeted for aid is the Boston-based Democracy for  China Fund, a nonprofit organization run by Shen Tong, a student leader who  escaped from China following the massacre.  </P> <P> But the issue of raising money, Woo says, is secondary. His primary concern is  to raise awareness in the United States regarding the plight of people  struggling for freedom in China and around the world.  </P> <P> "Many people are not allowed access to information. They are denied the most  basic human and economic rights," Woo said. "All around the globe, people are  willing to die for privileges that we, as Americans, simply take for granted."  </P></p>

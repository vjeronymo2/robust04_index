			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / International Company News: US bank sought Banesto board changes last autumn JP Morgan, the US bank advising Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto) before its board was dismissed two weeks ago, recommended to Mr Mario Conde, Banesto's former president, last autumn that he make changes in the bank's senior management as part of a recovery plan. JP Morgan wrote to Mr Luis Angel Rojo, the governor of the Bank of Spain, on the eve of the intervention to say that it supported Banesto's former management. However, it has emerged that the US bank had told Mr Conde that it thought that several senior managers should be replaced. JP Morgan is believed to have pressed for management changes that could have been announced early this year as part of its own recovery plan, which would have involved writing down Pta265bn (Dollars 2bn) of Banesto's assets immediately and raising new capital by measures including a convertible bond issue. Mr Conde, meanwhile, has promised to hold a press conference this week, which would be his first public appearance since being removed as Banesto chairman. It seems unlikely that Mr Conde will seriously challenge the central bank's intervention. He owns about 4 per cent of Banesto's equity and his personal fortune may depend on the bank recovering under its new management. Mr Conde borrowed Pta70bn from Banco Central Hispano (BCH) to participate in the capital increase, lead by JP Morgan last year, pledging the shares he bought and the rest of his assets as a guarantee. However, Mr Conde is likely to add his voice to growing opposition in Madrid to the possibility that the new Banesto management could write down the bank's capital, and thus the value of its current shares, before asking other Spanish banks to participate in a capital increase. Mr Jose Maria Amesategui, the president of BCH, has publicly opposed a capital writedown. 'It is the last thing they should do,' he said. Mr Alfredo Saenz, Banesto's acting president, has told shareholders he is 'studying every possibility' to defend their interests. Opponents of an equity write-down argue that he should recapitalise the bank by selling assets.</p>

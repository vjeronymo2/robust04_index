			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, March 23 (TANJUG) -- President of the Serb  municipality of Zadar Mladen Kalapac on Wednesday asked Italy to  protect Serb refugees from this port-city on the Adriatic from  the Croatian authorities who are terrorizing them.    In a letter to Italian Prime Minister Carlo Ciampi and  Secretary of the National-Social Movement Gianfranco Fini,  Kalapac said that he was addressing them on behalf of the 42,000  Serbs banished from Zadar who have met the same fate as Italians  did after the Second World War, said the news agency ISKRA of  the republic of Serb Krajina.    Zadar and a considerable part of the Dalmatian coast were  part of Italy until September 1943.    Zadar is in close proximity to the republic of Serb Krajina  which was formed by Serbs in their ethnic and historical lands  in Croatia in 1991 in answer to its forcible secession from the  former Yugoslavia and the downgrading of their national rights  by the Zagreb authorities.    Since the beginning of Croatia's war for secession, 14,000  Serbs have been killed and more than 300,000 banished from this  former Yugoslav republic.    Around 10,000 houses belonging to Serbs have been blown up  all over Croatia in the past three years.    Special rapporteur of the United Nations Human Rights  Commission Tadeusz Mazowiecki in late February this year accused  Croatia of human rights violations and terror over Serbs,  especially in the coastal region of Dalmatia.    The Helsinki human rights federation on Wednesday accused  Croatia of forcibly evicting over 5,000 people from their flats  and physical abuse of citizens, predominantly of Serb  nationality.</p>

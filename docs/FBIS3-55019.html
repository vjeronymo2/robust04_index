Slezevicius, the country's sixth head of government since it  won independence in 1990, says Lithuania is well past the worst  stage of economic recession, raising the hope for an increased  flow of foreign investment in 1994. He said talks were under  way for as many as five credit lines with the World Bank alone.    The prime minister forecast that next year's inflation will  be lower than an increase in incomes and pensions because of  appropriate groundwork being laid down in the past six months  which he called "a very difficult period indeed." Slezevicius  said when the government arrived in office nine months ago, it  inherited a combined debt of USD 71 Mln [$71 million] for  imports of gas and nuclear fuel. The problem has now been  resolved, he said. The monthly 25 percent rate of inflation has  now been kept down to less than that for one quarter of the  year, he said.    The prime minister said the opposition does not appear to be  happy about the signs of stabilization. Slezevicius spoke of  farmers threatening a general strike since August and a series  of sporadic rallies and pickets which he described as  politically-motivated actions aimed at unsettling the situation.  And he added that the Conservatives did not conceal their  wanting to overthrow the government. However, the social basis  for strikes is diminishing, Slezevicius said.    The prime minister warned against attempts to try to rock  the  boat, saying the government would go ahead with its policy of  liberalizing the economy, steadying the currency, and resolving  social issues.</p>

The  people believe that this bridgehead should be burned to prevent  them from attacking us. Before midnight on 25 January, the  people and the NADK surrounded and attacked the Stoung District  township. After an hour of fighting, we had completely occupied  the district market and destroyed the district office buildings,  two barracks, a police quarters, six vehicles and armored  carriers, and a rice warehouse. We killed seven cruel district  officials; four puppet officers holding the rank of colonel,  major, and captain; and 12 invading enemy soldiers. We also  wounded a number of enemy soldiers and captured 38 others. The  other puppet troops quickly fled for their lives from the Stoung  District township. [passage omitted]</p>

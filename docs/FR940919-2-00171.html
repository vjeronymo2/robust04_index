			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. The Company asserts that its failure to become primarily engaged in a non-investment business by December 30, 1994 is a result of factors beyond its control. The existence of the FDIC Claims has precluded the Company from investing its assets in a non-investment company business. Although the Company's executive officers reviewed numerous possible asset or business acquisitions, the magnitude of the FDIC Claims and the potential threat that the FDIC would seek to enjoin any utilization of the Company's assets has prevented the Company from investing its assets in a non-investment company business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Pending the settlement of the FDIC Claims, the Company has limited its investments to high quality marketable securities, cash or cash equivalents. Thus, the Company asserts that it primarily invests in securities solely to preserve the value of its assets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Although the Company has made substantial efforts to formulate alternative methods by which it can acquire an operating business and utilize its tax loss, the pending settlement negotiations of the FDIC Claims make it necessary for the Company to seek relief extending the relief granted by the Prior Orders. This would allow the Company to seek an FDIC settlement and, if successful, to formulate and implement new plans for becoming an operating business and utilizing the Tax Loss. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The Company believes that the issuance of an order exempting it from all provisions of the Act, subject to certain exceptions, until December 30, 1995 would be in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicant's Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Company agrees that the requested exemption will be subject to the following conditions, each of which will apply to the Company until it acquires an operating business or otherwise falls outside the definition of an investment company: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

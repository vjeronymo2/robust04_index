			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Fletcher Challenge forestry unit posts loss FLETCHER Challenge Canada, the forestry concern 72 per cent owned by Fletcher Challenge of New Zealand, reported a net loss of NZDollars 7.4m (USDollars 3.78m) in the December quarter compared with net earnings of NZDollars 27.5m in the corresponding period a year earlier. The year-ago period included a non-recurring net gain of NZDollars 56.3m related to the sale of the company's 45 per cent interest in an affiliate, Donohue St-Felicien The latest result represented a significant turnround from the Dollars 28.8m net loss recorded for the three months to September 30, Fletcher Challenge said. Mr Doug Whitehead, president of Fletcher Challenge Canada, said the second-quarter result 'offered encouragement that a recovery is starting to build'. Sales rose to Dollars NZ404.1m from NZDollars 399m a year earlier, in spite of the absence of production from the Hammond saw mill, sold in December 1991, and lower newsprint prices. The increase in sales reflected increases in shipments of 49 per cent for newsprint and 11 per cent for lightweight coated paper, combined with improved pulp and lumber prices and a favourable movement in Canadian and US dollar exchange rates. Cash-flow from operations, NZDollars 900,000, was above break-even for the second consecutive quarter. Fletcher Challenge Canada said it was in a strong position to take advantage of recovering pulp, paper and lumber prices and expected significant improvements in earnings. Mr Whitehead said the indications were that markets would continue to improve during the second half of the financial year.</p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Gilts overshadow the performance of Pibs - Bonds Reviews of 1993 reported the strong performance from gilts but few mentioned the strength of other sterling bonds. For instance, total returns from permanent interest bearings shares - fixed interest-paying instruments issued by building societies - ranged from 35 per cent for Halifax 12 per cent, to 46 per cent from Bristol &amp; West 13.375 per cent. Of the 46 per cent gain, 34 per cent was tax-free capital gain and 12.4 per cent was the gross amount of income. Predicting the future value or direction of your capital is pure speculation and one rarely recommends Pibs for capital growth. Therefore, the 1993 capital gain should be regarded as a bonus which will almost certainly not be repeated in 1994. However, one certainty is that investors who bought the Pibs with a 12.4 per cent income yield will receive the same in 1994 as in 1993, and 1995, and so on. Investors in most types of bonds (but not in Pibs, which will normally never be repaid) know from the outset when, and how much, the bonds will be worth at the maturity date. That is why institutions hold large bond portfolios within life, pensions and other investment funds. Last year saw record sterling bond issues of Pounds 22.6bn in addition to Pounds 60bn of new gilt issues. We recommend bonds for financial planning and to form the core of most portfolios to which equities can be added. You can buy bonds through a broker or authorised adviser. Market forces will determine the capital value, except upon maturity, which will be what was promised at the time of purchase. In the meantime you receive interest payments from the issuer. When you buy the bond, you need to be certain that you know for how long you wish to hold it, how much you want to receive back, and the income that will be paid in the meantime. You must also believe the issuer can afford to keep its promise (remember that unlike dividend payments which can be reduced or omitted at the discretion of the board, bond interest is a contractual obligation and failure to pay could force a company into liquidation). Finally, the bond markets are always developing. Last week saw the re-emergence of the once large corporations sector. Investors buying the new corporation issues have been achieving attracting yields of 65 basis points above comparable gilts, but they are not specifically guaranteed by the government. Michael Dyson is a director of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Capital Markets. This is a market-maker and cannot deal with private clients directly. Readers interested in buying bonds should approach a broker.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FIXED INTEREST SECURITIES FOR PRIVATE INVESTORS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Issuer                     Coupon      Price   Redemption   Redemption                                 %                    Date        Price  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Priority for income Brimingham Midshires        9.375    104.375          n/a          n/a Building Soc PIBS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- North American Life         8.250    104.3     17/11/2003       100 Eurosterling  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- European Inv Bank          10.375    130.25    22/11/2004       100 Bulldog  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Balanced income &amp; Capital Nationwide Building Soc     6.125     99.5     15/11/1999       100 Eurosterling  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Dudley Borough Council      7.000     39.375     1/2/2019       100                                         Part                                         Paid  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Zero dividend preference Shares Schroder Split Zdp          0.000    113.25     31/1/2002       202.76  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Johnson Fry 2nd             0.000    108.5     31/12/2003       222.6 Utilties Zdp  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Issuer                        GRA   Income   Interest    NRY  Net Inco                              sa    Yield      Dates    25%       25%  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Priority for income Brimingham Midshires          n/a     8.98    1/3 1/9    n/a      6.74  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Building Soc PIBS North American Life          7.46     7.91      17/11   5.52      5.93 Eurosterling  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- European Inv Bank            6.45     7.97       22/5   4.27      5.97 Bulldog                                         22/11  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Balanced income &amp; Capital Nationwide Building Soc      6.15     6.16      15/11   4.65      4.62 Eurosterling  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Dudley Borough Council       7.05     7.04    1/2 1/8   5.30      5.28  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Zero dividend preference Shares Schroder Split Zdp           7.43      n/a        n/a   6.45*      n/a  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Johnson Fry 2nd              7.40      n/a        n/a   6.45*      n/a Utilties Zdp  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Assumes inflation at 3 per cent  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (22): An ambitious programme - Taiwan: Infrastructure TAIPEI is yet another teeming, sprawling congested Asian city which has long outgrown the ability of its roads, railways, power generation and other services to cope with the rapid growth of its economy and population. Everywhere there is evidence of new construction, from scaffolding and tower cranes to the concrete stumps which will carry the elevated sections of the city's new Dollars 18bn mass transit railway. This is a country in the middle of rebuilding its infrastructure with a vast Dollars 300bn six-year development plan approved last year by the Taiwanese government. The programme is very ambitious and expensive. There will be opportunities for international contractors, designers and consulting engineers to bid for work in areas where the Taiwanese lack skills The Taiwanese will need international assistance to design and build the large numbers of bridges and tunnels needed as new roads and railways push across its mountainous terrain. Core electrical and mechanical systems for power station and railway construction - generating sets, rolling stock, signalling, automatic ticketing systems - will also need to be imported. Bilfinger and Berger, the German construction group, recently won a TDollars 18.8bn (Dollars 750m) contract for a 4.5km section of Taipei's Dollars 18bn Mass Rapid Transit light rail system. The contract includes construction of four stations and all the electrical and mechanical equipment for the route. Matra of France and GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering group, have separately supplied the core system and rolling stock for the TDollars 25bn first section to opened of the mass transit railway which is due to start operations next year. The Taiwanese government, concerned at a rising trade deficit with Japan, has asked the state-owned electricity generating corporation to try to buy equipment and design assistance from countries other than Japan. International companies in many cases will be expected to bid in joint venture with local firms. The main elements of the six-year plan include: Roads: Approaching 1,500km of new motorway are planned by the end of the century under national and provincial investment programmes. A 117km Northern Second Freeway between Hsinchu and Taipei, expected to cost TDollars 176bn, is under construction. There are plans to build a TDollars 60bn freeway 31km long between Taipei and Ilan in the north-west. This will require five long tunnels. A much more ambitious proposal is to build a 444km expressway up the western side of the island which will join up with the Northern Second Freeway to connect Kaohshiung in the south of the island to Taipei in the north. It will run parallel to the existing and often congested Sun Yet-Sen freeway. The road will be let in three sections costing a total of TDollars 550bn. Mass Rapid Transit: About 60 per cent of the contracts for the 88km Taipei mass transit railway are already let. About TDollars 50bn for electrical and mechanical work, however, has still to be let. Most of this will go to internal companies. Planning for a mass transit railway in Kaohshiung is well advanced and will provide more opportunities for overseas contractors. Several more such railways are planned for other Taiwanese cities under the six-year development plan. Energy: A big power station construction and expansion plan is proposed. The publicly-owned Taiwan Power Company wants to spend Dollars 93.8bn over the next 10 years on increasing the country's productive capacity from 18,383MW to 28,500 MW. It says the programme is essential to prevent power cuts which occurred last summer. The six-year plan envisages about Dollars 35bn being spent by 1996 on building and expanding power stations. High-Speed Rail: A 345km high-speed rail link between Kaohshiung and Taipei represents one of the biggest single investments proposed by the Taiwanese government. Planning and design have been approved but the budget for the TDollars 426.6bn rail route has still to be confirmed. Cost of providing the core system - rolling stock and electrical and mechanical equipment - is estimated at about Dollars 2bn. Bidders include GEC Alsthom, AEG of Germany and Kawasaki of Japan. Environment: Taiwan is running out of room to dump all its domestic waste. It currently operates two incinerators, both in the Taipei area, and 200 landfill sites all of which will close by the end of century. Seven more incinerators are under construction, using Japanese technology, at a total cost of about Dollars 41.1bn. A further 12 incinerators with a combined cost of Dollars 1.6bn are planned. It is hoped these will be built by international companies in joint venture with local firms. Efforts are being made to encourage US and European contractors in particular. The six-year plan also proposes heavy investment in water and ports as the country tries to encourage new development away from over-crowded cities into previously rural areas.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Louaifi Bennaoum: "The FIS Overseas"] </F>   [Text] The FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] has some 500  activists in foreign lands--many of them salaried cadres--and  1,500 to 2,000 sympathizers.    Anouar Haddam, Dihna Abderrahmane, and Ouli Abdesselam all  belong to what might be called the foreign "brain trust" of the  FIS.    All three are nuclear physicists. Just coincidence, or  convergence of interests?    The answer lies in the motive behind the assassination of a  senior officer in the ANP [People's National Army], Redouane  Sari, a nuclear physicist himself and thus known to the above  group.    Did Mr. Sari rebuff Haddam and his associates when they  ordered him to join their group?&lt;sup&gt; 1&lt;/sup&gt;    The sequel leaves no doubt: Atomic energy and their common  profession was the tie that linked them.    Haddam and his group would instigate a "Chernobyl" within  the  Algerian Islamist movement [MIA]. There is no room in their cold  strategic calculus for the "Djamaat" and their irrationality.    Haddam's calculus is that of opportunism and thirst for  power.    The Abassi-Benhadj antinomy has been superseded by a  polarization that will surely lead to implosion of the  destructive force that has been at work in Algeria over the last  two years.    The arrest by French police of Algerian-born Islamist  leaders  living in France shows that the Islamist movement there is far  from being, or constituting, a solid organization.    The mission of that command post, which looks for all the  world like an army general staff headquarters, is to prepare and  design targeted propaganda campaigns.    The cell has a substantial budget, in the range of millions  of U.S. dollars.    The Chicago cell has been given the function and title of  "parliament of the FIS."    Algerian Islamists based in the United States have access to  some of the most sophisticated communications equipment.  <H5>  Alicante </H5>   Next in importance after Chicago comes the city of Alicante  in Spain. There, Haddam has an installation called the "close  proximity operational command post." The mission of this cell is  to serve as a relay for communications with Islamist activists  inside Algeria.    Personal contacts take place on a regular basis in Mellilia,  Nador, and Oujda.    The Spanish cell serves as a transit base for "Afghans"  returning to Algeria.    The itinerary is as follows:    Oujda-Berguemt (Morocco), then across the Algero-Moroccan  frontier via Sidi Djillali, El Aricha, Sebdou, and Telagh. At  Telagh, "Afghans" are taken under the wing of a Saida-based  logistics network.    Profiles of those arrested, the documents seized, and  reactions of coreligionists in Germany, England, and the United  States clearly betray a host of weak points in the overseas  organization of the Algerian Islamists.    These weak points are explained by the total absence of a  base and the fact that the organization is locked tightly in the  sterile and demagogic rhetoric of its origins.    Our investigation has determined that the former FIS still  has four operational command posts.    In order of importance Chicago is first, followed by Madrid  (Spain), Paris (France), and Berlin (Germany).  <H5>  Chicago </H5>   A Black Muslim stronghold, Chicago today harbors more than  40  Algerian Islamists, in addition to a Middle East community  affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood Islamist movement.    The Chicago command post is run by Anouar Haddam, a nuclear  physicist born in Tlemcen. A former Princeton University  student, he stood as a FIS candidate in the 1991 legislative  elections.    The men responsible for logistical support are all veteran  black-market traffickers.    At every step along the way, Moroccan police and customs  officials are "softened up" by baksheesh [bribes]. It may be  that high-level Moroccan authorities have no idea what is  happening in their country.    The Spanish cell's membership includes procurers and a not  insignificant number of drifters with criminal records (drugs)  living on the Costa del Sol. Some are well known to Algerian  police: Back when Ben Bella was in hiding, they had infiltrated  his MDA [Movement for Democracy in Algeria] and served as  informers.  <H5>  Berlin </H5>   In Germany, where Rabah Kebir lives with some of Abassi  Madani's close collaborators, Algerian Islamists are less active  since they lack the necessary base of support.    Kebir maintains close ties to members of the neo-Nazi NSDAP  [Nationalist Socialist German Workers' Party], which helps  provision it and facilitates acquisition of false identity  documents.    Rabah Kebir himself is a rather interesting personality.  Passive, vacillating, and unstable, he is regularly denigrated  and challenged by Haddam, who accuses him of being a compromiser  and advocate of dialogue with the Algerian authorities.    Kebir maintains close ties to Madani's sons, Salman in  particular, as well as with Kamerdine Kharbane (expelled from  France to Pakistan).    Their faction, "the upholders of the oath," was born from a  meeting of group leaders in a west Algerian town last spring.    During that meeting, there was a stormy debate, with the  Djamaat asserting the lives of too many of their activists had  been lost and deploring the activities of the exiled brothers.    Kebir's faction has been marginalized by Haddam, who accuses  the Madanis of maintaining a hegemonic grip on the former FIS.  <H5>  Paris </H5>   Dihna Abderrahmane, a physicist who is married with three  children (his wife is an oral surgeon), had settled in the small  French town of Ferney Voltaire located 2 km from Geneva  (Switzerland).    A friend of Haddam, Dihna was the FIS's official  representative in France. On Tuesday 9 November at 0600, French  police came to his domicile to arrest him, but he fled to Sudan,  where he is currently staying.    Dihna's strategy was based on vigilance. Domiciled in  France,  he worked at the Islamic Center in Eaux Vives, a densely  populated quarter of Geneva. The center was controlled by a  branch of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and run by the Ramadan  family, whose matriarch is the granddaughter of the movement's  founder, Hassen El Banna.    Dihna received faxes in Switzerland at the above-mentioned  Islamic center and at the mosque of Petit Saconnay, a gathering  place for members of the former FIS in exile in Switzerland.    He received instructions directly from Chicago, from Haddam,  and relayed them to the French Algerian Fraternity (FAF), which  in turn passed messages on to the various prayer halls.  <H5>  FIS in France </H5>   Some 90 percent of Algeria's overseas cultural community  resides in France. The former FIS has never succeeded in winning  the loyalty of this community.    However, it has succeeded--with the help of non-Algerian  Islamists and French converts--in setting up networks.    The Tunisian Nahdah provided safe houses and mail drops  (bookstores, prayer halls, etc.). The Federation of French  Muslims [FMF] headed by French convert Youssef Leclerc, a  personal friend of Abassi, is financed by the World Islamic  League (Saudi Arabia). The FMF supplied volunteers for the cause  (preparation, printing, and distribution of tracts and  magazines).    To date the former FIS has failed to establish itself in  France, although it does enjoy the support of a few  reactionaries. Much has been said about the "harkis" [members of  harkas or native auxiliary continents of the French Army during  Algeria's war for independence], most of it untrue. Harkis still  living are at least 55 years old. Despised in both France and  Algeria, most are destitute. Their children, at least the great  majority of them, have no connection at all with the Islamist  movement. They consider themselves part of France's Maghrebian  cultural community.    That said, the confiscation of large sums of money at the  domiciles of those arrested confirms suspicions that Islamists  in France were well funded, enjoying affluent lifestyles that  contrasted sharply with the standard of living of the average  Maghrebian immigrant.    The former FIS counts some 500 activists living overseas,  most of them salaried cadres, plus 1,500 to 2,000 sympathizers.  Their principal activity to date has been propaganda--fiery,  violent, amateurish propaganda, notable for the absence of  rational argument.    Our inquiries with colleagues in the international press,  whose response reflected solidarity with Algerian journalists,  indicate that overseas the former FIS, lacking a popular base in  the Algerian cultural community or a convincing propaganda line,  is smoldering with violent discord between the MIA and the  former FIS triggered by the abduction of the three Frenchmen in  Algiers--discord that threatens to explode into the open. Iran  allegedly proffered its good offices in an effort to avert this  explosion.    Added to strains within the Islamist movement are personal  rivalries and a probable struggle for supremacy among the  various terrorist groups. On the ground, rivalry between the MIA  and the Djamaate (FIS groups aligned with Abassi) is quite open.  <H5>  Pasqua's Message </H5>   Juridically, the French Republic is fully within its rights  to take action to protect the security of persons and property.    Politically, Charles Pasqua is sending a clear and  multidirectional message not only to Islamists around the world  but also to extremists of every kind, Europeans included.    The message is a warning: The rules of hospitality in France  and elsewhere require that guests of the host country respect  certain obligations and responsibilities.    Two imams--a Turk who officiated at services in Nantua and  was behind the recent Islamic "scarf" [foulard] affair, and a  Moroccan officiating at Carpentras--have been expelled from  France to their country of origin. Again, the message was clear:  French laws will be enforced; which is not in any sense  inconsistent with freedom of religious practice in France.    To avoid driving authentic Muslim believers into alliance  with Islamists who use religion for political ends, Pasqua has  reaffirmed his respect, and that of the French Government, for  France's Muslim community. The government's actions were taken  in response to the assassination of two Frenchmen and the  abduction of three others.    FAF's publications called for murder and violence. Banned,  they will continue in other forms.  Footnote    1. Mr. Sari's assassins were killed by security forces later  in the year.</p>

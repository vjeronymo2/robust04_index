			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: BLP BLP Group, the USM-quoted maker of wood laminates and mouldings, reported increased losses before tax of Pounds 2.6m for 1991. That compared with a deficit of Pounds 198,000 last time and came from turnover down by 31 per cent to Pounds 37.7m. The pre-tax figure was struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 1.9m relating to a Pounds 1.43m provision against loans to the BLP Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust and reorganisation costs. In addition there was an extraordinary loss of Pounds 535,000 arising from disposal of the 95 per cent interest in Berg. Losses per share came out at 38.2p (4.4p).</p>

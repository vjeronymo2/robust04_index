			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / International Company News: Macy wins approval to use debtor financing R. H. MACY, the big US department store chain which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Monday, yesterday received bankruptcy court approval to use Dollars 60m of its Dollars 600m debtor-in-possession financing from Chemical Bank and Bankers Trust. The company, which will use the funds to pay suppliers and keep merchandise flowing into its stores, said the Dollars 60m was sufficient to meet its immediate financial needs. At the next court hearing, scheduled for February 13, Macy will ask approval for the balance of the financing commitment. After yesterday's hearing, Mr Myron Ullman, vice-chairman and chief operating officer, said the company was encouraged by the reaction of its suppliers. He said there were no plans to sell any assets. The company did not expect to make any significant management changes following the Chapter 11 filing. Mr Ullman would not speculate on how long Macy might be in Chapter 11. Emerging from bankruptcy, however, can take a long time. Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores, which filed for bankruptcy protection in January 1990, expect to emerge from Chapter 11 next week. The groups, which include Manhattan's Bloomingdale's, have closed about 40 stores since the bankruptcy process started. The company said there had been no significant management changes, apart from a new chief executive who was appointed shortly after the Chapter 11 filing. Macy, like Federated &amp; Allied, is a casualty of the leveraged buy-out craze of the 1980s. Macy was taken private in a Dollars 3.6bn management-led buy-out in 1986, and later increased its debt load by Dollars 1.4bn when it acquired Federated's California stores. The company's debt burden is estimated at about Dollars 3.7bn.</p>

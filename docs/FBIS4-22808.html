			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yakov Urinson, first deputy minister of the </F> economy, by Tatyana Korostikova, under the rubric "Projection";  place and date not given: "Prices Will Grow by a Factor of Five"]    [Text] Early this year the Ministry of the Economy  offered the government several scenarios of the development of  the economic situation in Russia--what will happen: if  everything is left as is, if credit is given to everyone, if  nothing is given to anyone, and so on. We asked First Deputy  Minister of the Economy Yakov Urinson to discuss the scenario  preferred by the government.    [Urinson] Our government has resolved to continue a quite  stringent financial course and reinforce financial discipline at  the same time, because on one hand we have tremendous  nonpayments, while on the other, enterprises keep a lot of spare  funds in accounts at commercial banks, and pay taxes poorly.    The government suggests that the following be done: If an  enterprise cannot pay with money, let it draw up a bill of  exchange. If it does not pay on the bill of exchange either,  then let it pay with its property, that is, go bankrupt. At  present about 30 percent of our production facilities are  unprofitable. It would be normal if we could shut down 5 percent  of enterprises before the end of the year.    If we succeed in making the recession structural (helping  the  best and giving the worst an opportunity to quietly close down)  production will decline by no more than 12 percent during the  year. Prices will calm down, too. In February they increased by  10 percent, in March--by 8.7 percent. If we could hold on for  another month, interest on credit would also go down. At present  it is 210 percent. It could be brought to 100-120 percent. As  soon as interest on credit goes down, capital investment will  appear.    Given the policy for which the government has opted, we  project a growth of prices in 1994 by a factor of five (in  1993--by a factor of 10). It will come to 7-8 percent per month.  People will already be able to plan their budgets.    I think that the exchange rate of the dollar will reach  3,000  rubles [R]. Since subsidies are not expected, it will slowly  creep upward.    [Korostikova] How many unemployed will we have? How do you  expect to help them?    [Urinson] There will 3.5-4 million people. At present there  are 1.2 million. It has already been one year since unemployment  benefits were introduced. However, it would be better for people  to have something to do. This is why we allocated funds for  retraining (during this period people will receive scholarships  and adapt).    We will employ people for public works. Small businesses are  the third area in which I see tremendous reserves. We have  proposed tax relief for small businesses and have provided for a  little money in the budget to support newcomers.    However, the unemployment problem must be tackled not only  at  the federal level. The local authorities better know the  situation and the way out of it. By law, they can resolve to  grant relief from local taxes or introduce new taxes.    [Korostikova] Incidentally, about taxes. Will they be  revised?    [Urinson] I believe that they will not be revised by any  means this year. First we need to create a powerful and at the  same time refined mechanism for the tax system. Our system is  now as crude as an axe. However, let it remain unchanged until  we develop a new one and kick it around in the parliament every  which way. Rules cannot be changed before the game is over. When  the new system is adopted, it should be laid down in the law: No  changes for five years under any circumstances.    [Korostikova] However, everyone who engages in production  assures us that it is impossible to operate because of high  taxes.    [Urinson] They are inclined to exaggerate the tax pressure  here. In 1993 withholdings of all types for the consolidated  budget of the state came to about 42 percent of the gross  domestic product (GDP) of Russia. What is the state of affairs  in other countries? In the United States the corresponding  parameter comes to approximately 35 percent, in Japan--38  percent, and in Germany, almost 50 percent. Therefore, not only  our tax burden is heavy. However, the outrage here is greater  than in any other country because everybody, especially a  segment of directors of state enterprises, wants to shift the  responsibility for their miscalculations (and resulting high  costs) onto the state. Besides, many entrepreneurs operate on  the principle "cry harder, tears bring you better luck at cards!"    [Korostikova] Could it be that everything is not that  simple?  Recently I needed to find a new wave entrepreneur-industrialist,  not a state enterprise director. This turned out to be  difficult. They are few and far between.    [Urinson] Ninety percent of our economy consisted of  producers. However, we produced guns, tanks, meat,  and butter rather than services. There is one  take-out kitchen per 100 residential buildings, and one laundry  per 1,000 of them. It is precisely in the service sector that  the shortage is the greatest. For this reason, financial, legal,  consulting, and consumer services are most profitable at present.    They say that our trade sector is overgrown. Meanwhile, its  contribution to GDP is smaller than in any other country, even a  not-too-developed one. Clearly, the capital streamed to the  sector, and profits are the highest there. Once the trade sector  has been saturated, profits will begin to increase in  production, and more goods manufacturers will appear.    [Korostikova] Nonetheless, the state collects a good deal of  money from us. However, we do not have any idea how it is spent.  This is why one kind of expenditure is specified in the budget,  while the money, to put it mildly, is not spent in the intended  way.    [Urinson] A powerful, professional, and depoliticized  parliament is the only means of genuine control over budgetary  expenditures.    [Korostikova] Does the current parliament fit the bill?    [Urinson] Of course, there are people there such as  Pochinok,  Gaydar, Yavlinskiy, Zadornov, Petrakov, Fedorov. One cannot  deceive them. On the whole, however.... I have spoken before the  old parliament and before this one. In the previous one, one out  of 10 questions was expert and normal; in this parliament, as  many as three are. However, this is what I see: The further we  go, the more politics, playing to the gallery, and fueling of  passions there is, and the less punctilious interest in each  number.    I have attended the proceedings of the French parliament.  Nobody discusses over there whether you are in favor of the  Whites or the Reds. They take a puny statistic--expenditures for  whatever--and begin to kick it around every which way. Either a  deputy prime minister or a deputy minister of finance makes a  presentation. He is questioned for two hours about a number that  is one-hundredth of the budget! This goes on for two weeks.  Following this, absolutely the entire budget is as transparent  as can be.    In the process, the press continuously covers who said what  about the number under discussion and what the consequences are  going to be if they act in a particular way. As a result, people  are better versed in budget statistics.    [Korostikova] Do you think that our economy has already  reached the bottom of its fall?    [Urinson] I think that this will happen sometime in the  middle of the year. It will be possible to talk about  stabilization only after inflation stays at 5-7 percent a month  for no less than 10 months, only when the recession is put in  order--not all enterprises will shut down, only the bad ones,  and most importantly, only when natural investment begins rather  than the coercive investment we see at present, that is, when  our enterprises begin to invest funds in the development of  production rather than exchange rubles into foreign currency.  Then a pickup in the economy will begin.</p>

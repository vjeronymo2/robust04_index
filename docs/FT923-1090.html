			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / International Company News: Recticel forced to write off BFr213m RECTICEL, the Belgian manufacturer of polyurethane foam which is 60 per cent owned by Societe General de Belgique, was forced to write off BFr213m (Dollars 6.9m) in the first half of 1992 because of lingering environmental problems at companies which have since been sold. The company, which changed its name from Gechem in June, lost BFr285m after tax and extraordinary items, compared with losses of BFr767m in the first half of 1991 when it was still consolidating 100 per cent of its US subsidiary. However, Recticel Europe, now the main operating unit of the group, increased its net profit from BFr351m to BFr362m in the six months to June 30, on turnover of BFr15bn (BFr14.8bn). The group said yesterday that recent restructuring at Recticel Europe - including the closure of 16 plants - had helped offset some of the effects of the poor economic climate. Mr Luc Vansteenkiste, the group's chief executive, refused to provide more details of the environmental problems. But he said there would be no additional provisions in the second half. Last week, Recticel announced plans to end its ill-fated expansion in the US foam market by selling most of its remaining stake in Foamex LP, its US subsidiary. The company said yesterday it hoped to break even in the full year, if extraordinary losses were excluded. Group net profits at Cobepa, Belgium's third-largest holding company, slipped from BFr3.44bn to BFr2.71bn in the first half of 1992. The company, 67 per cent owned by Paribas of France, said that useful comparison of the two halves was difficult because the final result depended on when gains were realised on investments. Unrealised gains increased from BFr8.9bn at the end of last year to BFr9.79bn in June 1992.</p>

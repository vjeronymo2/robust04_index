			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 2 Feb (TANJUG) -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy,  the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, today  warned that Russia will not allow any provocations of and  threats against Serbia, that it will demand the lifting of  sanctions, and that unless this happens it will raise the issue  of Russia's UN membership.    Zhirinovskiy said this in talks with Vojislav Seselj, the  leader of the Serbian Radical Party, who was his host today at  the Federal Assembly. He said that an organization which allows  children to die for want of medicines can no longer be called  the United Nations Organization. This, according to  Zhirinovskiy, is an instrument in the hands of a state that has  become an evil empire.    I am telling the West from Belgrade today that war games in  the Balkans are over and that a new historic epoch is beginning,  said the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, which won the  highest number of votes in the recent Russian parliamentary  elections.    Zhirinovskiy reiterated that he sides fully with the Serb  people and that he regards Western threats against Serbia as  threats against Russia. If the Serb people seek help we shall  offer moral, material, and, if need be, also military support,  he declared, warning that the Russian Army is still one of the  strongest in the world. He informed his host that a meeting of  support and solidarity with the Serb people will be held in  Moscow on 5 February, and that Serb officers, party officials,  and representatives of the Serbian Orthodox Church will be  invited to come on 20 February, Russian Army Day.    The leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party mentioned  a proposal for the unification of Slav nations in an eastern  European community. I am putting forward a proposal for the  setting up of a Slav parliament in Belgrade or another Slav city  which would be a counterpart to the European Parliament in  Strasbourg, Zhirinovskiy said. He added that in relation to  Western Europe, stretching from the English Channel to Vienna,  the eastern European community would stretch from Knin to  Vladivostok.    Zhirinovskiy announced that a congress of Slav nations will  be held in Moscow on 2 April. With 1993 the withdrawal of Slavs  and the passive attitude of the Orthodox Church ended. In 1994  a new historical era of the renaissance of Slav nations begins,  he added. The Slavs are, he said, one nation, and if the German  nation united, if the Germans, British, and French are uniting,  why should not the Slavs do the same?    Zhirinovskiy stressed that his party supports democratic  principles which should be respected equally by everyone. We do  not support violence and we are not threatening anyone, we are  just warning, he added. The Warsaw Pact has been dissolved and  we also want NATO to be dissolved, Zhirinovskiy said, adding  that the world is tired of hegemony.    The leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia  proposes, as he put it, the regionalization of the world,  dividing it into north and south America, eastern and western  Europe, the Far East and Japan. In a world divided like this  political power would be balanced and that would prevent a major  new war.    Zhirinovskiy and Seselj said they are satisfied with the  similarity of their parties' standpoints. Seselj stressed that  the Serb nation is engaged in a great struggle to liberate its  western territories. The Serbs differ on many internal policy  issues but they are united as far as the defense of national  interests is concerned, Seselj pointed out.    He said that Croats and Muslims are tools controlled by the  West, which wants to break the backbone of the Serb nation. We  were alone until you appeared, he declared to Zhirinovskiy.  However, we have never stopped believing that the great Russian  nation will stand up on its own feet and say no to the West. We  are one people, our origins are the same, our languages are  similar, and we can survive in the new world only by leaning on  each other, Seselj said. He expressed his wish that, as soon as  possible, the Liberal Democratic Party becomes the ruling party  and Zhirinovskiy the president of Russia.</p>

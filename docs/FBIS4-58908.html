			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, May 8 (AFP) -- The  Palestinian police deployment in the Gaza Strip, scheduled to  start on Sunday [8 May], has been delayed again, Palestinian  sources said here late Saturday.    They said "technical reasons" were to blame for the delay in  the arrival of hundreds of policemen from the Rafah border  crossing with Egypt, but declined to elaborate.    Some 300 policemen left Cairo for the Rafah crossing earlier  Saturday, a day after Palestinian general Ziyad al-Atrash  announced here that the Gaza deployment would start Sunday after  a delay of several days.    But Palestinian officials in Amman, meanwhile, said hundreds  more policemen were to cross Sunday from Jordan into the West  Bank for deployment in the other self-rule area, Jericho.    However, the Israeli news agency ITIM said no deployment was  expected in Jericho Sunday as the Palestinians had failed to  coordinate their arrival with the Israeli army, it said.    The police were due to arrive in Gaza, ITIM said, quoting  military sources.    Under the autonomy deal signed Wednesday between the PLO and  Israel, 9,000 Palestinian policemen are to be deployed in  Jericho and the Gaza Strip to take charge of security as the  Israeli army pulls out.    However General Dany Rothschild, coordinator of Israeli  activities in the occupied territories, complained Saturday that  the Palestinians were not ready to take over their new  responsibilities.    "If the transfer of civilian powers in the autonomous zones  does not take place in an orderly fashion, the situation on the  ground will deteriorate," he said. "We still don't have anybody  to hand these powers to."    He detected a change in the Palestinian stand.    "Up until a few days ago, the word from them was: `Give us  the keys and leave. We'll sort it out.' Their calls for help  are now more frequent and they're starting to realize the size  of the task," said the general.    On the Israeli side, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is to  present the self-rule accord he signed last week with PLO leader  Yasir 'Arafat for parliament's approval on Wednesday,  parliamentary sources said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Attempt of Seditious Force To Undermine DPRK's Unique </F> Status"--KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 29 (KCNA) -- The Russian ambassador  to South Korea, Kunadze, recently contended that the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea "must observe all its obligations  under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], since it is its  signatory."    Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says that Kunadze  and  others who view the matter this way are, without exception,  persons who ignore hard facts, swayed by prejudice.    The analyst says:    The DPRK Government decided to withdraw from the NPT on  March  12, 1993, according to paragraph 1, article 10 of the treaty to  defend the supreme interests of the state. Later, it  temporarily suspended the effectuation of this withdrawal. It  is a political commitment we made to the United States for the  sake of the DPRK-U.S. talks and it does not mean our return to  the treaty. Therefore, we are not under obligation to fulfill  the treaty as its signatory. Practically, we have undergone only  an inspection suited to our status following the temporary  suspension of the effectuation of our withdrawal from the treaty  on June 11, 1993.    Our unique status has been recognized by the United States  and the secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency.  In actuality, the world recognizes our unique status.    To ignore our unique status and refuse to reconize it is  motivated by the sinister purpose of creating the impression  that we remain in the treaty with a full status, not using the  word of return to it, and thus finding a pretext of interference  and pressure and stifling our Republic. And Kunadze has joined  in it, we dare say. We cannot but pay a special attention to  the fact that the clamor for denying our special status timed to  coincide with the refueling at our 5 megawatt experimental  atomic power station.    Our unique status is not dissolved, even if some quarters  deny and refuse to recognize it. This unique status is not what  we wanted, but was imposed on us by the United States and the  agency.    We do not intend to maintain the unique status forever. It  will be dissolved when DPRK-U.S. talks open and a package  solution is achieved.</p>

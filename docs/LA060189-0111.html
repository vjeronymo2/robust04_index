			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Pope John Paul II, who begins a five-nation, 10-day tour of Scandinavia today,  will encounter religious anti-Catholicism that is little changed since the  excommunication of Martin Luther in 1520. In Norway, most Lutheran bishops have  refused to attend a common prayer meeting, and in Denmark, Protestant bishops  have threatened to boycott the visit if the Pope is allowed to speak in the  country's royal cathedral. Only in Finland, which has two state churches --  Lutheran and Greek Orthodox -- is the visit to take on the form of an  integrated ecumenical meeting.  </P></p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / US, UK top drugs market growth The US and UK remain the fastest growing pharmaceuticals markets in the world, but the gap is slowly being closed by other western European nations, according to figures published yesterday. Drug sales in the US for the first eight months of the year stood at Dollars 34bn (Pounds 21bn), 8 per cent higher than a year ago. This represents modest growth in the US by recent historical standards and was matched only by the UK where drug sales rose to Dollars 3.6bn, said IMS International, the specialist market research company. Both the UK and the US have been relatively lenient towards drugs companies. Other countries have imposed sometimes draconian price controls on drugs in an attempt to limit the growth in healthcare costs. The world's second biggest market, Japan, saw sales rise only one per cent - to Dollars 14.1bn - in the first eight months of 1994 compared with the same period a year earlier. Drug sales growth in Japan averaged 6 per cent in 1993 but the government imposed widespread price cuts in April this year. Italy has seen the sharpest turnaround in the fortunes of the drug sector. A January reform to the the system under which some drugs were paid for by the state has led to many widely-used products now sold at half or even full price. The latest figures show that drugs sales are running at 8 per cent below a year ago. In Germany, drugs sales have recovered this year. August was a good month for the industry, and sales for the year to August were up 6% on 1993, at Dollars 8.7bn. This is compared with a 5% rise recorded year on year in July. France recorded a 2 per cent increase for the first eight months of 1994 over the same period of 1993.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        PHARMACY DRUG PURCHASES                     January-August 1994 (Dollars m)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            N America     Japan*     Germany    France  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cardiovascular               5,570       2,206       2,117      2,062 Alimentary/Metabolism        5,580       2,750       1,539      1,337 Central Nervous System       5,776         715         930        930 Anti-infectives              3,138       1,754         555        894 Respiratory                  3,424       1,053         893        584 Musculo-Skeletal             1,493       1,380         469        353 Blood Agents                 1,541       1,171         336        495 Others                       7,465       3,096       1,866      1,363 Total                       33,987      14,125       8,705      8,018 % Change**                       8           1           6          2  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Italy     UK    Spain     N'land     Belgium  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cardiovascular          1,138    604     516       209         213 Alimentary/Metabolism     873    703     423       249         164 Central Nervous System    468    480     291       133         166 Anti-infectives           586    250     314        68         116 Respiratory               292    549     248       155          96 Musculo-Skeletal          267    237     141        49          58 Blood Agents              285     59     148        48          43 Others                    935    694     467       201         180 Total                   4,844  3,576   2,548     1,112       1,036 % Change**                 -8      8       4         6           3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Non-hospital market only **Increase excluding currencies  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IMS International  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Baker puts on brave face as Mideast mission wavers MR James Baker, the US secretary of state, takes his Middle East peace mission to Jordan and Israel today with little sign of any tangible progress in his efforts to convene a regional peace conference. After talks yesterday in Cairo with his Soviet counterpart, Mr Alexander Bessmertnykh, Mr Baker told reporters that there were 'significant differences' between Israel and Syria on a UN role at a proposed conference, and on the exact nature of the gathering. Damascus is pressing for a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East dispute on the basis of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which require Israel to withdraw from land occupied in the 1967 war, including Syria's Golan Heights. But Israeli leaders discount UN participation, saying the world body is biased. Israel is also against a regional conference that has any status beyond that of a ceremonial 'opening' to direct talks with its neighbours. Syria wants a regional gathering to have a role in overseeing peace moves. With the Baker mission hung up on these procedural issues, other knotty questions are tending to be overlooked at this stage, such as the perennial problem of who might represent the Palestinians. Mr Baker is pressing for a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation to overcome Israel's objection to sitting down with representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, which it describes as a 'terrorist gang'. Officials close to Mr Baker have warned that if by the end of the week there is little sign of progress, the US secretary of state will abandon his latest round of peace-making and return to Washington. Mr Baker is seeking to put the best public face on a very unpromising situation, but in private US officials have sounded pessimistic. A rash of statements from Mr Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's premier, in the past few days insisting that there would be no territorial compromise have cast a deepening shadow over the Baker mission. Mr Bessmertnykh tried to sound a faint note of optimism after his meeting with Mr Baker, telling reporters that 'our talks on the Middle East have reached a large plateau.' Problems were fewer than before which gave 'ground for hope', he added. Mr Bessmertnykh was due to meet Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, in Geneva today. 'They are meeting here on Tuesday but that's all I can say at this stage,' said a PLO official in Geneva.</p>

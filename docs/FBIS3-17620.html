Official results are expected to be announced Wednesday.    The referendum included questions on whether the population  favours relations with Ukraine on the basis of agreements, on  dual citizenship on the peninsula and on providing the force of  law to a number [of] Meshkov's decrees.    Local observers note that the affirmative answer to the  questions means support to the first Crimean president elected  in January and to his anti-crisis programme.</p>

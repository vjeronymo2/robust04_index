			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (22): Scotland the different ANATOMY OF SCOTLAND Edited by Magnus Linklater and Robin Denniston Chambers, Pounds 15.99 431 pages THE NICE THING about Scotland is its manageable size. Its population is concentrated, with 4m of its 5m people living in the 70-mile-long central belt. Its principal companies and its institutions, financial and otherwise, are few. for You frequently go to gatherings at which a good selection of the top people in the country are all together. Above all, Scotland is different. Scots feel themselves to be a distinct nation within the UK and do many things differently from England. Scotland therefore lends itself to a book like this, which describes the different sectors of public life in the country, its distinctive organisations and economy. The editors, Magnus Linklater, editor of The Scotsman, and Robin Denniston, a publisher, also promise to tell how the country 'works,' who runs it and how those people exercise their power. The title emulates Anthony Sampson's famous Anatomy of Britain which first appeared in 1962. Like Sampson's book, this has chapters on such things as the law, the aristocracy, politics, the civil service, the church, business, economic quangos, the arts and sport. It is all useful stuff, fascinating and entertaining in parts, and the book should be on the shelf of anyone who needs to know about Scotland. It is remarkably free of inaccuracies, the sub-section on the financial community being an exception. But unlike Sampson's Anatomy of Britain this book is written by ten authors, mostly Scottish journalists such as George Rosie, Alf Young or Peter Jones. This is not the exploration of an outsider who comes in to meet the key people but rather the view of writers with distilled knowledge of their subject. As a result there is no overall judgment on Scotland, its strengths, weaknesses or its future, and the broad questions posed by the editors never really receive an answer. How is that a country with a very small ruling group (perhaps only about 2,000 people, many of whom appear fleetingly in this book) rarely succeeds in defining a big objective, then combining to achieve it? Scots often express their frustration at this. Linklater says in his introduction that although the lines of influence of leading Scots 'cross and criss-cross,' it is hard to talk about a Scottish 'Establishment.' England, he thinks, has a much more obvious ruling class. He may be right (I disagree) but in a book on how Scotland works it deserve more than a paragraph.</p>

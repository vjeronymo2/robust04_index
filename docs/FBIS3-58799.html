			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Cowardice of Europe"] </F>   [Text] There must be not less, but more Europe. That is  the familiar chorus of the litany of many political parties, and  over the next few months the population will continue to be  confronted with it. After all, the European election campaign  will soon be starting, and a not inconsiderable number of  candidates will declare their great belief in the European idea.  Their words will meet with great skepticism, not least because  of Europe's dramatic failure in the former Yugoslavia.    Exactly how great and total the debacle really is, was once  again illustrated all too clearly yesterday in the European  Parliament [EP] in Strasbourg. European Commissioner Hans Van  den Broek called for the curtailment of European attempts at  negotiating peace, claiming that after all they lead nowhere and  invariably end in failure. Despite the many conferences that  have been held, the prospect of peace is further away than ever.  And whenever agreements were reached in the past, they were not  respected. The warring factions in Bosnia are continuing to  give priority to their armed struggle and Europe is powerless to  convince them to do otherwise. The European Union lacks the  military might, a coherent concept, and, above all, the  single-mindedness to do so. It is no coincidence that Van den  Broek should specifically choose the Greek presidency to propose  that Europe wash its hands in innocence, echoing the legendary  cowardice of Pontius Pilate. After all, the Greeks are allies  of the Serbs, and will do nothing that ruffles the feathers of  Milosevic &amp; Co. Under these circumstances, it can virtually  be  ruled out that the Union will succeed in acting firmly or  coherently. After nearly three years of war, an exhausted  Europe has had enough of the misery in Bosnia. Yesterday, an  isolationist appeal was made by EC Commissioner Van den Broek,  but there were also the decisions by the Netherlands and Germany  to send thousands of Croatian refugees back home. The question  remains, however, as to what the consequences will be of any  further spreading of the fighting and ethnic cleansing. Bosnia  is not the only powder keg in the Balkans. There is also  Kosovo, and Macedonia. If their fuse is ignited, then the fire  could spread right through the Balkans, and the European Union  would have no alternative but to fear the collapse of that  entire flank of the continent. The belief that the Union can  isolate itself from the rest of Europe is a dangerous  misconception, and a foolish illusion.</p>

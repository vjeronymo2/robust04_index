			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / UK Company News: Ropner stages second half recovery ROPNER, the engineering, property, investment and shipping group, picked up in the second half to leave 1991 pre-tax profits just 4.5 per cent short on the previous year. Profits for the 12 months worked through at Pounds 5.27m (Pounds 5.53m), after being Pounds 2.27m (Pounds 2.97m) at the halfway mark. 'A creditable performance' according to Mr Jeremy Ropner, chairman. Following the earlier disposal programme, turnover dropped from Pounds 35.4m to Pounds 14.6m, and generated an operating surplus of Pounds 1.55m compared with Pounds 2.64m. The rest of the profit was made up of income from interests in associated undertakings Pounds 1.81m (Pounds 1.59m) and investment revenue Pounds 2.09m (Pounds 2.11m), less interest payable significantly lower at Pounds 181,000 (Pounds 815,000). Mr Ropner said each of the three operating divisions contributed positively; stringent control of costs and 'a realistic approach' to marketing made a significant impact. Engineering activities included production of domestic electric heaters, textile and can making machinery, and machinery for paper making and paper processing. Profit of the Scruttons associate was Pounds 4.27m (Pounds 1.87m). Group share was Pounds 1.22m and included non-recurring exceptional items of Pounds 2.42m of which Pounds 693,000 was attributable to the shareholding. It was clear that recessionary and competitive influences were affecting Scruttons' performance in 1992, Mr Ropner declared. Cash resources created by disposals had been conserved against the background of a deteriorating business environment. The group had generated a positive cash flow while continuing to invest in existing businesses. For the current year Mr Ropner was optimistic of a better contribution from engineering, where Meltog had a gratifying order book, and of continuing progress in property. Shipping, however, was unlikely to achieve a result comparable to 1991. 'When the business climate improves I am confident that - as a result of the measures we have taken to restructure the framework of the company - our profitability and dividend-paying capability will improve,' he said. Earnings per share were maintained at 15.8p and the dividend is held at 8.25p with a final of 4.75p.</p>

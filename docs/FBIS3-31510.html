			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, Feb 17 (CTK) -- Frantisek Miklosko,  deputy chairman of the opposition Christian Democratic Movement  (KDH), said today he saw a solution to the current stalemate in  parliament by adopting a resolution charging the president with  calling a referendum to decide on holding early elections in  November. The constitutional bill of the Slovak opposition to  hold early elections in November did not get the necessary  three-fifths (90) of the votes in parliament today.    The opposition does, however, have a chance to push through  a  resolution on referendum as a simple majority of the votes in  the 150-member parliament is required for it to be approved.  The opposition has not yet come up with such a suggestion.    "The resolution would be a way out of the current crisis and  then the question what to do with the privatization law and a  vote of no confidence in parliament could be discussed. These  things should be decided by all parties on the highest level,"  Miklosko said.    "The prospects for the dismissal of the cabinet of Premier  Vladimir Meciar have become very complicated," he said. "It is  one thing to dismiss the government and another to compose a new  one," Miklosko said alluding to the stand of the Hungarian  minority coalition.    The coalition of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement  (MKDH) and the Egyutteles movement made it clear that it would  support a new cabinet provided the opposition promised in a  written form to meet the Hungarian minority demands. Therefore  votes of the 14 Hungarian deputies could prove to become  decisive under the current stalemate distribution of forces  between the coalition and the opposition.    "The position of Hungarian deputies is very problematic and  we therefore do not have enough votes to compose a new  government by ourselves," Miklosko said.    Referring to the intention of the governing Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) to start collecting 350,000  signatures on Monday [21 February] to call a referendum on  holding parliamentary elections in June, Miklosko said that "it  was an absolutely unrealistic plan."    "I regard it as an unambiguous attempt to exert pressure. To  call elections in June is unrealistic," Miklosko said, adding  that if a resolution binding the president to call a referendum  is passed by parliament it would become impossible to call two  referendums on early elections.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Russia in Turmoil: Wealthiest republic waits and watches YAKUTIA, the biggest and richest republic within the Russian federation, is waiting to see whether pro- or anti-Yeltsin forces will win the impeachment vote today in the Congress of People's Deputies. 'We are waiting to see which side will turn out to be right,' jokes Mr Gavriil Struchkov, editor of a liberal newspaper, Sakhada (Land of the Yakuts). Some 6,000km north-east of Moscow, Yakutia - or Sakha, as it prefers to call itself - has much at stake in the showdown between President Boris Yeltsin and the parliament. A statement by the local republican government and parliamentary leaders on Monday simply condemned power struggles in Moscow without blaming Mr Yeltsin or Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker. But some local reformists said yesterday that a victory for parliament would give the cautious Yakut leadership a freer hand to reverse economic reforms. This is already happening as a continuing fall in production and raging inflation are being blamed on privatisation, said Mr Fedot Tumusov, head of parliament's committee for market reforms and entrepreneurship. 'A year ago I would have doubted reforms could fade,' said Mr Vladimir Danilov, deputy chairman of the state privatisation committee. But he said that Mr Mikhail Nikolayev, the Yakut president, had recently supported a decision to weaken his committee by splitting it into two. Only one privatisation auction, offering shares for vouchers distributed to the entire population, had been held so far. Mr Danilov said that if Mr Yeltsin was again defeated at today's Congress, it would only be a matter of time before Mr Anatoly Chubais, the energetic Russian privatisation minister, was removed and his mass privatisation strategy dumped. However, if strong presidential rule and energetic reforms were pursued by the centre, there would be less leeway, indeed less incentive, for Sakha to go its own way. A failure to stabilise Russia's finances and restructure the economy could encourage rich regions like Yakutia to introduce their own currencies and withhold diamonds and taxes from the centre. The producer of 98 per cent of Russia's diamonds and the third largest source of gold, Yakutia has pushed autonomy to the limits promised but never granted under the old communist system. But while declaring its sovereignty and introducing Yakut citizenship alongside Russian nationality, the 1m-strong republic has also pledged to remain part of the Russian federation. Mr Vasily Alexeyev, chairman of the Yakut parliament's natural resources committee, said his republic now had a fair deal for sharing its diamonds and gold with Moscow. But he said it was important to recognise that Yeltsin was fighting a very real threat of a communist counter-coup. 'The many former communists who are talented professionals are needed, but others who just want to return things to the way they were before are very dangerous,' said Mr Alexeyev, a biologist who never joined the party. 'Everywhere the fate of democracy will depend on how quickly they are neutralised.' However, his namesake, Mr Artur Alexeyev, first secretary of the newly revived local communist party, had no qualms about declaring that Yakutia had been better off under communist rule. 'At least then we didn't have poverty. The Soviet regime also gave us our own Yakut state.' He wants fresh elections for parliament and president alike, saying neither side had carried out its promises for a better life.</p>

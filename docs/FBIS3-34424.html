Prayers and peace be upon the most noble of messengers.  Citizens-- men and women: The country is going through a  decisive stage in its history, amid international changes and  developments on the national scene which place the country in a  multifaceted crisis. We have talked a great deal about this  crisis, and an exact diagnosis of it has been made. The time  has come for us to look forward to the future with all of our  strength and to face the situation with courage. This is the  challenge facing all Algerians, men and women alike.    Algeria has capabilities, and its sons have sufficient  ability, will, and determination to confront this challenge. We  have to remove the spirit of despair and failure from our  hearts, and regain creative initiative. Fortunately, the force  that is motivating our society is the will of a vital people who  aspire to self-realization and to prove itself as an active and  effective force. We understand well and in depth the will of  change, and we understand the aspirations of our people,  particularly our youth, for development, justice, and progress.  We work for the embodiment of this will and push the process of  change to its aspired end. The political crisis in Algeria is  in fact a crisis of a society that aspires for radical change  and for the building of a developed Algeria, capable of taking  its position in the modern world: an Algeria that realizes  democracy and believes in the ethical and human values.    An Algeria that rejects backwardness and marginalization, an  Algeria deeply rooted in its religion, its identity, and its  history and confidently looking forward to the future. We stand  for this ambitious Algeria which is able to win the challenges  and which should launch all of its capabilities and resources in  the battle of change. This change, which is a true break from  the past, could only be comprehensive and all of the effective  forces in society have to take part in the change, including  political, economic, social, and cultural forces and honourable  citizens. This Algeria, deeply rooted in its countryside,  villages, and towns, with its youth, cadres, workers, farmers  and women, exists in the fields, factories, universities, and  institutions.    We will work to provide conditions and suitable frameworks  to  bring about a break with the past and a change.    Youth ought to understand that the current transformations,  which must be completed in an atmosphere of security and  stability, are aiming, in essence, at giving an opportunity to  the new generations to play their role in the administration and  the management of the country. And this is one of the main aims  of the new national system.    We will provide all available resources and the necessary  facilities for our youth to shoulder their responsibilities in  order to shape their fate with confidence.    Citizens: I salute all of the national forces and the  security forces and members of the People's National Army as  well as our cadres, workers, and youth who have been attending  to the country's safety and security, to the state's continuity,  and to the normal work of the institutions.    I salute our community abroad, which will receive special  attention in our work. We will take the necessary measures  leading to the consolidation of its solidarity and the defense  of its interests and allow it to take part in the national  action and the country's economic development.    Citizens: In the political sphere we have chosen the path  of dialogue to deal with the country's current situations, and  as a basis for political practice. Despite the difficulties and  hesitation by some sides, we are determined to continue serious  dialogue according to the aims listed in the national consensus  platform to which we are committed throughout the transitional  period. These goals are to ensure the availability of political  and security conditions and to revert to the path of democratic  election, thus enabling the people to choose its representatives  with total freedom and without any form of pressure and  falsification. We realize that the political crisis can be  solved only through dialogue and with the participation of the  national political and social forces--without exception.  Algeria has a defined program and a clear plan for dealing with  the political crisis. We are in control of this path and firm  in applying this program.    We would like to draw the attention of the foreign partners  to the fact that we need calm, and we ask them to be reserved in  their evaluations of our country's situation. In order to  consolidate this path the National People Army--the offshoot of  the Liberation Army--will always remain at the level of  challenges and wagerings, and will make every effort to help the  country to a suitable political and permanent solution through  dialogue within the framework of the principles of the republic  and by respecting the people's choice.    Citizens: We are convinced that the security solution alone  is not enough to take the country out of the crisis, and that  radical solutions to the political, economic, social, and  cultural issues are inevitable.    Furthermore, the return of security and stability in the  country as well as tranquility to the citizen will undoubtedly  secure a quick solution to these problems.    We will use all resources to contain violence and end the  bloodletting. The blood that is being shed is Algerian  blood--the blood of our sons and daughters. Therefore, it is  imperative that we stop the blooldshed and free the country from  violence once and for all. Violence as a way to political  change and as a way to seize power is totally unacceptable.    Although we have been trying to free political action and  organize it within the framework of law and away from all forms  of violence and political manipulation, we will never tolerate  those who are trying to sow the seeds of sedition and chaos, to  destroy the country's material and human resources, and to  tarnish its reputation. No religious, political, or cultural  reason can explain or justify the crimes that have been  committee against people and property.    The abnormal phenomenon in our country reflects nihilism and  belongs to organized crime, whose main goal is to deal a blow to  the nation's dynamic and real forces.    The law will be applied fully and strictly to the  perpetrators of these acts. Those who have gone wrong and have  not committed crimes against the nation can return to reason,  sense, and adherence to the law. In this context, I would like  to express my sympathy and support to the families of the  victims of the crimes.    Citizens, everyone must be aware that political pluralism  and  democratic practice do not mean the weakening of the state or an  undermining of its institutions. The new national order, devoid  of political, ideological, economic, and cultural monopolies,  can only be achieved in a state with strong institutions. This  state must belong to all the Algerians, whatever their political  affiliation.    In this context, the national media has a sensitive role to  play in building the new national order. It has to rise to the  level of responsibility to enlighten the public opinion and  educate and promote it; promote its civil tendency; report the  truth objectively, without distortion or falsification; inform  it of what takes place around it; and raise it in a way that  would serve the homeland.    Citizens: In order to get out of the current situation it  is imperative for us to find solutions to the economic  situation. This requires making decisions and taking practical  measures that will effectively implement the economic reforms  aimed at liberating the national economy from monopoly and  centralization and providing the opportunity for creative  initiatives to bring forth public and private economic and  financial resources, as well as to build an advanced economy  that complies with market laws and competition. All of this  needs state protection for the more deprived social groups.    Appropriate solutions will be found for foreign debts, which  are a heavy burden on the country, through negotiations with  international financial institutions. Dealing with the economy  will lead to temporary negative complications, which are the  nature of any qualitative structural change. We will resolutely  ensure that Algerians will share these complications within the  framework of an effective national solidarity.    Citizens: Confronting the internal problems does not  distract us from paying attention to the changes taking place  around us in the world. Algeria, which is conscious of the new  challenges, will do its best to determine its position in the  new world order and play a vital role in the international  cooperation and world peace.    In this respect, the need to build the Arab Maghreb Union  appears to be a necessity imposed upon it. Algeria will use all  its influence to achieve this noble goal. We will work  sincerely to clarify the atmosphere for guaranteeing the  interests of the peoples of the region and respect their will.  This makes us give our complete support to the UN peace plan to  settle the Western Saharan issue.    We emphasize the policy of good neighborliness and  noninterference in internal affairs, and we are enthusiastic  about consolidating the stability of the region and eliminating  the causes of tension, conflicts, and extremism.    Algeria will continue to be committed to its solidarity with  African peoples and the region's fateful causes.    Algeria will work for a just and lasting peace in the Middle  East and in the Arab region; it will welcome any initiative  aimed at cleansing the atmosphere in the Arab world.    Algeria will also continue to play its role in the  Mediterranean in order to make it a region of peace,  cooperation, and stability; it will be committed to bolstering  relations with the countries of the North and developing them on  bases of common interests and mutual respect.    Citizens: In conclusion, I would like to take this  opportunity to salute the Algerian people, who in this difficult  situation have shown awareness, vigilance, and compassion, and  have rejected violence and adventurism.    I would like to appeal to all Algerians to mobilize in order  to regain our country's glory, pride, and might.    Citizens: I hope on the occasion of the advent of the  blessed month of Ramadan, the month of atonement and  forgiveness, that tranquility will return to the people, peace  to the country, and love between the people. Surmounting crises  can be achieved only through compassion and work.    May God's guidance make our work successful and Algeria a  peaceful country.    Long live Algeria.    Eternal glory to our martyrs.    May God's peace and benediction be upon you.</p>

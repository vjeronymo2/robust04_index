			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Damascus Urges Christopher </F> To Bring Something New If He Wants Successful Visit"]    [Excerpt] Damascus, Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- [passage  omitted] On the eve of U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's arrival in the region a Syrian official has told  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that, if Christopher wants his latest visit to  succeed, he must bring something new as well as clear answers to  the fundamental questions Damascus raised during his recent  visit, because both the fate and the resumption of the peace  process will be determined by these answers.    The Syrian official added that Damascus does not believe  that  Christopher is coming to the region empty-handed. Or that he is  going to expose himself to the difficulty and hardship of travel  without bringing something new with him. Nor do we believe that  the United States would risk its credibility and reputation and  evade its pivotal role in the peace process.    The Syrian official pointed out that Syria is waiting to see  what Christopher is going to bring with him. And that it  stresses once again that he is going to receive every response  inasmuch as Syria truthfully and sincerely aspires to peace -- a  peace called the peace of the brave based on justice and  comprehensiveness. The official said: If Israel really is  seeking to establish this peace, it -- before anyone else --  knows the roads leading to it, otherwise this peace is going to  remain a dream that cannot be realized, thereby pushing the  region toward numerous probabilities.    The Syrian official accused Israel of seeking to achieve  separate deals on all the Arab axes. And that it has prepared  for them secretly under the peace slogan in order to impose its  conditions on the Arabs individually.    The official said: We do not believe that Washington is  going to let Israel diminish its role. Because the current U.S.  role does not allow it to implement the will of one party to the  exclusion of another, especially when that party is in breach of  international law. And Israel's interests and relations with  the Arabs cannot allow it to be able to impose its conditions  and what it terms its peace and security in the region. And the  United States is fully aware that separate deals will not lead  to peace. In fact, that attitude is going to make peace  prospects remote.</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONG BEACH BACKS MOVE TO BAR BIAS OVER AIDS  </P> <P> With little ado, the City Council this week endorsed a proposal outlawing  discrimination against people who have AIDS.  </P> <P> In a unanimous vote that drew applause from a crowd of supporters, the council  ordered preparation of an ordinance that would prohibit discrimination in  housing, on the job, or in offering business or medical services.  </P> <P> "I'm glad it wasn't controversial. Something like this shouldn't be  controversial," said David Newell, who, as president of the Long Beach Lambda  Democratic Club, has been one of the proposal's leading proponents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Smith Urged Support of Measure  </P> <P> Six California cities, including Los Angeles and Pasadena, already have AIDS  anti-discrimination on the books, as do six counties, including Los Angeles.  "We feel the city of Long Beach should join other cities," Councilman Clarence  Smith said in urging his colleagues' support.  </P> <P> Under the proposed ordinance, those who believe they are being discriminated  against because they have AIDS or are simply perceived to have AIDS could file  a civil lawsuit, both for damages and to halt the discrimination. The city  attorney would also have the authority to sue to stop instances of  discrimination.  </P> <P> Advocates, who faced virtually no opposition at Tuesday's council meeting,  argued that the legislation is necessary both to protect civil rights and to  create an environment in which people will undergo testing for acquired immune  deficiency syndrome without fear of retribution.  </P> <P> "We must work to reduce the risk," said Councilman Evan Anderson Braude, who  introduced the proposal.  </P> <P> With more than 600 reported cases of AIDS, Long Beach has one of the most  serious AIDS problems in Los Angeles County. City health officials have  endorsed the ordinance, stressing that there is no medical reason to  discriminate against those with AIDS.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Memo on Transmission of AIDS  </P> <P> "There is no evidence that the virus is transmitted in the air, by sneezing, by  shaking hands, by sharing a glass, by insect bites, by living in the same  household with an AIDS sufferer or by any other incidental or casual contact,"  Diana M. Bonta, the city's director of Health and Human Services, wrote in a  memo to the council.  </P> <P> Rather, the virus that causes AIDS is transmitted through sexual contact and  through exposure to infected blood, or from an infected mother to her baby at  the time of birth.  </P> <P> One of the first cities in the nation to enact an AIDS anti-discrimination  ordinance, Los Angeles assigned a deputy city attorney to handle complaints  filed under the 1985 law. The city has received about 300 complaints during the  four years the law has been in effect, but has never gone to court, said David  Schulman, the Los Angeles city attorney who oversees the AIDS cases.  </P> <P> Testifying earlier at a council committee meeting on the matter, Schulman said  there are several reasons why the complaints have not wound up in court. Many  of them are settled, AIDS victims do not want publicity about their condition  and they are often too ill to pursue a lengthy court case.  </P> <P> Mark S. Senak, an attorney who has handled a number of AIDS discrimination  complaints around the country, said that it is his experience that if people  lose their jobs because they have AIDS they are more likely to settle for  financial damages and continued insurance benefits than reinstatement. "People  tend not to take their job back or want it back," said Senak, who is now  working as the AIDS Project director at St. Mary Medical Center in Long Beach.  </P></p>

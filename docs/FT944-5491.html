			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: The real purpose of competition policy Sir, Your editorial on Sir Bryan Carsberg's decision to step down as director general of the Office of Fair Trading ('Trading places', November 30) appears to perpetuate the myth that the purpose of competition policy is the protection of the consumer. Competition policy in the UK, and elsewhere, is based on the notion of public interest - that is, the long-term interests of society as a whole and not the short-term interests of consumers. It was this confusion over the aims of competition policy which brought Sir Bryan and the OFT into conflict with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The most vivid manifestation of this conflict arises over the different approaches taken by the OFT and MMC to so-called vertical restraints. The OFT under Sir Bryan views any vertical restraint with suspicion. Put crudely, it believes that all vertical arrangements are put in place simply to enable companies to increase prices to the overall detriment of the consumer. In contrast, the MMC has a much more agnostic view. It recognises correctly that in many cases vertical arrangements are pro-competitive and benefit the consumer. Moreover, it is important to remember that the OFT's assessment of the competitive effects of vertical arrangements is necessarily limited - its role is one of separating those cases which clearly do not raise any concerns from those which might. Any decisions it takes, therefore, should be seen as no more than preliminary. In contrast, the role of the MMC is to undertake a much more thorough investigation of those cases referred to it by the OFT. The fact that a lengthy and in-depth investigation often reveals no public interest issues should not be cause for censure. Competition policy requires individuals who are capable of dispassionate and objective economic analysis and who recognise the complexities of business. As you say, finding a suitable new director general will not be easy. Simon Bishop, Lexecon, 40 Long Acre, London WC2E 9JT</p>

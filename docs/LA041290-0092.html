			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH ISSUES EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PROTECT CHINESE STUDENTS  </P> <P> President Bush on Wednesday issued the executive order he promised last  November to protect Chinese students from deportation to their politically  troubled homeland.  </P> <P> Bush directed the attorney general to defer until Jan. 1, 1994, any deportation  proceedings against Chinese nationals who were in the United States on or after  June 5, 1989, and whose visas expire.  </P> <P> Many Chinese students fear reprisals because they supported the pro-democracy  movement that was crushed when the government sent in the army against the  people in Beijing to end the occupation of Tian An Men Square last spring.  </P> <P> Instead of starting deportation proceedings, the government will notify Chinese  nationals when their visas expire, under the order signed by Bush. The Chinese  nationals also will have the right to seek jobs in the United States.  </P> <P> A requirement that Chinese nationals must have valid passports will be waived.  The government also will furnish documents to "facilitate travel across the  borders of other nations and re-entry into the United States" for those whose  passports expired.  </P> <P> Bush had announced that he would protect the Chinese students who feared  persecution after Beijing's brutal crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators  last June.  </P> <P> On Nov. 30, he vetoed legislation designed to extend visa protections to the  Chinese nationals. But he said then that he would issue an executive order to  guarantee that no one would be forced to return to China.  </P></p>

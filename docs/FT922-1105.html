			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Would-be firewood fetches Pounds 17,600: Saleroom A BUNDLE of 21 rare wooden tally sticks used in the mid 13th century as royal receipts sold for Pounds 17,600 at Sotheby's yesterday to the London dealer Quaritch. In 1834 millions of obsolete tally sticks were placed on a bonfire which went out of control and burned down the Palace of Westminster. The sticks sold yesterday - which were used as counterfoils - were presumably saved from the flames. The sticks provided the Exchequer with proof of such payments as Pounds 6 13s 4d from the Abbot of Abingdon 'for making the king's son (the future Edward I) a knight' and Pounds 3 6s 8d 'from John de Turbervill for contempt'. The price reached yesterday was at the top of the estimate. In the same auction of manuscripts and miniatures an Italian Renaissance manuscript by Basinio da Parma on astronomy and astrology, written in Rimini around 1455, sold for Pounds 115,500, way ahead of forecast. It was bought by Bank of Rimini for the town museum. The auction totalled Pounds 853,402 with 11.8 per cent unsold. This unsold percentage was largely accounted for by a Book of Hours, produced in Bruges around 1510, which was unusual in being signed by its scribe, 'Johnnykins of Bomal'. The manuscript was unsold at Pounds 72,000 but found a buyer immediately after the auction. The collection of German faience (tin-glazed earthenware) assembled by Dr Ragnar Borsum brought in more than Pounds 500,000 with a top price of Pounds 52,800 paid twice - for a Nuremberg tankard of around 1760, painted with scenes of children playing, and for a Bayreuth tankard dated 1771, which carried a top estimate of Pounds 9,000. Christie's had disappointments at its tribal art sale. It totalled Pounds 363,170 but was more than 40 per cent unsold. An Ubangi slit drum made Pounds 82,500, but the biggest surprise was a pair of Indian moccasins, from the Cree-Seminole tribe, which were estimated at up to Pounds 1,500, but which sold for Pounds 22,000. Phillips was selling in situ the contents of 13 St Thomas Street, Winchester. The top price, and double the estimate, was the Pounds 59,540 paid by an overseas dealer for a pair of George II carved console tables in the manner of William Kent.</p>

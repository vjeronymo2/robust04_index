			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Buckingham holders told to sell INDEPENDENT directors of Buckingham International will today advise investors in the struggling hotels and nursing homes group to sell their shares, as its cash difficulties appear greater than previously thought. Their statement marks a change of opinion on a Pounds 12.4m offer for Buckingham's common and loan stock from Purlieus, a Jersey company controlled by Jemma Trust and Naaz Holdings. Together they own 38.7 per cent of Buckingham and the Takeover Panel ordered them to bid for the rest. The directors will tell shareholders they should either accept the offer or sell their ordinary shares in the market for a higher price. They should retain, though, their loan stock. Purlieus is offering 2.75p per ordinary share and 27.5p per Pounds 1 nominal of loan stock. Earlier this month the directors advised shareholders to reject the bid and retain an ongoing interest. The shares closed down  1/4 p on Friday at 5p. The group's survival, however, is now in doubt if it cannot find funding - either through project finance or asset sales - before the middle of 1993. Pounds 100m.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Huge selling of pound and lira EUROPEAN currencies and the US dollar suffered sharp falls against the D-Mark yesterday as investors panicked over Germany's decision not to cut its short-term interest rates last Friday, writes James Blitz. Another concerted round of D-Mark buying was triggered by a growing belief that the differential between US and German short term interest rates could rise. The Bundesbank left the Lombard rate unchanged while dealers believe that the Federal Reserve might cut rates at its Federal open Markets Committee today following Friday's poor non-farm payroll figure. The falls in both the lira and sterling, which are now floating outside the ERM, were the most dramatic of the day. Yesterday's run on both currencies was triggered by new and acute uncertainties over their governments' economic policies. In Italy's case, the market was plagued by fears that the government's new budget will not be passed, that capital controls will be introduced and that a general strike is imminent. The lira again fell victim to selling by Italian corporates, dropping a dramatic 5 per cent on the day and closing at L934.4 from a previous L885.6. According to Mr David Cocker, chief economist of Chemical Bank, the market is targeting a fall to L1000 per D-Mark. Sterling's loss of 12.5 pfennigs against the D-Mark in three trading days results from an economic policy vacuum in the UK government. A worrying feature of the pound's decline is that it reflects heavy institutional selling of gilts and UK denominated bonds. Mr Avinash Persaud, currency economist at UBS Phillips and Drew, says that European fund managers started to sell sterling between DM2.50 and DM2.40. 'European funds were big purchasers of gilts earlier this year in the belief that there was little currency risk and a yield to be gained,' he said. Mr Persaud projects a fall to DM2.30 by the year's end. The pound closed at DM2.3920 from a previous close of DM2.43. The conviction that a realignment is imminent put pressure on several ERM currencies. Potentially the most important fall was the French franc's, which closed at FFr3.3930 to the D-Mark from a previous FFr3.3860. Both the Bundesbank and the Bank of France have spent hugely to support a currency whose devaluation would signal the end of the ERM. Mr Mark Austin, chief economist at HongKong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in London, believes that the pressure on the franc will continue if there is no realignment. The peseta closed at Pta71.40, a little closer to its floor of Pta72.62, even though the Bank of Spain intervened to support the currency.</p>

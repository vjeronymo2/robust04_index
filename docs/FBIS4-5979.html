			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Letter from Thai Ambassador to Burma Wirasak Futrakun to </F> the SUNDAY POST]    [Text] Sir: Allow me to offer my view on some points which  were made in the editorial that appeared in your distinguished  newspaper (THE SUNDAY POST) on 10th April 1994, entitled, "It's  time-wasting telling Burma what press freedom is about."    1. I have never heard of the incident that was mentioned in  the editorial involving the Thai Ambassador and the Burmese  Foreign Ministry in the aftermath of the 1988 uprising in Burma.  I doubted whether the Burmese Minister reportedly slammed one of  Thailand's English language dailies on the table before the Thai  envoy could take a seat.    For during my tenure in Myanmar [Burma] up until now, I have  never encountered a display of bad temper by any of the  ministers to me. The people of Myanmar on the whole are devout  Buddhists like the Thai people. Therefore, such display of angry  emotions is considered inappropriate.    Even during the heights of some crises, such as the Hill-491  incident, the Myanmar authorities were never rude to the Thai  ambassador. Whenever a protest had to be made to the Thai side,  the tone of the message of the Myanmar side was always more in  sorrow that such things should not have happened between friends  rather than in anger.    2. The invitation to H.E. Brig Gen Myo Thant, Minister for  Information of Myanmar, to visit Thailand is not aimed at  "erasing Rangoon's doubts that the (Thai) government supports  press criticism of the State Law and Order Restoration Council,"  but is part of the high-level exchanges between Thailand and  Myanmar for the purpose of promoting friendly ties between two  neighbouring countries.    We need to have a long-term perspective about Myanmar as our  largest immediate neighbouring country which we must maintain  and promote cordial relations if we desire peace and prosperity  for our people living in ten provinces along our Western border.    3. Our good-neighbour policy towards Myanmar is not based on  a desire for economic gains as crassly alleged by some so-called  Western experts on Myanmar. If you look at the actual foreign  investment figures of the Foreign Investment Commission of  Myanmar, Thailand places fourth (US $70.17 million) behind South  Korea (US $96.38 million), the United States (US $200.25  million), and Singapore (US $240.63 million). There is no more  logging or fishery concessions for Thai companies in Myanmar.    We pursue the present policy towards Myanmar simply because  we want to have Myanmar as a good neighbour. I often told my  Western colleagues that where you stand depends on where you  sit. I also asked them why did the British Government pursue  constructive engagement policy towards South Africa while other  western countries sought to isolate and sanction it. In our  case, a peaceful and prosperous Myanmar is in Thailand's  national interests.    4. Regarding your objection to the names "Myanmar" and  "Yangon," these are ancient and indigenous names used in our  neighboring country. Myanmar has been trying to shed her  colonial legacy associated with the names or the pronunciation  given by her former colonial power. Does the BANGKOK POST wish  to continue to constantly remind our neighbouring country of her  colonial past, thereby repeatly pouring salt into old wounds?    Wirasak Futrakun, ambassador of Thailand, Union of Myanmar.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Ukrainian Supreme Council Chairman </F> Oleksandr Moroz by unidentified correspondents on 11 June; place  not given; edited by Svitlana Pysarenko: "I Stand for  Protection of Social Achievements"]    [Text] On 11 June, Ukrainian Supreme Council Chairman  Oleksandr Moroz met with journalists, as a candidate for the  Ukrainian president. But before answering journalists'  questions, the Ukrainian Supreme Council chairman reported on  the future activities of the parliament. In particular, this  relates to the introduction of changes and amendments to the Law  on Local Councils and Self-Government, aimed at defining equal  subordination of council chairmen, as well as the need to more  accurately define the electoral procedures and counting of votes  to select the winners.    It has been planned to focus the future work of the  parliament on economic issues. Parliament will hear a report by  the Cabinet of Ministers on the current situation, in order to  reduce risk and simultaneously define the starting point for the  new authorities. Oleksandr Moroz is to deliver a report on the  problems of stabilizing the economic situation, and to define  the main directions for parliament action. Only following that,  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk will submit to the Supreme  Council for approval the candidate for prime minister, whose  plan for action would be able to confirm all decisions by the  Supreme Council. All this is being done, Oleksandr Moroz noted,  so that both legislative and executive authorities bear  responsibility for the coordination of actions of the Supreme  Council and the Cabinet of Ministers. Oleksandr Moroz also  voiced his support for amplifying functions and broadening the  powers of the Cabinet of Ministers.    Of course, there were tricky questions and smart answers as  well. Here is the quintessence. Read and judge for yourself:    [Correspondent] If the Cabinet of Ministers and the prime  minister obtained broader executive powers than its current  ones, this would mean taking them away from the president. What  functions, in your opinion, should the head of state have?    [Moroz] He should represent Ukraine so that it does not lose  its image before the world community as a member of  international organizations, in issues concerning nuclear  weapons, or trade relations. The president must defend  Ukraine's image. Regarding internal affairs, the president is  not able to concentrate on executive functions, he must hand  them over to the Cabinet of Ministers. Yet, the president  should be a guarantor of the Constitution, he should prevent any  violations.    [Correspondent] Currently, there is an opinion that it is  inexpedient to form a government before electing the president.  What is your standpoint on this issue?    [Moroz] The point is not to form the government, but to  appoint the prime minister. No one can be sure that the  president will be elected.    [Correspondent] But there is a constitutional provision  saying the new president presents the candidate for prime  minister.    [Moroz] No. It has been written in the Constitution that  the president presents the prime minister. If the Supreme  Council approves him in three days from now, it will do the same  in three weeks.    [Correspondent] You are not campaigning much for yourself.  Perhaps you need to meet with company staffs more often? Is it  important for you to participate in the presidential campaign?    [Moroz] My main task was to begin the Supreme Council's  work. When I was in the hospital, I was actively campaigning for  myself among the medical personnel. In general, I could put it  this way: "I am not asking you to vote for me, but for the man  you trust. I am not seeking power, but my goal is to become the  president." I will be holding meetings with staffs.    [Correspondent] It has been rumored that if you do not  become the president, you will begin a battle against the  presidency. Is that so?    [Moroz] No. The main point is to find within society the  optimum correlations between powers and functions of different  authorities. In Germany, for instance, all this was done, I  would say, in an intelligent manner. I would also like us to  define everything in an optimum way, so that hair does not stand  on end on heads of people supporting the division of power....    [Correspondent] In which office do you think you would feel  better -- that of Supreme Council chairman, or president?    [Moroz] I cannot say which role is better: I became the  chairman quite recently, and I have not yet worked as the  president. Therefore, I will answer this question later.    [Correspondent] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said  that he would hold consultations concerning the candidacy for  prime minister. Has this taken place, and has the candidacy  been approved?    [Moroz] Yes. Leonid Kravchuk attended the Supreme Council  session. Six names were discussed, and we agreed on two of  them. But since the president is to name them, I will not do it.    [Correspondent] Do you consider it necessary that a  presidential candidate submit his income declaration?    [Moroz] Of course, this is a norm of the law, and I have  complied with it. As a matter of fact, my declaration has not  stunned anybody.    [Correspondent] If this is not a secret, what is your  salary?    [Moroz] I have not yet received it, but it approximately  amounts to 2-2.5 million [currency not specified].    [Correspondent] President Kravchuk has recently said that he  does not see poorly dressed or hungry people in Ukraine...    [Moroz] There is nothing strange about this if someone stays  among well-dressed and well-fed people.    However, a theater actress lives in my building. Her pension  is not enough to make ends meet. I help her with food that I  grow on my countryside farm. It is difficult for her to receive  such help, and it is also difficult for me that I must help her  in such a way.    [Correspondent] If Kravchuk and Kuchma advance to the  second round of elections, for whom will you vote?    [Moroz] I will tell you that after 26 June, when they  advance to the second round.    [Correspondent] What, in your opinion, will be the results  of the 24 July elections for Ukrainian people's deputies in 112  constituencies?    [Moroz] I believe that the current proportions among forces  in the Supreme Council will be preserved. However, deputies  will not be elected everywhere. Perhaps we will have around  60-70 people elected.    [Correspondent] You have four grandchildren. Have you  already built, for example, a cottage for them?    [Moroz] I feel shameful that I have not done anything like  that for them. I recall when I was removing couch-grass from my  farm, I told to myself that socialism can be built together, but  a cottage just alone.    [Correspondent] Deputies are supposed to put into shape  their working relations with the Supreme Council. How will they  provide for themselves, will their salary be raised?    [Moroz] Cheap deputies may cost the state a lot. Their  current salary amounts to 1.3-1.5 million [currency not  specified]. One must take it into account that there is no  housing for them in Kiev, they live in hotels. Their families  live separately, which means additional expenses. Perhaps,  considering all this, deputies' salaries will be raised. But,  we will publish everything to avoid speculations. In general,  prices must be brought in line with wages, because the  artificially suppressed inflation will explode anyway.    [Correspondent] There is a talk that legislation depriving  deputies of immunity is already being drafted in parliament.    [Moroz] According to the Law on Deputy Status, a deputy is  an immune person. If a deputy violates the law, however, he  must be accountable not as a deputy, but as a citizen. All  citizens are equal before the law.    [Correspondent] Do you need your own team of people, and  according to what principle do you select them?    [Moroz] I need a team, and the principle is the ability to  objectively assess processes. Based on my experience as  Socialist Party leader, where we have different people, very  different, and where I have probably lost more health than in  any other work, I know that discrepancies in opinions are not  important to me, but causes are.    [Correspondent] Would it not be more expedient for  parliament to elect the president?    [Moroz] These elections must be held according to current  legislation. In general, I think that it would be better to  elect the president not in direct elections, but by, for  example, a congress of councils of all levels, which would have  a higher level of legitimacy. This congress of councils of all  levels, not the parliament, could also adopt amendments to the  Constitution. The Constitution would then be protected. In  general, one must first adopt an amendment to the Constitution,  and then an appropriate law, not to the contrary, as was the  case before.    [Correspondent] Do you think that the state should assist  the press, which is currently in a very difficult situation?    [Moroz] Attacks on the press began as early as 1986 in the  Soviet Union, and due to inertia, it still continues. But, it  is the reader who must be protected, so that subscription fees  for a publication he needs do not ruin his family budget.  Currently, many people do not subscribe to anything, because  their wages do not allow for that. I believe that not  publications, but the Communication Ministry must be subsidized,  and then all publications will have equal conditions before the  readers.    [Correspondent] What periodic publications do you like?    [Moroz] I like those I can read without glasses. But  speaking seriously, I like all of them, there are different  things in different newspapers. There are papers that publish  some things I already know. This is not interesting.  Currently, I flip through approximately 15 publications, most  of all those dealing with politics and authorities, reviews, and  commentaries.    [Correspondent] Have you read the latest stories concerning  Kravchuk?    [Moroz] About Kravchuk? I know more about him than the  authors of those stories. I do not read them. Rada Havrylivna,  Shcherbytskyy's [former first secretary of the Ukrainian SSR  Communist Party] wife, has presented me with a book about him.  I started to read it, and I understood that the author based  his position on Shcherbytskyy's. I put the book aside. Perhaps  I will read it one day.    [Correspondent] You once said that no political force is  putting pressure on you. What if one does, how will you react?    [Moroz] Adequately. I understand what you are trying to  say: Apparently, the communists are putting pressure on me. So  are other forces. In general, there is no majority in  parliament, and I will do everything to maintain this situation.  I believe that my goal is to consolidate all forces.    [Correspondent] Do you personally make decisions, or is  common opinion a stimulus for you?    [Moroz] There are various approaches. When I see that  someone's proposal has more merit, I support it. As a rule,  however, the majority of people do not accept progressive  decisions, at least, not immediately. So one must convince  them. I am accused of having dangerous intentions, for example,  in my program. My positions are criticized, but when I ask  which ones in particular, my accusers cannot answer, because  they have not read my program. They say that I am an enemy of  Ukraine, of the state and the people. These allegations are  groundless. I stand for the protection of our social  achievements: the guaranteed rights to work, education, health  care, and cultural development. History must not be distorted,  this will do no good. We were celebrating the 50th anniversary  of setting up the second front, and we had even forgotten to  invite members of the anti-Nazi coalition. Events are being  seen in a different light now, even though there are no grounds  for that to be the case.    [Correspondent] Are you going to visit the Crimea?    [Moroz] Yes. But before that, I want to do some preliminary  work. Besides, the Crimean problem is not as acute as it is  being portrayed by certain media. Regarding the Crimea, the  main thing is to prevent the use of force. All problems must be  resolved in a political manner.</p>

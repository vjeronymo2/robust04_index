			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Latin American Finance (2): The return of capital to Latin America AT THE beginning this year, the Financial Times celebrated its 100 years of publication on pink paper and carried a reproduction of its first pink issue. News on Latin America was prominent. One front page article declared that JS Morgan and Co and Baring Brothers declined an invitation 'to send delegates to Buenos Aires to discuss the debt question'. JS Morgan saw 'nothing to negotiate about in regard to loans.' Mexico's debt had been renegotiated five years earlier. On the last day of 1892, Mexican 6 per cent bonds issued in the 1888 restructuring by the Porfirio Diaz government closed up a quarter point on the London stock exchange, at 78 per cent of face value. One does not have to look far to be reminded of the boom-and-bust nature of the international financial markets' 200-year-old affair with Latin America. The question now is whether the recent unusual upsurge in private capital flows is sustainable, or whether once again the whole process is going to end disastrously. The flows have been spurred by developments both within and outside the region. Latin American governments have set the scene by introducing economic policies which have met the approval of investors. To greater or lesser degrees, governments have opened economies to outside competition, curbed budget deficits, privatised state industry and generally increased the role of the market. High real interest rates, designed to bear down on inflation, have more than compensated investors for the perceived risks of investment. The foreign debt problems which plagued governments during the 1980s have been temporarily ameliorated by sharply lower US interest rates. Mexico and others have benefited from longer-term, albeit modest, debt relief through the plan launched in 1989 by former US Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady. Outside the region, low US interest rates and recession in the US and other industrialised countries have lowered investor returns in more traditional markets, and led investors to look at higher returns offered in Latin America. These investors include Latin Americans who, over the previous 20 years, had moved capital away from the region. According to preliminary estimates from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (Cepal), the region's net inflows of all types of capital amounted to Dollars 57bn last year, 50 per cent up on the preceding year and nearly three times the level of 1990. The greater part of this inflow was private capital. Mexico's inflows were up to Dollars 23.3bn from Dollars 21.5bn; while Argentina's rose to Dollars 9.3bn from Dollars 5.3bn. The most remarkable rise was Brazil's, to Dollars 10.1bn from Dollars 1.2bn. After nine years in which Latin America transferred resources to the rest of the world, net transfers - that is new finance minus capital repayments and interest and dividend remitted abroad - became positive to the tune of Dollars 5.5bn in 1991 and trebled in 1992 to Dollars 17.1bn. The inflows to date have been critical in the restoration of economic growth: economic expansion exceeded population growth in 1991 and 1992. They have helped to lift the financing constraints that have plagued the region's economies since the beginning of the debt crisis.</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WALZER GUIDES GRANT GIRLS INTO CITY SOCCER FINAL  </P> <P> Amanda Walzer, out of the Grant High lineup for nearly a month because of  bruised ribs, showed no sign of rust in leading the Lancers to a 2-1 win over  San Pedro in a girls' City Section semifinal soccer match Wednesday at Daniels  Field in San Pedro.  </P> <P> Walzer, a junior striker, scored both Grant goals, the second on a sweeping  kick from 20 yards with 12 minutes remaining.  </P> <P> "She really played well, she surprised everybody," Grant Coach Frank Ortiz said  of Walzer, the Lancers' leading scorer who had not played since crashing into a  goal post in a match three weeks ago. "That lifted us, her coming out and  showing so much determination."  </P> <P> The Lancers (12-2-2) will meet undefeated Chatsworth on Saturday for the City  championship. The site of the match has not been determined. Grant finished  second to Chatsworth in the Northwest Valley Conference during the regular  season.  </P> <P> San Pedro ends its season 12-1-2.  </P> <P> Walzer scored seven minutes into the first half. After outrunning San Pedro's  coverage, Walzer went one on one with goalie Elisa De La Pena and scored on a  shot into the right side of the net.  </P> <P> San Pedro's Chellee Bennett scored on the rebound of a missed shot five minutes  later for her team's only goal.  </P></p>

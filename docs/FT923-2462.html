			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Austria still profits from special relationship: One-time middleman trade with former Comecon states survives bloc's break-up WHEN the Soviet empire collapsed three years ago, Austrians feared much of their trade would disappear. The country had long profited from its cold war role as a reliable supplier and discreet middleman in often clandestine east-west trade. In the mid-1980s, Austrian exports to countries of Comecon, the Soviet trade bloc, totalled ASch25bn-ASch30bn (Pounds 1.3bn-Pounds 1.6bn) a year, about 8 per cent of its total trade. Imports were on a similar scale. Today, to the surprise and pleasure of Austrian leaders, the economic resurgence of Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland has already more than offset losses in other former Comecon countries. These three account for more than 80 per cent of former Comecon trade, according to Austrian officials. In the first six months of this year, exports to the three amounted to 11 per cent of Austria's exports. Austria has been more successful in trading with these countries than any other western country, a fact that goes some way to explaining why the Austrian economy has resisted recession longer than those of its western neighbours. Austria's trade with these countries has grown sharply in the past three years, although in the case of Poland the growth stopped in the first half of this year. Mr Egon Winkler, Austria's overseas trade director, is optimistic that the trend will continue and perhaps broaden to other eastern countries. 'The demand for products we can offer is very large in the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) countries, but financing is a problem.' He says the composition of the eastern trade is already broadly based. 'The outstanding items are, as you would expect, construction equipment and materials, services and machinery.' According to the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), 14 per cent of the 49,000 joint ventures set up in eastern Europe have been made by Austrian companies. And of the roughly Dollars 13bn (Pounds 6.5bn) invested in eastern European countries, 6.5 per cent has come from Austria. Austria is trying to cement relationships by offering management training to fledgling businessmen from eastern countries. Mr Johann Farnleitner, deputy secretary general of the Austrian Chamber of Commerce, says more than 12,000 people have gone through 420 courses to date. 'They are grateful, and we make sure they have a short stay with an Austrian company while they are here. It is the beginning of a number of networks.' The drawback for Austria is low-priced imports from the eastern countries. The main victims are Austrian makers of cement, fertilisers, farm machinery, building materials and, to a small extent, low grade steels. (Agriculture would be another, but Austria, like the EC, fiercely protects its farmers.) Companies in these sectors have been demanding protection from what they consider dumping by the eastern countries. Austrian officials acknowledge that eastern companies benefit from low wages, low energy prices and virtually no environmental protection costs, but they are in a difficult position. Austria's exports to Hungary exceed its imports from that country by a third. The surplus with Czechoslovakia is 20 per cent. 'It is hard for us to do anything to help these hurt sectors because we are doing so well overall,' Mr Farnleitner says. Austria's policy is to try to give these sectors time to adjust. In the case of cement, which is causing acute problems, the government hopes to set up an orderly marketing agreement with eastern producers to start when import quotas are removed at the end of this year. Some observers estimate that up to 100,000 Austrian jobs may be lost as a result of the new eastern competition. Mr Farnleitner puts the figure at up to 40,000. Mr Franz Vranitzky, the federal chancellor, who has to bear the political pressure of this development, observes wryly: 'It is one of those difficult situations in which you see macro-economic success and micro-economic defeat.' Another problem has arisen as a result of the association agreements between the European Community and the three eastern countries. The agreements stipulate that goods must move directly between the two to win duty-free status. This causes problems for Austria and other members of the European Free Trade Association (Efta), especially for the many large European companies which have established depots in eastern Austria to serve eastern Europe. Talks are to be held soon between EC and Efta officials to try to resolve the problem.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa said Thursday [7 April] Japan will allocate 11 million  dollars to Kazakhstan to help dismantle its nuclear weapons,  Foreign Ministry officials said. Hosokawa made the announcement  in a meeting with Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who  arrived in Japan on Wednesday for a four-day visit.    The amount is part of a total of 100 million dollars Japan  pledged last year to help four former Soviet republics --  Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan -- dismantle their  nuclear weapons. The officials said detailed use of the 11  million dollars will be decided in discussions between the two  sides at a committee on cooperation for the destruction of  nuclear weapons.    Hosokawa praised Kazakhstan's efforts to denuclearize,  democratize and shift toward a market-oriented economy, they  said. Kazakhstan joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  (NPT) as a nonnuclear weapon state last November.    Nazarbayev, 53, asked for Japanese cooperation in helping  his  country tackle environmental pollution at the Semipalatinsk  nuclear testing site and in the Aral Sea, the officials said.  Specifically, he requested cooperation in providing medical  equipment for hospitals treating people exposed to radioactivity  near Semipalatinsk.    Hosokawa said Japan will seriously consider cooperation with  the hospitals, which the ministry officials said is expected to  be covered by the 11 million dollars.    An estimated 233 million tons of radioactive substances are  believed to be left in Kazakhstan. As for environmental  problems in the Aral Sea, Hosokawa said the problem should be  solved internationally but added Japan would study what it can  do, the officials said.    Also during the 30-minute meeting, followed by an hourlong  dinner, Nazarbayev, 53, said he supports Japan's bid to become a  permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.    A joint statement signed by the two leaders prior to the  meeting said Kazakhstan "expressed the hope" that Japan would  become a permanent member of the Security Council and "fulfill  its relevant responsibilities." Hosokawa told Nazarbayev Japan  intends to fulfill its responsibilities within its capabilities,  the officials said.    On the international front, the Kazakhstan president  proposed  holding a conference covering the whole of Asia to build trust.  Hosokawa agreed on the importance of creating trust in Asia but  expressed reluctance to set up a forum covering the whole region  such as the conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  (CSCE).    Nazarbayev asked Japan to offer its manufacturing technology  to Central Asia and suggested setting up a committee between  Japan and Kazakhstan to study such a possibility. Hosokawa  suggested the two sides utilize the existing bilateral economic  committee.    Nazarbayev also offered a list of 1,394 Japanese prisoners  of  war detained in Siberia who died in Kazakhstan, the officials  said.    On Friday, Nazarbayev is to meet Emperor Akihito and Empress  Michiko and give a press conference later in the day.</p>

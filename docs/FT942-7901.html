			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / European Elections (June 9 and 12): Bavarian woman aims to win the heart of England - Financial Times Correspondents in Italy, the Netherlands and Britain follow the fortunes of three candidates seeking election to the European parliament It may seem an impossible task. But a 38-year-old farmer's daughter from Bavaria could be about to pull off one of the shock victories in Britain's Euro-elections, writes James Blitz. Ms Gisela Gschaider, representing Labour in the seat of Worcestershire and Warwickshire, has taken advantage of a new European law allowing EU nationals to stand in any Union country. The law has triggered a flurry of such candidates: in Germany a Dutch woman is standing for the Social Democrats and in Italy a Belgian man is standing for the Radical party. But while some of these candidates may be no-hopers, Ms Gschaider, a vivacious woman with a strong German accent, thinks she may be in with a chance of taking this newly created West Midlands seat. 'Two years ago it would have been unthinkable that Labour could win in such a traditionally Conservative region like this,' she says. 'But the Tories are doing so badly in opinion polls that a Labour victory is a real possibility.' Although she has lived in the UK with her English husband for 20 years, Ms Gschaider's origins have triggered controversy in an area that is the essence of 'middle England'. Mr John Corrie, the Conservative candidate, has openly doubted whether people would want to elect a German as their MEP. He said he hoped his Labour rival would enjoy 'a short sojourn in this beautiful heart of England - until June 9'. Gisela, as the local press call her, is not perturbed. While not emphasising her nationality in the campaign, she still thinks that her background would make her a particularly affective MEP. 'People do not always understand that you cannot approach European politics from a purely national point of view,' she says. 'The politics of Brussels have a supra-national flavour, and countries are discredited if they just see every issue from their own point of view.' Luck is certainly on her side in this campaign. She is standing for a party deeply committed to European integration; the British Conservatives, who are sharply divided over Europe, would find it much more difficult to put forward such a candidate in a marginal seat. Nor do local people seem swayed by the anti-German jingoism fashionable in Britain's tabloid press. But if Ms Gschaider is to win it will ultimately depend on whether the Labour party can repeat nationally the strong performance it showed in recent local elections. For the moment, its campaign managers in the West Midlands believe that the Bavarian candidate is not losing the party any votes.</p>

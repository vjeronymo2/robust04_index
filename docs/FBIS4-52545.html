			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- Kim In-so's eldest  daughter Kim Hwa-sim and Ham Se-hwan's sister Ham Suk-nyo wrote  to the International Committee of the Red Cross, calling for a  vigorous campaign to save Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan who are now  detained in South Korea after a long prison life without  ideological conversion.    Kim Hwa-sim is a university teacher in Pyongyang. She was  five years old when she saw her father last and is now near 50.  Ham Suk- nyo, above 80, lives in Ongjin county, South Hwanghae  Province.    In her letter, Kim Hwa-sim said:    "My father was arrested by the enemy while active as a  guerrilla (militiaman) in South Korea during the last Korean  war. He was kept in prison in South Korea for 33 years and  seven months for the mere reason that he refused ideological  conversion. Though released, he is not allowedi to return home  where his flesh and blood are waiting.    "The South Korean side's allegation that `Kim In-so is not a  prisoner of war, so cannot be repatriated,' is sophism ignoring  international law on prisoners of war and contradicting reason  and principle.    "The fact that my father was an unconverted long-term  prisoner and he sent a letter to the international committee of  the Red Cross last year, asking for help in his repatriation to  the northern half of Korea, shows that he does not want to live  in South Korea but earnestly hopes to return to the North where  his children live.    "I ask the international committee of the Red Cross which  defends human rights and regards the humanitarianism of Red  Cross as its life and soul to launch an active international  campaign so that my father can be returned in a short time to  the northern half of the country where his family lives."    In her letter, Ham Suk-nyo said:    "My brother Ham Se-hwan who had been arrested during the war  was excluded from the exchange of prisoners of war after the  ceasefire. He was kept in prison for 34 years for his refusal to  be converted. After his release, he is eking out a bare  existence as a sick man above 60 away from home with no one to  take care of him.    "Those in charge of the Red Cross in South Korea do not  comply with the demand of the DPRK Red Cross society for his  repatriation, alleging that he does not belong to the category  of prisoners of war. I earnestly ask your committee to launch  an active international campaign for his repatriation."</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Budget '92: Cruellest cut could come from the voters - Why Lamont should not rely on tax reductions to win the general election MR Norman Lamont needs only to look around the entrance hall of his official residence at 11 Downing Street to be reminded of the pitfalls of income tax policy in an election year. For gazing down from the walls are two former chancellors and prime ministers, Gladstone and Disraeli, who in 1874 were respectively the loser and the winner of a general election in which Gladstone went to the country promising to abolish income tax. Gladstone's defeat not only established income tax as a permanent fixture in the government's fiscal armory, it provided an early example of an occasional tendency in Britain for the electorate to reject lower taxes as a vote catcher. There is of course no hope that Mr Lamont, now preparing for his second Budget on March 10, will abolish income tax. But action to reduce the income tax burden is almost certain for the first time since Mr Nigel Lawson's tax cutting budget of 1988. The chancellor is now generally expected to take a penny off the basic income rax rate, reducing it to 24p from 25p in the pound, even though this will cost the exchequer some Pounds 1.95bn when the government's finances could be heading for a deficit of between Pounds 18bn and Pounds 24bn in 1992-93. If Mr Lamont thinks he has sufficient scope, he may raise the allowances before which the basic rate takes effect by more than the statutory 4.5 per cent rate determined by last December's year-on-year increase in the retail prices index. Television viewers can expect the chancellor to justify either move as a stimulus to Britain's recession-hit economy in his Budget speech. But income tax cuts this year would be almost entirely politically motivated. It is far from clear that lower income taxes would be the best way of restoring growth. Oxford Economic Forecasting, a private sector economic research body, has calculated that 1p off the basic rate would add just 0.1 per cent to economic growth this year and 0.3 per cent in each of the two subsequent years. Although OEF, like many other forecasting bodies, expects the chancellor to lop 1p off the basic income tax rate, it warns that 'such action may well cause some problems over the medium term'. Mr Geoff Meen, OEF's research director, points out that tax cuts take some time to work through to the economy and might only start to boost activity after the long-awaited recovery had begun. In the meantime, the government's already poor financial position would have been weakened further. From an economic viewpoint, the chancellor's first choice of a basic rate cut also appears perverse. Increasing allowances benefits the bottom 70 per cent of taxpayers in particular, while a basic rate cut puts more money in the pockets of the top 30 per cent. The lower paid would be more likely to use any tax hand-out to boost spending, thus stimulating demand in the economy. Furthermore, higher allowances take people out of the tax net. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that some 1.1m people would stop paying income tax altogether if the chancellor were to raise allowances by 9 per cent - or double the rate of indexation. Because the cost of Budget tax changes is calculated on an indexed base, such a move would be cheaper than a basic rate cut, costing about Pounds 950m more than simply indexing the allowances. The government has a long standing commitment to reducing the basic income tax rate to 20p. But until the beginning of this year, few people expected that a start would be made on this programme in this year's Budget. The change of government sentiment in favour of a rate cut is rooted in the tax and benefits policy of the opposition Labour party. Income tax is one of the few areas of economic policy where a sharp distinction exists between the government and opposition. A rate cut would clearly mark the Conservatives as the party of tax cuts ahead. Labour intends to abolish the upper earnings limit on employee's National Insurance contributions and introduce a top tax rate of 50 per cent for people earning substantially more than Pounds 30,000 a year to finance higher pensions and child benefits. It has also proposed restricting reliefs for higher tax payers and moving to a new starting rate of tax at below 20 per cent. Its plans would effectively create a top tax rate of 59 per cent compared with the present 40 per cent, set by Mr Lawson in 1988. The IFS has calculated that very few people in the bottom 70 per cent of income distribution would lose from Labour's plans and many would gain. But the abolition of the upper earnings limit would affect 3.2m employees, who would lose 9 per cent of all earned income above Pounds 20,280. Someone earning Pounds 27,000, for example, would lose slightly more than Pounds 600 a year. Many of the potential losers are concentrated in London and the south-east, where the recession has hit hardest and there are several marginal constituencies. Therefore it is not surprising that income tax has become a big election issue. A cut in the basic rate of tax has obvious attractions for Mr Lamont. It would attract more headlines in a pre-election Budget than a big increase in allowances. As Labour has said it will reverse any pre-election cut in tax rates, such a move would force the Opposition to campaign in support of raising taxes. But an income tax cut would not be without risk. Budget and election planners ignore the streak of altruism in the electorate at their peril. Mr Lamont will have to bear in mind that opinion polls earlier this year suggested that most voters would prefer more spending on public services than lower taxes. There is also the dreadful example of Gladstone, who foundered in 1874, when both the vote and liability to income tax were confined to small and affluent minorities.</p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Power companies warned on long-term deals POWER COMPANIES have been criticised by the industry's regulator over attempts to tie customers to long-term contracts in the run-up to market de-regulation next April. The Office of Electricity Regulation (Offer) has warned that some of the contracts may be anti-competitive and has instructed companies to re-draw them to provide consumers with escape clauses. The problem has arisen because of the impending introduction of competition in the power market for medium to large consumers. This has 50,000 users, ranging from schools to medium-sized business sites, which have to buy from their local monopoly power distributer. From April they will be given the right, already enjoyed by the 5,000 largest power consumers, to choose from any electricity company which is prepared to supply them. In an effort to keep customers, some regional companies have been offering discounts for electricity consumed before April to customers who agree to sign long-term deals lasting up to four years. In a letter to the companies Offer has ruled that this behaviour takes advantage of the present monopoly market to preclude other suppliers from competing effectively after April. It has told the 12 regional companies in England and Wales and two Scottish distributers that 'to avoid suggestions of anti-competitive behaviour' it expects each contract signed before April to include a clause enabling a customer to be released from the deal after a year. Offer wants contracts already signed to be amended to reflect this change. Disclosure of the long-term contracts has prompted concerns about how the discounts are being financed. Industry regulations prevent regional electricity companies from cross-subsidising between various parts of their business. It is thought that several regional companies have 'over-recovered' in their monopoly markets this year - they may have charged too much because inflation estimates have proved incorrect. The regulations require that this money is not used for discounts in the new competitive market and is returned to customers in rebates. Offer said: 'Companies must demonstrate to us that there is no cross-subsidy. Deals should be self-financing.' Offer has also reminded regional companies that under their licences they must not discriminate between similar customers when they offer contracts. It could not say yesterday which of the distributers had been offering discounts tied to long-term contracts. Lex, Page 20</p>

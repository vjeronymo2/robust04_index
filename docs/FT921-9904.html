			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow falls as Federal Reserve refuses to act Wall Street GLOOM returned to the equity market yesterday after the Federal Reserve signalled that it had not changed monetary policy in spite of an unexpected decline in employment in January, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The market had expected the January employment report to show an increase of about 30,000 in non-farm payrolls. Instead, the figure tumbled by 91,000. The decline sparked renewed speculation that the Fed would try to stimulate the economy by cutting its target for Fed Funds. Although it is still widely believed that there will be further monetary easing in the coming weeks, the Fed indicated yesterday morning that it had not changed its 4 per cent target for Fed Funds. The Dow Jones Industrial Average bounced off its low of 3,209.08 to close at 3,225.40, down 30.19 on the day, but little changed on the week. The index initially rose some 14 points yesterday before the Fed's intervention. Declines led advances by 970 to 698. Turnover was moderate at about 231m shares. The more representative Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 2.73 lower at 411.09 and the Nasdaq composite slid 2.72 to 634.95. The Dow eased 2.01 to 3,255.59 on Thursday. The bond market was similarly affected yesterday. The treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which rallied nearly one point on the back of the employment numbers, was quoted  1/32 lower at 102 5/8 , yielding 7.77 per cent in the afternoon. Among declining blue chip issues, Philip Morris lost Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 75 3/4 , IBM fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 89 1/8 and Merck slid Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 153 1/2 . Lockheed added Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 43 7/8 after the company said that it was comfortable with earnings estimates of between Dollars 5.30 and Dollars 5.80 a share for 1992. The bank stock rally ran out of steam yesterday. Citicorp eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 16 1/2 but Chemical Bank, which fell in early trading, firmed Dollars  1/8 in the afternoon to Dollars 30 3/4 . Relief that Owens Corning had taken a smaller-than expected charge to cover asbestos-related claims helped shares in the fibrous glass products manufacturer add Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 37 after jumping Dollars 7 5/8 on Wednesday. In the secondary market, Immunex tumbled Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 59 1/4 on news that the biotech company will raise its research spending by 50 per cent. Immunex posted fourth quarter earnings of 21 cents a share yesterday, as compared with a loss of 63 cents a year earlier. Canada Stocks ended the week steady, after losing ground in the wake of a downturn on Wall Street. The composite index fell 10.37 points to end the week up less than one point at 3,596.33. Declining issues topped advances 302 to 297. Volume was 29.364 shares, as compared with 30.364 shares on Thursday, and trading value was CDollars 307.1m, as against CDollars 323.7m.</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: PTT Telecom joins data network venture PTT Telecom, the Dutch telecommunications company, has joined forces with AMR, parent company of American Airlines, and CSX, the US transportation company, to develop and sell an electronic data network in Europe. The network will enable manufacturers, shipping lines and freight forwarders to keep track of cargo shipments as they move from factory to customer. Mr Robert Crandall, chairman of American Airlines, said the venture with PTT Telecom was the first of a planned series of regional partnerships around the world aimed at providing companies with transport logistics information. AMR and CSX announced last month they had formed an initial partnership, called Encompass, to promote the logistics information system. The system aims to allow global trading partners to communicate electronically, regardless of the type of computer systems they use internally, or where they are based. Mr John Snow, head of CSX, has estimated the potential market for products such as Encompass at around Dollars 1.6bn. PTT Telecom will take a 35 per cent stake in the new joint venture, Encompass Europe, and invest Fl 50m (Dollars 27.8m) in the project. AMR and CSX, owner of the Sealand shipping line and one of the largest railroad operators in the US, will hold the remaining 65 per cent via the Encompass partnership. The two US companies have invested Dollars 40m in developing the transport logistics concept over the past few years. The principle aim of the Encompass system is to help cut inventory and other costs for manufacturers as well as reduce the amount of paperwork for hauliers. 'It sometimes seems to us that there's more paper than freight,' Mr Crandall said. The system is being tested in the US by multinational corporations such as Digital Equipment, the computer company, and Procter and Gamble, the consumer products group, which is using the electronic network to monitor shipments between the US east coast and the Far East. Encompass Europe, to be based in Rotterdam, claims to be the first electronic data interchange system for the transport industry which spans the various 'modes' of transport. After Europe, Encompass's next priority is to find an equity partner in the US similar to PTT Telecom for the North and South American markets. In Asia, it will probably seek several different partners.</p>

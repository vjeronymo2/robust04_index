			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "NTC" newscast] </F>   [Text] The first Environment Minister Manuel Rodriguez  Becerra assumed his post just a few weeks ago, and the Attorney  General's Office has already filed charges against him. The  charges involve the cutting of trees in the forests of El Choco  Department.    According to investigations, the minister and 20 other  officials of the Choco [word indistinct] Company, CodeChoco,  authorized the indiscriminate cutting of over 200,000 hectares  of forest in 1980. Investigations reveal that Rodriguez Becerra,  who was the director of Indirena [Institute for Development of  Renewable Natural Resources] at the time and a member of the  CodeChoco Board of Directors, did not control or verify the  permits of five companies, including (Barza 1 and Barza 2), for  exploiting the lumber in the (Chajerado) area. The new minister  feels that the Codechoco Board of Directors are not responsible  for that ecological crime.    [Begin Rodriguez Becerra recording] I did not directly  participate, nor am I responsible for the exploitation of lumber  in the Indian territories. [end recording]    Nevertheless, the Attorney General's Office has said the  exploitation authorized by CodeChoco led to the extinction of  over 10 animal species, contamination of the Atrato River, and  the expulsion of Indian communities from southern Choco.</p>

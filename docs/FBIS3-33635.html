Both  delegations established a joint formulations committee which  held its first meeting last night. This committee will continue  work this morning. The formulations committee will deal with the  major issues currently on the agenda: the implementation of the  Gaza-Jericho First agreement and the issue of the border  crossings. This morning, the committee will report to the  plenum on the results of the discussions. The members of the  formulations committee are Nabil Sha'th, Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad  Quray'], and Akram Haniyah, on behalf of the PLO, and its  Israeli members are Uri Savir, Major General 'Uzi Dayan, and  Yo'el Singer.    Minister Yosi Sarid warned against excessive optimism and  explained that there were still gaps between the parties'  positions. Sarid said that it would only be possible this  evening to know whether an agreement had been reached.    Last night, Yasir 'Arafat and Shim'on Peres held a private  meeting which lasted approximately two hours.</p>

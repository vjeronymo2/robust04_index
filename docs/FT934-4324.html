			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Broker jailed for Pounds 645,000 theft An investment broker who cheated clients out of Pounds 645,000 to prop up his ailing business was jailed for four years yesterday, John Mason writes. Mr Kenneth Renton, the former chairman of Wentworth Asset Management, pleaded guilty last month to 14 charges of theft and four of obtaining property by deception. Passing sentence at Inner London Crown Court Judge Fingret said Mr Renton's actions amounted to 'persistent and blatant misuse of clients' money'. Mr Renton was also disqualified from being a company director for 10 years. He had denied a further 20 charges of theft and deception involving Pounds 1m. These charges have been laid on the file.</p>

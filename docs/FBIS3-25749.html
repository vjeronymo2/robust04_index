The document states that although  prostitution was obvious in the society even before the arrival  of Unomoz personnel, with the arrival of thousands of soldiers  in the country within the framework of the peace process, this  phenomenon increased from that period. The report states that  this increase is also due to the fact that the Unomoz personnel  are earning more than Mozambican citizens, hence they are  attractive to minors, who involve themselves in prostitution.    [Begin Deputy UN Special Representative recording in  English]  It has been suggested that some Mozambican cities, where the  incidence of Unomoz members involved with prostitutes was found  to be greatest, have been regional centers of prostitution in  successive periods during which foreign troops were present  there. In those places, prostitution, including minors selling  sex, has long been a feature of urban life. In addition, many  observers agreed that patrons of the sex trade in Mozambique are  not limited to Unomoz personnel. Nevertheless, it is evident  that some Unomoz personnel stationed in some locations in  Mozambique have indeed patronized prostitutes and that  prostitution in those places has increased perceptibly since the  arrival of Unomoz in large numbers. This increase in  prostitution has negatively affected the quality of urban public  life, and apparently in some instances generated some  ill-feeling toward Unomoz personnel in some areas. It is also  evident that some Unomoz personnel patronizing prostitutes  sought the services of prostitutes thought by them to be minors.  Now, the investigating team found that patronage of  prostitutes, among them minors, by some Unomoz personnel  occurred despite existing codes of discipline and the explicit  instructions given to many members of the Unomoz to avoid all  illegal sexual liaison with Mozambican women.

			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. ARTISTS OFFER TRIBUTES TO HAVEL;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: THE CZECHOSLOVAK LEADER ALSO RECEIVES A DEGREE FROM COLUMBIA AND  VISITS NEW YORK'S MAYOR.  </P> <P> Major American figures in the arts, literature and theater paid tribute  Thursday to colleague Vaclav Havel, the playwright who endured confinement and  official recrimination during decades of Communist domination in  Czechoslovakia, but whose work carried him to the presidency of his country  last year.  </P> <P> Havel, who has gained stature as a dramatist in the tradition of Eugene Ionesco  and Samuel Beckett, was praised at impressive ceremonies at New York's  Cathedral of St. John the Divine after receiving an honorary degree at Columbia  University.  </P> <P> He entered the huge arched gray stone church to a fanfare mixed with the  tinkling of tiny gold bells that were handed out to the audience.  </P> <P> "I am sorry I had no opportunity to write my speech because I was not today two  hours in a prison," Havel said, calling the tribute a "big and moving  celebration."  </P> <P> "I thank all who participate. . . . We will feel it as sympathy and support for  freedom."  </P> <P> The Czechoslovak president lit a candle for freedom. Thousands of candles were  held high by the throng in the cathedral.  </P> <P> The cathedral ceremony was symbolic of deepening artistic ties between Eastern  Europe and the West. It had its roots in a January visit to Prague by a group  from New York's Actors Studio, who presented Havel's play "Audience." Havel,  who spent years in prison, had never seen the play staged.  </P> <P> Thursday's tribute in New York brought kudos to a politician-playwright with a  sardonic sense of irony who once said in an interview: "Every morning I fight  depression -- a black mood, guilt that I am not writing."  </P> <P> The day's program featured appearances by a host of major figures in the arts  ranging from Nobel Prize-winning author Elie Wiesel to Paul Newman and producer  Joseph Papp.  </P> <P> "I have been in the presence of some great artists. I have been in the presence  of some great statesmen," Newman said. "I have never been in the presence of an  artist-statesman."  </P> <P> Havel replied to cheers from an audience at an Actors Studio reception before  the tribute began. Standing next to Newman, he said:  </P> <P> "I am very glad that I am among my colleagues. I will not speak a very long  time because I am very nervous."  </P> <P> The Czechoslovak president said Newman loomed as large as a legend and that "I  didn't think Mr. Newman physically existed." There was great laughter and  applause.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, Havel, 53, who was elected Czechoslovakia's president Dec.  29, mixed international affairs with artistic politics. He visited the Council  on Foreign Relations, held a news conference at the United Nations, visited the  Metropolitan Museum of Art and met New York Mayor David N. Dinkins for  breakfast.  </P> <P> "I didn't run for president," Havel told Dinkins. "I was raised to that post by  public opinion, public pressure."  </P> <P> Guests at the breakfast included Papp, fellow playwrights Arthur Miller, Edward  Albee and Wendy Wasserstein.  </P> <P> Havel said he enjoyed a "wonderful evening" while touring pubs in Manhattan's  East Village with film director Milos Forman. Havel and Forman, an emigre,  attended boarding school together in Czechoslovakia 43 years ago.  </P> <P> "If a playwright succeeds to orchestrate the overthrow of a dictatorship  without one bullet being fired, it is a miracle," Forman told the audience at  the packed cathedral. He added: "We are all here to show you our faith, our  admiration, our support, our affection -- and if you ask for it, our help."  </P></p>

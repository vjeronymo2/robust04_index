			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   Civil Service Affirmative Action -- "The public service  affirmative action programme announced on Wednesday by Minister  Zola Skweyiya is a moderate plan," states the Johannesburg  BUSINESS DAY in English on 10 June in a page-8 editorial. "With  two related reservations that will need to be addressed, it  looks like a careful attempt to build an appropriately balanced  public service within a fiscally responsible framework." "The  main criticism is Skweyiya's failure to acknowledge that the  public service is simply too big." The second troublesome aspect  is the decision "to introduce earnings parity in the former  homelands. While the differentials had become a source of  conflict, the new government may discover that taking the line  of least resistance is not always the most appropriate  response." The editorial does say, however, that in regard to  the 1,000 new senior service posts "it is necessary that the  racial and political imbalances at the top be remedied." In  conclusion, the BUSINESS DAY warns that "the form the  affirmative action programme takes is crucial. Competency  cannot be sacrificed for the sake of achieving an acceptable  racial balance."  <H8>  NEW NATION </H8>   Cabinet Salary Perks Criticized -- "Frugality will have to  be  the watchword of the democratic government as it begins to  settle into office," begins the Johannesburg NEW NATION in  English on 10 June in a page-8 editorial. "Everything must be  done to make sure that the purse strings of the state treasury  are sufficeinetly taut and so ensure that we direct as much of  our resources into the process of reconstruction and  development. We make this point against the background of  concern in the democratic movement around the size of cabinet  ministers' pay packets." The editorial recognizes the need to  give ministers an adequate salary, but much of the problem  surrounding this issue is "the secrecy that shrouds the size" of  ministerial salaries. Transparency is important, the editorial  stresses. "Secrecy will only serve to fuel speculation on the  exact scale of benefits cabinet ministers are being paid. And  this will not do any good for the moral leadership, which is as  important as political leadership." "Without the necessary  moral leadership, trust will fritter away. And that will not  make for stable government."</p>

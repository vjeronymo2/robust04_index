			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WAR OF FALSEHOODS  </P> <P> It's time for San Diegans to speak up and make known to the so-called Rev.  Sheldon of the Traditional Values Coalition and his ilk that we are not patsies  for his political agenda. He comes to our community from elsewhere with his  hateful, bigoted, intolerant views and wants to use the citizens of San Diego  to promote them.  </P> <P> His opposition to the Human Dignity Ordinance, which provides equal rights, not  special privileges, to a segment of our population that is continually harassed  and discriminated against by the likes of Sheldon, is indefensible. These  people work, pay taxes, contribute to our community and deserve the same equal  rights as the rest of us.  </P> <P> Come on, San Diego, lets show these extremists that they're not fooling us with  their misrepresentations and smoke-screen antics. Support the HDO and equal  rights for all citizens.  </P> <P> JUDY and JIM KUEENEN  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

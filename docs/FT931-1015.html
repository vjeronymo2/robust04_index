			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Court threat over building society rents A BUILDING society which sold an estate agency chain that later went into liquidation is facing demands for unpaid rents from landlords who insist it is still legally responsible for its former subsidiary. The claim against Northern Rock, Britain's 11th-largest building society, comes from a group of landlords from whom estate agency offices were rented. The claim hinges on Section 22 of the 1986 Building Societies Act, requiring societies to discharge the liabilities of subsidiaries. The case is believed to be the first of its kind. Northern Rock, which has rejected the landlords' demand for rents totalling more than Pounds 300,000, insists its obligation ceased when it sold the chain last year. Mr Chris Jobe, society secretary, said: 'We believe that when we dispose of a subsidiary company that liability ends.' But some landlords and their legal advisers are meeting today to decide whether to pursue their claim, possibly in the High Court. Solicitor Mr Peter Hughes, at whose office the meeting will be held, said: 'It's a question of interpretation of the legislation and the surrounding circumstances.' Mr Hughes, a partner in Corbould Rigby &amp; Co, is acting for two landlords and co-ordinating an investigation on behalf of 10 more. Northern Rock Property Services, a subsidiary of the Newcastle-based building society, built up an estate agency chain in the 1980s, trading under different names in various parts of England. At its 1989 peak it had about 100 outlets. As the property market slumped and the chain's generation of mortgage business proved disappointing, Northern Rock decided to quit the estate agency and sold the chain to several buyers. In September last year 51 estate agency offices in London, the south-east and on the south coast were sold, under the name Seleridge to a company called Franklin Fox. Two months later Seleridge went into liquidation. Mr Hughes said that in many cases leases entered into by Seleridge have been disclaimed by the liquidator. Mr Chris Potter, former managing director of defunct Northern Rock Property Services, said: 'The landlord has to take the same chance as anybody else in commerce these days.' Mr Michael Coogan, deputy secretary of the Building Societies Association, said that to his knowledge the case was the first of its kind.</p>

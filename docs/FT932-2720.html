			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Ivory &amp; Sime ahead to Pounds 4.9m IVORY &amp; SIME, the investment managers which handle Pounds 3.3bn of funds, reported an increase of 7.5 per cent in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.9m for the year to April 30. The previous year produced Pounds 4.52m but was adjusted to Pounds 4.91m, including gains on disposals, under FRS 3. Turnover rose to Pounds 14.4m (Pounds 13.9m) while administrative expenses were virtually unchanged for the fourth successive year. That led to operating profits increasing by 12.5 per cent to Pounds 3.98m (Pounds 3.65m). Funds under management grew 12.7 per cent to Pounds 3.3bn, reflecting the attracting of additional funds, notably from North America and Japan, and buoyant stock markets worldwide in sterling terms. Earnings per share were 10.75p (9p and 10.38p under FRS 3), the growth rate boosted by the reduced number of shares in issue following the purchase and cancellation of 2.25m shares. The final dividend is 4.75p to lift the total to 6.5p (5.75p).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by unidentified XINHUA commentator: "Develop </F> New Industries, Nurture Modern Enterprises"]    [Text] Beijing, 26 Feb (XINHUA) -- With the passage of time  and the development of economic and scientific and technological  trends worldwide, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's call for "developing  high technology and achieving industrialization" has revealed  more and more foresight and strategic vision, especially in the  two years since the publication of Comrade Xiaoping's speeches  made during his southern tour. Over the past two years, China's  scientific and technological undertakings have advanced by leaps  and bounds. While a stable contingent of scientists are  devoting themselves to basic science and high-tech research and  are tackling key scientific and technological projects, a large  number of research institutes and academies have sent talented  scientific and technical personnel to various national economic  sectors to contribute to China's economic construction and to  push the country to the forefront of international science and  technology.    The prosperity of the nation and the enhancement of the  overall national strength hinge on scientific and technological  progress. High tech, represented by electronic information  technology, new energy technology, biotechnology, and new  materials technology, is one of the mankind's greatest  accomplishments in science and technology in the 20th century.  In recent years, a number of high- tech research projects based  on the latest scientific achievements have flourished and have  been quickly transformed into practical productive forces,  exerting a profound influence on economic and social development  and becoming the core of overall national strength and the focus  of international competition. Whoever has an edge in high-tech  industries holds the initiative in political, economic,  military, and social development. Because China is currently at  the crucial stage of developing new and high-tech industries,  how to develop new industries and energetically nurture modern  enterprises has become an especially pressing issue.    The industrialization of new and high technology and the  application of advanced science and technology in traditional  industries are the two major trends in economic development  today. The establishment of a socialist market system will  create a very favorable environment for the industrialization of  new and high technology. Many of China's high-tech enterprises  have been founded and developed through the support of domestic  and international markets. The science and technology market,  which is a major component of the socialist market system,  includes technology markets, markets of scientific and technical  personnel, and markets of high-tech products. We should  cultivate and promote in a selective way the science and  technology market, which can play a comprehensive role in  traditional industry, and we should make the market become the  "incubator" of high-tech enterprises and industries.    In developing new industries and nurturing modern  enterprises, we should use scientific and technological advances  to tackle difficult and pressing problems in various national  economic sectors. We should combine overall plans with  breakthroughs in key areas, closely combine the science and  technology development plans of the central and local  governments as well as departments, and concentrate funds and  talented personnel to tackle key scientific and technological  engineering projects. We should nurture a new industrial  pattern before the year 2000 by selecting and concentrating  efforts on several projects from the "863 Program" which can  become leading industries and which can exert a significant  influence on the national economy.    In developing new industries and nurturing modern  enterprises, we should conduct preliminary studies and  verification of leading new industries targeted by China for the  next century, so that science and technology can play a visible  role in readjusting the industrial structure, improving product  quality, increasing value added, strengthening market  competitiveness, and raising enterprise efficiency. We should  attach importance to cultivating several points of growth for  modern enterprises, such as high-definition television,  digital-sound broadcasting, optical-fiber visual communication,  and superintegrated circuits. Science and technology  departments should adopt various measures to promote the  commercialization, industrialization, and internationalization  of high-tech research results by doing everything within their  capability to introduce new and high technology to large and  medium enterprises as soon as possible.    In view of the formation of new industries and the emergence  of a growing number of high-tech enterprises with modern  mechanisms, we should expedite the reform of the science and  technology management system, strengthen the intensity of the  reform of scientific research departments, and accelerate the  implementation of the strategic plan of "holding fast to one end  and leaving the whole field open." Meanwhile, we should attract  talented personnel, capital, and key technology and equipment;  expand scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation  with foreign countries; and nurture a group of young scientists.    Seizing the opportunity to catch up with the advancing pace  of high tech in the world is a pressing task of China's economic  development, as well as the inevitable choice for the Chinese  nation to become stronger in the world.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Boeing setback underlines aviation downturn BOEING, the world's biggest aircraft manufacturer, underscored the recession in the global aerospace industry by reporting a 23 per cent drop in first-quarter earnings to Dollars 325m, or 96 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 6.64bn, compared with Dollars 420m, or Dollars 1.23, on sales of Dollars 7.97bn in the same period of last year. The figures were in line with analysts' expectations of about Dollars 1 a share. Boeing said the drop was due to lower sales of commercial aircraft and defence and space equipment. It delivered 93 commercial aircraft during the quarter, compared with 124 in the same period of 1992. Commercial aircraft sales dropped to Dollars 5.50bn from Dollars 6.54bn, while defence and space sales dipped to Dollars 1.01bn from Dollars 1.29bn. Mr Frank Shrontz, chairman, said second-quarter sales were expected to be higher due mainly to the timing of commercial jet deliveries, but second-half sales would be lower than the first half, reflecting reductions in commercial production rates. For the full year, Boeing projected sales of about Dollars 26bn, down from Dollars 30.2bn last year.</p>

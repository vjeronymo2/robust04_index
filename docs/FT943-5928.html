			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Louis Newmark cuts deficit to Pounds 896,000 Louis Newmark, the engineering and specialist equipment group, reduced pre-tax losses from Pounds 1.58m to Pounds 896,000 in the year to April 2. The result is in line with interim expectations with the second half loss coming down from Pounds 689,000 to Pounds 258,000. Mr John Newmark, chairman, said that the first half loss for the present year was likely to be similar to the same period last time. But he said that he would expect a generally improved trading situation to show through in the second half. Turnover rose from Pounds 23.9m to Pounds 26.8m, helped particularly by a 39 per cent increase in watch sales from Pounds 4.71m to Pounds 6.53m. Losses per share were 21.3p (53.8p) and again no dividend is recommended.</p>

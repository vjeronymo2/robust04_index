			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, May 30 (XINHUA) -- China had exported 34.8  billion U.S. dollars worth of products by May 10 this year, up  by 45.8 percent over the same period last year, while imports  also reached 29.8 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 33.9  percent.    This means that a series of reforms in foreign currency,  finance and tax and foreign trade structure, especially those  eliminating subsidies for exports, have proved effective, said  an official from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation here attending the opening ceremony of the Tianjin  Export Commodity Fair Saturday [28 May].    According to the official, China's foreign-funded  enterprises  imported 11.7 billion U.S. dollars worth of products, surpassing  their export volume by 2.9 billion dollars.    However, the official admitted that this year's foreign  trade  has been affected by price hikes, resulting in the decline of  export efficiency and shortages in capital and raw materials.  The ministry is trying to work out an effective way to further  boost imports and exports, he said.</p>

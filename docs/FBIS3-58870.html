			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Finland and Russia have reached a preliminary  agreement that the threshold for relaying information about  nuclear accidents will be lowered. Finland will thus receive  information from Russia about less serious accidents on the  other side of the eastern border. In addition, the countries  agreed this week that exchanges of information about nuclear  plants will be increased. Within the next few weeks a Finnish  group of experts will visit the Chelyabinsk nuclear waste  reprocessing plant.</p>

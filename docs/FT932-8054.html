			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Chamberlin &amp; Hill 11% ahead at Pounds 1.6m CHAMBERLIN &amp; Hill slowed down in the second half with only a marginal improvement in pre-tax profits. Accordingly, the increase over the year ended March 31 1993 was restricted to 11 per cent, with profits of Pounds 1.59m compared with Pounds 1.43m. Turnover for the group, which makes iron castings, electrical conduit fittings and switchgear, improved from Pounds 19m to Pounds 20.3m. That advance was wholly attributable to exports, the directors said, the prospects for which were good. There was yet to be seen clear cut evidence of significant growth in UK demand, they added. Earnings per share came to 16.07p (15.28p). The proposed final distribution amounts to 4.5p (4.25p), which lifts the total payable for the year to 6.25p, against a previous 6p.</p>

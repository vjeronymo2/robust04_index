			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Inveresk turns in 60% rise to Pounds 9.26m  -Margins improved by focusing on higher value-added products Inveresk, the Scottish speciality paper manufacturer which floated on the Stock Exchange last June, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.26m in the 53 weeks to December 4 1993. The result was a 60 per cent improvement on the Pounds 5.79m recorded in 1992. In both years the company incurred a loss of about Pounds 900,000 on discontinued activities. Turnover on continuing activities increased by 3 per cent to Pounds 90.5m (Pounds 87.9m). The company attributed part of its improved profits to the ending last year of unprofitable commodity papermaking at its mill at Inverkeithing, Fife. By focusing on higher value-added products and turning round its fine paper business, operating margins have been increased to more than 10 per cent, according to Mr Stefan Kay, managing director. Mr Kay said that the recovery in the UK paper market was 'nervous, patchy and uneasy.' Confidence in the German market has taken a serious knock during the year because of recession, though sales of Inveresk's products held up well. Trading elsewhere in Europe was satisfactory, Mr Kay added, while sales to east Asia and the Americas continued to be encouraging and with considerable scope for the future. Inveresk invested Pounds 7.2m in plant improvements, paid for out of cash flow, and plans to invest a further Pounds 6.5m in 1994. Earnings per share were 16.9p (11.5p) and a final dividend of 3.5p is recommended. There was no interim dividend and Inveresk said on flotation that the final dividend would be two thirds of a normal dividend. COMMENT Inveresk is a solid company with experienced management in a moderately profitable niche of the paper market, factors which helped push its shares up from last June's issue price of 150p to 223p, before adding another 7p to 230p yesterday. Its stated aim is to become 'Europe's leading speciality paper company', and it hopes to find a suitable target for acquisition in Europe or the UK. With Pounds 41m on its balance sheet and an unused borrowing facility of Pounds 20m, it should be well equipped to do so. Inveresk may be able to profit from higher market prices and exploit its 20 per cent unused capacity, but could also suffer if wood pulp costs, now beginning to increase, go up further. Last year it enjoyed a tax charge of only 9 per cent because of allowances from past losses; this year, however, the tax charge will be 28 per cent, and analysts believe pre-tax profits up to only Pounds 10m will be possible. That would mean reduced earnings per share of 13.7p, giving a multiple of 16.7 on yesterday's closing price of 230p. On that basis the shares look fairly priced.</p>

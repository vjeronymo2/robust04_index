			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Call for Removal of Exchange Controls--"Ahead of the  election, insecurities are far more likely to grow than to  recede, and that is likely to persist unless absolutely clear  policies are specified by our next government," warns a page-10  editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 10  February. "The confidence needed if we are to attract the  investment to create jobs and develop the economy would be  restored more easily if a new government shows it has shed the  fears that hobbled our economy under the National Party."  BUSINESS DAY urges an "immediate removal of exchange controls."  Argentinians and Egyptians that took the exchange controls leap  of faith "have responded by redirecting their foreign funds back  home." "South Africans seeking security have exported more than  their capital, more than fistsfull of Krugerrands. Many have  taken themselves and their skills abroad and are probably  congratulating themselves on their foresight as this country  descends into apparent confusion. A clear commitment on a  timetable for removing exchange controls would be among the  soundest confidence-boosters the ANC could provide."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   Need for More Accessible Education -- A new government  should  "increase subsidies for tertiary institutions" advises  Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 10 February. "The country  will suffer if the state does not embark on an aggressive  programme to make education more accessible."  <H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>   Campaign To Drive White Teachers From Black Schools -- "The  campaign to drive white teachers out of traditionally black  schools has graduated from being sadly misguided to decidedly  dangerous," points out a page-6 editorial in Cape Town CAPE  TIMES in English on 8 February. "Given the shambles in black  education in South Africa, urgent efforts are clearly needed to  train, retrain and upgrade the skills of black teachers.  Efforts to demonise whites and run them out of town may pander  to the racist instincts of some politicians, but they will not  help black schoolchildren pass their exams."</p>

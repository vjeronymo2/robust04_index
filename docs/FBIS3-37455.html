During  today's meeting with foreign journalists, Einseln said that the  proposal for such a meeting had originated from the Russian  side. He noted that Estonia should strive for cooperation with  all neighboring countries, including Russia. The major general,  however, did not wish to elaborate on cooperation with its'  eastern neighbor.    Speaking about Russia's military doctrine, Einseln  emphasized  that it looks quite acceptable on paper but one must look at how  it is implemented. So far Russian statements have, in Einseln's  opinion, sounded quite threatening. At the same time the army  commander opined that a major part of Russia's aggressive  statements are meant for domestic consumption or serve as  blackmail. Einseln hopes that common sense will finally win in  Russia too.    According to Einseln, he is on good terms with the Russian  servicemen deployed in Estonia. Einseln explains the halt in  the troop withdrawal with bad weather. Would you be keen to go  anywhere in such weather? asked Einseln of journalists. Einseln  supported the Latvian decision to agree to the Russian demands  on Skrunda radar station. He is also in favor of reducing the  number of Russian troops in Kaliningrad Oblast and the  coordination of international aid provided to the Baltic Armed  Forces. The (?forces) commander thinks that NATO's Partnership  for Peace program, which Estonia joined on 3 February, is a step  in the right direction, and at the right time. This has been  reported by the Baltic News Service.</p>

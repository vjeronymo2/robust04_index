			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Five O'Clock Sharp" newscast] </F>   [Text] We have last-minute information on the negotiations  between leaders of the transportation sector and the government.  [four-second break in transmission] We repeat: The  negotiations between the transportation workers and government  have been broken off. We receive this last-minute report from  Carlos Torres, chief editor of the "Five O'Clock Sharp"  newscast. Carlos Torres, tell us what has happened.    [Torres] The negotiations between the government and the  transportation sector were broken off a few hours ago. The  members of the National Transportation Commission withdrew,  because they are demanding the government conduct the  negotiations only with the National Transportation Commission.    Labor Minister Francisco Rosales expressed regret over the  withdrawal of the National Transportation Commission members and  said the government had called the entire National  Transportation Council to study the agreements. The Nicaraguan  Transportation Chamber president reported that three members of  the Transportation Chamber were attacked in the Metro Centro  sector this morning and directly accused Roberto Gonzalez, the  main leader of the Parrales Vallejos [bus cooperative] of being  involved in this event. Gonzalez denied his accusations, however.    Francisco Rosales and Emilio Pereira, the labor and finance  ministers respectively, have just gone to the second floor of  the National Assembly to talk to Assembly President Luis  Humberto Guzman to try to find a solution to the transportation  problem. Roberto Gonzalez and members of the National  Transportation Commission have said their demands will be  tougher tomorrow.</p>

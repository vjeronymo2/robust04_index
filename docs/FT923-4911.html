			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Milder winter helps Grafton advance Grafton Group, the Dublin-based builders' merchant and DIY concern, lifted pre-tax profits 14 per cent to IPounds 1.85m (Pounds 1.75m), in the six months to June 30. Mr Michael Chadwick, chairman, said the results reflected improved returns from Irish operations and a reduced contribution from the smaller UK operations. The milder winter helped the group during the half year. Turnover improved to IPounds 48.7m (IPounds 45.7m) generating trading profits of IPounds 2.55m (IPounds 2.17m). Interest charges rose to IPounds 698,000 (IPounds 553,000). The interim dividend is stepped up to 2.75p (2.5p), payable from earnings of 8.6p (7.5p) per share. For the full year, Mr Chadwick said the group was benefiting from the investments and acquisitions made in 1991 and expected to record an increase on the IPounds 3.55m pre-tax achieved last time.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: Compaq slims down for PC market war THE PRICE war in the personal computer market has claimed 1,000 victims at Compaq Computer, which yesterday announced it would axeabout 10 per cent of its work force worldwide . Compaq also said it would take about Dollars 85m in restructuring and other special charges in the third quarter to cover severance costs, writedowns and a loss on the early retirement of long-term debt. The charges will be offset by a gain of around Dollars 86m on the sale of stock Compaq held in Conner Peripherals, a manufacturer of computer disk drives and a Compaq supplier. The redundancies come despite record revenues and unit shipments in the third quarter just ended, Compaq said. The company said operating earnings for the third quarter were 'comfortably above second-quarter 1992 levels', when Compaq earned Dollars 29m, or 35 cents per share. Compaq lost Dollars 70m, or 82 cents, in the third quarter of 1991. After the loss a year ago, Compaq's board ousted Mr Rod Canion, co-founder, and promoted Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer to president and chief executive. Compaq also sacked 1,400 workers. The latest cuts are being made 'in anticipation of a continuing intensely-competitive market environment', Mr Pfeiffer said. PC prices, which have dropped about 30 per cent in the US this year, are continuing to fall and the momentum of the price war is picking up in Europe and other markets. Compaq's share price rose sharply to Dollars 36 1/4 at midday yesterday, up from Wednesday's close of Dollars 33 1/2 . James Buxton, Scottish Correspondent, adds: In Europe, Compaq will close its plant at Stirling in Scotland and concentrate all European manufacturing operations at its main plant at Erskine, near Glasgow. Up to 100 employees who work in management, professional, engineering and administrative functions will lose their jobs, reducing the Scottish manufacturing payroll to just over 800.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Klimov: "Working Together"] </F>   [Text] Yesterday's enlarged sitting of the collegium of  the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office involving  prosecutors from the republics, krays, and oblasts, and military  and transport prosecutors, was devoted to the theme of the fight  against crime. State structure representatives, including  Presidential Staff Chief S. Filatov, Federation Council  Committee Chairman I. Kostoyev, and Human Rights Committee  Chairman S. Kovalev, took part in the collegium's work.    The trend toward a rise in organized crime, which is  destabilizing the atmosphere in society, was noted in the report  by Acting General Prosecutor A. Ilyushenko, as well as in the  speeches by regional prosecutors and those by the leaders of law  enforcement organs.    Various appraisals of the president's edict were heard.  Federal Counterintelligence Service Director S. Stepashin  declared: "I am in favor of violating the rights of the  individual if that person is a criminal." S. Kovalev  categorically disagreed with this conclusion, placing the  emphasis on the unswerving fulfillment of human rights and  compliance with the spirit and letter of the Constitution.    Other speeches also noted the possible danger of "going too  far" in terms of human rights compliance when fulfilling the  president's edict.    The collegium called on prosecutors to consider the fight  against crime and the coordination of the actions of the law  enforcement bodies the most important area of their activity.  It was proposed that constant surveillance over compliance with  legislation be guaranteed when carrying out measures stipulated  by the president and the parliament to protect the population  from organized crime.</p>

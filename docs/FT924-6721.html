			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Beach water quality improves THE QUALITY of seawater at Britain's beaches has improved slightly this year, although a fifth of bathing areas are still below EC standards, the government's 1992 survey of bathing waters shows. The report says that 79 per cent of the 455 identified bathing places met EC coliform - or bacteria - standards. This compares with 76 per cent in 1991 and 77 per cent in 1990.</p>

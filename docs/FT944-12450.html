			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (3): City's influence is still dominant - Regional political scene Atlanta's local political scene can be a little confusing at first glance - 'there is no such thing as an Atlanta government,' says Tim Crimmins, a Georgia State University history professor and local political analyst. The reason is that metro Atlanta, with 2.9m inhabitants, is composed of the city of Atlanta, a relatively smallish central city, and ten far larger surrounding counties. And, just to complicate matters, another eight counties are considered by the US federal government to be within Atlanta's metropolitan statistical area. Each county has its own governmental structure intact and no intentions of consolidating into a metropolitan government. Instead, Atlanta's various political entities co-ordinate their policy-making on issues such as water, transportation and tourism through the Atlanta Regional Commission and, most importantly, try to speak with one voice for the purpose of drawing outside investment. 'Co-operation has lessened the need for consolidation,' said Mr Harry West, the Atlanta Regional Commission's chairman. But the city and the surrounding county governments compete fiercely for the prizes of economic development. And political tensions would no doubt be far higher if Atlanta were not the economic juggernaut that it is. Over the last few decades, the city has been losing more and more of its share of incoming investment to the surrounding suburbs. The shift has occurred over the last 30 years as the predominantly white, middle class suburbs have vastly grown, leaving the city of Atlanta with a predominantly black - and relatively poor - population of less than 400,000. A political change has accompanied the population shift. The city remains a Democratic party bastion, while the suburbs are increasingly Republican and conservative. The leading right-wing Republican congressman, Mr Newt Gingrich, who represents some of Atlanta's northern counties, exemplifies the suburbs' political tenor. Yet, despite some erosion of its power, the city's political influence is still dominant. It continues to be run by a working alliance of the white business elite and the black politicians who have held control of City Hall for over 20 years. The city's mayor, Mr Bill Campbell, still plays the most crucial role in representing Atlanta. And his is a juggling act, says Prof Crimmins. While the mayor symbolically represents one of the most prosperous metropolitan areas in the US, he rules a central city that suffers from all the problems of crime, crumbling infrastructure, poor schools and insufficient revenues that besiege most of the big American cities. Fortunately, he seems especially apt at having a foot in both business and political worlds. A graduate of Vanderbilt and Duke Universities, two prestigious schools of the South, and a successful lawyer with a large Atlanta law firm, Mr Campbell is a generation away from the civil rights struggles that shaped the life of his parents and their contemporaries. His two predecessors, Mr Maynard Jackson and Mr Andy Young, who had ruled City Hall successively from 1973 to 1993, are of the earlier generation. Both men broke colour barriers for public office. Mr Jackson was Atlanta's first black mayor, and Mr Young was the first black US Ambassador to the UN. Mr Campbell's talk now is mostly about 'running city government like a business,' rather than racial issues. In this sense, he seems a man well-suited for the fiscally straightened 1990s - 'we have to find ways of doing things cheaper and with fewer people,' he says. Having only been in office ten months of his four-year term, Mr Campbell says he has already shrunk the city's bureaucracy by 400 jobs. The 1996 Olympics will assist Mr Campbell in dealing with some of the city's fiscal problems. Additional tax revenues will come in and the lion's share of Dollars 1.5bn in Olympic investment will be in the central city, helping to keep unemployment low and improving several of the poorest neighbourhoods through Olympic-related construction. Adding to the construction boom, Mr Campbell won voter approval in July for a Dollars 150m bond issue for much needed city infrastructure improvements. He says that roughly 30 per cent of the projects, especially those related to streets, bridges and parks, should be completed by 1996. He also wants to put more spark in the city's financial management - 'there is vast creativity in the financial world and we need to be less stodgy,' he says. One new financial tool that he has heartily supported is the sale of tax liens to a private collection agency. Mr Mitch Skandalakis, the chairman of the governing commission of Fulton County, wherein the City sits and which collects its taxes, initiated the tax lien measure. Recently approved by the commission, it will bring Dollars 75m immediately into the county's coffers, 20 per cent of which will go to Atlanta. Mr Skandalakis, who is running for re-election this month, says that if re-elected he will restart talks that he began recently with Mr Campbell about eliminating duplication of services between the city and the county so that both could save money. Mr Skandalakis, who is white and conservative, also juggles political and economic interests, given that his county includes Atlanta and some of the northern suburbs that want little to do with the city. Despite their differences, Mr Skandalakis gives the most compelling reason for political cohesion in metro Atlanta. He says he wants to help Mr Campbell succeed as mayor 'because if Atlanta fails, the whole area fails.'</p>

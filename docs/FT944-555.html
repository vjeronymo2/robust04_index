			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Scalfaro intent on taking his time No quick solution to Italy's government crisis seemed likely yesterday as President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro resumed his consultations. He spoke first to Mr Carlo Scognamiglio, senate speaker and a possible interim prime minister, and Ms Irene Pivetti, speaker of the chamber of deputies who has also become an important constitutional figure in the search for a new government. President Scalfaro, who can dissolve parliament or invite someone to form a new administration, intends to proceed cautiously. He will spend at least the rest of the week in formal discussions with all the main political figures in an attempt to avoid early elections following last week's resignation of the Berlusconi government. His determination was emphasised yesterday in a letter to union leaders praising their 'civic sense' for declaring, in a pre-Christmas message, that early elections would harm the country. This view has placed him in a potentially dangerous direct conflict with Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the outgoing premier, who is determined that elections be held by early April at the latest in order to gain maximum benefit from a sympathy vote. The media magnate turned politician continues to enjoy solid support for a snap election from Mr Gianfranco Fini, leader of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, principal partner in the rightwing coalition that governed Italy since May. However, the other main coalition partner, the populist Northern League, does not share this view. All are agreed that a quick election would be against the movement's interests. This has weakened Mr Berlusconi's hand but has done nothing to help find an alternative solution. One new element in this uncertain picture is the plight of two senior figures closely linked to Mr Alfredo Biondi, the outgoing justice minister and one of the coalition's most controversial members. Over Christmas it was revealed that Salerno magistrates had advised Mr Ugo Dinacci, chief inspector at the justice ministry, that he was under investigation for alleged links with the Camorra, the Naples Mafia, for allegedly helping 'fix' trials. Mr Dinacci has been in the forefront of the government's campaign to bring anti-corruption magistrates to heel. At the same time Mr Vincenzo Vitale, deputy head of Mr Biondi's office at the justice ministry, has come under investigation by Palermo magistrates for alleged abuse of office - which he denies - relating to a series of favours provided to Sicilian businessmen and politicians suspected of being close to the Mafia.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, June 22, INA--Iraq's permanent ambassador  to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdun said the Iraqi diplomacy  engineered by President Saddam Husayn had a prominent role in  breaking basic chapters of the siege imposed on the country.    In an interview to AL-JUMHURIYAH newspaper, published here  today, Mr Hamdun added that the current position of the  leadership and the recent visit by deputy premier, Tariq 'Aziz,  to New York and his talks with the Security Council members was  a solid one and placed Iraq's enemies and advocates of the  continuity of the blockade in a difficult and critical corner,  because it stripped them of the pretexts.    The Iraqi diplomat regarded the increase in number of the  states supporting Iraq's cooperation with the Security Council  and the progress made in implementing the resolutions and the  lifting of the blockade as the best evidence on feasibility of  the Iraqi stance and effectiveness of the Iraqi diplomacy.    Assessing the position inside the Security Council during  the  July discussions, Mr Hamdun further said "the continuity of the  Iraqi cooperation with the U.N and its specialized bodies drew  further hostile pretexts, thus the forthcoming discussions by  the Security Council should largely reflect the positive state".    He stressed that the July discussions would be a step  forward  for lifting the blockade.    The U.S policy versus Iraq is governed by the complex of its  traditional view to the Middle East and in the light of factors  of the Arab-Israeli conflict in addition to the substantial  issue, namely, the energy and its flow, Mr Hamdun said.    He confirmed that Iraq was an important country and its role  within the frame of the future view could not be set aside by  the decision-makers in the United States, and any arrangements  to be discussed or implemented would remain inferior unless Iraq  is playing its normal geo-political role in the region.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Abta cracks down on tour operators The Association of British Travel Agents is launching a crackdown on tour operators and travel agents - including the use of private detectives - to safeguard customers against companies going bankrupt. Members voted 9-1 at the association's annual meeting last weekend to give the secretariat more powers to look into companies' accounts and activities at any time - for example, if it suspected a company of engaging in activities of which it was not aware. Previously it had to wait until the end of each financial year to examine accounts.</p>

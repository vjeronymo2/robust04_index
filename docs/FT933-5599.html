			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Offshoot sale behind advance at Persimmon INCREASED purchases by housing associations helped lift unit sales at Persimmon, the York-based housebuilder, by 30 per cent to 1,462 in the half year to June 30 1993. However, lower average selling prices and margins held back profits. Pre-tax profits advanced from Pounds 7.25m to Pounds 9.72m helped by a Pounds 2.36m profit on the sale of a non-trading subsidiary with surplus advance corporation tax and lower interest charges of Pounds 1.32m, compared with Pounds 1.98m. At the operating level profits came out lower at Pounds 8.68m, against Pounds 9.23m. Mr Duncan Davidson, chairman, said: 'House prices are starting to move. There is a stronger secondhand market. Confidence and fear of unemployment are still holding back the housing market.' Turnover increased to Pounds 85.4m (Pounds 71.5m). The company said 300 of its total sales were to housing associations at an average selling price of about Pounds 45,000, compared with Pounds 65,000 for each speculative house sale. Operating margins fell to 10.2 per cent, against 12.9 per cent. The landbank stood at a stable 13,350 units with planning consent. Persimmon also owns, or has options on, 2,700 acres for which it is seeking planning permission. Mr Mike Allen, deputy chairman, said the company was reducing expensive incentives: 'Part exchange sales are costing us less than they did six or seven months ago. Last year each sale cost Pounds 5,500 compared with Pounds 1,500 in 1988.' At the end of the period borrowings were Pounds 23m giving gearing of 16 per cent. The interim dividend is maintained at 2.8p. Earnings per share were 7.6p (5.2p). COMMENT Shares in Persimmon yesterday closed up 5p at 289p indicating some caution over the ripeness of the profits. Better sales volume and headline pre-tax profits have more to do with windfall gains than a good climate for housing. The government's cash injection of Pounds 750m, which lifted sales to housing associations, is unlikely to be repeated. But the company could realise a further Pounds 4.5m by 1995 from ACT-related disposals. Exceptional gains apart, sales completed or in the pipeline since mid-year already match the total for the first half and on higher margins. As land prices improve, the company should benefit from its long landbank. However, Persimmon owns only two thirds of its landbank with the remainder held in joint ventures, a form of off-balance sheet financing which proposed accounting rules could shortly outlaw. The company's own calculations are that this would almost double gearing. Stripping out exceptional gains, forecasts are for full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 16.5m, giving earnings up to 12.4p. A prospective p/e of 25 is average for a sound builder but investors are paying more for others in the sector offering more sparkling prospects.</p>

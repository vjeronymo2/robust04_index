			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: AT&amp;T claims video-phone breakthrough AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph yesterday introduced a telephone which allows the user to send full-colour, television-quality still pictures down an ordinary phone line, while simultaneously talking over the same line. The company said the product, called the Picasso phone, was the first of its kind and would be marketed to businesses - such as advertising, design and engineering companies - which needed to transmit high quality images between different sites. Several products allow the transmission of still or moving images while talking on a telephone line, but these generally require a special, upgraded phone service, such as integrated services digital network (ISDN). The new AT &amp; T equipment is distinctive in that it does not require the user to have an ISDN service, but merely an ordinary telephone line. The phone will sell in the US for around Dollars 3,295 and the cost of calling on it will be the same as for a regular voice call. The phone underlines two important trends at AT &amp; T: its increasing emphasis on the merging of voice, video and computer technologies to produce new products; and its greater entrepreneurial focus. Mr Robert Kavner, head of its communications products business, said the new phone had been developed in a year by a team drawn from across the AT &amp; T group, which relied heavily on customer advice in creating the device. Images can be put into the phone system from ordinary video cameras, digital cameras, photo compact disc players or personal computers. Users can draw over the transmitted pictures with a computer mouse to highlight a point. AT &amp; T also announced yesterday it and Kodak, the photographic products company, were exploring synergies between the two businesses with the aim of producing 'end-to-end image communications solutions' for customers. Kodak's photo CD player is one source which can send images over the Picasso system.</p>

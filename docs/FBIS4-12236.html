			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Maher Chmaytelli] </F>   [Text] Cairo, April 6 (AFP) -- Israel is holding back on a  date for its withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho to pressure the  Palestinians into giving up their demands, the PLO complained  here Wednesday [6 April].    A PLO negotiator, asking not to be named, said Israel aimed  to win concessions from the Palestinians on key issues such as  water-sharing rights for Jewish settlers in the future  autonomous areas.    The date for the Israeli army's withdrawal from the Gaza  Strip and West Bank town of Jericho is being used as a weapon to  secure Palestinian concessions on several other points, he said.    The Israelis also wanted veto rights over legal matters so  they could overrule decisions taken by Palestinian courts.    On archaeology, another of the issues under discussion since  a new round of autonomy negotiations opened in the Egyptian  capital on Sunday, Israel demanded excavation rights.    The negotiator said Israel was calculating that the PLO had  more to lose from a delay in an army withdrawal, which was  originally due to start on December 13 and be completed by April  13.    When the two sides failed to meet the December target set by  the Declaration of Principles they signed in Washington on  September 13, opponents of peace such as the Islamic Resistance  Movement (Hamas) gained ground, he noted.    To ease the pressure of time and win room for manoeuvre, the  Palestine Liberation Organisation has asked for an Israeli  commitment to pull out between April 13 and May 1, he said.    "Once one commits himself to a date, he really goes about to  do everything to respect it," chief PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th  said on Tuesday.    But his Israeli counterpart General Amnon Shahaq remained  non-committal and stressed that the emphasis was on signing a  final package for the launch of autonomy.    "What is important is to have the agreement signed and it  will be signed when all discussions will be finished here. I  can not say when," he said. "We will continue next week and I  hope it will be finished soon."    The latest round, following a five-week break because of the  Hebron mosque massacre, was to wind up on Wednesday because of  Israel's commemoration of the Holocaust the next day and to  reopen on Sunday.    On the ground, 26 Palestinians who were exiled by Israel  returned to the West Bank on Tuesday to bolster preparations for  self-rule. Another 23 Palestinian exiles returned home to a  hero's welcome on the Gaza Strip.    Meanwhile in Cairo, both sides were still divided over the  release of Palestinian prisoners. Sha'th complained that Israel  was refusing to free members of groups hostile to the peace  process, including Hamas.    Talks on deploying a Palestinian police force focused on  several issues, including the size of the force, a factor which  appears to have been resolved in contrast to the other  difficulties.    The force will be 9,000 strong, a compromise between the  10,000 demanded by the PLO and the original Israeli offer of  6,000, according to Sha'th.    Akram Haniyah, a close aide to 'Arafat, said in an Israeli  newspaper interview from PLO headquarters in Tunis that Arafat  should arrive in Jericho during the first week of May.    "I think 'Arafat and the political leadership of the PLO  will  arrive in Jericho during the first week of the month of May," he  told HA'ARETZ.    However the aide added a note of caution with an eye on the  talks: "The situation is still fluid. Everything depends on the  outcome of the negotiations underway in Cairo."    'Arafat himself on Wednesday left Amman after talks with  King  Husayn to travel to the Egyptian capital where he was to guide  his negotiators on the last day of talks.    Israel and the PLO were also to meet in Paris the same day  to  discuss economic issues.</p>

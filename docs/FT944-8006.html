			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Positive part of pyramid Sir, The FT particularly will realise that there are losers in all types of business endeavour. Why should network marketing be any different? It is very sad that Bethan Hutton's article (Weekend Money: 'Inside the pyramid game', November 19) fails to mention any of the positive aspects of the Amway business, the important part Bris and Kerry Bovill have played in developing that business and, in so doing, the opportunities they have created for hundreds if not thousands of people facing a bleak and uncertain future.

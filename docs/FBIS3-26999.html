Jiangxi saw the greatest number of Taiwan residents paying  hometown visits there last year, totalling some 40,000, since  the Taiwan authorities relaxed restriction on hometown visits to  the Mainland. They were all pleased with the economic build-up  which was underway and made up their minds to make contributions  to social undertakings, including the opening of schools,  construction of bridges and village roads, improvements of the  power supply, the funding of a home for the elderly and the  planting of trees. A Taiwan compatriot originating from Leping,  a place in Jiangxi, donated to a fund for the construction of a  primary school in his village because of its backwardness in  education when compared with the economic development there.    A total of 45 Taiwan compatriots witnessing the building of  a  bridge over the Ganjiang River during their home visits donated  a total of RMB 300,000 to fund the construction. Ganzhou  Prefecture saw total donations valued at RMB 1.86 million made  by 183 Taiwan compatriots last year to fund 91 social  undertakings.    Various levels of local governments in Jiangxi expressed  their gratitude to these Taiwan compatriots and presented them  with certificates praising their generosity. Items funded by  donations by Taiwan residents were carried out in keeping with  the willingness of these donors.</p>

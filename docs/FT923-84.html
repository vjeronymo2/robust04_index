			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Benetton rises 16.5% to L92.8bn BENETTON, the Italian clothing group, raised net profits by 16.5 per cent to L92.8bn (Dollars 74.47m) in the first half of this year, on a 7 per cent rise in sales to L1,233bn. The improvement came across virtually every line of the group's business, with strong growth from its up-market Sisley brand, which increased sales by 29 per cent. Turnover by Benetton's socks and accessories division also jumped, with a 90 per cent increase stemming largely from increased sales of sports and women's shoes, as well as accessories. Geographically, Germany and Spain had performed particularly well, while sales had risen due to expansion into new areas, notably among developing countries. The company confirmed the return of Mr Aldo Palmeri, its former managing director for eight years, to his previous position. Mr Palmeri, a one-time Bank of Italy official, left Benetton in February 1990 to become Citicorp's chief country corporate officer for Italy. Benetton's gross industrial margin rose by 9.3 per cent to L460bn, while net financial charges dropped by L1.5bn to L16.8bn. Net debt fell by L75bn to L327bn.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Merck beats expectations with earnings of Dollars 705.7m SHARES in Merck gained ground yesterday morning after the biggest US drugs company posted slightly better-than-expected third-quarter profits. During the quarter, Merck's earnings rose to Dollars 705.7m, or 62 cents a share, compared with Dollars 634.8m, or 55 cents, a year earlier. Most analysts had expected profits of 61 cents a share in the latest quarter. Sales advanced 3 per cent to Dollars 2.54bn from Dollars 2.46bn. On Wall Street, the results helped lift Merck's shares by Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 32 1/4 at the close. Merck attributed its improved earnings performance to cost control measures, improved productivity, a better product mix and strong unit volume gains. It said its results also benefited from restructuring and a lower tax rate. For the first nine months, net income was Dollars 1.49bn, or Dollars 1.31. A year earlier, the company earned Dollars 1.38bn, or Dollars 1.19. Merck's 1993 results were muddied by restructuring charges in the second quarter. In the same period of 1992, results included charges of Dollars 462.4m for accounting changes. Stripping out restructuring charges in 1993 and the 1992 accounting changes, Merck said its net income rose 10 per cent to Dollars 2.01bn, or Dollars 1.77 in the first nine months of 1993. Sales grew to Dollars 7.5bn from Dollars 7.06bn. The company said that sales growth was held back by the sale of its Calgon Water Management business in the second quarter and by the impact of a strong dollar. In the human and animal health segment, unit sales of its high blood pressure treatment Vasotec, anti-ulcer drugs Pepcid and Prilosec and the anti-cholesterol drug Zocor were strong. The company's Proscar drug, to treat symptomatic benign prostate enlargement, also contributed to the sales gain. However, sales of cholesterol-lowering Mevacor continued to erode in the nine months. It is planning a Dollars 6bn takeover of Medco Containment Services, the biggest US mail-order drugs distributor. Merck said it intended to finance the acquisition through a combination of equity, cash and debt financing. The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Appointments: To Bristol, with ice Harveys of Bristol, the world's largest sherry company, is to have, from March, a new managing director who comes from Hiram Walker, the Canadian wines and spirits group acquired by Allied-Lyons, Harvey's parent, six years ago. Ian Hannah, 45, brand manager of Croft sherry back in the 1970s, is delighted to be looking after the brand-leader Bristol Cream rather than 'the pretender'. He replaces Antonio Filipe, who is retiring after just a year in the job. A man who thinks Bristol Cream 'chilled with ice is a very nice drink', Hannah says that Harveys, which had been allowed to operate very independently within Allied Lyons, is now being progressively integrated into the Hiram Walker division. Hannah's main concern is with sherry's old-fashioned image: 'It is a very attractive taste, and if only people didn't know it was sherry they would think it a sensational new drink.' Closely involved with Smirnoff's 'the effect is shattering' campaign in the 1970s, he plans to 'rejuvenate the category, make it more contemporary'. For the past four years he has been managing director of European Cellars International, the French and German wine interests of Hiram Walker. 'Frankfurt and Bordeaux were a much easier commute than Jerez will be,' he says, anticipating the difficulty of shuttling between Spain, the production, blending and storage location, and Bristol, seat of Harvey's worldwide sales and marketing effort. Although not a Spanish-speaker yet, Hannah is 'going into deep immersion soon'.</p>

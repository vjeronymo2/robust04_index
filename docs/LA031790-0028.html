			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TORRANCE COUNCIL REJECTS PROPOSED OFFICE BUILDING  </P> <P> Voicing concerns about traffic and density, the Torrance City Council has  rejected a proposal to build a seven-story office building and four-story  parking structure near the corner of Hawthorne and Torrance boulevards, one of  the city's busiest intersections.  </P> <P> After the council's 6-1 vote against the proposal this week, Duke Runnels,  senior vice president of Oxford Properties Inc., said his firm would design a  smaller project.  </P> <P> The project was to be the second phase of development on a 16-acre parcel at  the northwestern edge of the Del Amo Fashion Center, near the Marriott Hotel.  </P> <P> The first phase of the project -- the 107-foot-high Computax building and  parking structure -- was approved by the council in 1987 on a 6-1 vote, with  Councilman Bill Applegate opposing it as too bulky.  </P> <P> Applegate reiterated his opposition this week, and this time was joined by all  his colleagues, except Councilman Dan Walker, who voted for the second phase of  the project.  </P> <P> "This is not the type of structure I want to see on that site," Applegate said.  "I voted against the Computax building because it was a high-rise building with  little setback, and I am opposed to a similar project."  </P> <P> Walker said he favored the project because it was consistent with the first  phase.  </P> <P> The proposed second phase consisted of a 101-foot-tall office building situated  52 feet south of Torrance Boulevard; a four-level parking structure behind the  office building and a one-story office building near Torrance Boulevard.  </P> <P> A key issue in the debate was the density of the project.  </P> <P> When the Computax building was approved, the council insisted that there be no  more than 80 square feet of floor space for every 100 square feet of property  area, or a floor area ratio of 0.80, for the entire 16-acre project.  </P> <P> But the council permitted a higher density -- a floor area ratio of 0.94 -- on  the 7.3-acre parcel where the Computax building was to be situated, with the  understanding that a lower density would be observed on the remainder.  </P> <P> On the second phase, however, Oxford asked for an even higher density. The  proposed building would have had a floor area ratio of 0.95 on a 3.3-acre  parcel. The company said that a lower density on a third parcel -- a floor area  ratio of 0.50 on a 5.3-acre site -- would keep the floor area ratio for the  entire property within the 0.80 limit.  </P> <P> But the council wasn't buying this approach.  </P> <P> Applegate was the most vocal in opposition.  </P> <P> "This project is out of place," Applegate said. "It is not consistent with the  previous proposal made on the property."  </P> <P> He noted that the proposed building was only 6 feet lower than the Computax  building but would be only 52 feet from the curb, compared with the minimum  66-foot setback for the Computax building.  </P> <P> Applegate said he wanted to see a smaller building without a new parking  structure.  </P> <P> "I'll be real honest," Councilwoman Dee Hardison said. "I wish I asked the  piercing questions three years ago." She added that the proposed project was  "not what I visualized."  </P></p>

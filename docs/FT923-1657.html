			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Edinburgh Fund Managers dips 23% Edinburgh Fund Managers, the international fund management group, reported a 23 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.46m to Pounds 1.89m in the six months to July 31. Mr Colin Ross, chairman, said the decline reflected reduced profit from unit trust trading, lower income on cash deposits and increased administrative costs associated with an imminent office move. He said the full year was expected to show a comparable decline in profits as that experienced in the first half. The interim dividend, however, is held at 5p and a maintained final of 8p forecast. New business totalling Pounds 100m was won in the period, but this was partially offset by a 3 per cent fall in funds under management to Pounds 1.84bn, as world stock markets declined in sterling terms. Earnings per share dropped from 9.5p to 6.9p.</p>

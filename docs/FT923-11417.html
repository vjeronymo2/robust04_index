			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: LMS assets per share fall 9% to 99p LONDON Merchant Securities, the property and investment group, saw its net assets per share fall 9 per cent from 109p to 99p over the 12 months to March 31. Shareholders' funds declined to Pounds 312m (Pounds 358m) but this fall was offset partly by the sale in January of 22.5m shares in First Leisure Corporation, which accrued Pounds 50.7m in profits and represented Pounds 24.7m on the balance sheet. Also the number of shares in issue fell by 11.5m with the Pounds 131m acquisition of Westpool Investment Trust, the largest asset of which had been its 50.9 per cent stake in LMS. Westpool's results were not material, but the deal simplified the group structure. Lord Rayne, LMS chairman and from October the successor to Lord Delfont as chairman of First Leisure, said LMS had retained a 15.2 per cent stake in the leisure group as 'a measure of confidence' in its management. First Leisure provided the bulk of the Pounds 7.77m (Pounds 8.68m) share in the profits of associated undertakings. Net rental income grew to Pounds 28.9m (Pounds 23.2m), giving operating profits of Pounds 25m (Pounds 22.1m). Interest payable increased to Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 11.6m) - none has been capitalised - and pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 24m (Pounds 28.9m). Mr Robert Spier, finance director, said the group's liquidity, its low gearing of about 24 per cent, and the fact that virtually all of its Pounds 178m borrowings are at fixed rates - and some 71 per cent beyond the end of the decade - all displayed the group's soundness. The final dividend is lifted to a proposed 3p (2.8p) to make 3.8p (3.6p) for the year.</p>

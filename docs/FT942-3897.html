			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Working Life: A munch at the Apple - Eating Out It is called Mrs Ascher's Steamed Vegetable Torte and it tends to turn heads when served in New York's Park Avenue Cafe, consisting as it does of a brightly coloured tower of layered peppers, squashes, zuchinis, spinach, cauliflower and broccoli, topped with a puree of eggplant, potato and leek. The dish typifies the exuberant style of resident chef David Burke, one of Manhattan's best known exponents of New American cuisine, who imaginatively mixes traditional staples of US cooking with more exotic ingredients and presents the dishes in dramatic fashion. Other examples of his art include chilled lobster salad with toasted saffron, couscous, endive and candied lemon; or carpaccio of marinated tuna and seaweed wrapped noodles. The Park Avenue Cafe is a relative newcomer to New York's rich choice of top quality restaurants. But over the past two years it has become a fashionable alternative to Mid-town Manhattan's leading established exponents of contemporary American cooking, namely Aureole, Arcadia, the Quilted Giraffe and the Sign of the Dove. The food is exciting (though some critics complain it is a little too contrived), the wine list is strong, and the service is attentive, without the American waiter's irritating tendency to over-familiarity. It is a good place for business discussions because its tables tend to be well spaced apart - unlike some of its cramped rivals, where you may find yourself sharing your confidential negotiations with the next tables, or your attention wandering to the much more fascinating details of a neighbouring diner's love life. The decor is conducive to both types of conversation, blending romantic American country folk art with a dash of hard-edged city sophistication. In short, it has the class one would hope for from a Park Avenue address, without any of the stuffiness that often accompanies it. A meal for two, including a decent bottle of wine, tax and a 20 per cent tip, will cost Dollars 180 to Dollars 200. Park Avenue Cafe, 100 East 63rd Street, New York. Phone: 644-1900.</p>

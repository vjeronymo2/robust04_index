			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): High-speed CD-ROM Matsushita has unveiled a CD-ROM drive that reads CD-ROM (read only memory) disks at quadruple speed, and can also write, erase and rewrite up to 650 megabytes of data onto optical disks, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo. Matsushita has received or applied for 88 international patents on the drive's 'phase-change' recording technique, which reversibly alters the structure of the disk. Users can transfer data from CD-ROM onto disk, edit the data, and read it at almost the same speed as from the CD-ROM. Matsushita is likely to start selling the new drive next year, probably under the Panasonic imprint. The new drive, which uses 120mm disks, is likely to be priced at around Y100,000 (Pounds 630).

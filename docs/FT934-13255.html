			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Tietmeyer makes his mark It is tempting, amid the surprise surrounding yesterday's Bundesbank rate cut, to conclude that something fundamental has changed with the installation of Mr Hans Tietmeyer as president. To do so might be a mistake. The discount rate cut was both large and unexpected, but the money market repurchase rate is being cut by a mere 27 basis points. That suggests a shift in style rather than substance  - and a wait before the bank is again moved to cut official lending rates. Considering the cogent way in which Mr Tietmeyer explained the decision  - money supply under control, third quarter output flat and inflation looking good in the last three months  - it is curious that so few pundits had forecast a cut. One explanation is that Mr Tietmeyer was trying to earn the markets' respect by surprising them. In this regard he looks more a man of the world than his predecessor. He may also be more inclined to take the exchange market into account. It is not just the pressing doubts about France's ability to hold out without rate cuts. The Bundesbank cannot be indifferent to pressures on the Belgian franc, given Luxembourg's threat to sever its connection with that currency. This would complicate matters for Germany, which has a large banking presence in the Grand Duchy. Finally, a little encouragement to other European countries to cut their interest rates might just help boost flagging demand for German exports. Mr Tietmeyer may be trying to offset recent D-mark appreciation, but he needs support at home. It will be awkward if next week's inflation figure, at which even he can presently only guess, turns out disappointing.</p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Sutcliffe Speakman parts company with chief executive Sutcliffe Speakman is parting company with its chief executive in the wake of a disappointing performance in its UK carbons activities, writes Katrina Lowe. Mr Richard Mumford assumed the post of managing director and chief executive at the time of Sutcliffe's reconstruction in 1991. It is thought that there was a difference with the board over management style and his handling of the group's carbons business, where demand has been slack. Mr Mumford was a specialist in the activated carbon business. The company is engaged in activated carbon technology and environmental protection systems. Mr Ernest Tyerman, chairman, said yesterday that the downturn in carbons sales partly reflected reduced bulk sales in the short-term. He added that estimates that the problems could result in an overall profits shortfall in 1994-95 in the region of Pounds 200,000 were not incorrect at present, but there was some time to go until the year end. In the year to end-March Sutcliffe swung a Pounds 6.56m loss to profits of Pounds 1.1m pre-tax. The shares fell 7p yesterday to 40p.</p>

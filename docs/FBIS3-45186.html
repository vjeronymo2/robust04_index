			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 12 (XINHUA) -- The Agricultural  Bank of China (ABC) will add 9 billion yuan to its annual credit  to agriculture this year, which will lift the bank's credit  supply to agriculture to a total of 25 billion yuan, according  to a senior ABC official here today.    In addition to the loans provided by the rural credit  cooperatives across the country, the agricultural sector is  expected to get over 35 billion yuan in loans for the whole of  1994.    This means a jump of about 45 percent from last year's level  of 23.8 billion yuan.    According to ABC's president Ma Yongwei, the bank will be  split into two banks: the Agricultural Development Bank and the  Agricultural Bank of China.    The former will be responsible for policy-related lendings  which will ensure the state purchase of grain, cotton and oil  seed and channel poverty-relieving funds to most needy areas.    Free from the policy-related business, the Agricultural Bank  of China will begin to operate in the way of a commercial bank.    At present the bank as well as the country's banking  authorities are working at top speed defining the range that  policy directives will cover and the differing capital fund  management for the two banks, noted Ma.    He said the policy-oriented bank would be established in the  first half of this year, before the summer harvest begins.    This year, the People's Bank of China, The Central Bank,  will  stick to the credit quota system to ensure control of total bank  lending.    The ABC president stressed that ABC branch banks would not  breach the quotas set by the bank authorities.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Circular </F> on "Legal Issues Cropping Up in the Course of Running  Sino-Foreign Joint Ventures"--promulgated by the Ministry of  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation on 5 October 1993]    [Text] Since the promulgation and implementation of the  "Sino-Foreign Joint Venture Law and its regulations for  implementation, China has approved 3,986 Sino-foreign joint  ventures (up to the end of September 1987). The following  circular on several legal issues which often crop up in the  course of running Sino-foreign joint ventures in various  localities is now issued:    1. Concerning replacement of approval certificates.    Sino-foreign joint ventures, in the course of carrying out  contracts, often have to change the addresses of the joint  ventures, the parties in the joint ventures, the total amount of  investment, the business scope, the formation of the boards of  directors and changes in the chairmen and vice chairmen of these  boards, and changes involving the contents of approved  agreements, contracts, rules, and approval certificates which  have already been issued. Article 17 of the "Regulations for  Implementing the Sino-Foreign Joint Venture Law" stipulates:  "Agreements, contracts, and rules for joint ventures come into  effect on approval by examination and approval organs and the  same holds true in the case of alterations." Therefore, all  changes in the major contents of agreements, contracts, and  rules for joint ventures should be approved by the original  organs for examination and approval. Upon approval, new  approval certificates will be issued with the same serial  numbers as the original approval certificates and the old  approval certificates will be taken back. Changes in  registration will be made against the approval certificates at  the original registration organs.    2. Concerning the issue of not allowing general managers or  deputy general managers of Sino-foreign joint ventures to take  up concurrent posts as general managers or deputy general  managers of other economic organizations.    Article 40 of the "Regulations for the Implementation of  Sino-Foreign Joint Venture Law" stipulates: "General managers  or deputy general managers will not take up concurrent posts as  general managers or deputy general managers of other economic  organizations and will not take part in commercial competition  for other economic organizations against the joint ventures."  At present, the general managers of the foreign sides of some  Sino-foreign joint ventures have concurrent posts as general  managers or other posts in enterprises outside the bordera.  This violates the laws in China and should be stopped. The  "other economic organizations" stated in the provision include  both economic organizations at home and abroad.    3. Concerning the limits of authority for examination and  approval of increasing investment in Sino-foreign joint ventures.    If an approved Sino-foreign joint venture wants to increase  investment because of the needs in production, operation, and so  on, and if the sum of the amount of investment to be increased  and the amount of the original investment exceeds the limits of  authority for examination and approval of the original organ of  examination and approval and the expanded part is within the  same project, the newly signed agreement on increasing  investment should, together with the originally approved  documents, be submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations and Trade for examination and approval.    The abovementioned matters regarding approved Sino-foreign  joint ventures and foreign trade enterprises should be handled  according to the abovementioned principles. [Signed] Ministry  of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade [Dated] 17 December 1987</p>

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / German strikes expected to bring chaos today: Trial of strength between public sector unions and government comes to a head TRAINS and buses, post, refuse disposal, and a string of other public services are expected to be severely disrupted in western Germany from today after all the public sector unions voted overwhelmingly in favour of strike action. Before dawn today, public transport workers began to walk out in the first full-scale public sector strike to hit the country for 18 years. Postal workers, railway employees, hospital administration and school services and white-collar workers are also to be involved. The action amounts to a trial of strength between the trade unions, and both central government and the local authorities, in the latest annual wage round. At the same time, pay negotiations between the employers and the construction workers' union, IG Bau, broke down on Saturday, and IG Metall, representing the country's 4m engineering workers, has already called for 'massive warning strikes' this week in support of its own wage claims. The unrest could affect the entire German economy at a time when it is already labouring under the burden of paying for unification with the east. There was a hint of a desire for compromise last night, when Mrs Heide Simonis, Social Democrat (SPD) finance minister of Schleswig-Holstein and a key member of the employers' side in the public sector negotiations, proposed a pay deal increasing the lowest wages by more than the 4.8 per cent currently on offer. Mr Bjorn Engholm, the SPD leader, called for an urgent resumption of negotiations, and a new government offer in the coming week. However thus far the government, represented by Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister, has refused to improve on 4.8 per cent, compared with an arbitration panel proposal of 5.4 per cent, and a union demand of 9.5 per cent. Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, leader of the OTV public sector union, said the unions would 'prove very quickly that without the public services, nothing runs at all'. The OTV is reported to have a strike fund of DM600m. 'We can keep going,' she said. Postal workers started strike action on Friday, and over the weekend public theatres and concert halls were also closed when stage-hands, make-up artists and ticket sales staff walked out. Striking train safety inspectors were expected to halt express trains by midday today. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, yesterday gave an upbeat assessment of German economic developments, announcing that the economy of western Germany grew by 1 per cent between the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of 1992, writes Peter Norman in Washington.</p>

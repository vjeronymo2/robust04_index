			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic by </F> Christophe Lamfalussy in Brussels on 22 March: "The European  Union Must Keep Its Promises"]    [Text] [Lamfalussy] Minister, you are going to meet with  Andre Adam, director general of policy at the Foreign Ministry.  What is the nature of your visit?    [Jovanovic] So many things worry us: The Yugoslav crisis,  the unjust and artificial isolation in which we have been placed.    [Lamfalussy] In practice, you want the sanctions to be  lifted?    [Jovanovic] The European Union (EU) must keep its promises.  It was it which proposed the peace plan to us. It asked the  Serbian side to fulfill the conditions. And they have been  fulfilled. It promised us that it would start to lift the  sanctions. And we have been waiting for several months. Hoping  that its promise means something. If not, its credibility in  the negotiations will be greatly affected.    [Lamfalussy] There is still an impression that Serbian  Bosnia  and Serbia are the same...    [Jovanovic] Our influence on the Bosnian Serbs has limits.  When three of our presidents went from Belgrade to Pale last  year, they were humiliated. Their prestige suffered as a  result. The Bosnian Serbs have been living there for a thousand  years. They know their rights better than us. If they feel  that we do not support them, they are ready to tell us to go to  the devil.    [Lamfalussy] What is your influence on the Serbs in Krajina  who are opening negotiations with the Croatian Government this  Tuesday?    [Jovanovic] We cannot tell them what agreement they must  sign. We can tell them that the hostilities must end, which is  what we are saying to the Croatians too.    [Lamfalussy] What is your feeling?    [Jovanovic] We must return to the self-determination which  was guaranteed by the last federal constitution of Yugoslavia  and the penultimate Croatian Constitution. Croatia was defined  as the state of the Croatian nation and the Serbian nation.  When Mr. Tudjman came to power, his first action was to revise  the constitution and reduce the Serbs to a minority. Until  their rights are restored, there will not be much room for a  compromise.    [Lamfalussy] In one country which would be Croatia?    [Jovanovic] It is possible if they reach agreement.    [Lamfalussy] Is the agreement signed in Washington by  Croatians and Muslims another sign of hope?    [Jovanovic] God willing. It may be a hope, but it may also  be dangerous. It will all depend on the American vision. Do  they want a just and lasting peace? Or do they want to  humiliate the Serbs?    [Lamfalussy] Mr. Redman has visited Belgrade...    [Jovanovic] He only gave broad outlines. The Americans are  not telling us openly what they want. That makes us suspicious.    [Lamfalussy] One guarantee for peace is the control which  you  have over the war criminals, Arkan for instance...    [Jovanovic] Arkan only carried out one escapade in two years  without our knowing about it. He was invited by the mayor of  Bijeljina [as published] who wanted to oppose a mini-coup d'etat  by the Muslims. We have never accepted the atrocities committed  by him or by other parties. But in a civil war, there is no  room for angels.</p>

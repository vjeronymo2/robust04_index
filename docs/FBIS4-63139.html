			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" program] </F>   [Text] The procuracy of the Pacific Fleet has established  the reasons for the vast explosion at the fleet's aviation  (bomb) store. According to the procuracy, one of the servicemen  learnt that some of the things stored at the dump contained  precious metals and decided, with his friends, to remove them.  They found the munition they were seeking and began to dig into  it with a bayonet. When the munition unexpectedly burst into  flames the soldiers could think of nothing better to do than to  run away.    As a result of the subsequent fire and explosion about 200  wagon-loads of munitions went up into the air and great material  damage was caused to the neighboring villages.</p>

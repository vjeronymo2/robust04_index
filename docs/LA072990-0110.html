			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> BEST BET  </P> <P> Curators tell visitors that the Cabrillo Marine Museum got its start when a  local lifeguard found a dead pelican washed up on the shore and plunked it  across a table to examine. Soon he and others were collecting and displaying  marine creatures and aquatic curiosities in a nearby bathhouse.  </P> <P> Ten years ago, with financial help from the Los Angeles Department of  Recreation and Parks, the museum moved into a new complex at Cabrillo Beach.  The San Pedro museum today boasts 35 aquariums that are home to sea cucumbers,  mantis shrimp, stony cup coral and hundreds of other animals that normally live  in the surrounding ocean waters.  </P> <P> This summer, the museum is offering a series of one-week workshops for  children, called "Science at the Seashore." During this week's workshop, kids  in grades one to four will be collecting specimens at the seashore and  examining them under a microscope. "Kids freak out when they can actually see  the animals feeding," instructor Steve Vogel said. The cost is $70 for the  five-day, 9 a.m. to noon program.  </P> <P> Other special programs for adults and families are scheduled year-round. The  museum's exhibits and aquariums are open from noon to 5 p.m. Tuesday through  Friday and from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. Although admission to  the museum at 3720 Stephen White Drive is free, parking at the lot at Cabrillo  Beach costs $5. One of the favorite attractions at the museum is an outdoor  tank where visitors can touch sea urchins, bat stars and sea anemones. For more  information call 548-7562. IAN ROSE  </P></p>

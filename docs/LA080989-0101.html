			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH SAYS HE'S READY FOR 'MAXIMUM' IRAN DIALOGUE;  </P> <P> EFFORT ON HOSTAGES INTENSIFIES  </P> <P> The Bush Administration sent a clear signal to Iran today that the United  States wants to encourage "maximum dialogue" on the American hostages in  Lebanon despite the Administration's publicly stated policy of refusing to get  involved in "trading off or negotiating for hostages."  </P> <P> Although insisting that Administration policy has not changed, President Bush  said: "I hope I am open-minded enough to talk and to exercise every diplomatic  channel I can to free these Americans. And no American is going to be content  until these Americans are free."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Policy Remains Unchanged  </P> <P> In a later interview with The Times, White House press secretary Marlin  Fitzwater insisted that Administration policy remains unchanged. But Fitzwater  said Bush was interpreting the policy in a way that should make clear to the  Iranians that the United States wants to establish clear lines of communication  through an intermediary to facilitate a dialogue on the hostage issue.  </P> <P> "You can say it's a signal to Iran, and we clearly want to encourage maximum  dialogue," Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> Fitzwater said the Administration hopes that the election last week of Hashemi  Rafsanjani as Iran's new president means a change of attitude on the part of  the Iranian government. "Our policies haven't changed," he said, "but we want  to state them in a way that maximizes the opportunity for dialogue."  </P> <P> </P> <P> New 'Definition'  </P> <P> The Administration has made several statements reflecting what Fitzwater called  a new "definition" of that policy, beginning with a comment by Bush in an  interview that appeared in Wednesday's Boston Globe.  </P> <P> Asked if he had forsaken the policy of not negotiating for the release of  hostages, Bush said he has no problem saying that "if I can talk to somebody  and get the release of an American hostage and do it without, in my view and in  the view of the experts, putting others at risk, I'd be glad to do that."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a senior intelligence source said that "a lot of very delicate  things are going on" in negotiations with Iran through third countries to try  to seek the release of the eight American hostages being held by terrorists in  Lebanon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Algeria Plays Role  </P> <P> Algeria, which has played a major role in negotiating the release of hostages  in several other cases, including when a TWA jetliner was hijacked by Shiite  Muslim extremists in the summer of 1985, has emerged as a prominent  intermediary in current negotiations, the source said.  </P> <P> Other sources said that Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Jordan also are operating as  intermediaries in U.S. contacts with Iran.  </P> <P> Bush, during a brief question-and-answer session with reporters in the Oval  Office, promised to pursue every diplomatic channel in seeking release of the  hostages, whom he described as "too precious for me to be sticking my head in  the sand."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Effort Energized  </P> <P> The videotape released by terrorists that showed the body an American hostage  -- Lt. Col. William Higgins -- hanging from a rope has energized the effort to  free the hostages, Bush said.  </P> <P> "There is a common threat. This is too much. Enough is enough," Bush declared.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- The Ministry of Agriculture,  Forestry and Fisheries said Tuesday [10 May] that quarantine  measures Washington State has implemented recently to prevent an  apple disease spreading have cleared Japanese requirements for  imported apples.    Ministry officials said the ministry's on-site inspections  have found no problems in U.S. quarantine procedures for fire  blight, a common apple disease. Ministry sources said that as a  result, a Japanese ban on imports of U.S.-grown apples will be  lifted from late this year to early next year.    Japan has resisted U.S. calls for ending its curbs on  imports  of American apples despite decades of U.S. lobbying, citing  worms and diseases which could spread to contaminate Japanese  crops.</p>

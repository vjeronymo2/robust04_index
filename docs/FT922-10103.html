			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Books: Publish and be grand THE MACMILLANS by Richard Davenport-Hines Heinemann Pounds 18.50, 370 pages HAROLD Macmillan used to boast that his grandfather was a crofter, and - having it both ways - that his wife was the daughter of a duke. Like another British prime minister, Churchill, he had an American mother. What everybody knew was that the family was in publishing, though apart from being naturally bookish, he boasted about that rather less. What few people can have known until the publication of this book, however, is how grand the publishing business was. In the second half of the 19th century, it must have been the foremost house in Britain. The Macmillan brothers, Daniel and Alexander, were friends of Gladstone. They picked up young authors all over the place. Among their early titles were Tom Brown's Schooldays by Tom Hughes and Charles Kingsley's Westward Ho], books which made not only reputations but also money. Although Daniel died in 1857, Alexander went on to found Macmillan's Magazine, a monthly publication designed to bring on younger writers like Matthew Arnold and attract the established, like Lord Tennyson, into the Macmillan fold. The magazine was spectacularly successful; practically all the best-known writers of the time contributed. On Tennyson's death in 1892, the Macmillan family was put in charge of the funeral arrangements at Westminster Abbey. The entire intellect of England seems to have been there. 'No one who was present,' wrote the Marquess of Dufferin, a former Viceroy of India, 'will ever forget the scene, which was unparalleled in its dignity and splendid significance.' Apart from discovering authors, the Macmillans promoted publishing as a business. The Net Book Agreement, which lays down that a bookseller shall not undercut the retail price set by the publisher, was established as part of their doing at the end of the century. It still, more or less, exists. Daniel Macmillan was Harold's grandfather, and it was of his humble origins that the man who was to become prime minister used to boast. A photograph of the crofter's cottage where Daniel was born went with Macmillan throughout his government offices. Yet Daniel very quickly moved south, to Cambridge and London, first as a bookseller, than as a publisher. The Macmillan family had long been well-educated, with a tendency to religious earnestness. Daniel dropped the Baptists and switched to the Church of England when he put Scotland behind him. And he and his younger brother Alexander were lucky. Their move into publishing coincided with the sharp rise of literacy. Other publishing houses were founded at much the same time: Routledge and Cassell, for examples. George Routledge established the Railway Library which, Walter Bagehot recorded, sold books 'like sandwiches'. But it was the Macmillans who, in their list of authors and their influence, had pride of place. The remarkable fact about this book is that the story has never been told before. It is the natural subject for a company history, and it would have been even better if the Macmillan family had agreed to cooperate. The reason why they did not seems to be that Davenport-Hines wanted to add a thesis of his own. That was to explore the misfortunes - disease, premature death and alcoholism - that have dogged the Macmillans over the years. He thinks that the Macmillan men - Harold in particular - were given complexes by a dominating mother. The family refusal did not deter the author, who used to work in the Macmillan publishing house. Yet the result is that he has written two books in one. It is the first 123 pages about the history of the business that are riveting; the rest is a readable enough account of the life of Harold Macmillan with the odd attempt at psychological insight. Davenport-Hines thinks, for instance, that the familiar baring of the Macmillan teeth, which some saw as an ingratiating smile, was a sure sign that he was on the attack  -just like an animal. It stemmed from his hostility to his mother.</p>

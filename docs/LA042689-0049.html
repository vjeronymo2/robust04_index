			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: JOHNSON SABOTAGE THEORY IS BACK  </P> <P> The theory that Ben Johnson was a victim of sabotage at the Seoul Olympics  surfaced again at an inquiry into drug use by Canadian athletes on Tuesday at  Toronto.  </P> <P> David Sookram, attorney for Dr. Jamie Astaphan, who treated Johnson, suggested  during cross-examination of Waldemar Matuszewski, Johnson's physical therapist,  that Johnson received pills described as pain killers several days before he  tested positive for steroids and was stripped of the gold medal he won in the  100-meter dash.  </P> <P> On Monday, the inquiry's senior counsel, Robert Armstrong, had recommended that  the theory of someone tampering with Johnson's water bottle in Seoul be  discounted when he told commissioner Charles Dubin that all lawyers involved in  the probe had agreed to abandon it.  </P></p>

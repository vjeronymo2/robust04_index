			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan ("Yerkir", "Lragir" dailies), 04/23/94 --  Russian State Duma discussed the problem of condemning the  Genocide of Armenians during its session on April 22. Different  fractions of Duma had prepared corresponding declarations.  Nevertheless, in spite of strong pressure on Duma by the Turkish  Ambassador in Russia and the Turkish Defense Minister, who is  currently in Moscow, no polemics were made.    Duma's Liberal-democratic fraction presented a project of  declaration, condemning the genocide of Armenians, which was  previously prepared by the "Fund of Russian-Armenian  collaboration" organization. Duma accepted this declaration,  and its deputies have raised in memory of the victims of  Genocide with one minute of silence.    Nevertheless, Duma, as a legal body, continues the  discussion of the presented bill.    The following declaration was accepted by the Russian State  Duma on April 2:    "20th century has been marked by great winnings of human  spirit and good will. Nevertheless, it will also remain in  history as a period of world war disasters, dictatorships and  disgusting crimes against humanity.    The first evidences of the Genocide were massacres and  deportations of Armenians in the Osman Empire in 1915-16. More  than one million people were killed, causing a terrific loss to  the world family of nations.    We feel deep and eternal sorrow for the victims, for all  poets and craftsmen, peasants and painters, regardless of their  nationality or faith, who were not born [because of the  Genocide].    On the eve of 79th anniversary of this tragedy, Russian  State Duma condemns the genocide of Armenians and declares deep  condolences to Armenian people, grieving with all descendants of  the Genocide, living in Russia and all around the world. The  memory of victims and our conscience will permanently bother us,  as an evidence of the epoch which didn't pass in vain".    Similar declarations were made by two major fractions of  Duma - the Liberal-Democratic party and the "Russian Choice"  union.</p>

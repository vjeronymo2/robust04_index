			<p>Neutron   Bomb Using `Red Mercury'  <H4>  Report `Absolutely Groundless' </H4>  <F P=102> LD1504104994 Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 0956 GMT 15 Apr 94 </F> <F P=103> LD1504104994 </F> <F P=104>  Moscow ITAR-TASS </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Mirniy (Archangelsk region) April 15 TASS --  ``Reports about a `new Russian miniature bomb,' allegedly  developed with the use of `red mercury,' are absolutely  groundless,'' ITAR-TASS was told today by Lieutenant-General  Yuriy Zhuravlev, chief of the state testing ground of the  Russian Strategic Missile Forces.    ``Russia is not making or testing new types of nuclear  weapons,'' he stressed.    The hullabaloo around the Russian ``top secret weapon,'' the  general believes, was raised by those who disapprove of the  partnership relations that are now being established between  Russia and the West. We have seen more than once in the past  that whenever some military-industrial complex needed new funds,  reports immediately began to appear, claiming that this or that  country ``is lagging behind the Russians,'' he recalled.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Short sterling stalled VARIOUS vacuums affected the UK money markets yesterday. The Tory party conference had given no real cause for concern, the latest economic data produced nothing of real import, liquidity was not unacceptable and the market was on hold, writes Peter John. Financial futures traded marginally lower and Bank of England operations went ahead smoothly if not quite as effortlessly as last week. The December contract for short sterling was down by one basis point to 94.37 at the close on gentle turnover of around 12,500 contracts. French and German cash futures were also weaker on balance. December short sterling has traded within a very tight range between around 94.32 and 94.38 for some time as the market has sat back waiting for some indication of the long-anticipated rate cut. One sterling dealer said: 'Basically, we have had the same interest rate for nine months and the market is hungry for change.' A number of market operators were surprised at lack of bad news from the party conference. What they saw as neutral to non-inflationary producer price statistics did not give a boost to the argument for another rate cut in the next few weeks. Several analysts pointed to the 2 per cent fall in import prices which might be expected be expected to follow through to lower prices in the high street. There was suspicion that the gilts market might be homing in on something different. Government bond prices were weaker across the board and a fall in bond prices often signals concern that inflation might be on the turn. Generally, the market is looking nervously towards the key retail price index figures tomorrow and several economists are predicting small rises in underlying inflation, the index that excludes mortgage interest payments. SGST, the French owned securities house, predicts a 0.1 point rise in September to 3.1 per cent. Interbank operations began the week with a forecast liquidity shortage of Pounds 1.05bn, later revised to Pounds 1.2bn. The pressure of the shortage was defused early on after the Bank of England provided Pounds 412m of assistance. This was followed by further injections of Pounds 6m and Pounds 545m topped off with late assistance at an unspecified rate of Pounds 50m bringing the total to Pounds 1.013bn.</p>

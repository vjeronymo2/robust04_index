			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Ford Deferring Merit Raises: Ford Motor Co. announced that it was deferring  first-quarter merit pay raises for 55,000 salaried workers in the United States  to cut costs in a soft and unpredictable auto market.  </P> <P> The move "is a recognition that the future is somewhat uncertain because of  weak auto industry sales and slowing economic growth, along with an  increasingly competitive environment," the company said. Ford's move follows  one by General Motors Corp., which said this month it plans broad cost cuts  designed to save more than $1 billion. Ford did not say how much it expected to  save with the program but added that it was part of an effort to cut costs and  increase efficiency.  </P></p>

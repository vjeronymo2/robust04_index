			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / China's central bank calls for tight money policies China's central bank, in an unusually forthright public declaration, has issued a clarion call for tight money policies, continued fiscal restraint and curbs on capital spending to combat inflation. The People's Bank, which for years has sheltered behind a dusty cloak of bureaucratic anonymity, made its 'fight-inflation-first' views known in a glossy publication titled 'China Financial Outlook, 1994'. While the document contains errors and omissions, such as understating the value of China's gold reserves, it does provides a relatively timely accounting of the country's financial position to the end of 1993. This contrasts with the bank's previous reporting which has tended to be much delayed and barely recognisable from propaganda. China, the bank said, should control investment through fiscal and monetary policies, and reduce domestic demand through a 'tight credit policy, thus increasing exports and curtailing imports'. Money supply should not be allowed to grow faster than 24 per cent for 1994, which is broadly in line with monetary growth in 1993. Publication of 'China Financial Outlook, 1994', with its smart graphics, elegant lay-out and attempts at forecasting economic and financial trends for this year, coincides with new legislation redefining the People's Bank's role as the leading institution in the fight against inflation. The document also reflects the bank's greater self confidence under the governorship of Mr Zhu Rongji, senior vice premier in charge of the economy. In its analysis of likely inflation trends, the bank predicted that price rises would gradually slow over the latter part of the year, although there would be 'fluctuations and the whole years's average. . . may continuously remain at a high level.' China reported the cost of living increase in the 35 main cities was 22.7 per cent in June compared with the same month last year. Retail inflation was about 20 per cent. The bank's forecast gave no indication that it might be prepared to relax credit restrictions during the year or ease monetary targets. But the forecast was drafted in the first quarter before pressures from ailing state enterprises forced some easing of credit. The People Bank, in reference to reforms of its charter, defined its role as 'keeping the currency stable and promoting economic growth'. 'The PBC (People's Bank of China) has to increase the use of indirect regulation while at the same time maintaining credit ceilings on specialised banks (state-owned commercial banks),' the forecast added. China's foreign exchange reserves were expected to support 2.8 months of imports in 1994 compared with 2.94 months in 1993. In fact, the forecast underestimated the improvement in China's reserves, which rose by 50 per cent in the first half of the year to Dollars 31.8bn. Slower growth in imports contributed to the improvement.</p>

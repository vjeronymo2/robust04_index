			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Information Technology Society in the Frankfurt  League of German Electrical Engineers (ITG) regards digital  mobile radio as a significant improvement in the position of  Germany and Europe. They note that the Germans, in particular,  not only played an essential role in the development of the new  "Global System for Mobile Communication" (GSM) standard, but  they were also in the vanguard in the development of the GSM  mobile radio net. They also claim that a large percentage of  Federal German territory is already equipped with radio stations  for the D1 and D2 nets which use the GSM standard. By 1995, 95  percent of the territory should be included.    GSM is the prerequisite for mobile telephoning without  borders: 28 countries, including the CIS, China and Australia,  want to install GSM radio nets over the next few years. When  that has happened anyone within these countries who has a GSM  mobile phone can access the net and place or receive a call.    The technical prerequisite for the compatibility of the  individual national networks is the GSM standard set by ETSI  (European Telecommunications Standardisation Institute). It  defines the processing of the digital signals at the interface,  the division of the frequency band into channels, modulation and  coding as well as the functions of the fixed radio stations and  their regulation. In Germany these technical requirements were  met with the activation of the D1 net. ETSI standardization is  converted into the national standard by the German Electronics  Commission in the DIN and the VDE (DKE).    Software for the complex GSM systems runs on supercomputers  which in turn must be incorporated into the net. The nets are  constructed in such a way that in the signal area every radio  station can reach a maximum number of subscribers simultaneously  by mobile telephone. This is achieved by data reduction and by  optimal utilization of the frequency bands by multiplex  processing. The 137 frequencies in the 900-megaHertz band  alloted to the GSM can each be utilized by eight subscribers. By  multiple utilization of the frequencies at various points on the  net an almost unlimited subscriber capacity is achieved. In the  opinion of VDE-ITG, demands on mobile communications systems  will continue to grow. Intelligent network functions will have  to be developed for current nets in order to introduce a unified  worldwide call number. Only then can the goal of "universal  personal communication" be realized. Every subscriber should be  able to access the network on any continent by card or telephone  and be able to receive calls using the same call number in any  country. By the year 2005 the European "Universal Mobile  Telecommunication System" should be using an integrated system  to provide the services of mobile radio nets which today exist  side by side. Comparable efforts are being undertaken worldwide  with the objective of creating a "Future Public Land Mobile  Telecommunication System."</p>

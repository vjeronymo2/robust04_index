			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Popular policies: Masayoshi Takemura Mr Masayoshi Takemura has made a spectacular comeback at the head of Japan's Finance Ministry, its most powerful bureaucracy, despite being constantly undermined, in his days as chief cabinet secretary in the Hosokawa administration, by Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the backroom strategist, writes Emiko Terazono. Not only does the Finance Ministry govern state budget, tax policy and financial markets, it also supervises the Bank of Japan's monetary policy. So far his pronouncements as finance minister have been sweet to the public's ears. Yesterday he stressed he would pursue income tax cuts but ruled out an immediate consumption-tax increase. He has gained electoral popularity through his low-key style, is a self-professed environmentalist, and has been calling for a green tax to help conserve the regional environment. Along with members of the Socialist party, Mr Takemura is known for his strong ties with North Korea. He has visited the country three times, including a trip he organised for Liberal Democrat and Socialist elders to meet President Kim Il-Sung in 1990. Such ties pose risks for swift Japanese decision-making towards North Korea were a crisis to erupt. In contrast to Mr Ozawa, he envisages a more discreet role for Tokyo in the international arena, claiming Japan should maintain its role as a pacifist country, and strongly opposes its financial involvement in regional military crises.</p>

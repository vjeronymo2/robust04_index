			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Brunei debts about to be settled Sir, Your article headed 'Brunei default on debts alleged' (October 20) fails to highlight the fact that this matter concerning just Pounds 4,000 is within days of being settled. While there can be no adequate excuse for some of the delays which have occurred, it is not true to say that our promissory notes on behalf of students are 'worthless'. We are unaware of any 'other debts in the United Kingdom' which remain unsettled. Jaini Abdullah, first secretary, High Commission of Brunei Darussalam, 19 Belgrave Square, London SW1X 8PG</p>

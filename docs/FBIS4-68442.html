			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report on statements made by First Vice Premier Oleg </F> Soskovets at collegium meeting with the directors of metallurgy  enterprises: "`It Is Difficult for Everyone--In Different  Ways...'"]    [Text] After the resignation of Ye. Gaydar and B.  Fedorov, the mass media reported that the corps of directors had  come to power, that the government would carry out its will, and  consequently, that an end had been put to the reforms in Russia.  What was the basis for such conclusions? It would be better to  make a judgment on industrial policy based on the actual  relationships between the government and enterprise directors,  not on the basis of theoretical arguments. In this connection,  their meeting in an expanded collegium of the Russian Federation  Committee on Metallurgy was significant. The directors of the  basic sector of domestic industry--metallurgy--and a number of  government officials headed by First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets  held a dialogue which did not conform to what has been described  by our SMI [mass media], let us say frankly. The directors did  not speak as the opponents of reforms. The government was in no  hurry to compliment "the generals of industry." This was a  meeting of pragmatists, first of all.    Essentially all the problems facing the Russian economy are  concentrated in enterprises of the country's metallurgical  complex, because they are the ones who have incurred the largest  expenditures for energy consumption, locked in all the country's  mining and 25 percent of the coal industry, and taken over a  substantial part of the output of the machinebuilding complex  and the electrical engineering industry, and so forth. These  problems must be resolved, because without the metallurgical  industry, the Russian economy cannot be reformed any further:  metallurgy is the foundation on which all industry stands.    The country's basic and most important sector is in crisis  today, and no matter how painful its manifestations are,  searching for those at fault for this situation in the central  departments in Moscow is unlikely to be correct. And not only  because metallurgy is always the focus of close attention by the  government (it is sufficient to remember that the government  examined stabilization of the work of a number of subsectors of  the metallurgical complex on several occasions last year), but  primarily because today metallurgical enterprises are  independent subjects of economic activity and subjects of the  market. And they should operate independently. But it seems to  me that many metallurgical enterprise managers have not realized  this fact yet, and have not completely adapted themselves to  conditions in an economy which is being reformed.    There are reasons for this. Centralization in industry,  for which ministries were used as a tool in the USSR, was  probably most apparent in enterprises subordinate to the  Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy and Ministry of Nonferrous  Metallurgy. Let us remember how the ministers "trained" the  directors in selective conferences. The commands are still fresh  in most of their minds: "Stop production--give the converted  metal back to the cooperatives... Discontinue domestic  deliveries--set aside so many metric tons for export, so many  for the Ministry of Defense..." We were trained to work by  command and in accordance with volume indicators, and although 2  or 3 years ago we were studying the work of foreign firms and  invited the presidents of concerns and representatives of  joint-stock companies who have been working under market  conditions all their lives, we have not been able to develop  anything similar to their system of management.    We denationalized property and formed shareholding  enterprises, and we essentially limited ourselves to this. After  acquiring a basis for independent economic operation, we began  setting prices ourselves. Transport workers set rates which,  from their point of view, were the best possible to maintain the  sector. Can the prices for energy resources be called abnormal  if the power engineers set them freely, guided by the very  specific situation in which they found themselves? Ask any  manager in the Ministry of Fuel and Energy about this, and he  will say that all the prices for electric power announced for  consumers through the RAO [Russian Joint-Stock Company] "YeES  Rossiya" are based on the cost of the metal, coal, and so on.  But as a result we arrived at a situation in which no one can do  anything: everyone owes each other. Who has to set up a system  for payments between enterprises, in accordance with laws  drafted by the government, of course? The Ministry of Finance?  Of course not. Who has to ensure that the banks, whose founders  are engaged in economic operations, provide for effective  demand? The government? Also no. We have to say frankly that a  management system has not been created in metallurgy.    A Committee on Metallurgy has been established, and it  performs a great deal of useful work in shaping government  policy with respect to the sector, but metallurgists have not  been able to come to agreement among themselves. Beginning with  the mining enterprises, through all the production conversions  right down to the fourth process stage, there are absolutely no  financial relationships--those relationships which can establish  and maintain the necessary production ties in any  situation--among the subjects engaged in economic operations. A  management system is able to identify the common interests of  enterprises and unify them, not in accordance with a formal  characteristic, but because of their economic, financial, and  property linkage. It is precisely this link which is traced in  the classical structure of any Western concern associated with  metallurgy, whether it is a technological or multisectorial  association. It is precisely this link which creates additional  interest for the producer and is the stimulus for production.  Until we establish it, it is very difficult to speak about  stopping the manifestations of the crisis at some stage.    We are now attempting to unite the interests of miners and  metallurgists, miners and transport workers, aluminum producers  and power engineers, and we are speaking about cartel  agreements, which may be only natural for economic subjects in  the current stage from the viewpoint of tariffs, and on the  other hand, from the viewpoint of prices for finished products.  But this kind of agreement remains on paper if its participants  make a stand for their narrow interests and are oriented not  toward the final ton on which each one's profit is calculated,  not toward the production cycle as a whole and all the  processing stages, right up to completion of the end product,  but only toward the stage associated with their direct activity.  Civilized approaches to relationships between economic subjects  are well-known in the world, and we have to develop them as well  if we do not want to return to the old system, which should be  ruled out completely today. We must not go back to the command  system, but forward, toward a financial system of management.    Today we cannot pay for Kazakhstan coal for the  Magnitogorsk,  Nizhniy Tagil, and Orsk-Khalilovo combines, for chromium ore for  Chelyabinsk and Serov, and we cannot count on Ukrainian  enterprises... We should not think that we can get along without  that part of the raw material and production base which was left  with the near abroad after the collapse of the USSR, and that  Russia is in a position to restore everything that it lost.  According to our estimates, this would cost the country $12  billion. Will the taxpayer understand us if we ask him to pay  such a sum? Of course not. Based on professional knowledge of  technological production facilities and experience in personal  relationships, it is incumbent upon us to restore ties and  reactivate a unified metallurgicl complex, but only through  financial relationships, which should become the basis for the  system of metallurgy management which we have to create.    I am following how the situation in our economy is being  interpreted in the West. There they say the Central Bank is  chiefly at fault for the lack of the results needed in the  reform, because it supposedly is extending credit to state  enterprises. But this is not the case. We have to acknowledge  the complete absence of a state system for increasing investment  activity. Metallurgy, like a number of other sectors, was given  substantial benefits related to customs duties, export  operations, and currency deductions last year. But these  benefits did nothing to increase investment activity: because of  the crisis in effective demand, a substantial part of the funds  released were directed to the consumption fund.    Unfortunately, we do not hear the voice of enterprise  managers, and they have to raise questions about costs in the  government's work, credit and financial problems, and on both  tax and pricing problems, that is, on key questions where the  government has to work out the basic rules of the game in  accordance with which economic subjects should interact between  themselves and with the state. The most important subject for  our economic policy is the change of enterprises to  shareholding, which should produce definite results in the  activity of each economic subject; the urgent task of organizing  a banking system is extremely important as well.    The government can resolve all these matters only with the  help of our specialists. We will not find any others who know  domestic metallurgy and understand the problems facing it.</p>

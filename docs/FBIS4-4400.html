			<p>BFN     [Text] Fukui, March 30 KYODO -- Activists of the  international environmental organization Greenpeace arrived  Wednesday [30 March] aboard the patrol boat MV Greenpeace in  Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, to protest the start-up of Japan's  prototype fast breeder reactor Monju there.    During the 10-day port call at Tsuruga, Captain Arne  Sorensen  and 18 Greenpeace activists will inform local residents of the  dangers Monju poses for the environment in videos and a photo  exhibition on the boat, spokeswoman Etsuko Ikeda said.    The fast breeder operated by the governmental Power Reactor  and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. will soon reach what is  called "criticality," the stage when a nuclear chain reaction is  self-sustaining. Ikeda said Greenpeace estimates Monju will  reach criticality on April 8.    The reactor, which uses a mixture of highly toxic plutonium  and enriched uranium as fuel, will then produce 280,000  kilowatts of electricity.    In a recent report, Greenpeace warned that Monju "could  explode like an atomic bomb, killing thousands and contaminating  most population centers in Japan and neighboring countries."    Greenpeace also alleged that the Japanese Government is  withholding important data on the safety risk posed by Monju.  Noting that the original safety assessment for the fast breeder  was undertaken over 10 years ago, Greenpeace called for a new  safety review and a full environmental impact statement.    On its previous mission last October, the MV Greenpeace  monitored nuclear waste dumped into the Sea of Japan by Russia  and the former Soviet Union.</p>

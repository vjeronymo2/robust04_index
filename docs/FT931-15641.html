			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Budget 'split' played down DOWNING Street sought yesterday to dispel reports that Mr John Major was at odds with Mr Norman Lamont over the need for tax increases in the March Budget, Philip Stephens writes. But the prime minister's aides did nothing to damp speculation that Mr Major intends to take a leading role in deciding the shape of the eventual package. The judgment of cabinet colleagues is that Mr Major will be much more cautious than the chancellor about any measures that might abort economic recovery. The aides said Mr Major would have his first substantive discussion with the chancellor over the outlook for the economy and public borrowing tomorrow. Mr Lamont will report on the conclusions of the Treasury's Chevening weekend. Mr Major is likely to emphasise his concern that the budget should underpin industrial confidence and investment.</p>

This is the first visit to Switzerland by Qiao, chairman of  China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, at  the invitation of President Gert Haller of the National Council  of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland.    Qiao said in a written speech upon his arrival that China  and  Switzerland have had friendly contacts for a long time.  Switzerland is one of the first Western countries to have  recognized the People's Republic of China and established  diplomatic ties with Beijing.    China has always respected Switzerland's neutral position  and  attaches great importance to developing ties with this European  nation, he said.    Over the past few years, the Chinese leader added,  cooperation between the two countries has progressed smoothly in  the fields of politics, economy, science and technology as well  as culture.    "We are very pleased to note that the contacts and  cooperation between China's NPC and the National Council of  Switzerland's Federal Assembly have also been further  developed," he added.    Qiao, who is in Europe on a three-nation tour which will  also  take him to Austria, said the purpose of his current visit to  Switzerland is to acquaint himself with Switzerland's  parliamentary and government leaders as well as friends from all  walks of life here.    He also hoped to increase mutual understanding, deepen  friendship and expand cooperation through the current visit so  as to further push forward the friendly ties between the two  countries and the two parliaments.    Qiao and his party were greeted at the airport by Ricardo  Jagmetti, president of the Council of States of Switzerland,  Erwin Schurtenberger, Swiss ambassador to China, Xin Futan,  Chinese ambassador to Switzerland, and Jin Yongjian, Chinese  permanent representative to the U.N. office at Geneva.</p>

The latest confirmation of this is the news "double" just  seen in Japan -- YOMIURI SHIMBUN has informed the Japanese about  what Yeltsin intends to say in his message to parliament at the  end of the month, and KYODO has told them where Chernomyrdin  will be leading the country when he presents the new budget.    The Japanese agency got its hands on a copy of the speech  which Prime Minister Chernomyrdin is expected to deliver soon in  parliament. According to the document acquired by the Japanese,  the Russian head of government will announce a strengthening of  state control of the economy, prices, and the process of the  economic management of enterprises. At the same time  Chernomyrdin will declare his intention to continue the reforms,  but he will emphasize that, if need be, the state will intervene  actively in economic matters. Price control will be revived in  sectors where state enterprises dominate. This control is  expected to entail enterprises' signing price agreements on  government recommendations. Apart from that, enterprises will  be obliged to coordinate with the government the price levels  for their output, the level of wages, and ways in which the  profit obtained will be disposed of. This coordination will be  a basic condition for enterprises to receive state subsidies and  credits. As far as privatization is concerned, Chernomyrdin  will promise to continue it but will note that, when it leads to  increased prices, the need for a monopolized market will remain.    As the Japanese, now familiar with a document that has yet  to  be delivered, are observing, in general the premier's report  stresses that the reforms will continue, the planned economy is  not being revived, and what is intended is merely a question of  strengthening elements of state administrative control which, in  fact, are routine throughout the rest of the world. With the  help of these elements Chernomyrdin will promise to knock  inflation down to a level of 7-9 percent by the end of the year.    For the uninformed it is interesting to know that in his  future speech the Russian president will devote a whole  paragraph in the section on international policy to relations  with Japan. As YOMIURI reports, citing reliable sources close  to the president in Moscow, there are as many as five different  versions of this paragraph. All of them note that Russia and  Japan must develop mutual relations, particularly in the  economic sphere, basing themselves on agreements reached during  Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tokyo last year. The differences among  the five versions are small in principle and concern the  formulation of the most delicate question in bilateral relations  -- the territorial question. Moscow sources have revealed to  YOMIURI that in some versions the territorial question is not  mentioned at all, in others it is not mentioned "by name," while  in the most "specific" version it is designated as existing but  linked to Russian domestic difficulties. The sources stated in  addition that Russia cannot neglect relations with Japan but  that the president's speech will, as far as possible, give the  subject short shrift in order not to "upset nationalists at  home."    In short, Tokyo is already studying our leaders' upcoming  speeches while we here continue to follow Russian events through  foreign sources. News here is clearly fresher and more up to  date....</p>

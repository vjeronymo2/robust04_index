			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> IAN SMITH WINS JUDGMENT AGAINST ZIMBABWE REGIME  </P> <P> Former Rhodesian leader Ian Smith has emerged victorious from a legal battle  against the Zimbabwean government over his parliamentary salary.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court on Monday overturned a High Court ruling that had upheld the  refusal of the House of Assembly, the country's Parliament, to pay him his  salary for a five-month period in 1987 when he was suspended as a member. The  Parliament took the action against Smith for his comments in praise of South  Africa.  </P> <P> Chief Justice Enoch Dumutshena said in his 40-page judgment that the Speaker of  the Assembly had violated Smith's constitutional rights by suspending his  salary payments.  </P></p>

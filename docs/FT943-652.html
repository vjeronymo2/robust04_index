			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Baltic lifted to Pounds 3.95m Baltic, the specialist finance company, more than doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.58m to Pounds 3.95m for the six months to June 30. The results were boosted by Pounds 1.6m from the recovery of debts previously written off, lower costs associated with the strategy of moving away from the leasing business, and improvements in margins in non-recourse financing. Mr Peter Conroy, finance director, said the company was considering new sources of profits, including financial services, to replace the declining leasing portfolio. Turnover fell 12 per cent to Pounds 8.14m (Pounds 9.29m), although the decline on continuing operations was just 1 per cent, from Pounds 8.24m. Basic earnings per share increased from 1.6p to 8.6p; from 1.2p to 7.6p fully diluted. The dividend rises from 0.5p to 1p. Improved liquidity enabled Baltic to purchase 3.1m of its shares, resulting in Pounds 3.4m being returned to shareholders.</p>

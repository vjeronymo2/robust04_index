			<p>BFN     [Text] The Central Committee of the [dissident] Palestine  National Liberation Movement, Fatah, has stressed that the  Israeli military escalation against Lebanon falls within the  context of exerting pressure against Syria through Lebanon to  make it abandon its national and pan-Arab positions, which  reject secret and public agreements similar to the recent Cairo  agreement between 'Arafat and Rabin.    This emerged in a statement issued by the Central Committee  today. The statement reviews the threats, objectives, and  dimensions of the Israeli military escalation against Lebanon at  this time in particular and the Western world's silence about  it. The statement says: This escalation comes in continuation  of the attempts by Israel and the hostile forces to strike at  the forces that oppose the Gaza-Jericho agreement in order to  implement this agreement, pave the way for it, and market it  through the Palestinian gate to our Arab region.    The statement praises the heroism and steadfastness of the  national and Islamic resistance in Lebanon and warns our masses  against the dimensions and threats of the new Israeli military  escalation. It stresses that struggle will continue until the  occupied territories are liberated.    The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP]  also stressed that the Israeli attacks against Lebanon confirm  the weakness of the Gaza-Jericho agreement and the true  intentions of Israel's phony calls for peace with Lebanon and  the Arabs.    In a statement issued today on the anniversary of the 5 June  1967 Israeli aggression against the Arab nation, the DFLP says  it urges everyone to confront Israel's schemes and savage  aggression, in a manner that bolsters the march of the valiant  intifadah in the occupied territories and ensures the  implementation of the resolutions of international legitimacy,  which guarantee to the Palestinian people the right to liberate  their land, determine their own future, and establish their  independent state.</p>

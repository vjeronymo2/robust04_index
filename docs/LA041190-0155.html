			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW DECLINES 1.35 IN DAY OF QUIET TRADING  </P> <P> The stock market barely budged in a quiet session today as Wall Street drew  closer to a long holiday weekend.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 1.35 to 2,729.73.  </P> <P> Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances on the New York Stock Exchange,  with 725 up, 747 down and 492 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 141.08 million shares, against 136.02 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index lost .06 to 187.57.  </P> <P> In the credit markets, prices of long-term Treasury bonds rose slightly,  lowering their yields to the 8.56%-8.62% range.  </P> <P> That reversed an increase in rates Tuesday that occurred as a sale of 40-year  savings institution "bailout" bonds drew an unenthusiastic reception.  </P> <P> But analysts said traders were proceeding cautiously as they watched the first  corporate earnings reports for the January-March quarter come in.  </P> <P> The numbers are expected to be downbeat, for the most part, reflecting  persistent weakness in economic growth.  </P> <P> Bond prices rose in nervous early trading today, rebounding from Tuesday's  selloff that stemmed from disappointment over the government's auction of new  long-term bonds.  </P> <P> The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up at midday around 3/8 point, or  $3.75 per $1,000 face amount, after losing about $5 on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Its yield, which moves inversely to the price, fell to 8.54% from 8.59%  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Shorter-term Treasuries posted more modest price gains.  </P> <P> Analysts said the credit markets got a boost today from rumors that at least  two money center banks are having liquidity problems due to troubled real  estate loans.  </P></p>

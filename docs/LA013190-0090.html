			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LORENZO HINTS AT CONTINENTAL, EASTERN MERGER  </P> <P> Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air Corp., was reported Tuesday to have  strongly suggested that he intends to merge bankrupt Eastern Airlines into  Continental Airlines. Both carriers are Texas Air subsidiaries.  </P> <P> Lorenzo made his intentions known at a meeting with airline analysts for  securities firms. The gathering was closed to the press, and Lorenzo could not  be reached for comment afterwards.  </P> <P> "He all but implied that the two would be combined," said one analyst who asked  for anonymity. "He said it was clearly feasible and that it makes sense to do  it."  </P> <P> The analyst said Lorenzo "was very careful not to be definitive. This was all  in the context of a feasible plan."  </P> <P> Lorenzo was said to have described how the fleets of the two carriers are  compatible, and, in fact, airliners are already being moved back and forth  between the two airlines. Lorenzo also reportedly said the labor costs of  unionized Eastern and non-union Continental are comparable.  </P> <P> Another analyst who attended the luncheon said Lorenzo indicated that talks  about such a consolidation have taken place between Eastern and its creditors.  </P> <P> Eastern, which filed for protection from creditors last March under Chapter 11  of U.S. Bankruptcy Code, last week presented a reorganization plan that must be  approved by the creditors. The creditors are reported to be less than happy  about the plan since they are being offered only 10 cents on the dollar in cash  and another 70% of what they are owned during the next decade with no interest.  In return, Texas Air would transfer ownership of 40% of Eastern's stock to the  creditors.  </P> <P> If a merger of the two airlines were attempted before Eastern emerges from  bankruptcy, the creditors and the bankruptcy court in New York would also have  to give their approval. Spokesmen for the creditors could not be reached  Tuesday.  </P> <P> One analyst said Lorenzo did not make the comments concerning the merger in  answer to a question but brought up the subject himself at the start of his  talk.  </P> <P> Art Kent, a spokesman for Texas Air, said, "The discussions (with the analysts)  were meant to be private." However, he conceded, "The merger of the two  airlines is among the many options that have been considered, but no decision  has been made."  </P> <P> After a reporter sought comment on Lorenzo, Kent said he reached the chairman,  who told him that "he had not said anything about a merger that he had not said  in the past." Lorenzo had told Business Week magazine last week that such a  merger "is not a crazy idea."  </P> <P> Russ McGarry, a representative of the machinists union, which went on strike  against Eastern five days before the carrier filed for bankruptcy, said: "What  is the difference how we feel about (a merger). It is something we thought he  would do a long while back. It would come as no surprise."  </P> <P> Officials of the pilots and flight attendants, which honored the machinists'  picket lines until recently, could also not be reached.  </P> <P> Meshing Eastern's unionized workers with Continental's non-union work force  would undoubtedly draw opposition from Eastern's unions, but since they have no  contract with the carrier, it is believed that they would not be able to block  a merger.  </P></p>

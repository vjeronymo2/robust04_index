			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / German tax on litter cleared Germany's city councils will be able to levy taxes on fast-food chains as a means of reducing litter caused by wrapping, following a decision yesterday by the Federal Administrative Court in Berlin, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin. The court ruled in favour of the city of Kassel, which in 1992 imposed a 50 pfennig (20 pence) tax on each disposable item made from synthetic material. McDonalds and other fast-food outlets in Kassel had challenged the decision on the grounds that the federal government, not local councils, had sole right to raise taxation. The Kassel authorities, which have raised DM1m a year through the surcharge, wanted to reduce the city's 500m tonnes a year of rubbish.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Igor Yavlyanskiy report: "Will They Play the `Slav Woman's </F> Farewell' in Berlin?"]    [Text] Bonn -- Three Russian officers will become students  at the Bundeswehr Academy in Hamburg this year. And a German  colleague will be attending the General Staff Academy in Moscow.  Russian and German warships will soon be holding joint maneuvers  in the Baltic, and next year the first Russo-German command post  exercises will be held in Russia. This was stated at a Bonn  press conference by Grachev and Ruehe, heads of the Russian and  FRG military departments. The Russian defense minister also  announced that a department to retrain officers released to the  reserve as a result of cutbacks will open in Moscow at the end  of the month.    Pavel Grachev made a high assessment of the level of  relations between the two countries' military departments. He  stressed that it would be a good idea if other states (the hint  was clearly addressed to the Baltic republics) were to learn how  to organize the Russian troop withdrawal from their territories  in a civilized way.    One other as it were "ceremonial" issue is still under  discussion -- how to hold the farewell parade of Russian troops  in Berlin 3 August this year to mark the end of their withdrawal  from German territory. Certain Bonn politicians (Foreign  Minister Kinkel, for instance) are suggesting that the  expediency of holding this ceremony depends on the development  of the situation with the Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia  and Estonia. On this issue Grachev showed typically military  resolve -- whether there is a parade or not is up to Yeltsin and  Kohl, nobody else.    He was equally clear-cut in answering a question about the  future of the 81,000 tonnes of Russian munitions which, in the  German side's opinion, are liable to be left on German  territory: "You can quote me in your newspapers that all  munitions will have been withdrawn from the FRG to Russia by the  end of this May."</p>

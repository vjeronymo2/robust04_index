			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTERS AREN'T CURE-ALL, BUT THEY CAN DO SOME EDUCATIONAL TASKS BETTER THAN  TEACHER  </P> <P> Michael Schrage's tirade includes so much misinformation that the validity of  his conclusion was probably lost.  </P> <P> He accurately assessed the error of computer junkies' obsession with the  machines as education's panacea. The problem is exacerbated by the hype that  computer skills must be taught if the work force is to be "competitive in the  global, technologically driven economy." Computerphobia is the greatest  impediment of technology. But the generation born in the 1960s was the last to  have computerphobes in large numbers.  </P> <P> Though they are attractive to students, it will be years before machines with  the capability to interact comprehensively with students will be available at  reasonable costs. Beyond costs is the question of desirability.  </P> <P> I manage a computer lab and I believe that students should always be grouped at  computers, never interacting alone with the machine.  </P> <P> Computer labs are rarely given the extras that Schrage associates with them:  "teaching assistants, community volunteers, software company representatives  and bright-eyed graduate students." These extras are generally assigned to the  classrooms based on need determined by class size, teacher proficiency, etc.  </P> <P> Both Schrage's examples of technological failure are probably wrong. I believe  that language labs and calculators are successful, but often are incorrectly  applied (or not used at all in the case of calculators). I am a product of the  language lab, and I'm extremely comfortable with my knowledge of German as a  result. I wish more teachers had the foresight to see the freedom from tedium  calculators offer.  </P> <P> Using the SAT as a reference point indicates Schrage's misunderstanding of that  test. The SAT is not based on enduring standards of performance, but changes in  content depending on the scores on previous exams. It essentially gets tougher  as time goes on. To accommodate the "best" performers, it creates a larger gap  between the "best" and the rest of us.  </P> <P> Schrage states that computers "don't quite fit into the hurly-burly  interactions of a class filled with 25 children of different talents and  temperaments." Not true. They fit quite well -- even in classes of up to 40  children.  </P> <P> Great programs exist that teach basic skills such as writing and access vast  quantities of information in minimal time -- the primary consideration for the  use of the computer.  </P> <P> K.

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: IWC says output of wheat will recover WORLD WHEAT production could recover further from the poor levels of 1991-92 to reach 575m tonnes in 1993-94, the International Wheat Council said in its initial forecast for the coming year yesterday. While this is still well below 1990-91's 594m tonnes, it marks a steady advance from 544m tonnes in 1991-92 and 557m tonnes estimated for 1992-93. The IWC expects CAP reform in the EC and the Gatt talks to have limited impact on world production. The effect of EC reforms 'is likely to be limited in 1993-94, particularly since most small farms will not have to comply with set-aside provisions'. As for Gatt, further progress is necessary 'before meaningful reforms can be implemented'. Production improvements are likely to be concentrated in traditional importing countries, the council suggests. 'Import demand might therefore be expected to fall in some regions, notably in Africa, central and southern America, eastern Europe and parts of Asia, including India.' Therefore the council expects world trade in wheat to fall further in 1993-94 to between 98m and 100m tonnes from an estimated 104m tonnes this year. But it points out that this year has demonstrated the unpredictability of the grain trade, with imports lower than expected in China but higher in India and Brazil. Russia will continue to be a large importer, making the provision of credit facilities by exporting countries crucial. The CIS and developing countries account for about 85 per cent of the world wheat trade. 'The limited prospects for renewed global economic growth, and the continued high level of international debt of the world's poorest countries, will again inhibit effective import demand.'</p>

The  Majles met in open session yesterday and after approving the  general form of the budget for the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20  March 1995], it continued in the morning, afternoon, and  evening. At yesterday's Majles session, after approval of the  general form of the bill, the Majles debated oil, tax, and  allocated revenues, and a ceiling on foreign revenues of  $10,154,300,000 was approved. We direct your attention to the  detailed proceedings and legislation.  <H5>  Legislation </H5>   After approving the general form of the 1373 [21 March  1994-20 March 1995] budget bill, the Majles debated oil, tax,  and allocated revenues for government organizations, and the  recommendations from the deputies were studied.    The first revenue item was the ceiling on oil production and  the price of oil, which was approved by the deputies.    Based on that legislation, the Ministry of Petroleum is  required to issue a monthly report on crude oil production and  sales and the revenues obtained until export earnings of  $10,154,300,000 are achieved, along with projected oil exports  and production by month for the remainder of the year. This  report must be prepared by the 10th of each month and submitted  to the Plan and Budget Organization, the Central Bank of the  Islamic Republic of Iran, the Ministry of Economic and Financial  Affairs, and the Majles Oil, Plan and Budget, Economic and  Financial Affairs, Cooperatives and Foreign Policy Commissions.    It is worth mentioning that the rial[R] equivalent of the  above foreign revenues is R17,651,988,000,000, and this is the  ceiling proposed by the joint commission.    After the oil ceiling, the Majles made its decision about  Note 2, and its means paragraphs were discussed and approved.    Paragraph Z - If authorized, the competent authorities in  the  government companies mentioned in Note 6 of Article 105 of the  Direct Taxes Law may take the reserves given in Article 138 of  the Direct Taxes Law approved in Esfand 1366 [20 February- 9  March 1988] and its amendment for the stated profits for their  1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] performance for use in paying  unpaid taxes and the government's profit share up to the  equivalent of the amounts stipulated in Part 3 of this law, and  they may pay the funds to the Ministry of Economic and Financial  Affairs.

Second: This must not entail a reduction of the unpaid taxes  and the government's profit share given in Part 3 of this law,  and it is not to be used by the competent authorities in the  aforementioned companies to obtain tax revenues for the  nongovernment entities given in row 110,500 in Part 3 of this  law.    They may set reserves given in Article 138 of the Direct  Taxes Law approved in Esfand 1366 [20 February-19 March 1988]  and its amendment at a figure in excess of 30 percent of the  stated profits for the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994]  performance of the relevant company.    The government is required to set commercial profits on  goods  imported into the country at a level that will achieve at least  the amount of the revenues projected.  <H5>  Banking Facilities Ceiling, Paragraph T </H5>   The ceiling for banking facilities that can be issued by the  nation's banking system to the government, private and  cooperative sectors with regard to what is left at the end of  1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] is authorized only to the  extent that the change in their net debt to the banking system  increases to R7,000 billion. The government is required to set  the quota for each of the economic sectors in the framework of  the aforementioned ceiling and this will be conveyed by the  Central Bank to the national banking network, and 55 percent of  the increase in the ceiling on banking facilities for the year  1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] must be allocated exclusively  to the private sector.  <H5>  Paragraph Y </H5>   To realize the tax revenues projected in Parts 3 and 8 of  this law, the tax exemptions on the revenues for government  companies given in the sections that pertain to them, with the  exception of the exemptions given in the Direct Taxes Law  approved in Esfand 1366 [20 February-19 March 1988] and its  amendment pertaining to the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994]  performance of these companies, are without effect.

The open Majles session recessed at 1715, to resume at the  evening session.  <H5>  Mr. Akrami's Proposal on Oil Products </H5>   Concerning the import of oil products, Mr. Akrami, deputy  from Semnan, proposed that this be prohibited in the year 1373  [21 March 1994-20 March 1995]. Concerning his proposal, Akrami  said: We now have a revenue problem due to the drop in oil  prices. One revenue solution is to reduce our domestic  consumption. Economy must begin with the government itself. One  solution is substitution. That is, the Ministry of Petroleum  should convert its passenger automobiles to burn natural gas.  The other government organizations should voluntarily reduce  their consumption of oil products, petroleum and gasoil, and  this would also improve the environmental situation somewhat.    He then called for expansion of natural gas service in homes  and the like. He said: This would automatically replace kerosene  and the like. The minister of petroleum may say he has nothing  to say against it but it is impossible, but the task of the  Majles is to make policy and the government must implement it.    Continuing, he said: We must prepare a consumption model for  the government itself to follow. Nothing will be solved merely  by raising prices.    The government representative and the commission opposed Mr.  Akrami's proposal. The government representative Mr. Aqazadeh  said in opposition: This motion is not a policy, it is a  decision. If it is a policy to say that we must economize, then  we must find the way to do it. One way is rationing. According  to previous experience, this does not work. It creates fuel  shortages and a black market.    Then Mr. Akrami's proposal was put to a vote and was not  approved.  <H5>  Engineer Yahyavi's Proposal </H5>   In the debate about oil revenues Engineer Yahyavi proposed  an  increase of 40,000 barrels per day [bpd] for oil products and  said: In this regard I issued a guidelines memo to Mr. Ahmad  Nateq-Nuri that what the Plan and Budget Commission did was in  violation of the guidelines. Without the knowledge of the Oil  Commission they deducted 40,000 barrels from the figure for  domestic consumption and added it to the figure for exports to  increase the revenue ceiling the Plan and Budget and Oil  commissions had agreed to and which was to have been presented  to the Majles. They thereby added about $190 million to the  revenue ceiling.    He noted that the Ministry of Petroleum did not allow for  increased consumption in the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March  1995] over the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994]. He said:  If we reduce this ceiling by even 40,000 barrels, it will put  pressure on the deprived class. Gasoline and gasoil have  priority in oil product imports, and then if something is added  it is spent on kerosene imports, meaning that if we subtract  this 40,000 barrels it will come out of kerosene imports and  this will again be pressure on the low-income classes.  <H5>  Mr. 'Abdollahi's Proposal </H5>   Speaking in opposition to Engineer Yahyavi's proposal, Mr.  'Abdollahi said: The 13.8-foreign exchange figure the Majles  approved for the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] has  decreased to 12.4 for the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March  1995]. I wish we had accepted economic growth. In the Second  Five-Year Plan we reduced basic goods to $695 million from the  $1.35 billion figure in the First Five-Year Plan, due to the  fact that energy growth is very great and is disproportionate to  the growth in gross product. These are the instances we cite in  saying that we must reduce reduce oil products and consumption.    Continuing, he said: Despite this, we increased our  consumption figure from 1.34 million bpd to 1.5 million bpd,  which is 12 percent growth. This rate of consumption is twice  the world's per-capital consumption, three times the consumption  in Turkey and so forth. Where will it go?    Concerning Note 25, 'Abdollahi said: If we had set prices  justly and fairly five years ago we would be having better times  now, and if we do not make a decision today we will bring the  country up against more problems in the future.  <H5>  Ahmad Nateq-Nuri's Proposal </H5>   Speaking in agreement with Engineer Yahyavi's proposal,  Ahmad  Nateq-Nuri mentioned that import priority goes to gasoline after  gasoil and then to kerosene. He said: It appears that social  justice itself is the most oppressed thing of all. Anytime  someone has a problem he says it is because of social justice.  This is what we do. If you want to prevent consumption, first go  and fix your ministry, reduce government consumption. First  reduce the numbers of 6- and 8-cylinder automobiles in the  ministries.    Continuing, Ahmad Nateq-Nuri discussed the shortage of fuel  in various regions. he said: We are not opposed to reducing  consumption, but begin the consumption model with yourself. He  discussed the fact that the commission has thought in a onesided  way, and has used its power everywhere. For the sake of the  oppressed people, he asked the deputies to vote in favor of  Engineer Yahyavi's proposal.    Then the expert from the relevant commission discussed  Engineer Yahyavi's proposal. He said: The joint Plan and Budget  and Economic and Financial Affairs commissions made this  decision, not the Budget Commission, and it is unjust of the  esteemed brothers to deal in this way with this commission.    The nation's production capacity is no more than this and we  can produce no more than this. We must retain the reserved  portion. We voted on liquid gas exports and we voted on the  dollar unit for each barrel, and in general we arrived at the  figure Engineer Yahyavi mentioned in his talk. He then discussed  the issue of economy on the joint commission. He said:    Policies are like the policy to prevent waste and  dissipation. We should import the same amount we set last year  and save the 40,000 barrels, from which we will derive more  revenue for other projects, and that is what is to be gained  from these proposals. The figure of $190 million is deducted  from revenues, of which the rial equivalent is R332 billion.  That is, we must add add 33.3 billion tomans to these revenues  before you, which are about 215 billion tomans. This means we  must deduct more revenues from the country, and this proposal  comes from the petroleum brothers.  <H3>  Talks by the Minister of Petroleum and the Government's  Representative </H3>   The government representative mentioned the order of  priorities of gasoline, gasoil, and then kerosene. He said: The  nation's consumption is based on existing demand. The figure of  190,000 barrels was approved and we have now imported 100,000  more barrels of oil. Mr. Mirvalad is saying that we have done  this on paper and moved the figures, but this did not occur in  the projects in practice. If you reduce the figure this year,  next year's exports will be reduced and will be used for  domestic consumption unless you support the policy that we will  distribute only this much and any shortfall will either be  accepted or you will use rationing and ration coupons.    Continuing, he said: If the policy is one of no coupons and  no regulations, it will be based on society's demand and we will  not be able to do anything.    Continuing, he then said: If the price is not revised,  200,000 barrels will not be enough and we will have to go to a  ceiling of 300,000 barrels. The government wants to control the  growth of consumption with the prices it has set. He also added:  If we do not make a decision about prices, we will have to build  a refinery every year.    Then the commission's proposal was put to a vote and it was  not approved.  <H5>  Majles Notes </H5>   Yesterday during the debate and study of the budget bill  RESALAT's correspondent spoke with Mr. Salehi, deputy from Izeh.  He discussed the procedure for allocating budget credits to the  nation's various provinces. He said: One problem the Majles must  study and solve is the Plan and Budget Organization's failure to  plan properly. This organization's officials must think with  concern and in national terms and use study and care to identify  various potentials in the farthest parts of the country.    He said: For example, it is noted that of the 17 heavy  projects in one of the nation's infrastructure areas, seven were  implemented in the province of Esfahan alone, and the other 10  were implemented in the rest of the country.    Continuing, the deputy from Izeh said: A 700-bed hospital  owned by the Social Security Organization was completed and  began operating in less than two years in the province of  Esfahan, while construction on a comparable hospital in  Khuzestan began in the year 1354 [21 March 1975-20 March 1976]  and is still 30 percent incomplete, even though the number of  people served by the Social Security Organization in Khuzestan  is greater.    Mr. Salehi also added: There is a city in the province of  Khorasan, which has all resources and even an airport, but the  other cities do not have such resources, because due to  relationships based on personal taste, a large part of the  nation's national resources are concentrated in one place. What  answer do the Plan and Budget Organization's officials have for  these problems? The Majles must exercise greater care in this  regard and it must assess and control the numbers and figures  for expenses in the years since the revolution.    In conclusion he said: Recently a bill came to the Power  Commission seeking authorization to build a series of food  industries 50 km from Esfahan. This created such a negative  reaction among the deputies because of the unjust distribution  of resources that it was unanimously rejected. This shows that  enough care is not being exercised in distributing the budget.</p>

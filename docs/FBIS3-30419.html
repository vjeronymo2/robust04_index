			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The Chamber of Deputies has adopted the following  conclusions on Croatian foreign policy:    The Chamber of Deputies gives its support to the joint  declaration signed by the Republic of Croatia and the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia, as a political means for achieving  lasting peace.    The declaration is an important step toward mutual  recognition of the two sovereign countries, and also paves the  way for reaching a political solution and for unconditional  re-integration of the UN-protected areas into the Republic of  Croatia. The declaration will contribute toward normalizing  relations between the two states and toward general stability in  the whole of southeast Europe. An important step on the way is  explicit recognition of all the states in their legitimate  international borders.    The Chamber of Deputies called on Bosnian Muslims to  unconditionally and promptly halt attacks on Croat-populated  areas, in particular in central Bosnia. If they fail to do so,  the chamber believes that the government and the president of  the republic should examine the current state of diplomatic  relations between the Republic of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The deputies most strongly condemn all crimes and acts which  are in breach of international law on warfare and humanitarian  issues, and call on the president and government to do their  utmost in the diplomatic, political, humanitarian and all other  fields to guarantee the survival and normal life of Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    All sides in the conflict were called upon to persist in  their efforts to end the war through negotiation and political  means and to reach a just and lasting solution acceptable to all  three peoples.

			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: ** KEITH SWEAT, "I'LL GIVE ALL MY LOVE TO YOU," ELEKTRA.: ALBUMS  ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> Sweat's debut album "Make It Last Forever" caught fire largely because of  producer Teddy Riley, and his absence is strongly felt on this Sweat-produced  follow-up.  </P> <P> While he has a few good, funk-flavored ideas, his album is far from overflowing  with them. Sweat is strongest on "Just One of Them Thangs," a smoky jam that  teams him with Gerald Levert, a gutsy singer who nearly always endows a tune  with hot and sweaty intentions. Sweat stumbles on "Merry Go Round" and "I Knew  That You Were Cheatin'," where he works his plaintive, "please, baby, please"  approach way too hard. CONNIE JOHNSON  </P></p>

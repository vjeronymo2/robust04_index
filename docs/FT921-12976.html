			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: Bombardier buys controlling stake in de Havilland BOMBARDIER, the Montreal-based transport equipment maker, is expanding its airframe manufacturing business by buying a 51 per cent interest in loss-making de Havilland of Canada with assistance from the Canadian and Ontario governments. A new corporate entity, to be known as de Havilland Inc, is to purchase assets worth CDollars 260m (USDollars 224.10m) from Boeing of Seattle, which has owned de Havilland since 1986. Boeing will receive CDollars 70m in cash. The buyers will also assume liabilities of about CDollars 190m. The province of Ontario will have a 49 per cent equity stake in de Havilland, but Bombardier will have the right to acquire that interest after four years. Ontario and the federal government have also provided various other financial inducements. The two governments have been desperate to find a buyer for de Havilland since a bid by Aerospatiale of France and Italy's Alenia was blocked by the European Commission last September. The EC contended that the proposed takeover would have created a dominant player in the European commuter aircraft industry. The 63-year-old company has enormous symbolic value to Canada. Maker of such famous aircraft as the Tiger Moth, the Mosquito and the Twin Otter, it is one of only two airframe builders in Canada and one of the biggest industrial employers in the Toronto area. De Havilland's only remaining product is the twin-engined Dash-8. The de Havilland purchase marks Bombardier's fourth investment in an aircraft manufacturer. It already controls Short Bros of Belfast, the US business jet maker Learjet, and Canadair, the Montreal-based manufacturer of business jets and fire-fighting aircraft. Boeing put de Havilland on the block almost two years ago after losing patience with the company, which last made a profit in 1982. Although its products are widely respected, de Havilland has been bedevilled by high costs, low productivity and uncertainty over its future.</p>

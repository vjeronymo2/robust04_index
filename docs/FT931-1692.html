			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Fresh foods behind BSN advance BSN, the leading force in the French food industry, saw net profits before exceptional items rise by 5.6 per cent from FFr3.44bn in 1991 to FFr3.64bn (Dollars 633m) in 1992 thanks to a strong performance from its fresh food and mineral water interests. The group, a participant in last spring's bid battle for Perrier, also managed to increase sales from FFr66.07bn in 1991 to FFr70.84bn last year, despite the sluggish state of consumer spending. BSN was also affected in the final quarter of 1992 by the franc's strength after the September currency crisis. Morgan Stanley estimated that BSN's net profits would have risen by 9 per cent in 1992, without the negative effect of the currency crisis and Italian tax changes. Despite the competitive state of its markets BSN increased operating profits from FFr6.7bn in 1991 to FFr7.12bn in 1992. Operating profits from fresh foods rose from FFr2.08bn to FFr2.54bn over the period, beers from FFr806m to FFr899m and mineral waters from FFr719m to FFr908m. Earnings per share rose from FFr53.30 in 1991 to FFr55.60 in 1992. However, BSN raised FFr461m in 1991 from selling a champagne business, thereby making 1992's total net profits 6.7 per cent lower than the previous year.</p>

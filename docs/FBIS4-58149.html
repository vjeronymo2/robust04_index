			<p>BFN     [Text] London, Apr. 29, IRNA -- The British Government  appeared intent Friday in continuing its fresh smear campaign  against Iran with the prime minister's office saying it will  "maintain vigilance" despite Tehran's rejection of IRA links as  trumped up.    The Foreign Office also insisted that it was looking for a  rapid reponse from the Iranian charge d'affaires to London,  Gholam Reza Ansari, even though he has already "categorically  denied" the allegations.    The charge d'affaires said that claims of Iranian contacts  with the IRA in its campaign against British rule in Northern  Ireland were "totally unsubtantiated" and suspected "elements"  were at work to undermine diplomatic relations.    Ireland's prime minister, Albert Reynolds, is also sceptical  about the claim. He said Thursday [28 April] he was unaware of  any such link and "cannot accept any part of the allegations  until they are established."    The FINANCIAL TIMES in London suspected that the  allegations were connected to the U.S. campaign to isolate Iran  economically following the American Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's talks with the British foreign secretary, Douglas  Hurd, this week.    The charges, which have been accompanied by maximum  publicity  in the British press, are seen aimed at trying to embarrass  European countries, who have recently worked to reschedule  Iran's debt repayments.    The prime minister's office said Friday that it had informed  European Union countries, the U.S., Canada and Japan of the  fresh allegations and that their response was "supportive."    The timing follows several European countries building up  better relations with Iran, including Ireland, whose marine  minister, David Andrews has just returned from Tehran. The  FINANCIAL TIMES also saw the move putting pressure on Japan's  friendly ties.    A spokesman for the UK Foreign Office remained adamant  Friday  the government was still looking for a "very early response"  from Iran to "immediately and conclusively sever" ties with the  IRA. But he was unable to explain how this could be done when  Iran had already totally rejected the claim.    The suggestion was there was never any reply likely to  satisfy London's intentions of provoking a new diplomatic row,  with the media here implying that it could lead to sanctions or  expulsions, that have been so common in Britain's diplomatic  policy.    The UK's hostility towards Iran has lingered since the  Islamic revolution in 1979 causing London to lose out heavily in  trade relations that have been filled by its European rivals,  which unlike the UK, have been more pragmatic in improving ties  with the Islamic republic.</p>

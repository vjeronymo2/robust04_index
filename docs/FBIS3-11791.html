			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Francisco Mendoza from Tijuana, Baja California; </F> from the "ACIR Radio News" newscast]    [Text] The possibility that more than one person took part  in the attack against Luis Donaldo Colosio was strongly  suggested today by Jose Luis Perez Canchola, the Baja California  human rights attorney general, who was present when Mario Aburto  Martinez was interrogated for approximately two hours.    The local ZETA weekly magazine has reported that the FBI  believes that Aburto could be part of a left-wing political  group. The publication added that someone had shouted "kill  him!" just seconds before the first shot rang out. If this is  true, it confirms Perez Canchola's statements that another  person was in on the crime and was at the site of the  assassination.    The Attorney General's Office has confirmed that the DEA and  FBI are helping with the criminal investigation and have started  to check on several of Aburto's relatives in California. I will  now play the tape [previous word in English] with Perez  Canchola's statements. Here it is:    [Begin recording] [Perez] We were all present and heard this  man's statements [words indistinct] so calmly and with an  complete control of his nerves. He spoke with a firm voice when  he answered [words indistinct]. Furthermore, he was extremely  adamant in his refusal to answer most of the questions that were  asked.    Because of the gravity of this event, the strong supposition  has emerged that this was an act organized by more than one  person. It would have taken a very extraordinary person to  carry out this action single-handedly. It had to be carried out  by someone with a great deal of education and training, as he  himself has stated.    It is evident from his statements that he organized the act.  He bought a weapon with which, over a period of time, he  conducted target practice in a field -- a field he did not  identify in his testimony. He specifically told us that his  intention was to wound candidate Colosio to call the media's  attention to pacifism and to enable him to talk publicly about  pacifism. [words indistinct] his statements. He said that  after being pushed and in the process of [words indistinct].  You [reporters] were there and know what happened, right?    I must say that while giving general facts and other scant  details about this action, he answered with a great deal of  serenity. He was asked about the possibility of being part of a  group, and he was questioned on his preparations in carrying out  this action. He refused to reply to any of these questions.  [words indistinct] but he always refused to reply. He even  refused to sign the testimony documents.    I have to say that I only saw him appear nervous once. I  noticed this because I saw his eyes widen and look incredulously  at the person. This was when they informed him that candidate  Colosio had died. He started to mumble something, but he fell  silent and immediately resumed his position of refusing to  answer any question.    This is what I perceived about him. He is a young person, 23  years old, who has the apperance of a worker. He showed a great  deal of self-confidence during the entire time I was with him.  To have done what he did, it seems to me that any person would  show signs of anxiety, but he was extremely calm. I saw him  walk briskly from one office to another. It appears he prepared  himself psychologically for some time to do what he did.    [Unidentified reporter] Why do you think he acted like this?  Do you think he is aligned with an organization or that he acted  with a friend or was encouraged by someone else?    [Perez] I agreed to talk to you only about what I saw at the  meeting [words indistinct] the rest is speculation. I have only  dared think... [pauses] the magnitude of this criminal act and  his conduct have led me to believe that more than one person was  involved. [end recording]</p>

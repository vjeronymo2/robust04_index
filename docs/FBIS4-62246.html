			<p>BFN     [Text] Representatives of Crimean political and public  organizations continue to picket the Ukrainian Supreme Council  building in Kiev. Here is our correspondent, Igor Kulinichenko,  reporting from the site.    [Begin recording] [Kulinichenko] The picket near the Supreme  Council building is in progress. It is being conducted by  representatives of political organizations who came here from  the Crimea. I see slogans that read: Get Russian military bases  out of our Crimea! Cancel Crimean autonomy -- Threat to  Ukrainian statehood! Stop Mafia from seizing power in the  Crimea! We protest against sale of Sevastopol, a Ukrainian  naval base! Only Ukrainian laws and Constitution should govern  the Crimea! Protect Crimean Ukrainians against self-will of  Meshkov and his clique! -- and many other slogans. People are  really demanding these things. I am going to go over to one of  the protesters and ask him to introduce himself.    [Vlasenko] My name is Pavlo Vlasenko. I am deputy chairman  of  the All-Ukrainian Prosvita [Education] Society.    [Kulinichenko] First of all, what do you think we should do  to make all people in the Crimea, including Crimean Ukrainians,  happy about the policies pursued by the Crimean parliament and  the government of Yuriy Meshkov?    [Vlasenko] It is impossible to make everyone happy. We  should do what is warranted by international laws and Ukrainian  interests. That is what we should do. The Ukrainian people, who  have more rights to this than those who kick up a row. [sentence  as heard] We believe that first and foremost, one should bring  all of Crimean legislation in line with Ukrainian laws. Second,  we believe that the previous Supreme Council made a mistake when  it agreed to autonomy in the first place. It should be revoked.  Or, if it is not revoked, one should at least introduce  presidential rule in the Crimea. Because, given the present  situation, the government invited from Moscow by Meshkov is out  to completely rob Ukraine, through the Crimea. The methods of  governing which they are proposing, such as the watch method and  so on, humiliate us as Ukrainian citizens. Do we not have  intelligent people? Of course, we do. Why should Moscow rule  us? Foreign troops must be withdrawn. We consider Russian  troops to be foreign troops in the Crimea. They should be  pulled out immediately. The Black Sea Fleet issue must be  resolved. We consider Sevastopol a Ukrainian city. We are not  the only ones who think so. The principle of inviolability of  borders should be preserved and strengthened, first of all, by a  decision of the Ukrainian Supreme Council. [end recording]</p>

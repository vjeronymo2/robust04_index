			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Arts: Australian Ballet THE Australian Ballet's third programme is a triple bill which pays debts and makes an investment for the future. Two of the pieces - Ninette de Valois' Checkmate and Antony Tudor's Gala Performance - tell of formative influences behind the company itself. The national ballet which Dame Ninette established in Britain is the example that guided the making of Australia's troupe (which this season, more than ever before, speaks with an independent and assured voice). Peggy van Praagh, the founder of the Australian Ballet, was one of the group of 'Tudor dancers' which sustained that subtle creator in his London years, and it was she who first played the role of the French ballerina in his acid commentary upon stellar temperament. The third piece, Of Blessed Memory, is the work of a new talent arisen within the troupe - Stanton Welch, in his early twenties and son of two former stars of the company, Marilyn Jones and Garth Welch. Of Blessed Memory reveals an eager gift for movement. It concerns the child's debt to its mother, couched in plotless but emotionally specific terms. At the ballet's centre Mr Welch has cast his mother, radiant as we recall her from her days as the company's leading ballerina, and now discreetly and lovingly shown as life-giver and watchful presence. Around her the choreography surges along the melodic paths of Canteloube's Chants d'Auvergne (excellently sung by Joanna Cole). It is music that can be cloyingly sweet, and sweetly coy, and Mr Welch, for all his bright skill, cannot surmount every pitfall of his score. Because he is musically alert, he tends at moments to 'mickey-mouse' in matching step for note, and the most wincingly roguish song leads him into the shallows of cuteness - the number could with advantage be cut. But he writes fluently; steps and ideas pouring from him (many of them good), so that we know the sincerity of his inspiration and of his creative drive. He is rewarded with excellent performances from a large cast - notably from Miranda Coney, Steven Heathcote, Justine Summers, Nicole Rhodes, Campbell Mackenzie. There is handsome design - evocative of the outback - from Kristian Frederikson. The staging of Checkmate is scrupulous. The McKnight Kauffer designs have lost nothing of their theatrical power (or their Art Deco distinction). The choreography has been carefully set, and with what emotional clarity does the drama unfold: after all the years, all the performances, the inevitability of the black pieces' triumph still grips. The Australian cast was admirable in intention, and technically fine - Greg Horsman the Red Knight; Lisa Pavane the Black Queen - but oddly light in physical tone. De Valois' choreography needs weight - there is an earthy, folk-dance directness to some of the steps - and slightly less brisk tempi, that will allow movement and gesture to be more fully realised. About Gala Performance there are two schools of thought: Antony Tudor's, who conceived the piece as a satire, but not as a romp, and that of most interpreters, who see the piece as on occasion for unbridled romping with the satiric bite of Carry On Dancing. Three ballerinas (from Moscow, Milan and Paris) battle for precedence and applause at a gala. The more implacable their manoeuvres, the better the interpretation, and the truer to life: the annals of ballet gossip are rich in incidents no wilder or egomaniacal than those in this display of sacred monsters. The Australian production (with a set unnecessarily garish) has caught something of the right style. Lisa Pavane stalked the stage in icy majesty as the Milanese divinity, and Justine Miles was oh-so-deliciously Parisian, but Sian Stokes' Muscovite was a knock-about grotesque - and comedy is too serious a business to be made fun of. Gala Performance inevitably suffers in a large theatre - it was made for an intimate stage with intimate by-play. A sea-change into opera-house farce denies its humour, though it would be fun to see it danced by some of today's more awful stars, whose mannerisms are no less ludicrous than those Tudor first sent up in 1938. The Australian Ballet continues at the London Coliseum (071) 836 3161 with varied programming until July 18. Sponsors include Australian National Line and Qantas.</p>

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Spain's new generation seeks power: Conservative opposition leader Jose Maria Aznar CONSERVATIVE opposition leader, Mr Jose Maria Aznar, 39, dismisses Socialist Prime Minister Mr Felipe Gonzalez, 50 next month, as an old man. 'It is my generation's turn,' says Mr Aznar, who was re-elected leader of the opposition Partido Popular yesterday at its keynote national convention in Madrid on Friday. Months ago such remarks by the slightly built Mr Aznar, who will lead his party into elections before the year is out, prompted derision. It was unthinkable that the personable Mr Gonzalez, in power since 1982 and a European statesman of stature, could be challenged by the likes of him. But with the economy stagnant and the ruling Socialists buffeted by corruption scandals and divided internally, Spanish voters are less enthusiastic about Mr Gonzalez than they were. The latest opinion poll puts Mr Aznar's party just 3.5 points behind the Socialists, with 33.2 per cent of the vote against 36.7 per cent. In the 1989 elections, the PP trailed the Socialists by 14 points. Mr Aznar, who has led the PP since April 1990, says that the weekend's congress in Madrid will mark the 'transformation of the centre-right in Spain'. In less than three years the patriarchs of the Spanish right, most of whom shared uncomfortable Francoist backgrounds, have been pensioned off, and Mr Aznar runs the PP with a circle of loyalists in their 30s. Mr Aznar has jettisoned the paternalism and the liking for state intervention which marked the Franco period and which formed the basis of conservative thinking when democracy returned. Mr Aznar says the party has undergone an 'ideological renovation' and been brought round to market-driven economics. He believes Spain's centre-right has fashioned a modern programme for change and market-oriented policies will help pull the economy round. The 2,800 party delegates will this weekend endorse policy calling for deregulation and privatisation. Previous conservative electioneering was largely confined to calls for law and order and to warnings that national unity was threatened by separatists. The PP's emphasis on the economy and its pledges to reduce interest rates come as lay-offs and receiverships dominate the news. Mr Aznar, a tax inspector by profession, is also promising a tax freeze before an overhaul of the taxation system, with changes to capital gains tax and death duties among others. Once seen as the representatives of the old order and encased in nostalgia, the conservatives under Mr Aznar are bidding to take the banner of change and modernity from the Socialists. 'PP voters are mostly young, independent and urban dwellers,' says Mr Aznar. He charges that the Socialists are backed by the rural areas, by those with little access to information and by those dependent on the state such as pensioners, the unemployed and public-sector workers. 'The socialists cannot modernise Spain with that sort of constituency.' General elections are not likely until October, but Mr Aznar has been campaigning for months. 'With every trip I become more convinced that Spain is on the threshold of an important change. 'People are feeling very low and disillusioned, they are calling out for something different.'</p>

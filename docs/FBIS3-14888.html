			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Undated "Statement by the Ukrainian Presidential and </F> Cabinet of Ministers Press Service"]    [Text] During a meeting with representatives of the mass  media organized at the request of Radio "Liberty" and the  [German] magazine DER SPIEGEL, Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk, briefing the journalists on the political situation in  Ukraine in connection with the forthcoming elections to power  structures at all levels, said that he considered his  participation in the early presidential elections set for 26  June 1994 inexpedient.    President Leonid Kravchuk justified his idea by the  insufficient time for holding elections at all levels. It  cannot be ruled out that the process of election and formation  of supreme bodies of legislative and executive power may go  beyond the time assigned for it and may overlap the course of  early presidential elections and elections to local organs of  power. This may lead to a vacuum of power, when the old Supreme  Council is no more, a new one is not yet in existence, and  Ukraine's Supreme Council, which might take upon itself the  entire executive power, has not yet been formed. In this  situation, the president alone may actually fulfill state  functions. If he also participates in elections at that time,  executive structures may collapse and control may be totally  lost. This is the determining argument.    In view of the fact that the idea expressed in the  aforementioned interview is being ambiguously commented upon  both in Ukraine and abroad, the Ukrainian Presidential and  Cabinet of Ministers Press Service points out that the position  expressed by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk was due to  precisely that specific situation in the life of our society and  state that took shape today and to its possible development in  the near future.</p>

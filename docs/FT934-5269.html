			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (18): Picture this, Mr Keynes KEYNES FOR BEGINNERS by Peter Pugh and Chris Garratt Icon Books, Pounds 7.99 174 pages KEYNES is back. Recessions in Germany, Japan and across Europe, sluggish recoveries in the US and Britain and disillusionment with monetarist orthodoxy after the collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism have all helped restore faith in a 'Keynesian' response to recession. At the root of this revival is a renewed belief that government action is needed in order to revive depressed economies. But only Japan can be said to have taken a traditional Keynesian 'pump-priming' response. In the US, persisting fiscal difficulties combined with heavy private sector debts have meant that monetary policy has been the main weapon of counter-cyclical policy. What would Keynes himself have thought of this new-style activism? For the causal reader, going back to the often obscure and contradictory works of the great man himself is unlikely to provide an answer. Nor is the busy Business Books reader likely to have the time to wade through Lord Skidelsky's magnificent two-volume biography. Let me make a suggestion. For those who want a quick flavour of Keynes' writings, in historical context, with lots of pictures and who are not too worried about detailed scholarly interpretation, Keynes for Beginners is perfect. The book traces the history of Keynes' life and thought from his birth in 1883, through the first world war and Keynes' critique of the Versailles treaty, the return to the Gold Standard and depression of the inter-war years, the General Theory of 1936, the second world war and Keynes' role in establishing the Bretton Woods system, his death in 1946 and the rise and fall of post-war Keynesianism. What makes the book novel is its use of illustration and character. Each page contains just a paragraph of commentary, with the bulk of the analysis spoken through the mouths of Keynes himself plus a host of characters, ranging from Adam Smith and Karl Marx, through Adolf Hitler to Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. The illustrations are clever, often funny, but the text is serious and well researched. Particularly welcome is the contemporary commentary. A rueful John Major pops up regularly during Keynes denouncement of sterling's disastrous return to Gold in 1926 at a horribly overvalued rate and subsequent exit. 'Sounds like the European Community's exchange rate mechanism that we abandoned in 1992]' comments Major. 'I wonder what Keynes would have though of the ERM?' asks Norman Lamont. 'I give you one guess]' replies Keynes.</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LAMPOON TO GIVE 3 SEATS TO INVESTOR GROUP  </P> <P> National Lampoon Inc. announced Wednesday that it would give an upstart  investor group three seats on its board, plus a novel status in day-to-day  operations.  </P> <P> In addition, public documents disclosed, the agreement provides that  independent producers Daniel Grodnik and Tim Matheson might be hired to share  the office of the president under founder Matty Simmons, who also is chairman  of the publicly traded magazine and movie company.  </P> <P> If Grodnik and Matheson obtain those positions by March 15, the investor group  pledged not to put up another -- conceivably opposing -- slate of directors at  the next shareholders meeting.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview from New York, the producers said they intend to  invest new capital in the firm and explore an expansion in entertainment areas  beyond publishing and film and television production.  </P> <P> Grodnik and his partner in Grodnik/Matheson Co. had been negotiating with  Simmons since Dec. 27.  </P> <P> They went into the talks armed with the backing of holders of 21% of the  company's stock. The two were accompanied by their investment adviser, David  Batchelder, who had been strategist for Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens Jr. in  various corporate raids before setting up an investment banking firm in La  Jolla last year.  </P> <P> Their campaign was always meant as a friendly involvement, Grodnik and Matheson  insisted. Matheson added that "it never hurts to have 21% of the stock," and  they both chuckled.  </P> <P> To accommodate the new directors, the company's board is being expanded to  seven from four seats.  </P> <P> In response to the investor group's demand for a hand in day-to-day operations,  Simmons agreed to the creation of a new three-member "executive management  committee." Its three members -- Grodnik, Matheson and a Nebraska ally, Alan S.  Parsow -- will "make recommendations to the board of directors and officers  concerning the management of the company," the firm's announcement said.  </P> <P> According to a copy of the agreement filed by the investor group with the  Securities and Exchange Commission, the company is to open employment  negotiations with Grodnik and Matheson immediately.  </P></p>

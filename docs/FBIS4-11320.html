			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 24 Apr (PL) -- "The Nation and the  Emigrants" conference ended here today with a determination to  maintain close ties between the government and those living  abroad, regardless of the differences between the United States  and Cuba.    Jose Ramon Balaguer, a member of the Politburo of the  Communist Party of Cuba, reaffirmed the local government's  willingness to continue working toward the normalization of its  relations with the emigrant community, despite, he stressed, the  rivalry that has existed between Havana and Washington for the  last 35 years.    Balaguer led the closing session of the conference, which  began on 22 April in the capital city's convention center. The  conference was attended by 215 Cubans currently living in 29  countries around the world who responded to an invitation from  the Cuban Foreign Ministry.    The meeting was private. Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina announced yesterday several agreements as the  preliminary results of the conference. Vice President Carlos  Lage today announced that there is now a better understanding,  between Cubans living both on and off the island.    According to Miguel Alfonso, spokesperson for the  conference,  the five-year waiting perod required of Cubans who left the  island legally in order to be allowed to visit the country was  eliminated. It will no longer be mandatory for emigres visiting  their relatives in Cuba to make reservations at a hotel, either.  Other changes will allow Cubans and their children living  abroad to study on the island if they pay the established  tuition and fees. The study will look into the possibility of  publishing a magazine directed at Cuban emigres.    The emigrants also proposed the creation of an emigrant visa  and a more expeditious procedure for traveling to their country  of origin for humanitarian reasons.    From now on the Foreign Relations Ministry will have the new  task of coordinating the work of all Cuban institutions  regarding emigration in order to ensure a systematic, efficient,  and harmonious process.    In addition, Lage confirmed that the emigrants will not be  excluded from investing in the island, although he said the  specific details and types of investment will be discussed at  future meetings.    In addressing the plenum, the vice president of the Cuban  Council of State said that, in general, foreign investment  regulations will be applied in such cases as established by  current legislation.</p>

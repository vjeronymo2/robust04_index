			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Munich (DDP/ADN) -- Federal Chancellor Helmut  Kohl has warned Germany against going its own way in Europe and  the world. Faced with future security challenges, it will be in  Germany's interest in the 21st century to continue its policy of  Western ties and international integration, the chancellor said  today while accepting this year's Konrad Adenauer Prize from the  Germany Foundation in Munich. This also means that Germany  should not stand aside when tasks and operations aimed at  preserving and reestablishing peace in Europe and the world are  at issue.    Hence, the issue of the Bundeswehr's deployment is at the  heart of united Germany's future alliance and partnership  capability, Kohl added. Anyone opposing bloodshed should also  help prevent or end it. If Germany fails in this, then it is  "justifiably" losing international respect and its own dignity,  but also the confidence that it needs and on which it depends to  a greater extent than do other countries. "A people no longer  willing to work with its partners for peace and freedom has also  morally given up," the head of government said.    Kohl once again emphasized the significance of Europe's  political union for safeguarding peace. Nobody should believe  that the specter of nationalism in Europe is endemic only to the  Balkans. On the other hand, Germans should also resist the  temptation to despise patriotism just because that notion was  abused during the Nazi period. [passage omitted]</p>

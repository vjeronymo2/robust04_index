			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRISTMAS IN SRI LANKA  </P> <P> In this island nation, hot curries are what most Sri Lankans eat throughout the  year. But Christmas is different. That's when roast turkey with stuffing and  fruit-laden steamed puddings hit the table.  </P> <P> These dishes, accompanied by a salad, vegetables and dinner rolls, appear in  upper-middle-class homes, whether Christian or not (Sri Lanka is 70% Buddhist).  </P> <P> Turkeys are shipped in from the United States, but the pudding is English in  origin. The English, Sri Lanka's most recent Colonial rulers, bowed out in  1948. The Dutch and Portuguese, who preceded them, also added cakes and sweets  to the national larder.  </P> <P> Shanthi Casie Chetty, the daughter of a Sinhalese mother and father of Dutch  descent, teaches cooking in Colombo, the capital city. She's studied pastry  making in Switzerland and regularly gives a course in Western-style desserts.  Recently, she demonstrated the pudding during a pre-Christmas series of  classes.  </P> <P> Ceiling fans whirred overhead warding off Colombo's steamy heat as Casie Chetty  chopped fruits. It didn't seem to matter that Christmas pudding seems more  suitable to colder climes. With one end of the room open to the breezes, she  showed how to marinate the fruits in a mixture of brandy, sherry, vanilla, rose  flavoring and the spices that have drawn traders to the island for centuries.  </P> <P> Rather than using pre-ground spices, she lightly roasts cardamom seeds, whole  cloves, nutmeg and a cinnamon stick in a dry skillet and grinds them into a  powder. Along with raisins, currants and candied peel, the pudding includes  cashews, which are another important crop in Sri Lanka, and preserved ginger.  </P> <P> The fruits should marinate four to five days or even longer to enhance the  flavor. The marinating fruit can be stored at room temperature, and Casie  Chetty advised her students to stand the container in a pan of water to ward  off insects -- a precaution that is perhaps unnecessary in countries outside  the tropics.  </P> <P> If you want to duplicate Casie Chetty's work in Los Angeles, the only seasoning  that may be hard to find is rose flavoring. The best source for this is Indian  markets. Preserved ginger means ginger cut into chunks or slices and packed in  syrup, some of which is added to the pudding. This product is carried in  Chinese markets.  </P> <P> If possible, the pudding should be mixed and steamed well in advance to allow  the flavors to mellow, then resteamed before serving. Here is the recipe.  </P> <P> SHANTHI'S CHRISTMAS  </P> <P> PUDDING  </P> <P> 3/4 cup raisins  </P> <P> 3/4 cup golden raisins  </P> <P> 1/2 cup currants  </P> <P> 1/4 cup drained preserved ginger  </P> <P> 1/3 cup candied orange and lemon peels, chopped  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons brandy  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons Sherry  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon Mixed Spice Powder  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon rose flavoring  </P> <P> 5 to 6 drops almond extract  </P> <P> 1/4 pound butter  </P> <P> 1 cup sugar  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon grated lime zest  </P> <P> 3 egg yolks  </P> <P> 1 to 2 tablespoons milk  </P> <P> 2 cups soft 2 day-old bread crumbs, broken into small pieces  </P> <P> 1/2 cup cashews, chopped  </P> <P> Dash salt  </P> <P> 2 egg whites  </P> <P> Brandy Butter  </P> <P> Wash and pat dry raisins, golden raisins and currants and chop.

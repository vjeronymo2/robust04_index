			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHURCH FACES BIG BILL TO ERASE VANDALISM  </P> <P> Three sides of an Encinitas church remain defaced with red paint, and an  employee of a company that had been retained to do work at the church has been  arrested in connection with the vandalism, a sheriff's investigator said.  </P> <P> Detective Floyd Feese said William Damery, 19, of Spring Valley was arrested  Thursday after a footprint found in the paint was determined to match his.  Damery was booked into the County Jail in Vista on suspicion of felony  vandalism exceeding $5,000. He was released on bail that night, Feese said.  </P> <P> About 7:30 p.m. Feb. 17, Gus Pappas, president of the parish council,  discovered the paint on the outside walls and on the concrete path around the  incompleted St. Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Church.  </P> <P> "It was a shock," said the Rev. Theodore Phillips. "It brought us much sadness  to see something beautiful defaced, to see the house of God desecrated."  </P> <P> Repairs will probably begin next week at a cost of $25,000, and, because the  paint cannot be washed off, the stucco has to be reapplied, Pappas said.  </P> <P> Feese said he did not know whether the vandalism was an act of revenge or a  crime of hate.  </P> <P> There was a dispute concerning the amount of money the church agreed to pay the  company for which Damery worked, Feese said. Feese said that W. E. Walters, a  Lemon Grove painting contractor, estimated that it would take three to five  days to apply water sealant to the church, and that church leaders agreed to  pay $13,000. But, because the job took only a day and a half, the church  council wanted to pay only $11,000.  </P> <P> However, Pappas called it a "typical contract dispute" that was resolved. He  declined to comment further. He said he only mentioned the disagreement to the  detective because he asked.  </P> <P> "It came up because I knew that whoever did the vandalizing had to be someone  who knew about paint and who had access to paint," Pappas said.  </P> <P> Feese said that whoever vandalized the church used a power-sprayer during a  heavy rainfall between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. Feb. 17, when visibility was minimal.  </P> <P> Situated just east of Interstate 5 on Manchester Avenue, the church's golden  dome displays an unplanned image of a shining cross to passing motorists.  </P> <P> Physicists have been asked to study the appearance, Pappas said, adding that  they suspect it is caused by the sunlight reflecting off the curvature of the  dome.  </P></p>

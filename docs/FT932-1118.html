			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Beijing fears grow over runaway economy: Inflationary spiral and political dislocation are starting to hurt CHINA'S official press continues to trumpet economic gains, giving front page treatment to glowing testimonials such as yesterday's People's Daily report which hailed the 'surging' economy. But at another level, officials are making little secret of their deepening concern at the government's apparent inability to slow what some are likening to a runaway train. Worries are also growing about the political costs of an overheating economy, accompanied by spiralling inflation. China's boom, while it is bringing a better life to millions, is also tending to emphasise differences between rich and poor, country and city. Peasant unrest fuelled by heightened dissatisfaction over a widening gulf between rural and urban incomes is not the least of the government's problems at present. Fear of increasing militancy among China's 900m rural dwellers has prompted a hasty re-think of economic priorities, leading to an easing of the financial burden on hard-pressed farmers. Measures adopted thus far to restrain the macro-economy, including credit curbs, interest rate increases and a clamp on capital spending appear to be having limited impact in the face of the economic momentum generated in the past year since paramount leader Deng Xiaoping opened the doors wider to investment, urging his countrymen to 'seize the moment'. Chinese economists and western officials say that unless evidence emerges soon of the economy slowing, and perhaps more important, of inflation abating, then more decisive steps will be required. Apart from a further tightening of credit and increases in interest rates, the authorities may be obliged to consider administrative steps such as import curbs they have fore-sworn thus far. Mr Wu Mingyu, a senior economic adviser to the State Council, China's cabinet, believes that while the government is on the right track in pushing ahead vigorously and courageously with market reforms, steps to cool the economy such as interest rate increases were 'too little, too late.' The government's economic advisers were urging such measures three to four months earlier, he revealed, but this advice was not heeded. Among factors that delayed earlier action was the convening of the National People's Congress, or parliament, in March this year, that endorsed speedier economic reform. Officials reportedly did not wish to convey negative signals about the pace of reform on the eve of this important event. Lingering concerns over appearing to contradict Mr Deng's calls for a growth spurt may also have been a factor in delaying action longer than desirable. China's senior leader has reportedly come round to the view recently that the economy needs to be calmed; but the leadership itself is far from united on the steps required, with divisions between conservatives advocating more decisive measures and reformists, anxious that care be taken lest clumsy intervention might derail the reform process altogether. Beijing is awash with reports that the leadership will soon convene a party plenum to debate economic reform and more specifically how to manage the economic boom. If such a gathering materialises its main task would probably be to forge a consensus out of present differences. Mr Deng's failing health and an intensification of manoeuvring among leadership contenders is adding to uncertainties. With each succeeding day more evidence accumulates that China's economy is continuing to defy relatively puny official efforts to restrain it. The International Monetary Fund acknowledged this week that its forecast of 8.5 per cent would vastly understate China's growth this year in view of the fact that China's industrial output continued to accelerate in April and May. Output was up by by 24 per cent in the first five months of the year, compared with last year. China's State Planning Commission this week reported that the economy would grow by 13-14 per cent in the first six months of the year, compared with a rate of 12.8 per cent last year, and a forecast 9 per cent for the whole of this year. GNP growth in the first quarter exceeded 15 per cent. Among stark figures that underline difficulties facing the government are those that show that in spite of much talk about restraining capital spending, investment in fixed assets actually surged in May by Dollars 52.8bn (Pounds 35.2bn), equivalent to one third of the Dollars 150bn total for the first five months of this year. The government is also wrestling with a deteriorating trade balance, continued pressure on the depreciating yuan and inflation that reached an annualised 17 per cent in the first quarter in China's 35 larger cities, and which is almost certainly continuing its upward spiral in the absence of tougher measures to lessen demand. Government jitters over the economy are likely to intensify as the social costs of inflation bite harder. China's trade deficit stretched to Dollars 3.1bn in the first five months on imports of Dollars 33.3bn, an increase of 26.9 per cent over last year, against exports of Dollars 30.2bn, up just 8.2 per cent. The import binge is unlikely to be allowed to continue in spite of grand diplomatically inspired buying pledges that have more to do with China seeking to demonstrate its political value to a recession-plagued west than they do with the country's real financial circumstances. China's fast-depreciating yuan is an almost certain cause of nervousness in Beijing at present with no real sign that the local currency has reached a floor since it was allowed to float from June 1 at official swap centres, sliding about 25 per cent against the dollar on the first day, and slipping further since. In the absence of signs of a firm hand in control of the economy the currency will almost certainly continue to drift lower and nervousness among foreign investors will increase. Chinese officials face difficult decisions before they depart Beijing next month for their summer vacations. As a western economist said: 'They face a practical problem what to do: they fear that anything they do will result in a harder rather than a softer landing. But the longer they hold off, the harder the landing will be.'</p>

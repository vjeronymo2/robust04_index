			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading STRONG buying of stock index futures following the reduction of interest rates in several European countries ran out of steam leaving the futures contract to once again test the 2,900 resistance level, writes Joel Kibazo. The September contract on the FT-SE opened quietly at 2,901. Anticipation of a reduction in German Interest rates drove it gently forward on a squeeze and the cut in France only served to push it higher. However, the reduction in German rates just before lunch led to frantic buying of September. This boosted the contract to the day's best of 2,930, also helping pull the underlying market higher. But, with the long anticipated reduction out of the way, dealers chose to cash in on earlier gains. Together with the dull opening on Wall Street, the September contract went into retreat surrendering earlier gains. It finished at 2,902, down 15 on its previous close and around 2 points ahead of its estimated fair value premium to cash of around 11 points. Volume at the official close was 8,812, though that total improved in after hours business. Volume for traded options fell back to 23,886 against a previous total of 32,581 contracts. Some 4,640 was dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 2,177 in the Euro FT-SE 100 option. GEC was the busiest stock option with a day's total of 3,056 lots.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: IRI holding in SME will be 5% after sell-off IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company, will lower its stake in SME foods, the retailing and catering subsidiary, to 5 per cent from 62 per cent after the group's food production activities are sold in the coming weeks. IRI is in the closing stages of disposing of SME's Italgel (frozen foods) and Cirio, Bertolli, De Rica (canned foods and edible oils) activities. Buyers for the two operations may be revealed within the next month. The government's privatisation plans also envisage a sharp and speedy reduction in IRI's share in SME's remaining food retailing and catering operations. Retailing, conducted by the GS supermarkets chain, accounted for L2,509bn (Dollars 1.71bn) of SME's L5,814bn group sales in 1991, while the Autogrill catering unit had sales of L1,011bn. In a two-stage transaction, IRI plans to sell 32 per cent of its 62 per cent stake in the retailing and catering operations to a 'hard core' of shareholders, which will have around 5 per cent each. In line with Italy's new takeover code, the 'hard core' will then be obliged to launch a public tender offer for a further 32 per cent. IRI will then be able to offer its remaining shares to the 'hard core' under the offer. Any shares left in its hands above the 5 per cent level will be placed on the market, after giving SME's workforce special pre-election rights. The deal could be followed by a further sale of SME stock from the 'hard core'. Under the government's complex SME privatisation rules, the 'hard core', including IRI, will not be allowed to pool more than 50 per cent of its stock in a shareholders' pact. As the combined holding of the 'hard core' and IRI will amount to 69 per cent of the capital, it is possible the additional shares will also be sold.</p>

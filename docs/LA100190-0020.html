			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC;  </P> <P> BEHR CONDUCTS 'NIXON IN CHINA' AT PAVILION  </P> <P> "Nixon in China" is not much of a conductor's opera, but all those who have had  a turn with it have seemed able to impart a distinctive character. Certainly  Randall Behr did so Saturday evening, when the piece returned to the Dorothy  Chandler Pavilion after a 13-day layoff.  </P> <P> Behr, Music Center Opera's resident conductor, stressed the lyrical aspects of  the lush score, leading a suave, rounded performance that retained the clear  textures and vitality instilled by his predecessor in this run, Kent Nagano.  Behr also brought out the dance-based, vernacular rhythms, in a gracefully  swinging account that provided scope for explosive contrasts.  </P> <P> The reinforced Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra played with cohesive, stylish  aplomb for Behr, momentary lapses at the end of Act I and the beginning of the  ballet notwithstanding. This is a very persuasive orchestra for composer John  Adams -- its luminous "Shaker Loops" still glows in some memories -- and it  makes much of its manifold opportunities here.  </P> <P> Some amplification inconsistencies skewed balances for the voices, both the  established solo cast and the Music Center Opera Chorus, but otherwise the  performance retained its now-familiar vocal character.  </P> <P> A matinee Sunday is the final performance. JOHN HENKEN  </P></p>

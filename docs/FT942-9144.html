			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: IFC puts Dollars 15m into Latin America fund The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank, has invested Dollars 15m in a new Latin American corporate bond fund which it helped to set up. A number of US pension funds and European institutions have also put money into the Dublin-listed fund, bringing total investment to Dollars 80m, said Mr Marc Wenhammar, head of fixed-income at Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets, the advisers to the closed-end fund. Mr Wenhammar said that the fund's first gains would come from the higher income which the dollar-denominated bonds would provide but that its medium-term aim was to make capital gains from a reduction in yield spreads on the bonds. He said that it also wanted to take advantage of secondary market disparities. The fund was launched in April in the aftermath of a sell-off in emerging market bonds triggered by a tightening in US interest rates in February. Mr Wenhammar noted that yield spreads on Mexican corporate bonds had come close to 400 basis points over US Treasuries but that they had since narrowed to around 270 basis points. About 70 per cent of the fund has already been invested, with just under half going into Mexican corporate paper while Argentine and Brazilian debt account for 30 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. Mr Wenhammar said the fund's initial investments have been in liquid corporate issues but that at a later stage it hoped to buy convertible bonds.</p>

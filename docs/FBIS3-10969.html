			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Costa Rican economic developments monitored through  15 March.    In the past months, the Treasury Ministry has maintained an  aggressive policy in placing government bonds on the financial  market. The debt financed by bonds in 1993 was 33 percent higher  than in 1992. The high interest rates of the bonds have forced  banks to pay higher rates, therefore loan costs also increase.  This is bad for investment and production. (San Jose LA NACION  in Spanish 28 Feb 94 p 39A)    According to the treasury minister, although the fiscal  deficit reached 5 billion colones in January, at the end of the  year, it should not be higher than 25 billion, which represents  2 percent of the GDP. The rise in the January deficit was  because of reduced tax collection, increased salaries in the  public sector, and $7 million paid toward the Paris Club debt.

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / International Company News: A summer under wraps at BNP - Pebereau plots a course for privatisation AUGUST is traditionally a time for French executives to rest, but for Mr Michel Pebereau, the new chairman of Banque Nationale de Paris, it will be a demanding month when he must map out a new strategy for the bank in preparation for its privatisation next autumn. Mr Pebereau, who was brought into BNP two months ago by France's new centre-right government to replace the veteran Mr Rene Thomas, will in early September present his plans for the future of the traditional bastion of French banking - first to its staff and then the investment community. The scale of Mr Pebereau's challenge at BNP should not be underestimated. He has taken over at an extraordinarily sensitive time when BNP is not only poised for sale to the private sector, but is also badly bruised by the recession that has for the past year haunted France's banks. The new chairman does have the advantage of being an old hand at the privatisation game. He arrived at BNP after a decade at Credit Commercial de France, a smaller banking group which was privatised by the last centre-right government in 1987. Mr Pebereau impressed analysts and investors at CCF by creating a clearly defined niche for his group in the sprawling French banking scene. He focused on four areas of activity - retail banking, investment banking, asset management and private banking - and positioned it as the bank for wealthy private clients. He invested in an ambitious arts sponsorship programme and even commissioned Mr Sebastio Salgado, the celebrated Brazilian photographer, to work on last year's annual report. His task at BNP will be very different. Mr Pebereau has moved from a middle-sized bank which made net income of FFr7.9bn in 1992 to one of the biggest banks in Europe with net income of FFr39.92bn (Dollars 6.77bn). Moreover, BNP reported a reduction in net profits from FFr2.94bn in 1991 to FFr2.17bn in 1992 and recently warned of a further fall in the first half of 1993. BNP, in common with the other big French banks, has been affected by the sluggish state of the credit market and the steep increase in business failures, particularly among smaller companies. Ms Susan Sternglass, banking analyst at Goldman Sachs, is braced for a further fall in net profits this year to FFr1.1bn. At first glance, this does not look like an attractive privatisation prospect. However, Mr Pebereau does have consolation that BNP is not heavily exposed to large corporate loans, unlike Credit Lyonnais, the other big state bank. As a result, Ms Sternglass and other analysts are confident that, once the French economy recovers, BNP's problems should ease. 'This is a straightforward recovery story,' said Ms Sheila Garrard, banking analyst at Shearson Lehman. 'We should see an improvement next year with the real recovery coming through in 1995. In the meantime, Mr Pebereau will have a chance to show us what he can do.' One area where Mr Pebereau should be able to make an impact is in costs. BNP's costs represented 70.4 per cent of income last year, which is typical of the big French banks but higher than the German average of 65 per cent or the British of 55 per cent. French banks have traditionally shied away from rationalisation because stiff labour laws have made it so costly and complex to shed staff. Rationalisation is now slightly easier due to recent changes in legislation and BNP, like the other banks, has already announced a cost-cutting plan. Analysts suspect Mr Pebereau might accelerate that programme, possibly as part of a longer term effort to streamline BNP's organisational structure. On the strategic front, he has to consider what to do with the portfolio of industrial investments that BNP has built up in other state-controlled companies. Judging by his record at CCF, he is unlikely to follow Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, his counterpart at Credit Lyonnais, by beefing up BNP's industrial banking role. But most of the existing investments are long-term stakes which he may decide to keep. The other big issue is the future of BNP's relationship with Dresdner Bank of Germany. The two banks already collaborate in eastern Europe and have agreed terms for a share-swap of up to 10 per cent. Mr Pebereau must decide whether to extend the collaboration into other countries and how to structure BNP's operations outside France. 'Mr Pebereau was a great success at CCF and we have high hopes of him at BNP,' said one analyst. 'But BNP is much more complex than CCF and he has a bigger job to do. We'll really see what he is made of now.'</p>

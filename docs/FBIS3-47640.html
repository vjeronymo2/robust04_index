			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- Japanese Trade Minister  Hiroshi Kumagai ruled out Friday [14 January] a new round of  quadrilateral ministerial trade talks on market access under the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry, made  the remark in response to recent news reports that the United  States and the European Union (EU) have agreed to call for  ministerial talks among the four trading partners of Canada, the  EU, Japan and the U.S. next month.    "There is no possibility of a new round of talks since  negotiations have already been concluded," he said.    Working-level talks will be enough if they want to confirm  agreements reached under the GATT negotiations, he added.    Kumagai also said no ministerial talks are required for  Japan  and the U.S. at this stage to break an impasse in their talks on  a "framework" for bilateral trade.    U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor suggested both sides  hold high-level talks to straighten out differences.    The two parties should continue negotiations strenuously,  rather than setting the stage for higher-level talks, he said.</p>

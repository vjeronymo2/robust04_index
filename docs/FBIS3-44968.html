Li Tieying, member of the CPC Central  Political Bureau in charge of cultural affairs, fiercely  criticized some local officials who thought that "wealth would  not be increased without prostitution." At present, some  newspapers in Beijing have been strongly denouncing this opinion.    Reportedly, in Guangxi, from Nanning and Beihai to Qinzhou,  Fangcheng, and Dongxinng, people may find prostitutes  everywhere. They publicly solicited in the streets without any  scruples. The scenes startled tourists from other localities  and seriously affected their mood. A more surprising fact was  that some local officials regarded this as a "sign of prosperity  and opening," and held that "this would greatly improve the soft  environment for investment." Some local officials even more  boldly advocated the "new conception" that "wealth would not be  increased without prostitution." It seemed to them that setting  up a red-light district would be a "new way to get rich." In  fact, there already exist red-light districts without signboards  in some coastal cities.    Yin Dakui, vice minister of public health, was indignant at  such a "new conception." Recently, he pointed out that the  establishment of "red-light districts" would certainly lead to  the legalization of prostitution, and the appearance of licensed  prostitutes would not indicate the disappearance of unlicensed  prostitutes, which would just further increase. The  legalization of prostitution would bring about extensive  debauched and promiscuous conduct in society, and venereal  disease would spread to an out-of-control degree. The main  measure for controlling venereal disease is still to ban  prostitution. The idea of "legalizing sexual services" is  inadvisable and is unsuited to China's national conditions.    In the past, Li Tieying also issued an instruction, saying  that China's prestige was built up on the basis of national  prosperity and the people's wealth and on the basis of the  country's economic, scientific, and military strength. China  should rely on the stable and united environment to attract  foreign investment and to develop the tourist industry. It must  never rely on selling out national and personal dignity and  using vulgar interests to attract foreigners.    Recently, Liu Jiachen, vice president of the Supreme  People's  Court, strongly denounced, through the mass media, some local  and departmental leaders for "showing an indifferent attitude  toward" banning prostitution and "not taking effective measures"  for doing this. He said that they were afraid of affecting  external investment and local economic development if they  thoroughly banned prostitution. As a result, "they did not act  resolutely, and just turned a blind eye to prostitution  activities. This inevitably left prostitution unchecked or even  allow such activities to spread freely." Liu said: In some  localities, the authorities "only inspected prostitution and did  not actually ban it, because those who performed the duty of  inspection would gain benefits by imposing fines on prostitutes  and their visitors." As a popular saying goes, "detaining  prostitutes may increase income, and prostitute visitors may be  released." Liu revealed that "a small number of law enforcement  personnel are prostitute visitors themselves, and they did not  pay by using their official functions because prostitutes have  to seek their protection." He said: "Such ineffective  management was the key reason why prostitution could not be  effectively checked and banned."    The mainland official mass media also revealed that  according  to statistics kept by the information department of the Ministry  of Public Health, up to the end of 1992, registered patients  contracting venereal diseases numbered 836,835 people. The  incidence of venereal diseases increased from 0.00002 percent in  1981 to 0.01724 percent at the end of 1992. Up to the end of  November last year, AIDS patients and people infected by the  AIDS virus numbered 1,159 people, with 14 people being dead. In  addition, according to statistics by the Ministry of Public  Security, 201,000 prostitutes were found and detained in 1991;  and 242,000 prostitutes were found and detained in 1992. If 50  percent of the prostitutes contracted venereal diseases, then  more than 200,000 people were infected through this channel.</p>

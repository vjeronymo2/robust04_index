			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEGAL VIEW: OTHER APPROACHES TO LOWER COSTS  </P> <P> One of the ways to improve access to affordable legal services is to allow  licensed, independent paralegals to perform routine legal services in such  fields as landlord-tenant and bankruptcy. That was the subject of last week's  column. The State Bar Commission on Legal Technicians had recommended just such  an approach.  </P> <P> The commission made several other recommendations that could help make the law  more understandable to average folks. Here are some of them, with my comments.  </P> <P> * Increase the jurisdictional limit of small claims courts to $5,000. In  January of next year, the current ceiling of $2,000 will go to $2,500. There is  a bill pending before the legislature that would increase it to $5,000. Earlier  attempts to increase the limit to $5,000 were unsuccessful. Small Claims Court,  where you represent yourself without a lawyer, is an excellent way for people  to solve relatively minor disputes (minor, that is, when compared to the kinds  of cases heard in superior or municipal court). It simply isn't cost effective  for two sides to each pay a lawyer $500 to $1,500 to help resolve a case that  is only worth $4,200.  </P> <P> * Implement a courthouse information office (or else authorize court clerks) to  provide basic information about required forms and court procedures, similar to  the advisory service in small claims court. Court clerks are generally  reluctant to explain how to fill out a court document because of the  possibility that they will be accused of the unauthorized practice of law. In  San Francisco county last year, 60% of the petitioner's filings in family law  court were filed without a lawyer, according to the commission. Other counties  experience similar trends. For those who are unable or unwilling to pay for a  lawyer, some basic guidance through the courthouse thicket can only help  improve the administration of justice.  </P> <P> * Expand Neighborhood Justice Centers and other methods of alternative dispute  resolution. A great idea. Mediation is a way to help people resolve their  disputes in a less formal setting than courts, with less effort spent on  fact-finding and more emphasis on working together to find mutually  satisfactory solutions. The Neighborhood Justice Center in Santa Monica  (213-854-0122) was one of the first, and is open to all.  </P> <P> * Consider a requirement that service of an unlawful detainer complaint include  information on how to obtain responsible legal assistance. What this proposes,  translated into English, is that when your landlord slaps you with an eviction  lawsuit, you receive a piece of paper explaining how to find a lawyer to fight  the suit. That would be especially valuable to someone unfamiliar with the  legal system and lawyers, which is probably the case with most people who are  facing eviction proceedings. Maybe that sort of information sheet should  accompany the complaint in any kind of lawsuit.  </P> <P> There are plenty of other ideas kicking around to make the law more accessible,  but what makes these interesting is that they were all proposed by a commission  appointed by the State Bar of California.  </P> <P> They reflect the increasing recognition within the legal profession that  affordable legal services must be a top priority.  </P> <P> And they should be.  </P></p>

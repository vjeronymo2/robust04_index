			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic developments monitored through 15 June.    Ricardo Santa Cruz, manager of the Agricultural Commission  Association of Nontraditional Products, Gexpront, has said  broccoli and pea harvests contribute nearly $50 million in  revenues annually, an amount that represents nearly 30 percent  of local sales of nontraditional goods and 8.3 percent of the  total goods the country exports. The Gexpront official said  broccoli yields nearly 170 million pounds each year, of which 40  million tons are exported, resulting in revenues totaling $30  million. (Guatemala City SIGLO VEINTIUNO in Spanish 13 Jun 94 p  8)    Antonieta de Bonilla, acting president of the Bank of  Guatemala, Banguat, has said that nearly 1 billion quetzals have  entered the economy during the current year and that the process  had not adversely influenced the inflation rate. She said that  of that amount, 200 million quetzals were generated by open  market operations, a similar amount came from compulsory  investments, and another 200 million quetzals resulted from  public sector deposits in Banguat. According to the Banguat  official, the remaining 400 million quetzals have not negatively  impacted the economy because it is invested in short-term  investments. (Guatemala City SIGLO VEINTIUNO in Spanish 13 Jun  94 p 8)    Official sources disclosed today that the Guatemalan trade  balance during the first five months of the year recorded a  $268.8 million deficit. Banguat stated that up until 2 June,  trade balance exports had recorded $658.08 million in revenues  and imports had amounted to $924.9 million. According to the  Banguat Department of Economic Studies, the items that generated  the most revenues were coffee -- $166.4 million -- and sugar --  $95.33 million. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 0020 GMT 11 Jun 94)    Banguat has announced that total net international monetary  reserves had increased to $873 million during 6-11 June as  opposed to the $870 million recorded the previous week. Net  reserves had increased to $805 million as opposed to $801.2  recorded a week earlier. Regarding available currency, a $646.6  million increase in external liquidity had been recorded.  Banguat sources have disclosed, however, that during the first  week of June, the active interest rate (the rate applied to  weekly loans) increased by 2.81 percentage points and now stood  at 24.12 percent. Passive rates (rates applied to term  deposits) fell by 2.60 percentage points and now stand at 14.16  percent. (Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 11 Jun 94 p 60)    Official sources reported that Guatemalan banking system  interest rates had been cut 1.2 percent (for the active rate)  and 1.8 percent (for the passive rate) during the first quarter  of the year. Banguat stated in a document entitled "Evaluation  of the Monetary, Exchange, and Credit Policy" that the active  rate has been cut from 25.7 to 24.5 percent, while passive rates  had been cut from 13.7 to 11.9 percent. The Monetary Board,  which is responsible for fixing economic policies, has stated  one of its objectives during the current year is to cut market  interest rates so as to diminish the cost of funds, as well as  Banguat operation costs.

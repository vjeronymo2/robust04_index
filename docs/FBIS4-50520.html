			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Letter from Zhang Jun (1728 6511), staffer of the Chaoyang </F> County Supply and Marketing Cooperative--date not given]    [Text] Comrade editor:    The situation prevailing in the markets of means of  agricultural production this spring is severe. Investigation  and analysis data indicate that there are problems such as a  shortage of resources for the business and means of sale in  agricultural production, particular shortages in the business  and the sale of fertilizer; price hikes of these productive  means; and disorder in these markets. The means of agricultural  production are the essential factors of production. Success or  failure in running the business in this regard is directly  affecting the basic role of agriculture. In order to stabilize  the agricultural development and to protect peasants' interests,  it is imperative for us to consolidate the markets of means of  agricultural production and to conduct macro-economic control.    First, we should enhance the role of the business of means  in  agricultural production as the main channel of all sectors.  Over many years, supply and marketing cooperatives at all  levels have played an important role in ensuring the supply of  means of agricultural production, in safeguarding peasants'  interest, and in protecting agricultural production. After  having relaxed the restrictions on the business of means in  agricultural production, competitions in this regard have become  intensified because the state, collectives, and individuals have  joined in succession in the business. The decline of economic  results and the shortage of funds are adversely affecting the  capability of supply and marketing cooperatives in market  competition and in purchasing, selling, and storing the  commodities of these productive means. However, the  self-employed businessmen in this area who join in the  transaction in the busy season and quit their business in the  slack season, have jostled the normal operation of markets in  this regard. They have made the departments in charge of  supplying the means of agricultural production unable to  estimate market capacity and demands, severely emphasized the  role of supply and marketing cooperatives in being the main  channel of all economic sectors, and imposed a shadow on the  feeling of the broad masses of peasants.    Second, we should consolidate the chaotic order in the  markets of means of agricultural production. A number of  falsified and sub-standard means of agricultural production have  flooded in the markets due to increasingly intensified market  competition and interference caused by abnormal competition.  All of these have brought harm to peasants, hindered  agricultural production, led to a chaotic order in the business  of means of agricultural production and in the prices and  quality of these productive means, and severely damaged the  interests of peasants. Departments in charge of enforcing the  law at all levels should resolutely check the business without a  license and strictly handle the cases of illegal purchase and  sales and the cases committed by those who are marketing the  falsified and sub-standard commodities in this regard. At the  same time, supply and marketing cooperative at all levels should  enhance the organization of goods sources; engage in legal  operation; keep the commodity prices stable; vigorously  stabilize the markets of means of agricultural production; and  meet the demands of agricultural production.    Third, we should promote the establishment of a service  network for the supply of means to agricultural production. The  chaotic markets of means of agricultural production have enabled  the business and sale of fertilizer to go out of control and  will undoubtedly lead to a loss of guarantee in supplies that  adversely affect production. The business of means of  agricultural production is strongly seasonal and these  productive means can enjoy brisk sales as soon as the busy  season comes. In order to enhance the capability of readjusting  and controlling the markets of means of agricultural production,  we should reconsider the main channel role played by the supply  and marketing cooperatives and provide preferential policies for  the supply of business and marketing cooperatives. At the same  time, these cooperatives should continuously deepen the reform  in the operation and management of their business in this  regard. They should also regard companies dealing in the means  of agricultural production as a firm leader and the grass-roots  cooperatives in rural areas as support, bring into play the  strong points of mass communities, broaden the network and  centers of purchase and sales, and actively promote the  popularization of the service network for supplying and  marketing these agricultural productive means.</p>

			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINCHELL'S SAYS BOARD MAY SELL 'DONUT HOUSES'  </P> <P> Winchell's Donut Houses, which has been struggling to boost sales and profits,  said Thursday that it might put itself up for sale.  </P> <P> The news was met with enthusiasm on Wall Street. The La Mirada-based company,  which is organized as a limited partnership, posted the largest percentage gain  -- 27.2% -- on the New York Stock Exchange. Winchell's units, which are  comparable to shares, rose 75 cents to close at $3.50.  </P> <P> The announcement came one day after TW Services, which owns 42% of Winchell's,  agreed to be acquired by a New York investment firm in a deal valued at $1.65  billion. But executives said the potential sale of the 657-store doughnut chain  is not related to the TW takeover by Coniston Partners.  </P> <P> "Winchell's clearly is something that the company has had some difficulty  with," said Gus Oliver, a general partner with Coniston. "We certainly support  the selling of it. It's best disposed of."  </P> <P> TW also owns Denny's coffee shops and El Pollo Loco restaurants, both of which  Coniston has said it intends to keep.  </P> <P> In a brief statement, Winchell's said that a special committee of its board had  "been appointed to consider various methods of maximizing unit holder values,  including a possible sale of the partnership."  </P> <P> The market value of Winchell's, based on the closing price of its units  Thursday, is nearly $30 million.  </P> <P> Terrence J. Wallock, general counsel for Denny's and Winchell's, said the  decision was made to explore a potential sale after "we received a number of  unsolicited inquiries about the company."  </P> <P> Wallock would not identify any person or group.  </P> <P> "We definitely wouldn't be interested in buying the whole thing," said Richard  N. Hart, vice president of Boston-based Dunkin Donuts, the nation's largest  doughnut chain. Unlike Winchell's, whose stores are mostly company-owned,  Dunkin's nearly 1,800 stores are almost all operated by franchisees.  </P> <P> "With their (low) volumes and their difficulty in attracting quality managers,  we think the franchise route is much better than running company-owned  outlets," Hart said.  </P> <P> Winchell's has been beset with financial and legal problems since it was spun  off from Denny's about 2 1/2-years ago. Denny's sold 58% of the doughnut chain  to the public for $90 million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rapid Drop in Value  </P> <P> But within months of the sale, Winchell's reported an $11.5-million loss for  1986. Winchell's shares, which initially traded at $18, sank to below $4 and  numerous shareholders filed lawsuits. The suits are still pending.  </P> <P> Industry officials also said Winchell's suffered from poor and unattentive  management. Under TW, stores began to remodel interiors and introduce new  products, such as muffins.  </P> <P> Yet problems remain. For the first three months of 1989, Winchell's lost $3.35  million on sales of $36.1 million.  </P> <P> Winchell's was founded in 1948 when Verne H. Winchell opened a single shop in  Temple City. In 1968, he sold the company to Denny's in exchange for stock and  became chairman of the chain. He has since left the company.  </P></p>

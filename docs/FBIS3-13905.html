			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Iraq is to take part in the 12th meeting of the OPEC  Ministerial Committee in charge of monitoring the world oil  market, scheduled to be held in Geneva next Friday. Oil  Minister Dr. Safa' Hadi Jawad made this announcement to the  Iraqi News Agency. He said that Iraq would participate in the  meeting out of its concern for the interests of oil-exporting  developing countries. He added that the OPEC Ministerial  Committee in charge of monitoring the oil market would discuss  the deteriorating situation in the world oil market, where the  average price for OPEC crude oil recently dropped to $13, an  extremely low level that has not been seen since the mid-  eighties. He pointed out that the current price is $8 less than  the minimum price that the OPEC approved in 1990.    The oil minister said that Iraq's absence for the past three  and a half years, resulting from the unjust and illegitimate  embargo, severely damaged the interests of oil-exporting  developing countries in general. These resolutions, he said,  excluded a very positive and influential force and an important  balancing factor from the world oil market, pointing out that  the drop in the current oil price on the world oil market and  that deteriorating oil revenues of the OPEC member states are  just two consequences of the unjust blockade imposed on Iraq.    The oil minister also said that Iraq, which is still  steadfast through its huge oil potential, its firm principled  positions, its belief in the need to protect the interests of  the oil-exporting developing countries, and its compliance with  the principles of OPEC, was and will continue to be an  influential force in the oil market and is looking forward to  playing its full role positively and efficiently after the  removal of the nightmare of the unjust blockade, which is being  imposed by the forces that are dissatisfied by Iraq's brave  positions and its confrontation of their monopolies.    He added that Iraq has drawn the attention of all parties  concerned in OPEC to the dangers of the deteriorating oil price  that will harm the producers because it will reduce crude oil  production and oil revenues. The consumer, he said, would also  sustain losses because of the possibility of a halt to its oil  revenues and of an imbalance in the oil market. He then  explained the sound Iraqi position, and said that the  oil-importing countries have begun to pursue certain polices to  raise oil prices for the ultimate consumer by imposing huge  taxes on consumption and using various pretexts to justify these  polices, including ways to protect the environment, limit the  rising global temperature, and impose energy and carbon taxes.    As a result, he added, oil has become a commodity and a  suitable tool to collect taxes and revenues for the treasuries  of consumer countries' governments. Meanwhile, he said, the  oil-exporting developing countries are suffering from a drop in  oil prices and from shrinking revenues, at a time when they are  more entitled than others to these revenues.</p>

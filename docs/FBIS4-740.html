			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jonathon Rees] </F>   [Text] Maseru April 15 SAPA -- Troops from the Royal  Defence Force occupied a stragtegic hill overlooking the Lesotho  capital of Maseru on Friday [15 April] morning, Information and  Broadcasting Permanent Secretary Seeiso Sarutla said. This was  apparently a bid to stop soldiers from the Makoanyane barracks  from coming into town.    It was soldiers from Makoanyane who held four cabinet  ministers hostage on Thursday after Deputy Prime Minister Sello  Metsi Baholo was shot dead in a bid by soldiers from a section  of Lesotho's Army to storm his house, Mr Sarutla said.    Automatic rifle fire was heard from the hill early Friday  morning, but Maseru was otherwise calm and residents appeared to  be going about normal business.    Prime Minister Itsu Mokhehle was scheduled to address  Lesotho's Parliament and Senate on Friday morning.    Mr Sarutla said Thursday's killing and kidnapping could be  an  attempt to separate the prime minister from his cabinet and so  render him ineffective. He said Lesotho's one year-old  government under the Basotho Congress Party was still looking  for clarity on long-standing pay demands from the military, but  was determined not to give soldiers any increases above those  received by other civil servants.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A Lesotho cabinet minister, who is in Gaborone on a  temporary sanctuary, says the present conflict in his country  came after a government announced a commission of inquiry into  the January faction fighting within the Lesotho Army.    In an interview with BOPA [Botswana Press Agency] today, Mr.  Monyane Moleleki, who is Lesotho's minister of natural  resources, said the Lesotho Government intended to have experts  from Botswana, South Africa, and Zimbabwe in that commission.  He said the terms of the inquiry had said that the Lesotho  Government was not going to be represented in the commission.  He said some opposition members had alleged that some cabinet  ministers were involved in the disturbances and demanded that  they resign. He said he does not understand why the present  disturbances took place just before the commission started its  work. Mr. Moleleki said the commission should have been allowed  to take place and establish who was involved in the January  fighting.    Mr. Moleleki said ministers could resign for moral and  political considerations, and not (?killed) by force by the army  if ever they had a hand in the disturbances.    He described the political situation in Lesotho as stable  but  volatile due to the murder of Lesotho's deputy prime minister,  Mr. Selometsi Baholo, and the abduction of four cabinet  ministers, including himself, last Thursday.    Mr. Moleleki said he intends going back to Lesotho very  soon.  He said after his abduction he and the other ministers were  kept at the army barracks for four days, but later handed over  to the police. He said once in custody, they were accused of the  disturbances that took place in January when there was factional  fighting within the Lesotho Defense Force. Mr. Moleleki said  the soldiers accused them, saying one of them had gone abroad to  recruit mercenaries to kill some members of the Lesotho Army.  He said Mr. Baholo was not in the country during the January  disturbances as he had gone to Belgium for medical reasons.    Meanwhile, the minister for foreign affairs, Dr. Gaositwe  Chiepe, has confirmed that she met Mr. Moleleki, but not the  three other ministers who are said to be in Botswana. Dr.  Chiepe said it is her hope that the ministers would go back to  Lesotho because they are not refugees. She said Botswana is  still consulting the Zimbabwean Government on the action to be  taken.</p>

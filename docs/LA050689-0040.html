			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> TWO JOCKEYS HOSPITALIZED FOLLOWING FOUR-HORSE SPILL AT HOLLYWOOD PARK  </P> <P> Two jockeys were hospitalized Friday following a four-horse spill near the end  of the sixth race at Hollywood Park.  </P> <P> Alex Solis, suffering possible head and neck injuries, was taken to Centinela  Hospital Medical Center and was to remain overnight for precautionary reasons,  a track spokesman said. Jockey Eddie Delahoussaye also was brought to the  hospital but left a short time later.  </P> <P> Baino Park, a 4-year-old ridden by Delahoussaye, was running second to eventual  winner Waterscape before appearing to snap her left foreleg just a few strides  from the finish. Delahoussaye was thrown from his mount, triggering the spill.  </P> <P> Solis and Valentine Wine were next to go down, followed by Chris McCarron and  Son Of One, then Henry Garcia and Singaroundtheworld. McCarron, who suffered  cuts on his nose and cheek, and Garcia, who bruised his forehead, walked away  from the accident.  </P> <P> Baino Park was humanely destroyed after being removed from the track by  ambulance.  </P> <P> Hollywood Park Medical Director Dr. Robert Kerlan said Solis, 25, was conscious  when he was placed on a stretcher and taken to the hospital by ambulance. There  was no sign of paralysis, Kerlan added.  </P></p>

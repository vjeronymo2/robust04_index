"We insist that the US Government apologize over the  involvement of its diplomatic staff in illegal-drug dealing,"  said the protesters, calling themselves the Salvation Front for  Indonesia's Youth Generation (FPGMI). They also accused the US  Government for influencing Indonesian youths with its  "destructive culture", being unfair towards the Islamic world  and forcing its interest on others.    "The inconsistencies of the US in upholding justice and  truth  are reflected in its double-standard policy toward Islamic  world," they claimed.    The demonstrators interspersed anti-American chants with  shoutings of "God is great" and sang a march. "US Embassy: We  sell xtc (ecstasy), narcotics and morphine", "USA satellite of  Zionism" and "Nato and USA are cowards, not heroes," said the  banner and poster totting crowd.    Two protesters then delivered a copy of their statement to  an  embassy staff, while the others peacefully and voluntarily  dispersed before the police could make any moves to end the  demonstration, which occurred in less than an hour. In the  statement, the demonstrators demanded that the US Government  honor and respect Indonesia's law and sovereignty by not abusing  their priviledges.    They also insisted that the US act honestly and fairly  towards the Islamic world as well as refrain from using trade  and economic issues for their own interests. [passage omitted]</p>

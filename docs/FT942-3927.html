			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Tory MPs call for cuts in spending Rightwing Tory MPs are calling on the prime minister to carry out sweeping reductions in public expenditure next year, saying that this is the only means by which the government can cut taxes and regain popularity before the next general election. As the Conservative party comes to terms with poor results in the European elections, Tory rightwingers are pressing the prime minister to cut public expenditure at once and set a strategy leading to tax reductions over the next two or three years. In 10 days' time the cabinet will hold its first discussion on this year's public spending round. The meeting will discuss in broad terms where departmental budgets could be cut, setting the tone for discussions on the issue right up to this winter's Budget. The Treasury has already said that last year's Budget saw significant cuts in expenditure, lopping about Pounds 15bn off spending over the three years to 1996. But some Tory backbenchers said yesterday the government must go a good deal further than this if it is to regain its tax-cutting credentials before the next election. Yesterday Mr John Townend, one of the most prominent Tory rightwingers, called on the prime minister to carry out drastic reductions in the number of people working in the civil service. He said: 'He has to cut the head count in the public sector.' Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, also signalled that, in the wake of the Euro-election defeat, tax cuts were now the key to Tory recovery. He said: 'I think over the next two or three years the opportunity of the chancellor of the Exchequer is much greater in terms of tax reductions.' Many rightwing Tories were yesterday also calling on Mr Major to carry out an extensive cabinet reshuffle, dropping Mr Douglas Hurd as foreign secretary and consolidating the more sceptical line on Europe that the prime minister has taken in recent weeks.</p>

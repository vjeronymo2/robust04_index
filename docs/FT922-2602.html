			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / S Africans take day off to back ANC campaign MILLIONS of South Africans will stay away from work today to mark the anniversary of the 1976 Soweto uprising and to observe the start of an African National Congress campaign of mass action aimed at breaking a deadlock in constitutional talks. The ANC believes that the government is stalling in negotiations at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the national negotiating forum, and that mass action is necessary to force it to quicken the process. Codesa failed last month to agree on the the details of a constitution-making body. Although this subject was yesterday returned to at Codesa, no breakthrough was expected until progress had been made in bilateral meetings between the government and the ANC. The mass action has been widely denounced by the ANC's political opponents, particularly the government.</p>

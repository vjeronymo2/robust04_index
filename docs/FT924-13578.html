			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / UK rate cut hopes fade THE Bank of England yesterday gave a strong hint that a further cut in UK interest rates was unlikely for several weeks. Dealers said the Bank indicated base rates would stay at 9 per cent this month when it offered to lend money to the market at established rates under a 26-day 'repurchase agreement'. Sterling lost two pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday, closing in London at DM2.50, after the Bundesbank's monthly report suggested Germany was unlikely to cut its official rates today. In late New York trading it was quoted at DM2.4952. UK shares eased on fading hopes of a quick rate cut, and the FT-SE 100 index closed 10 lower at 2,574.7.

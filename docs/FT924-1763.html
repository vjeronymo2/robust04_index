			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Iron ore producers face price cut threat GERMAN MILL agents have demanded a return to 1989 levels in the annual iron ore price talks that kicked off last week. The demand was made of the Brazilian miner Companhia Vale Rio Doce just before news broke of the application for creditor protection of the German steelmaker Klockner-Werke. The ore buyers are effectively saying they want the 1993 price of Brazil's Itabira fines grade, which has often provided the benchmark in previous iron ore 'mating seasons', to fall by as much as 16 per cent from this year's level. European steel companies have seen demand for their products fall steeply in the fourth quarter of this year - hence the recent calls for European Community intervention to restrict steel imports from eastern Europe. Many steelmakers in the EC have also announced deep cuts in their output this quarter. But the iron ore industry can be expected to resist the calls for a big price reduction for as long as possible. The first settlement in a mating season almost always sets the trend for most of the world's seaborne trade, which last year topped 390m tonnes. Last week also saw the opening of price talks in Tokyo between Australian miners and the Japanese mills. In the last couple of years CRA's Hamersley Iron has agreed the initial benchmark price for its fines in Japan. However, no prices were tabled by either side last week. Although Japan's steel mills have performed poorly so far this fiscal year their steel output in 1993-94 is expected to creep back over the 100m-tonne mark. Demand for iron ore in neighbouring countries such as South Korea and, especially, China is also expected to improve. In Europe the outlook for 1993 is less rosy, as evidenced by Klockner's troubles, and miners are concerned that this will colour price talks. Japanese buyers have little incentive to step into the talks as they know European mills are not going to withdraw their demand for a big price cut. With the consensus seeming to be that the final settlement will involve a fines price drop of about 10 per cent tomorrow's meeting between Brazil's CVRD and the German mills will be watched even more closely than usual.

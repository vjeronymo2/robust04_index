			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Management: Making the boss feel above par Only in California would you find a family therapist turned management consultant running his business on a sail boat and a golf course, and making a good profit during recession. J 'Mitch' Perry, president of the Perry Corporation based in Palo Alto, California, is a pioneer of soft consultancy. While British management consultancies are facing increased competition and lower profits, Perry expects to increase sales this year by a third. Soft consultancy uses unorthodox means to get across some of the woolier aspects of corporate strategy. The idea is that by combining management theory with some practice on the golf course, the ideas are more likely to stick. One of Perry's leading products is the Executive Cup, a lesson in teamwork. For two days and for Dollars 1,500 (Pounds 850) each, candidates are put in a classroom and taught how to perform well in a group. They are then cast off in sailboats on the San Francisco Bay to put the methodology into practice. 'There is an enormous difference between what people intellectualise in the classroom and what they actually do in a boat,' says Perry. At the end of the course each participant has to declare how they intend to adapt their behaviour, thus creating what Perry calls 'emotional sign up' to corporate objectives. Cynics might say this is simply a tax-efficient way of giving executives a good time. Yet Perry's clients, having thoroughly enjoyed themselves, swear it has been of real use to their companies. Sam Jones, president of the Product Exchange, a fresh produce dealer based in San Ramon, California, sent 50 of his workforce on the Executive Cup, at a total cost of Dollars 75,000. He claims that the programme transformed the whole mentality of his staff, 'It was a wonderful experience,' says Jones, 'It is no longer 'them' and 'us', but 'we', the Produce Exchange.' Another 'magic and substance' product offered by Perry is the Performance Classic. This three-day programme costs Dollars 2,500 per person and includes three mornings on one of California's most prestigious golf courses. This is not simply way of improving your handicap, says Perry: 'It is about you and your performance in all aspects of life - personal and business.' Jim Dobbins, president of Crestwood Hospitals, a nursing facility based in northern California, spent more than Dollars 100,000 with the JM Perry Corporation in 1991, more than he had ever spent before on consultancy and training. He attended the Performance Classic and says: 'I wanted to improve my game, but I came away with much more than that. I had a real good feeling for the principles of reacting rapidly to adversity that Mitch Perry taught.' Not all organisations are supportive of this kind of consultancy. 'Some companies are concerned about their image and say, 'People will think I'm having too much fun if I go sailing',' admits Perry. However, a surprisingly large number of US companies seem to view golfing, sailing, white water rafting and cross country skiing as legitimate ways of developing business skills. Even during a recession, companies including Amdahl, Citibank, NEC Technologies and Andersen Consulting have commissioned services from the JM Perry Corporation. IBM recently joined the ranks, signing a contract to send 85 employees on the Executive Cup. It is hard to see the idea working well in Britain: while many businessmen might relish the idea of three days' golfing on company expenses, their shareholders might take another view.</p>

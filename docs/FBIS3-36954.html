			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Plaksyuk from Lvov] </F>   [Text] Today in Lvov, a declaration was signed by members  of the Joint Polish-Ukrainian Commission for Border Cooperation.  Zamosc Vice Voivoda Bohdan Kowalko, leader and coordinator of  the commission, delivered a speech.    [Begin Kowalko recording, in Polish fading into Ukrainian  translation] The agreements which were signed demonstrate the  striving of the two parties to achieve better mutual  understanding and foster cooperation between two good, old  neighbors. All the participants in the negotiations could speak  out on the issue and could propose ways of resolving disputable  issues on a mutually advantageous basis. We have reached a  consensus on these issues, at least for the coming two years.  [end recording]    The declaration reads: The parties to the declaration find  it to be a stable form of cooperation between the local  Ukrainian and Polish administration of the border regions.  Cooperation on border issues should include the active  participation of representatives of these border regions in the  formulation of state policy in the sphere of border cooperation  and the promotion of cooperation between small and medium-sized  enterprises, between local and regional trade-industrial  chambers, etc. In addition, the 1994-95 program of work on the  Joint Polish-Ukrainian Commission for Border Cooperation was  drafted. Next, participants in the meeting issued a statement  in which they address the Polish and Ukrainian Governments and  hold out hopes for the rapid resolution of the issue of putting  the Khyrov-Kroscienko customs checkpoint into operation and the  speeding up of construction of an international railway and  motor vehicle checkpoint at Yagodin-Dorohusk. The operation of  these checkpoints will enable citizens of the bordering  mountainous regions [words indistinct] to develop bilateral  cooperation.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian 0900 GMT 23 February reports the  following situation in the republic:    "Powerful assaults by the chetnik and ustasha criminals on  the free Maglaj territory have been going on since 0730 [0630  GMT] this morning," Hajrudin Sermic, the correspondent from  Maglaj, reports. "In the southern sector of defense, the  chetnik and ustasha forces have been attempting a tank-infantry  breakthrough in the region of [words indistinct]; northward in  Plane, the chetniks are attacking from several directions.  Several hundred artillery shells have been fired, but the  knights of the 201st Brigade would not be taken by surprise.  They adamantly repelled the attack, although new waves of  attacks continue."    Civilian targets in the town and suburbs have also been  exposed to intensive destruction by scores of tank and howitzer  shells, as well as volley fire from mortar batteries. After  extensive preparations and concentration of manpower lasting  several days, a new, powerful offensive on Maglaj definitely  began this morning. The commander of the criminal chetnik army  Stankovic cries: "This is the beginning of the end for Maglaj  and Mt. Ozren." So Sermic concludes his dispatch.    "Sporadic but powerful shelling of the defense lines of the  free Brcko territory continues," reports Hamiz Deronjic, the  correspondent for that area. "The enemy directed the fiercest  mortar attacks yesterday and overnight at defenders' positions  in the central part of the front and on the Kladje-Djukici line.  A recoiless gun has opened fire on Djukici on several  occasions. The chetnik guns situated in Potocari pounded  central parts of Brcko's defense with [word indistinct] shells.  More overflights of the enemy helicopters have been registered  in the air corridor above Brcko over the last 24 hours."</p>

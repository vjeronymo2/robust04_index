			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / US backed Dollars 1bn Iraqi loan prior to invasion of Kuwait THE Bush Administration pushed through a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 568m) loan guarantee to Iraq for farm exports just 10 months before the invasion of Kuwait despite being presented with reports of widespread abuse of US funds by Baghdad at the time. The White House repeatedly dismissed objections by senior officials to its policy of using government-guaranteed credit as a means of maintaining good relations with Baghdad over this period. Baghdad's reported abuse of funds included: The use of some US government farm credits to procure militarily-useful purchases. Growing evidence that it was manipulating the US banking system illegally to fund its arms programme. Suggestions that it was demanding 'kickbacks', including armoured trucks, as part of the credit scheme. The debate over the issue came to a climax at a White House meeting on November 8, 1989 when senior officials from the Federal Reserve, US Treasury and Commerce Department all objected to the Dollars 1bn guarantee to back US farm exports to Iraq. The reasons cited, according to participants at the meeting, included the view that Iraq was no longer creditworthy - it was then in default on its Dollars 65bn of foreign debt - and that Baghdad had already admitted to the US that it had abused the same loan guarantee scheme. Opponents of the guarantee were also concerned at the political and financial fall-out from scandal surrounding the Atlanta, Georgia branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL). The branch had extended Dollars 3bn of unauthorised Iraqi loans used to finance Baghdad's weapons development programme. It is now the subject of congressional and criminal investigations. Mr Robert Kimmitt, the under-secretary of state, told the White House meeting that abruptly terminating the Dollars 1bn of loan guarantees for Iraq would be 'contrary to the president's intentions'. These were most effective way to improve relations with Iraq was through increased trade. The White House meeting approved the Dollars 1bn guaranteed agricultural credit, ignoring an Iraqi government admission to the US just weeks before that it had received what US officials described as kickbacks such as armoured trucks in connection with the same US government credit scheme. The abuse of the guaranteed food credit scheme - which is extended through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) - was confirmed by participants at the White House meeting and by documents obtained as part of a joint investigation by the Financial Times and ABC News/Nightline. The documents show that at a US-Iraqi bilateral meeting in Washington on October 5, 1989 Iraq 'admitted that it routinely received what it euphemistically called 'after sale service' such as armoured trucks from US commodity suppliers'. They go on to say this service 'might be construed as kickbacks which the USDA warned Iraq in 1988 were in violation in the CCC programme'. USDA has played down the size of the kickbacks and said evidence of abuse was inconclusive in late 1989. Half the dollars 1bn was dispersed to Baghdad. However, when Iraq's abuse of the CCC loan scheme was officially confirmed in a government report that was made public in April 1990 the remaining half was halted.</p>

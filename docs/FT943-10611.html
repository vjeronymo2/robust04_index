			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Fears of sanctions rebound - US telecoms companies' view of Japan market US telecommunications companies are jittery about the prospect of US sanctions against Japan. Long-standing and vocal supporters of their government's attempts to prise open lucrative Japanese markets, they are now nervous that sanctions could rebound by undermining hard-won footholds in Japan. According to Mr Bruce Moats, spokesman on federal government affairs at American Telephone and Telegraph, 'we don't want an environment of sanctions  -it could upset our customers (in Japan)'. The US, which has accused the Japanese government of discriminating against foreign companies in its government procurement of telecommunications and medical technology, will decide by the end of September whether to proceed with sanctions against Japanese imports. US companies said yesterday it was not yet clear whether the measures would take the form of higher tariffs or a refusal by the US government to buy Japanese products. They also did not know whether the equipment affected would include electronics as well as mainstream telecommunications technology. However Washington has argued that some form of action was justified by the failure of leading US telecoms companies such as AT&amp;T and Motorola to win market share in Japan. According to AT&amp;T, which firmly backs the government's attempts to open the markets, its Japanese sales of switching and transmission equipment and fibre optics were 'very small' in relation to its marketing efforts, when compared with results in other overseas markets. It said that NTT, the part-privatised Japanese telecoms carrier, which is AT&amp;T's main customer in Japan, gave it only a small slice of its annual procurement budget of some Dollars 6bn to Dollars 7bn, although it had managed to win additional orders from the new common carriers that compete with NTT on domestic long distance traffic. The possibility that this precarious business could be jeopardised by the US government's actions is a growing concern for AT&amp;T. Despite US companies' support for their government's strategy, they are aware that trade sanctions have a poor record in bringing about the desired change. Japanese companies themselves have been sanguine about the potential impact, while pointing out that the US has often resorted to tough language but has in practice been extremely cautious about deploying sanctions. Moreover, Japan's response to the tussle of the past few months suggests that it is becoming steadily less perturbed about the prospect of US retaliation than it has appeared during the long history of trade tension between them. Equivocal about whether such measures would succeed in opening up Japanese markets, US companies are also sceptical that sanctions would hurt their Japanese competitors in the US markets. Investment analysts say that price competitiveness in the market is so great that they would expect Japanese companies to absorb higher tariffs through their margins rather than attempt to raise prices. The most valuable part of the government procurement market, they argue, is that for military equipment; while its size is hard to estimate, analysts believe that foreign penetration is low. Ms Debra Waggoner of the American Electronics Association said: 'Outside the US, Japan is the world's single largest telecoms market. But our market penetration is disastrously low - we probably have 3 to 4 percentage points of the 5 per cent of sales which go to foreign companies.' She said companies should not be deterred by fears that the US government's actions would offend Japanese customers. Previous episodes when the US government had threatened sanctions had shown that 'the pressure companies can get from their suppliers is intense - the suppliers want them to tell their government to back off'. Meanwhile, analysts question whether the Japanese markets are really as inaccessible as the US suggests - and whether the war is worth fighting. Mr Richard Kramer, telecoms analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London, said technological specifications of equipment already installed, rather than issues of price, customer loyalty or government preferences, were among the most important market barriers. For example, he said, 'it is difficult to mix and match large digital switches. It is facile to say 'open up your markets and buy this switch'. 'Further penetration in either direction - of the Japanese market by the US or of the US market by the Japanese - is hard,' he said. If his arguments are right, and if the US goes ahead with sanctions, US companies could become embroiled in a trade battle in which they have little to win and much to lose.</p>

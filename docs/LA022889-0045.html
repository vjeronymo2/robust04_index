			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: THE KGB TOWERS OVER ENQUIRING MINDS  </P> <P> One question I am constantly being asked is, "Did the press have the right to  investigate and print stories about the private life of former Sen. John Tower  when he was being considered by the Senate Armed Services Committee for the  position of secretary of defense?"  </P> <P> The answer is, "Only if the Russians already knew about it." Tower's off-duty  activities are nobody's business, with the exception of the National Enquirer.  They are only significant if what he does for recreation could give aid and  comfort to the enemy, while the enemy provides aid and comfort to him.  </P> <P> Few people are aware that the KGB has a large department called The W&amp;D  Division -- W&amp;D stands for Womanizing and Daiquiris. The purpose of the  department is to find out which Pentagon officials like womanizing and which  ones prefer to play miniature golf. If they discover an official who likes to  do both, the KGB refers to such a person as a "twofer."  </P> <P> With one of the largest budgets of any agency in the Soviet Union, the W&amp;D  has training quarters, actually luxury hotels, where beautiful women are  instructed on how to be friendly and warm to Westerners in high places.  </P> <P> At this very moment, the KGB is holding a Miss Secretary of Defense 1989  contest, with the most beautiful women from all over the Soviet Union  competing. The winner gets 12,000 rubles, a Ziss convertible and an opportunity  to meet a U.S. secretary of defense in the bar of her choice.  </P> <P> The girls have to appear in bathing suits and then evening gowns. There is also  a talent category. Each contestant is asked how she would get the NATO order of  battle while making pillow talk.  </P> <P> To make the contest more interesting, each woman has access to any clothing in  Raisa Gorbachev's closet and is issued a Diner's Club camera hidden in the  neckline, which goes click every time she is bitten on the neck. One of the  most important qualities that the judges look for is how many people in high  government positions she can catch in a revolving door.  </P> <P> I only mention what is going on in Moscow right now because our President can't  be too careful when selecting a secretary of defense for this country. While  Tower may not be guilty of anything, we would be fools to ignore the fact that  the KGB's Miss Secretary of Defense 1989 is about to be chosen and start on her  world tour.  </P> <P> The KGB is a vicious, calculating organization and there is nothing it would  like more than to have its beauty queen party with Sen. Tower on a nuclear  submarine, even if he doesn't want to. The Russians are taking the position  that Tower may not be a swinger, but they have to be ready for any emergency.  While shooting photos of Tower's bedroom, a KGB man was overheard to say,  "We're not talking about a man falling in love with an agent -- we're talking  about finding out what's screwed onto the undercarriage of the Stealth bomber."  </P> <P> The odds-on favorite to win the Miss Secretary of Defense 1989 title is Miss  Smolensk. She used to be a ballet dancer with the Bolshoi, but she kept falling  down and they had to let her go. She is not only reported to be a seductive  Mata Hari, but she also speaks fluent Pentagonese.  </P> <P> In any case, the KGB officials have big plans for the winner. They are going to  ensure that she meets Tower at the Military-Industrial-Complex Cotillion in  Washington, which defense company lobbyists hold every year to present their  daughters to Washington society.  </P> <P> Miss Secretary of Defense 1989 will have strict orders that under no  circumstances is she to discuss "Star Wars" with Tower until their second date.  </P> <P> The KGB has never denied that attempting to make Tower a security risk is a  dirty business, but they say if they don't do it, who will?  </P></p>

			<p>940722 FT  22 JUL 94 / Observer: Eyeballing At last, Britain and China begin to see eye-to-eye over Hong Kong. Don't get your hopes up, though. It seems governor Chris Patten intends donating his corneas - after his death - to an international medical organisation, which operates a flying eye hospital. Oddly enough, Zhou Nan, China's de facto ambassador to Hong Kong, apparently made the same pledge yesterday while visiting the same flying eye hospital - built into a DC-10 airliner - at Hong Kong's Kai Tak airport. They really should be grafting at higher things.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Anti-U.S. Struggle of South Korean Youth" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- South Korean youth and  students waged anti-U.S. struggles in front of the "American  Cultural Centres" in Taegu and Pusan, Seoul-based radio reports  said.    Young people in Taegu Tuesday scattered copies of literature  denouncing the United States for screwing up the situation of  the Korean peninsula with nuclear pressure on the North,  shouting anti- American slogans and pouring paint on the  building of the "American cultural centre" in the city and a  police post.    They accused the United States of driving South Korean  agriculture into bankruptcy with pressure to open agricultural  product market.    On the 15th, students under the Pusan-South Kyongsang  Provincial Federation of General Student Councils staged a  surprise demonstration in front of the "American Cultural  Centre" in Pusan.    They occupied a road and condemned the United States for  creating a war crisis, shouting "objection to the U.S.  heightening tensions on the Korean peninsula" and other slogans.    In a statement they charged that the U.S. harms the peaceful  atmosphere of the Korean peninsula, clamouring for 'sanctions'  against the North with the approach of the 3rd round of North  Korea- U.S. talks.</p>

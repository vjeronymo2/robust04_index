			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Japan current account surplus record JAPAN'S current account surplus rose by 38 per cent to a record Dollars 19.09bn (Pounds 12.3bn) in March compared with the year before. The government figures, published yesterday, are likely to fuel US pressure for measures to cut the surplus. The sharp rise in the surplus largely reflects the recent appreciation of the yen against the dollar, which has increased the dollar value of Japanese exports. The yen's strength will ensure that the dollar value of the trade surplus will continue to rise strongly for the next few months just as the US and Japan conduct talks on measures to open the Japanese market to imports. The talks are aimed at reaching an agreement on trade policy which President Bill Clinton and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, would finalise at a summit in early July. The growth in the surplus will also add to pressure on Japan to consider further measures to boost domestic demand, to suck in more imports. The US administration has repeatedly said it regards the special Y24,000bn (Pounds 141bn) pump-priming measures which Tokyo has introduced since last August as just a first step in reviving domestic demand in Japan. In March the trade surplus was 20.2 per cent higher at Dollars 15.6bn than a year earlier, as the dollar value of imports rose 10.1 per cent to Dollars 18.24bn and exports increased 14.5 per cent to Dollars 33.83bn. However, in yen terms Japanese exports were only 1 per cent up in March at Y3,960bn, while imports were 2.9 per cent down at Y2,135bn. For the year to March Japan's current account surplus was 39.7 per cent up at a historic high of Dollars 126.08bn. The previous record was Dollars 94.14bn in 1986. The trade surplus for the 1993 fiscal year was Dollars 136bn, up 19.7 per cent. Combined with the slowdown in the Japanese economy, the surge in the surplus is likely this year to take it close to 4 per cent of gross national product, the peak it reached in the mid-1980s which led to trade friction with the US. The downturn in Japan was confirmed by an 11 per cent fall in vehicle sales in April from the same month in 1992. The slump douses hopes that a 1.7 per cent increase in March's sales marked the bottom of the decline in the car market.</p>

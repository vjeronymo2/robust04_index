			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / China denounces human rights reports China has denounced Asia Watch and Amnesty International over new reports of human rights abuses, accusing the organisations of prejudice, writes Tony Walker in Beijing. A Chinese spokesman said an Asia Watch report alleging an increase in political repression in China ignored recent positive economic developments. China's reaction reflects sensitivity that the reports may influence a US decision on renewing China's Most Favoured Nation status. Losing this would jeopardise billions of dollars' worth of Chinese exports.</p>

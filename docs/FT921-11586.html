			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Machinery and plant orders rise in west Germany ORDERS for west German plant and machinery rose last month for the first time in a year, the VDMA manufacturers' association said yesterday. Export demand was 3 per cent higher and German orders were 4 per cent up in real terms on December 1990, writes Christopher Parkes in Bonn. The aggregate 4 per cent rise was one bright spot in a year in which the value of orders fell 8 per cent. However, the VDMA said it was too soon to say if the decline, especially in overseas markets, had stopped. Foreign demand for the year was 17 per cent down in real terms.</p>

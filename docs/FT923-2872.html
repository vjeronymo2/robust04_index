			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Lira is still overvalued, say traders SPECULATORS took the view yesterday that Sunday's devaluation of the Italian lira had been insufficient to stabilise the currency, forcing the currency to decline sharply against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges. Officials at the Bank of Italy tried to put a good gloss on the lira's fall of around 1 per cent against the D-Mark, taking it below its central rate against the D-Mark of L802.48. 'Some days will have to pass for the exchange rate and financial markets to find a new equilibrium point,' an official at the Bank of Italy said. However, some dealers said the lira's decline was now unstoppable. 'Between now and the end of the week we will see sustained pressure on the lira, which will soon be trading near its new ERM floor,' said Mr Julian Simmonds of Citibank in London. The lira has been the victim of a new bout of selling by a range of players in the market, including bank dealers and investment institutions. On Monday morning, some 12 hours after the announcement of the devaluation, the lira opened in London at L784.62 to the D-Mark, at the top of its permitted ERM range against the German currency. At first, speculators who had sold lire before the devaluation bought the currency in a burst of short-term profit-taking. Yesterday, the mood changed radically. Mr Mark Slater, managing director of foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch International in London, said that big Italian corporations were selling the currency heavily. 'They have borrowed around Dollars 180bn in D-Marks and Swiss francs and converted them into lire,' he said, 'and are now buying back foreign currencies to hedge themselves against losses.' Several factors undermined the lira in trading yesterday: Dealers felt that Sunday's 7 per cent devaluation was insufficient and could well be followed by another one. The lira was already thought to be overvalued by about 20 per cent against the D-Mark on a trade-weighted basis before Sunday's realignment. Dealers are concerned that the Italian government must reimburse the Bundesbank for the massive intervention carried out by the German central bank in support of the lira. The Bundesbank spent up to DM24bn last week, buying lire on the open market. Under EMS rules, the Bundesbank can demand that the Bank of Italy repays it in lire at the old rate for D-Marks. There are fears that the devaluation will increase inflation and reverse the decision earlier this year to abolish the Scala Mobile, which guaranteed minimum wage rises.</p>

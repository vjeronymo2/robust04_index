			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Drop in liquidity hints at recovery The liquidity position of large UK companies worsened in the third quarter of 1994, the first deterioration in almost two years. But the statistics may show that British companies are now confident enough in the recovery to invest in new plant and equipment. 'It is the first indication that companies are happier with their balance sheets and will now attempt to take on debt to finance expansion,' said Mr David Owen, UK economist at Kleinwort Benson. Figures from the Central Statistical Office released yesterday showed that the liquidity of all large companies  - as measured by the ratio of total current assets to total current liabilities  - fell from 147 per cent in the second quarter to 142 per cent in the third. The last time the ratio fell was between the third and fourth quarters of 1992. Companies have substantially improved their liquidity position since the peak of the boom in 1989. In that year, the ratio dropped to 96 per cent. Among manufacturing companies, the ratio dipped from 127 per cent in the second quarter to 124 per cent in the third quarter. Among non-manufacturers, the ratio dropped from 178 per cent to 167 per cent.</p>

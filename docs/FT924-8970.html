			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / FT Pink Snow (2): Be comfortable when you put the boot in - David Goldsmith considers the technology that goes in to today's skis and boots FOR AN industry that has recently survived three near-snowless European winters and a worldwide decline in ski sales, equipment manufacturers have bounced back this winter with renewed evidence of research and development. Skis are going through their third industrial 'revolution' since the second world war. The metal and wood skis of the 1950s, which gave way to the fibreglass and carbon fibre models of the 1960s and 1970s, are now being replaced with shape-moulded skis. Revolutionary heat moulding techniques produce skis with ribbed top surfaces, angulated sidewalls, special platforms and isolated suspension sections for ski bindings. Skis that demonstrate this trend are the Head's F1 Flex control and K2 Velocity. Head, innovator of the mass-produced metal skis, appears to be coming out of a long trough in its fortunes. The Head F1 performs with more precision, edge grip and hug of the terrain than any previous Head ski I can recall. It can be recommended to any competent parallel or expert skier who does not travel at very high speeds. The K2 Velocity is one of several skis (Blizzard, Tyrolia and Fischer are others) that isolate vibrations from the bindings by incorporating a shock-absorbing section on the ski. Tyrolia has produced particularly unusual skis with a cunning pre-drilled hold pattern that is compatible with the company's own bindings. These shock-absorbed skis have been inspired by the strange unit used by many World Cup ski racers - the Derbyflex platform, which raises the bindings on a shock-absorbing platform. Although innovative approaches to ski making vary, two European ski manufacturers which pioneered the shape-moulding trend - Salomon and Elan - appear to have hit on a method which points to the future. The expression 'monocoque' has been borrowed from motor racing to describe it. Both factories use a method of wrapping a tough composite skin over the core of the ski (skis normally have no strength in their outer surfaces), producing a shell that becomes the key component of the ski's performance. The monocoque shell is varied in thickness and shape to produce skis of different flexibility and torque. The Salomon Force 9 3S became a hit last winter with skiers that go for 'extreme' and tricky parts of the mountain. The ski has an unusually quick, lively and sharp-cutting performance. Salomon entered the ski manufacturing game only three years ago, financed by the huge success of its dominant binding and boot divisions. The company's Pounds 30m ski manufacturing investment could not have come at a worse time, though, as it coincided with a general collapse in world ski sales. The company has therefore had to work extra hard to establish an exclusive identity, making skis with special attention to the all-important edge and base preparation. A pack of special wax is shrink-wrapped on to each pair of skis. The skis turn easily and carve superbly, but a few doubts remain concerning durability and lightness of the foresections of the skis. Interestingly, some models of the high-tech Salomon ski are now made with wood cores. From a company that has traditionally avoided any contact with natural materials this is particularly significant and points to a keenness to dampen the skis and beef up their general performance. In spite of numerous attempts to remove wood from ski manufacture and replace it with foam plastic cores, it remains the key core component of most quality skis. Volkl and K2, two up-and-coming manufacturers from unconventional ski-making nations (Germany and the US) use wood extensively in their ski construction. They both subscribe to a form of ski construction the first came to fame under the feet of Jean-Claude Killy at the 1968 Winter Olympics: torsion box. This expensive way of making skis, pioneered by Dynamic, involves wrapping the core with epoxy fibreglass and composite fibres. The result is that any Volkl or K2 ski above Pounds 250 has above-average, and in some cases exceptional, performance. Still riding the tide of ski manufacturing trends stands Rossignol, the French maker of consistently outstanding racing skis. The 4SK has been a long term favourite, and this year's hot tip is the 7XK for high-speed cruising of red and black runs, but excellent edge-to-edge reaction for shorter turns. BOOT BUYS The relationship of skiers to ski boots tends to be inspired by Woody Allen: intense but obsessive, fumbling, awkward and neurotic. Some skiers can take the joke, but lack of comfort is not what one should find after spending more than Pounds 200 on boots. Buying comfortable ski boots does not have to be the problem it used to be. Manufacturers that know how to seduce any easy sale line the rigid plastic shells of their boots with lovely soft thick padding. Nordica, the world leader in ski boot production, has pitched to the bulk of the market with this philosophy for the past decade. Millions of happy customers have resulted. Nordica's success has encouraged many other manufacturers to follow a similar design philosophy, but the wicked truth is that you can have too much of a good thing. Just as a plastic bucket lined with foam rubber can be comfortable to stand in, a ski boot does not necessarily function when it is too comfortable. The importance of obtaining control, along with comfort, has never been more important. As ski racers have discovered, the best method is to have boots custom-injected with foam that forms a near perfect mould around the foot. The best ski shops have now had up to 20 years experience of this process and its success rate is high. Try branches of Snow and Rock (London, Hemel Hempstead or Birmingham) or Ellis Brigham (nationwide) for boot foaming, or other dedicated specialists. The boots I tend to revert to, after annual experimentation with others, are a pair of Salomon SX92 Foam (now SX93 Foam Pounds 269.50). This is the only good rear-entry boot with a foamed inner, but several other 'four-clip' boots exists with this option - including the Rossignol R900, Dynafit 3F 912, Nordica Grand Prix 90 (an interesting revival and redesign), Tecnica TNT (recommended) and Lange X9 (also good). Although no self-respecting and professional ski shop should operate these days without specialist boot 'surgeons' and the equipment to modify boots, the reality is that most skiers buy boots off the shelf. What should you look for? My own choice remains rear-entry, because of its superb convenience and ease of walking to the lifts. Although there has been a revival of traditional clipped 'overlap' or 'four-clip' boots this winter, well-designed rear-entry boots offer excellent transmission of movement to the skis. Well designed rear-entry boots included the Salomon SX73 (or 83 for better skiers) and Raichle RX 787. At a lower price, the Nordica 798 could be considered by early intermediates. The Nordica Syntech range is an interesting hybrid of rear-entry and four-clip. Well-designed 'four-clip' boots include the Tecnica TC3 (for good intermediates) and TLC (for women), and Nordica 883 or 983 for experienced skiers. The Raichle Flexon boots, with their distinctive ribbed outer flex tongues, have a strong following with expert skiers. After 13 years of making only rear-entry boots, Salomon has bowed to market trends by launching a large range of four-clip boots called Evolution and Integral. These are worth investigating, too.

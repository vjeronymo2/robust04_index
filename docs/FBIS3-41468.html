On the Creation of a Single State System To  Monitor the Republic of Georgia Environment'']    [Text] By a decree of the Republic of Georgia Cabinet of  Ministers, a single state system to monitor the Republic of  Georgia environment has been created; it will observe and assess  the state of the environment and make forecasts.    The creation of a single state system for ecological  monitoring in the Republic of Georgia will make it possible to  improve the administration of the ecological situation in  Georgia and its operational control. Great importance is  attached to its successful implementation from the point of view  of the resolution of other problems connected with the national  economy.    The Ministry for the Protection of the Environment has been  entrusted with organizing a single state system to monitor the  republic's environment and elaborating a program for  implementing it in the republic.    The republic's academies of science and agriculture and a  number of ministries, departments, and agencies have been  entrusted with implementing individual monitoring systems.    The Ministry for the Protection of the Environment along  with  the Academy of Sciences and interested ministries and  departments are to present within two months to the Republic of  Georgia Cabinet of Ministers proposals for the creation of an  interdepartmental council in the Ministry for the Protection of  the Environment that will elaborate a program for creating a  single state system to monitor the republic's environment.    On the basis of the radiation control group in the  ``Sakmtavarhidrometi'' republican center for monitoring the  environment, the Ministry for the Protection of the Environment  should create a service for controlling radiation safety in the  republic by the end of January 1994.    A single environmental information and research system is to  be created within the main department of hydrometeorology and  environmental monitoring, which will unite the departmental  banks holding statistics on monitoring on the basis of a single  methodology and in accordance with international standards.</p>

According to a document circulating behind  the scenes in the parliament, a copy of which was sent to Radio  Metropole, some deputies [word indistinct] propose the  ratification of a decree advocating the implementation of  Article 149 of the Constitution in the event that the president  of the Republic does not appoint a new prime minister within 48  hours.    These deputies also indicate that this prime minister should  be appointed in compliance with the spirit of Article 148 of the  Constitution, an article that gives full power to the prime  minister and his cabinet in case the president of the Republic  is indisposed.    In a letter addressed to the president of the Chamber, these  deputies from the southern region request an urgent vote on  their proposal.</p>

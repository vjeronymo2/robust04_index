			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / First light in bitter Yugoslav imbroglio: The war in Bosnia goes on, but the London conference has made headway THE London conference has achieved a measure of success in winning the agreement of all parties to participate in long-term negotiations on the future of the Balkan peninsula, in spite of being unable to stop the fighting in Bosnia. The conference yesterday adopted a three-pronged strategy aimed initially at resolving the crisis in Bosnia. But each precarious step has to contend with the same obstacle that has hampered western efforts all along: the reluctance to back up threats with action, most notably the use of force. The first part of the strategy is to beef up the United Nations presence in Bosnia in order to protect the humanitarian aid convoys. The UN's mandate in Bosnia does not allow it to do that, as witnessed when the UN came under fire while delivering relief supplies to the Serb-besieged eastern Bosnian city of Gorazde. The London conference's draft document on Bosnia envisages establishing a much enlarged international peacekeeping force under UN auspices to maintain the ceasefire and control movements by military forces on the ground. If the UN's mandate is amended in this way, as proposed by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, the danger is that its forces on the ground will be forced to defend themselves, thus jeopardising their impartiality. 'This was exactly the argument recently used by Britain as a reason for not changing the UN's mandate,' said an EC diplomat. 'Yet now we are trying to change the UN's role so that Nato can avoid taking any military decisions about becoming involved in Bosnia.' This first strategy is supposed to run in parallel with the second prong aimed at increasing diplomatic, political and economic pressure on Serbia so that Belgrade will stop supporting the Bosnian Serb fighters. Mr Milan Panic, prime minister of the new, unrecognised Yugoslavia, has already asked the London conference to monitor the borders between Serbia and Bosnia. 'That's a sincere gesture. But Bosnia's Serb forces are loaded with weapons. Disarming these people is what we should be addressing,' an EC foreign minister said. This will take a long time and will again involve risk to those international forces monitoring the process. Moreover, as Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's foreign minister has repeatedly said, sanctions against Serbia will not stop the war, they will not allow any future Bosnian government to claw back territory seized by Croatia and Serbia, and they do not provide for the rebuilding of bombed homes from which Bosnia's Moslems were expelled. The threat of more sanctions is also designed to apply pressure on Belgrade to negotiate the restoration of autonomy to the Serb-controlled southern province of Kosovo so as to prevent the war from spreading to this part of the Balkans. Mr Alois Mock, Austria's foreign minister, pointed to the obstructive tactics of Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president. 'Time and again throughout this conference, we have seen Milosevic refusing to accept international mediators to negotiate the future status of Kosovo on the grounds that the conference is interfering in the internal affairs of Serbia,' he said. The third part of the strategy is designed to tackle all these complex problems. Six permanent committees based in Geneva will be set up in the wake of the conference. These will negotiate the future constitutional status of Bosnia, the status of ethnic minorities throughout the region, and the restoration of economic ties between the republics. UN and EC diplomats admit that the committees cannot hope to stop the fighting immediately. 'We said from the outset that this conference would not stop the fighting,' said Mr John Major, the British prime minister. His advisers say addressing the issues of ethnicity, nationalism, and identity throughout the Balkans is a long term process. Geneva is a long way from Sarajevo and Kosovo, from the fighting and the tension on the ground. Many of the ethnic communities in the former Yugoslavia are looking for a clearer sign of help from the west than is likely to be provided by another round of negotiations in a distant capital. The conference has given momentum to the search for peace. But there is widespread fear that if the three-pronged strategy has no military force to underpin it, the roar of Balkan mortar could again devour the western diplomatic effort.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): The market gives a simple message - Wall Street / The reasons for a fall which had to happen sooner or later With the benefit of hindsight, this week's plunge on Wall Street was an accident waiting to happen. For months, bonds had been getting cheaper and stocks had not. Last week's sharp rise in the discount rate merely prodded stocks into action. Whether they are back into line is a more ticklish question. The point is illustrated by one simple statistic. At the start of February, just before the Fed first raised rates, the long bond was yielding 6.3 per cent and equities 2.7 per cent. By last week, the bond yield had risen to 8.2 per cent and equities to only 2.9 per cent. To put the same point in a different way, the yield ratio rose over the period from 2.4 to over 2.8. Though this may seem a little arcane, its significance lies in the fact that the normal range for this ratio is between 2.2 and 2.6. The last time it reached 2.8 - that is, the last time equities were so expensive relative to bonds - was before the crash of 1987 (it went on to peak at the crazy level of nearly 3.6). It might seem surprising that retail investors, at least, should have tolerated this. After all, one of the most striking phenomena for equities in the early 1990s was the surge of private savings into mutual funds, when the return on cash was very low. When the Fed began to push rates up in February, that money ought to have started moving out. Instead, investors seem to have assumed that the strength of US economic recovery would push up corporate earnings and therefore stock prices, thus providing capital gains to make good the shortfall in income. It therefore came as a blow to realise last week that the US economic cycle seems finally to be turning down; or if not, that the Fed has every intention of pushing up rates until it does turn down. The third quarter results season just ended brought a string of record earnings from a wide range of companies, not merely the traditional cyclical sectors, and that may continue for another quarter or so. Nevertheless, the market senses that the earnings recovery is faltering. An oblique but powerful piece of supporting evidence comes from companies themselves. This week, Walt Disney capped a record year of earnings by saying it had spent Dollars 920m since May buying back its shares, and that it planned to spend up to Dollars 4.5bn doing the same in future. On the same day Merck said it was going to spend Dollars 2bn on its shares, a sharp increase on its previous buyback programme. The day after, the electronics giant AMP (market value Dollars 7.3bn) said it too would start buybacks, under a programme already in place but not yet implemented. Now, there are two ways of raising earnings per share: increase the earnings for a given number of shares, or reduce the shares for a given amount of earnings. Not all these companies believe their earnings growth will falter: indeed, AMP specifically said it expects record earnings for the next two quarters. But in general terms, when companies can find nothing better to do with their cash than retire their own equity, it is likely there are squalls ahead. The Fed's actions apart, the other factor weighing on the market's mind is political. It is clear by now that the crushing success of the Republicans in the mid-term elections could prove a mixed blessing. To be sure, the Republicans can be expected to press for a lightening of regulatory and other burdens. But they also stand for low taxation. Cutting taxes is quicker and easier than cutting spending, particularly for a party which is committed to halting the cuts in the defence budget. Other things being equal, in other words, the risk is that the budget deficit will worsen. This might seem a paradox for a party which contains such powerful figures as Senator Phil Gramm, who believes the constitution should be amended to prohibit the government from borrowing at all. But for the bond market, even the outside chance of increased supply would tend to push yields up as well; and the last thing the equity market needs now is a weak bond market. As for the week ahead, the market's indecision was shown by yesterday's thinly-traded holiday rally. There are at least two reasons for thinking the nervousness may not be over. First, though the Dow has fallen further in the past week than the broader-based S&amp;P 500, it has fallen by less since the start of the year. In other words, the big leading stocks may still be a touch overvalued relative to the market as a whole. Second, watch that yield ratio. At around 2.7, it is still on the high side. It is always possible that the bond market will save the day by staging a rally. The toughness of the Fed's recent actions reinforces its inflationary credentials; and if, as its critics charge, it risks slowing the real economy too sharply, there is nothing the bond market likes better than a good recession. Either way, the past week has rammed home one simple message. If you want to know where equities are headed these days, all you need do is work out where bonds are going first.  ---------------------------------- DOW JONES IND AVERAGE  ---------------------------------- Monday      3,769.51    -45.75 Tuesday     3,677.99    -91.52 Wednesday   3,674.63    - 3.36 Thursday    Market closed Friday      3,708.27    +33.64  ----------------------------------</p>

He was  commenting on the statement by the opposition leader, in which  he had criticized the dissolution of local bodies. He said  during the 1988 and 1990 elections, the funds for local bodies  were used to run the election campaigns of the Muslim League and  its allied parties. On both the occasions, Pakistan Muslim  League-Nawaz group used local bodies' funds for personal  purposes, which forced the caretaker government to dissolve the  local councils before the 1990 elections in order to ensure free  and fair elections were conducted.    The information and broadcasting minister said that Mian  Nawaz Sharif also received substantial assistance from Israel to  destabilize the then government. The assistance was provided in  the form of steel scraps through Israeli agents either free or  at a nominal price. An Israeli ship named (Jamatul) delivered  27,500 tons of scrap worth 240 million rupees.</p>

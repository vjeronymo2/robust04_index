			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 21 (CTK) -- Czech Defense Minister  Antonin Baudys today began a three-day official visit to France  at the invitation of his French counterpart Francoise Leotard.    It is the first visit by the Czech Republic's defense  minister to France since the division of the former  Czechoslovakia. It aims to emphasize the new shape of  French-Czech relations in the military sphere in the spirit of  the agreement on cooperation between the two countries' armed  forces which was concluded by France and Czechoslovakia in April  1992 and which has been assumed by the Czech Republic, a source  close to the Czech delegation told CTK.    Baudys, Chief of the Czech Army General Staff Jiri Nekvasil,  Director General of the Defense Ministry Foreign Affairs  Division Jaromir Novotny and other members of the delegation are  discussing with their French colleagues the questions of  European security and some specific forms of cooperation.    The delegation will focus on the preparation of French-Czech  joint military exercises which are to be held in both countries  this June. The joint exercises will mark a fundamental change  in military relations between the Czech Republic and France. In  the Cold War period the French Army was charged with the  assignment of occupying the Czech lands in case of a war  conflict.    During the visit Baudys will be shown French combat and  communication equipment. He will visit, for example, a base of  Mirage-2000 jets and the Matra firm.    At a meeting with Leotard this evening Baudys will discuss  the situation in the former Yugoslavia. Czech participation in  the celebrations to mark the Western Allies' landing in  Normandia in 1944 will probably also be discussed.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin today appeared before  the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. Rabin said  he did not believe that the government's policy in the political  process was leading to the establishment of a Palestinian state.  Our Knesset affairs correspondent Tamar Asalem reports.    [Begin recording] [Asalem] Strident tones were heard at  today's meeting of the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense  Committee. For the first time, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  presented the agreed upon map of the Gaza Strip, with the main  roads clearly marked out, to the committee members. Knesset  Member [MK] Beni Begin complained that although he had asked to  see the map at an earlier date, his request was been turned  down. MK Begin asserted that if Nabil Sha'th could view the  map, the committee members should at least have the same right.  This is the map that was signed in Cairo, the prime minister  explained. Rabin nevertheless said he believed that the  Palestinians would still make an attempt to change several  details. I do not feel that what we are doing must necessarily  lead to a Palestinian state, Rabin said. We are trying to let  the Palestinians run their own lives without harming the  security of the Israeli settlements.    As for Syria, Rabin said that all Israel's attempts to  launch  either public or secret talks had been rejected. The Syrians  must demonstrate their desire and readiness to reach an  agreement.    [Rabin] Syria's leadership is not doing what is necessary in  order to demonstrate its sincere desire for peace to the Israeli  public. I do not expect al-Asad to be as daring as the late  Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat who visited Jerusalem;  however, there are still many ways that the Syrian Government  can show its desire for peace.    [Asalem] Rabin nevertheless added that he had reason to  believe that once an agreement was reached with the Syrians, it  would be signed independently of the negotiations with the  Palestinians or Jordanians. I will not divulge the reasons for  my assessment, Rabin said. Against the background of the talks  which are resuming today, the prime minister reviewed  developments on the various negotiating tracks.    [Rabin] As for Jordan, I believe there are practical issues  on which we can make progress with the Jordanians, and I am sure  that the fact that we sent water and environmental experts  indicates that there are areas in which we can make progress.  With Syria we shall wait and see. We can of course exchange  views with the Lebanese, but I find it hard to believe that  Lebanon will move forward without Syria.    [Asalem] The prime minister also addressed the recent spate  of terrorist attacks. He reiterated that Israel would continue  to wage a ruthless war against the perpetrators of terrorist  attacks while continuing to negotiate with those elements that  had abandoned terrorism. As for the release of Palestinian  prisoners, Rabin said that such a step would be implemented in  accordance with yet to be defined categories and would be linked  to progress in the negotiations. All previous defense ministers  made goodwill gestures on national holidays, Rabin said, noting  that he did not remember any holiday when prisoners were not  released as a goodwill gesture. [end recording]    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1300 GMT on 15 February  reports that "Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said today that if  the PLO attempts to conduct an independent foreign policy, he  would regard this a violation of the agreement with Israel just  as he would if the PLO announced the establishment of a  Palestinian state. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that  Rabin made the remark in an appearance before the Knesset  Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.    ["Upon emerging from the session, the prime minister said  that Syria is not even trying to show the Israeli public that it  is interested in peace. According to him, the Israeli public  would have considered it a sign of a Syrian desire for peace had  Damascus accepted the request of Knesset Member Darawshah to  head a delegation of Israeli Arabs who wished to convey their  condolences to the Syrian president over the death of his son.    ["Our correspondent notes that during the committee session  there were sharp verbal exchanges between the Likud members and  the prime minister over the affair of the settlements of Dugit  and Netzarim."]    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1500 GMT on 15 February  further cites Rabin as telling the Knesset committee that "those  wishing to leave Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip and return  to live within the boundaries of the State of Israel will not  receive any compensation because the government is not  interested in encouraging them to leave. Our correspondent  Yo'el Nir reports that the prime minister noted that recently,  some 110 million shekels had been allocated for defense measures  for the Jewish settlements in Judaea and Samaria."]</p>

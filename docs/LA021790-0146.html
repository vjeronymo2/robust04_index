			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> AYERS DIES OF INJURIES FROM SUICIDE TRY  </P> <P> A Newport Beach woman who attempted suicide in her Santa Ana jail cell by  hanging herself from a shower rod died Thursday night from related injuries,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Pamela Pauline Ayers, 45, had been held since Aug. 12 in the women's jail as a  suspect in the fatal shooting of prominent Los Angeles attorney Gerald  Goldfarb, a 49-year-old appellate lawyer and columnist for the Whole Life  Times.  </P> <P> Deputies conducting a routine check Thursday discovered the woman hanging from  a bedsheet tied to a shower rod. Ayers, a former interior decorator, was alone  in her cell when the attempted suicide occurred, Orange County Sheriff's Lt.  Bob Rivas said.  </P> <P> Goldfarb died of multiple wounds to the head and body, and Ayers underwent  surgery for a self-inflicted wound to the abdomen shortly after the shooting  outside her Newport Beach condominium.  </P> <P> Police alleged that Ayers fired 10 shots from a 12-gauge shotgun that she had  bought just hours before the slaying. Investigators also allege that Goldfarb  and Ayers had argued shortly before the shooting.  </P> <P> Ayers' attorney has said the woman mistook Goldfarb's friendship and legal  counsel for a love relationship. Ayers' daughter, Christina Irwin, 27, said the  two were romantically involved and were trying to have a child until Ayers  suffered a mental breakdown early last year. WENDY PAULSON  </P></p>

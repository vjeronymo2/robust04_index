			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Asahi Glass profit slides 44% Asahi Glass, Japan's biggest glassmaker, showed a 43.9 per cent slide in pre-tax profits to Y11.25bn (Dollars 115m) for the first half to June, as stagnant demand from the construction and automotive industries pulled sales 9.2 per cent lower to Y440bn. Rationalisation measures introduced during the period, devolving some centralised responsibilities to its operating divisions, yielded a 7.7 per cent drop in operating costs to Y436.6bn. The company ex-pects a profits recovery for the full year. Sales of glass and construction materials, which represent almost half of all turnover, were down 7.7 per cent and those of chemicals, the second largest division, emerged 12.7 per cent lower. Growth was achieved only in electronics, where turnover was up 2.8 per cent to Y36.9bn as a result of demand for integrated circuits, glass substrates and optical fibre. In spite of the high value of the yen, Asahi Glass managed to expand exports by 11.7 per cent, reducing its exposure to the dull domestic economy. Exports account for 14.7 per cent of all sales, up from 12.0 per cent. A maintained interim dividend of Y4.50 per share is being paid from net earnings of Y6.44, down from Y9.90.</p>

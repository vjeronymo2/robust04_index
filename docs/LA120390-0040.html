			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Turkish Government Objects to Film: The Turkish Embassy has released a  statement denouncing the Turner Network Television movie "Forgotten Prisoners:  Amnesty Files," which debuted Nov. 19.  </P> <P> The embassy called it an "unfair and avowedly fictitious film" and said it  "falsely purports to portray contemporary reality in Turkey." The film, which  was based on a composite of actual cases, centered around an American attorney  who goes to Turkey on his first mission to document cases of government  torture. The Turkish Embassy accused the movie of defaming Turkey and  exploiting Americans' strong feelings about human rights violations. CLAUDIA  PUIG  </P></p>

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Hongkong Bank will not give up Midland 'lightly' - The Battle For Midland HONGKONG BANK yesterday said that it would remain interested in buying Midland Bank - even if its present bid failed. Asked what would happen if the sale of Midland was delayed until the autumn by the referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission of Lloyds Bank's rival bid, Mr Bernard Asher, Hongkong Bank executive director, said: 'We have a long and fulfilling relationship with Midland Bank going back nearly five years. 'It is not something we would give up lightly because the logic is so strong and good.' Mr Asher was speaking as Hongkong Bank published the formal documents stating the full terms for its bid for Midland Bank. Midland's shareholders have until June 30 to decide on the offer, which would create a combined banking group with assets of Pounds 144.6bn. The document, mailed to Midland's shareholders, values the bid at Pounds 3.4bn and 410p for each Midland share - well above Midland's closing price in London last night of 390p. The proposed Lloyds offer values Midland's shares at 453p. Hongkong Bank said the merger would make an additional contribution to profits of more than Pounds 800m in the first four years and Pounds 300m a year by 1996 for the combined banking group. Mr Asher revealed that Hongkong Bank would make cuts in Midland's 1,900-strong branch network and in the bank's treasury operations, but declined to give any details of possible job losses. However, around half of the Pounds 800m in extra profits which Hongkong Bank hopes to make would come from an expected increase in the income of the two banks after the merger. On the other hand Lloyds expects to make Pounds 700m of cost savings following a takeover of Midland. Mr Asher admitted that there was relatively little duplication between the existing operations of Midland, a mainly UK-based bank, and Hongkong Shanghai, a global bank with its main oper-ations in the Asia Pacific region. He said that Midland would benefit from the introduction of Hongkong Bank's branch administration and banking technology. Hongkong Bank and Midland have been co-operating in computer technology for nearly five years and it is expected that it would be relatively easy to unify their systems. Lloyds Bank immediately attacked the Hongkong Bank offer documents saying that, unlike its own offer, they did not promise to create a major new banking group in the UK which could compete vigorously with Barclays and National Westminster. 'Lloyds Bank's proposal would deliver a wider product range and cost savings which will enable substantial improvements in customers services and greater competition in the UK,' Lloyds said in a written statement. Lloyds also emphasised that uncertainties about Hong Kong's economic and political future after the territory returns to China in 1997 made its prospects extremely uncertain. It is believed to have written to the Office of Fair Trading this week warning that the fundamental issue at stake in the Hongkong Bank merger proposals concerned the possible risk to Midland Bank if things went seriously wrong in Hong Kong after 1997.

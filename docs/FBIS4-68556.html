			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irina Petrovskaya: "Will We Be Able To Force the </F> Genie Back Into the Bottle?"]    [Text] Last week an event occurred whose necessity had been  long reiterated by many of those people who understand even a  little bit about the economics of television. The event was a  milestone, revolutionary, worthy of press conferences and widely  broadcast announcements. Finally, an effort will be made to  somehow regulate the chaotic and uncontrolled commercial  activity of "Ostankino"--the source of many and all kinds of  abuses. According to the most modest estimates (which were used,  specifically, by the Presidential Control-Inspection  Administration, which conducted an investigation of the  company), "Ostankino" underreceived over 60 billion rubles (R)  last year. They disappeared without a trace, settling in  someone's private pockets. The average cost of a minute of  advertising today is $5,000. There are 100 such minutes at  "Ostankino" in the course of a day. That means it should receive  somewhere on the order of half a million dollars a day. Yet in  fact it receives $600,000 - $700,000 a month!    The heads of the company (different ones and in different  periods) sooner or later came to the idea of centralized  advertising. It is true, there were always opponents who tried  to persuade the "chiefs" that once the genie had gotten out of  the bottle, it would be impossible to force him back in. The  scope of business was too great, there were too many people and  structures interested in the real possession of advertising  time. There was too much money involved.    Despite all the "buts," the current leadership of  "Ostankino"  has nevertheless decided to force the genie back. It is doing so  in a surprisingly quiet, if not to say secretive, manner. In the  week which has passed since the moment the decision was adopted,  there has not been a single interview or a single piece of  information in any of the newspapers!    Obviously, this really is a delicate matter, if the  respected  and competent people to whom I turned for explanations hesitated  and avoided direct answers, while sceptics agreed to talk  exclusively in a confidential manner.    On the whole, all of my "consultants" agreed on one thing:  The creation of a single holding company which would sell all  the advertising time on channel one at firm prices is a good  idea. It is specifically according to such a scheme that many  Western companies exist. However, in the West they went to this  scheme systematically and gradually. For us, however, the  realities are different: "Ostankino" produces only one-fifth of  the entire product. The remainder it presently buys from  independent television companies, paying them in advertising  time. They, in turn, sell this time and decide for themselves  how to spend the money they receive. They produce cultural  programs, which are unprofitable and to which they cannot tempt  advertisers, at the expense of profitable commercial programs.    Now "Ostankino" intends to settle accounts with them in real  money, obtained from the sale of advertising time. And here is  where the questions and the doubts arise: Will programs which  are educational and cultural but unprofitable and not attractive  to advertisers disappear from the air? Will the new "master of  the money" dictate to "Ostankino" what to buy and what not to  buy? Why, for example, should it buy an expensive domestic  program when it can buy a cheap movie in the West, which will  bring a huge profit? From the standpoint of business, this is  normal. Yet from the standpoint of creativity, culture, and the  interests of society? When the advertising holding company  receives the first real profits, will it not be interested in  further increasing them by means of reducing expenditures? After  all, the stockholders--private firms--did not take on this  endeavor out of charitable convictions?! They have to pay off  "Ostankino," and to "cook up" something for themselves, if you  will excuse the expression!    I have heard apprehensions to the effect that the  advertising  holding company may go from being a mediator to being a  contractor, determining the company's program policy. (It is the  same principle: He who pays calls the tune). Then channel one  will simply collapse, turn into a broadcaster of third-rate  films, "soap operas" and advertising clips.    Moreover, the skeptics say, "Ostankino" is a bottomless pit  which is capable of swallowing up any amount of money, millions  and billions. Just hand it over. Since there has been no  reorganization of the company's outdated structure, and the  budget deficit remains high, "Ostankino" will use the money  received from commercial activity primarily for continuing to  feed its overly inflated staff and its administrative apparatus,  and to patch up the numerous holes and breaches. Where is the  guarantee that there will be enough left over to settle accounts  with private companies in a timely manner (and at a real  price!)? There is no such guarantee.    Well, and finally, the main thing: The changeover of  "Ostankino" to stockholding with the participation of the  television producers themselves (which is natural) has stopped.  It has gotten bogged down somewhere at the level of the  president's apparatus, and there is almost no hope left for it.  "Ostankino," while in fact remaining state-owned, is in essence  even now being changed over to shareholding. Moreover, the piece  being auctioned off is its most profitable and choice one--the  advertising space. In principle, there is nothing else to  auction off. "Ostankino" does not own anything but air  time--neither equipment, nor its own building, nor the desks in  the offices, nor even the lights in the restrooms. All this  belongs to an entirely different, independent organization--the  Television Technical Center. Now even the advertising time has  an owner--a strong, economically well-grounded monopolist which  unites six advertising agencies. All the other agencies (and  there is a great multitude of them in Moscow alone) will either  buy advertising time from it, or will perish (which is  improbable), or will begin a struggle. And we know what happens  when spheres of influence are divided up. However, we do not  want to think about this. First of all, because for "Ostankino"  this is an experiment. After all, it is never too late to return  to the former scheme. Secondly, all the apprehensions which have  been expressed are in the category of versions and suppositions  which, nevertheless, must be "sound-tracked." After all, it is  better not to allow something than to try to correct it later.  For now, it has not yet begun.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By special reporter Fang Yuan (2455 0337)] </F>   [Text] Being worried that the inflation rate that has  remained high would have a negative impact on the forthcoming  National People's Congress [NPC] and Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee sessions, or  even on social stability across the country, the Beijing higher  leadership have decided to adopt a series of measures soon to  keep down commodity prices. It is disclosed that as the fifth  anniversary of the 4 June incident is drawing nearer and nearer,  Zhongnanhai has ordered that "every measure be taken at whatever  expense" to maintain stability across the country.    Information has it that the mission to keep down commodity  prices has become the "central" task for China's major economic  management sector. Chen Jinhua, minister of the State Planning  Commission, and Luo Zhiling, vice minister of the commission,  have been named to run this massive price-curbing operation,  which will be carried out with the involvement and cooperation  of a few other departments. In order to mitigate the  drastically soaring trend of commodity prices, a series of  actions will be adopted soon, including convening an urgent  national telephone conference, launching a nationwide general  inspection of commodity prices, and taking some necessary  administrative actions to set price ceilings for some means of  subsistence. The whole operation will be fully launched by 7  March, with different phases started one after another.    The margin of price hikes in China has remained at a  two-digit level since last year. Despite the macroeconomic  regulation and control policy that was introduced in last July  with the aim of cooling down the economy, the momentum of price  hikes has not been curbed, with the commodity price index rising  from 19.5 percent in May to 22 percent in August in 35 major  cities. Then, last November, the country experienced a drastic  increase in the prices of grain, edible oil, and foodstuffs,  with grain prices alone rising by over 40 percent in some  localities. Although grain prices were temporarily stabilized  after 5 billion kg of grain reserves were sold on the market and  some administrative actions taken by the state, the price  increase trend was not completely halted. The price index in 35  major cities for January this year, as released by the State  Statistics Bureau, remained as high as 23.3 percent. Some  Beijing experts noted that China is now facing the fourth  commodity price "blast wave" after the three price increase peak  periods in 1985, 1986, and 1988.    An informed source in Beijing revealed that the CPC higher  leadership is deeply worried about the persistent high inflation  rate. And the commodity price issue will be a politically  sensitive one this year, particularly because this will be a  "year of reform" and also the year to see the fifth anniversary  of the 4 June incident.    Early this year, a central department concerned pointed out  in a most confidential document: This year will see the fifth  anniversary of the 1989 "Beijing contretemps" (that is, the 4  June incident), "hostile forces" at home and abroad will be  doing something. From last year onward, more and more of those  who went abroad before and after 1989 will be returning to China  (many of them have acquired the right of residence in foreign  countries). Meanwhile, those who were arrested because of  involvement in the 4 June incident are now being discharged from  prison, and they may still be playing a role as "unstable  factors," although most of them have now turned to work in the  economic field. In view of this fact, the document noted that  it is necessary to step up the "anti- subversion struggle" in  the economic field, pay close attention to these people's  activities after joining the business circles, and guard against  any attempt by them to confront the authorities or engage in  illegal political activities by making use of economic means or  under economic camouflage. It is said that to cope with this  development the Chinese public security and state security  sectors have set up special departments to keep watch on the  economic circles as well as dissidents in business circles.</p>

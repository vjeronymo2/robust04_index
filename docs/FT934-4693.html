			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: Anglo American lifts dividend Improved earnings from diamond and gold investments helped Anglo American Corporation, South Africa's largest company, increase attributable first-half earnings by 8 per cent to R629m (Dollars 172m) from R581m a year ago. Earnings per share rose to 271 cents from 251 cents and the interim dividend was increased to 95 cents from 90 cents a share. Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, predicted that full-year results would show a similar pattern to those recorded in the first half. Commenting on the political backdrop to the group's performance, Mr Ogilvie Thompson welcomed the interim constitution agreed last month, describing it as a 'major achievement' in the country's progress towards 'market democracy status'. He also described the five-year government of national unity, which will follow next April's election, as offering 'the best chance of creating the political and economic stability required for growth and broadly based development'. Mr Ogilvie Thompson also said the economic outlook was more positive. Not only has the country's four-year recession ended, but the economic policy debate has produced considerable consensus. He stressed particularly progress made on the anti-trust debate - where Anglo is normally the prime target on account of its size - which had developed 'in a rational and co-operative spirit'. On the operating side, investment income rose to R690m from R641m mainly as a result of higher dividends from Anglo's gold interests. Higher dividends from diamonds were offset by weak performances from platinum and base metal interests. Trading income fell by 12 per cent to R201m because of the fall in operating profit at Amcoal. A R68m surplus on the realisation of certain gold investments helped lift pre-tax income to R978m from R928m.</p>

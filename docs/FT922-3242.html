			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Drummond turns in Pounds 1.14m DRUMMOND Group finished the year to March 31 with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.14m, in line with the rights issue forecast made in January. In the previous year there was a loss of Pounds 379,000 after exceptional charges of Pounds 882,000. Mr Stefan Simmonds, chairman, said despite a further year of recession considerable progress was made in the development of the group. It was now a broadly based inter-related fabric manufacturing group, operating through five divisions. All divisions contributed to a near doubling of the operating profit to Pounds 2.03m, and there was continued improvement in the second half performance. An increase in sales of 37 per cent to Pounds 48.4m primarily stemmed from acquisitions made over the last 18 months. Earnings per share came to 4.59p (losses 11.17p). The final dividend is 0.75p for a total of 1.5p, against 1p previously and 2.35p in 1990-91.</p>

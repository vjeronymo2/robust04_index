			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>   [Text] The positive [kungjongjok] assessment of North  Korea, made when it allowed an overall inspection [chonmyon  sachal], is being hampered because the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team's entrance to North Korea  is being delayed.    IAEA Director General Hans Blix will report at the IAEA  Board  of Governors regular meeting, which will open at 1830 [0930 GMT]  on 21 February, that although North Korea allowed an overall  inspection, the agency is unable to start the North Korea  inspections due to the delay in issuing visas to the inspection  team members.    Director General Hans Blix will stress, in particular, that  in order to give an entire picture of North Korea's nuclear  development, it is necessary for North Korea to provide  additional information and allow special inspections [tukpyol  sachal] of the two unreported facilities, and that he will  continue to promote the solution to these matters as a separate  issue while watching how North Korea will implement the Nuclear  Safeguards Accord.    After receiving the director general's report today [21  February], the IAEA Board of Governors will discuss the North  Korean nuclear issue as a main agenda item on 22 or 23 February  and will urge North Korea to take appropriate steps to allow the  overall inspection as soon as possible.    It seems that the IAEA Board of Governors will discuss, in  particular, ways to help North Korea become a sincere member of  the international community after smoothly solving the special  inspection problem with the IAEA and ultimately return to the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] since it has allowed the  overall inspection.    It has been learned that North Korea will send a new  three-member delegation from Pyongyang to the IAEA Board of  Governors meeting to explain its position on the overall and  special inspection issue and the issue of its return to the NPT.</p>

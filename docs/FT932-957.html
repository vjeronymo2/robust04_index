			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: Nordic petrochemical groups link STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, and Neste, the Finnish state oil and chemicals group, have agreed to merge their petrochemicals businesses to form Europe's largest polyolefins producer and the fifth biggest in the world. The deal is one of the largest Nordic industrial mergers and marks a significant step in the restructuring of Europe's petrochemicals industry, the companies said. Polyolefins are plastics such as polypropylene and polyethylene. Because Neste's petrochemicals business is more than twice the size of Statoil's, it will receive 'several billion kroner' in cash from Statoil when the company is established. The jointly-owned company, which is yet to be named, should be operational by early 1994. It will employ more than 6,000 people and have annual revenue of Dollars 2.5bn. Annual polyolefins capacity will be 2.1m tonnes. Plastics processing will be pursued through Statoil's EuroParts subsidiary in Sweden and other entities. It will have production units in 10 countries and sales offices throughout western Europe, the US and south-east Asia. It will enjoy unique access to feedstock through Statoil's extensive gas production interests. Statoil and Neste also aim to exchange shareholdings in a number of oil and gas fields on the Norwegian continental shelf so that Neste can acquire producing assets in the North Sea while Statoil will acquire non-producing assets in the Norwegian Sea off the mid Norwegian coast. Mr Terje Wareberg, Statoil group executive vice-president, said the company would be established with 'substantial' capital to make it financially robust and highly competitive. Although the deal is to be finalised in the autumn, management will be appointed within weeks. The chairman will be chosen by Statoil and the chief executive by Neste. The new company's headquarters will be outside Norway and Finland, most likely in Brussels. 'This is a major industrial move within the Nordic community and is a necessary and healthy restructuring of an industry which has been hard hit by over-capacity and weak demand,' Mr Wareberg said. Mr Jaakko Ihamoutila, chairman and chief executive of Neste, said the deal would establish a basis for further co-operation with Statoil in the natural gas industry.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Laidlaw will not take up ADT option LAIDLAW, the Ontario-based waste services and transport operator, will not take up its proportionate share of the forthcoming public equity issue by ADT, its 28.4 per cent-owned international security and vehicle auction affiliate. The decision will lower Laidlaw's stake to just over 25 per cent, which will still leave the Canadian company as ADT's biggest single shareholder. Mr Donald Jackson, Laidlaw chief executive, said he supported ADT's refinancing effort, but Laidlaw's resources were best spent on its own core businesses. ADT plans to issue 18m shares in the US. Laidlaw's shares have tumbled by almost 20 per cent since it surprised the investment community last week with a loss of Dollars 33.6m, or 12 cents a share, for the three months to May 31. The loss was chiefly due to a Dollars 120m writedown stemming from a review of its US solid waste operations. Mr Jackson forecast earnings of 6 to 8 cents a share in the current quarter, slightly below analysts' estimates.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of International Hotels (10): It is hard to beat a way into Moscow - The hotel market in the former Soviet Union is struggling to catch up with demand When a couple of cleaning ladies launched a Dollars 10m law-suit against a leading western-managed Moscow hotel for their allegedly unfair dismissal, their tale joined the list of horror stories the western business community likes to tell about the hazards of investing in Russia. 'This country is crazy, you know . . . the judge will probably award them the money,' said one western construction executive. 'Oh, no, they won't. The judge is simply waiting to be paid off not to,' said another western entrepreneur, involved in tourism. The ladies apparently hit on the amount of Dollars 10m through a mistranslation of the conditions of a strict merit system. This had been introduced by the Radisson group, which manages the hotel in question, and said that employees were free to determine the size of their bonuses. The story also points up the particular difficulties facing western companies involved in building, refurbishing, and managing hotels in Russia. Despite being one of the Russian capital's favourite hotels for western visitors, with more than 85 per cent occupancy, the Radisson-Slavyanskaya Hotel shares many of the difficulties facing hoteliers in Russia. The advantages of a western-managed hotel such as the Radisson are also clear: with demand for quality rooms outstripping supply in Moscow, such hotels command a seller's market, despite the gradual encroachment of some degree of competition as new projects are - painfully - completed. The rewards to be made by those who have succeeded in beating their way into the market are increased by the considerable obstacles to others entering the market. Apart from a primitive legal system, ill-adjusted to the complexities of market economics, problems include ambiguous property rights, and consequent difficulties in raising finance for new projects. In the case of the Radisson-Slavyanskaya Hotel, the question of who actually owns the building remains the subject of competing claims among successor state and semi-state organisations to Intourist, the former state monopoly. In addition, the authorities' powerlessness to enforce their own rules may be illustrated by a railway workers' relaxation club still standing on the grounds of the hotel, despite an order for its demolition by the mayor's office in late 1992. A major factor slowing down the building of new hotels, as well as the refurbishing or rebuilding of Moscow's decrepit old hotels is the difficulty raising finance for Russian projects - partly because of the absence of a system for lenders to register their legal charge, and of a legal system capable of enforcing their rights. Endless rows over the ownership, financing, and management of the decrepit Hotel National, on a prime site just opposite Red Square, have meant it is still under scaffolding more than two years after work started. Some Moscow city government officials had promised Rogner, the Austrian construction group, a crack at managing the hotel in compensation for payment delays for the renovation. This in turn has clashed with a contract signed by other Moscow authorities with Marriott, the US hotel group, for it to manage the hotel. Other bits of Moscow's byzantine city administration have decided to hold a tender to select yet a third western company. But after just two years of market reforms, some progress is being made towards more transparent decision-making, and time is likely to cure many of the worst problems of Russia's infant capitalism.</p>

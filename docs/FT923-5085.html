			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Checkland denies he will quit BBC early SIR MICHAEL CHECKLAND, director-general of the BBC, insisted yesterday that he would continue in his job until the end of his contract, contrary to recent reports, Raymond Snoddy writes. Sunday newspapers had suggested that Sir Michael would go early to clear the way for Mr John Birt, director-general designate, and that Radio 2 and Radio 5 faced closure. Sir Michael said yesterday that he would remain director- general until his contract ended next February, adding that there was no plan to scrap any BBC radio channel. He said the BBC would set out a clear vision of its future shortly after the government published a planned green paper in the autumn. Sir Michael said there would be a restatement of the role of BBC governors and management, implying that the governors would stick to strategy and appointing top executives. The reports on Sunday followed a public row between Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, and Mr Marmaduke Hussey, BBC chairman. Mr Grade attacked BBC management and governors at the Edinburgh Television Festival last week for a 'pseudo-Leninist style of management'. Mr Hussey responded by describing Mr Grade as 'a Bourbon in red braces'.</p>

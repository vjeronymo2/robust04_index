			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Ever Ready sold by Hanson for Pounds 123m HANSON, the Anglo-US conglomerate, has sold Ever Ready, the UK dry cell battery manufacturer, for Pounds 132m to Ralston Purina, the diversified US-based food group. The move was described yesterday by one of Hanson's financial advisers as a 'tidying-up exercise' before making a larger acquisition. Ralston's purchase of Ever Ready, a brand it already owns in most countries outside the UK, confirms it as the world's largest manufacturer of dry cell batteries, adding annual sales of about Dollars 154.1m (Pounds 89.5m) to the Dollars 1.6bn which its existing battery division reported for the year to September 30. The financial adviser also said the exercise was 'aimed at providing the group with more cash to enable it to pounce on the next big target. I think that Hanson will now look to sell its 2.8 per cent shareholding in ICI before making its expected big acquisition'. There has been speculation that Hanson would sell its ICI holding since Lord Hanson told shareholders in February that the group had no plans for bidding for the chemicals group. Hanson bought its shares for an average price of 1,194p, they closed yesterday at 1,315p. In the long-running debate over Hanson's ability to run companies, the group's actions at Ever Ready have given ammunition to supporters and critics alike. When Hanson bought Berec (which included Ever Ready) in 1981 its profits had declined to a third of their 1970s peak, partly because it had missed the shift to long-life alkaline batteries. Hanson ruthlessly cut costs and sold assets, including most of the European operations to Duracell, its US competitor. The disposals realised half the purchase price of Pounds 95m. Operating profits rebounded to a peak of Pounds 23.4m in 1989 but fell back to Pounds 18.5m in 1991 on sales of Pounds 87.1m. But Hanson came to realise in the late 1980s that Ever Ready could flourish only as a multinational business. Mr Martin Taylor, vice-chairman, said the group had examined buying Duracell from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street firm which had taken it private in a 1988 leveraged buy-out. Ralston had bought Eveready, the US-based bearer of the famous brand name, from Union Carbide for Dollars 1.4bn. Hanson has since tried to buy it from Ralston but failed. 'We originally looked at buying Duracell from KKR and then looked at acquiring Ralston's battery business. We believe selling Ever Ready in the UK meets the same objectives.' Ralston Purina, whose marketshare in the UK was previously around 3 per cent, claims that its purchase 'fills a major gap' in its geographical coverage. Its market share in the Dollars 3bn US market is roughly equivalent to that of Duracell but Ralston has steadily enhanced its European presence. Ralston claims that, after the Hanson deal, it leads the European market overall. Observer, Page 19 Lex, Page 20 Takeover puts spark into battery maker, Page 21</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Bank angers playwright Playwright Arnold Wesker, whose TV productions have included Menace and Thieves in the Night, will soon have enough material for a gripping yarn about high-street banking. Mr Wesker, whose other works have included Sullied Hand and One More Ride on the Merry-Go-Round, was appalled to be charged Pounds 90.29 by his bank for paying into his London account a total of Pounds 600 transferred from France. The playwright has written to Mr Laurence Shurman, the banking ombudsman, about his treatment by the Finsbury Park, London, branch of National Westminster, where he has banked for 35 years. 'I've got a good record with the bank and it seems crazy that they've charged so much: at the least they should have warned me it would cost this amount to pay three cheques of Pounds 200 each into my account,' said Mr Wesker. Mr Wesker's tale of woe follows allegations from small businesses in recent years of bad treatment by the main clearing banks. On Monday, Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, said antagonism between the two groups was easing, though the banks had sometimes been guilty of 'insensitivity'. NatWest kept Pounds 45.56 of the Pounds 90.29 it charged Mr Wesker, with the rest paying for the services of the two French banks, Credit Lyonnais and Credit Mutuel, whose cheques were used in the transaction. NatWest admitted the charges were high but said they were 'fair' and 'reflected the costs of fiddling with little bits of paper'. Of the total taken, Pounds 30 was accounted for by NatWest's standard commission for currency transactions, Pounds 5.56 by postal charges and Pounds 10 by a handling fee.</p>

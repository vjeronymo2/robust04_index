			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / World Trade News: UK textile body attacks subsidies SUBSIDIES are distorting world trade in textiles and clothing, and hurting UK exporters, according to a report published today by the London-based Apparel, Knitting &amp; Textiles Alliance (AKT), writes David Dodwell. Biggest offenders are India, Pakistan and China, says the report. Subsidies range from simple cash support for exports to subsidy of raw materials, or subsidised loans for investment and export. The AKT, which represents the UK's Pounds 15bn textile and clothing industries, calls for a ban on export subsidies, increased transparency, rights to impose countervailing duties on offending exporters, and agreed international environmental standards. The alliance calls on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to tighten rules on the use of subsidies, and to enable rapid investigation of abuses. The UK industries have trimmed an estimated 87,000 jobs since 1988. Among investment subsidies, the AKT targets South Korea's recently agreed plan to provide Pounds 2.5bn to promote investment in its textiles and clothing industry. Controlled prices for raw cotton in Pakistan and China provided effective subsidies of Pounds 350m and Pounds 1.5bn respectively in 1991 to textile and garment exporters, the report claims.</p>

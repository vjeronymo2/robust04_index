			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS / NCAA MEN'S CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> NO. 2 UCLA ELIMINATES USD, 5-1  </P> <P> The second-ranked UCLA men's tennis team defeated No. 17 University of San  Diego, 5-1, in the second round of the NCAA Championships Saturday at Indian  Wells.  </P> <P> USD's Jose Luis Noriega, ranked sixth in the country, beat Jason Netter, 6-3,  6-3, at No. 1 singles for USD's only victory.  </P> <P> UCLA (26-3) advanced to the third round today. USD finished 22-6.  </P> <P> "I was disappointed we didn't win any of the four, five or six singles  matches," USD Coach Ed Collins said. "If we had won one of those, and with  Noriega winning at No. 1, that would have helped our momentum."  </P> <P> Top-ranked and undefeated Tennessee lost the first two singles matches but  rebounded to beat No. 19 UC Irvine, 5-2, and move into the quarterfinals.  </P> <P> Also in the second round, No. 3 Stanford, the two-time defending champion,  breezed past Oklahoma State, 5-1; No. 4 Georgia eliminated No. 23 Northwestern  from its first NCAA tournament, 5-2; Texas upset No. 5 Pepperdine, 5-3; No. 8  and host Southern Cal beat South Carolina, 5-2; Miami, Fla., beat No. 15  Arizona State, and No. 6 California beat No. 11 LSU, 5-3, in a match that  lasted 6 1/2 hours.  </P> <P> Tennessee was one of the 12 teams that drew first-round byes.  </P> <P> "We were concerned before the match because we knew Irvine is a very good  team," Tennessee Coach Mike DePalmer said. "We hadn't played in three weeks.  When we were up, 4-2, after singles, I was a little bit more at ease because we  haven't lost three doubles matches in about two years."  </P> <P> The only doubles match the Volunteers needed was at No. 2, where Coenie de  Villiers and John Gibson beat Carsten Hoffman and Mike Roberts, 2-6, 6-4, 6-2.  The other two doubles matches were suspended when the Volunteers clinched the  match.  </P></p>

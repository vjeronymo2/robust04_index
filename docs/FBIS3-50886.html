The march began at 1600 in Paseo La Reforma, near the  Child Heroes Monument in Chapultepec. They walked to Bucarelli  Street, moving along Juarez Avenue until reaching Maderos Avenue  and El Zocalo. During their march, they chanted slogans against  the situation in Chiapas State and the North American Free Trade  Agreement.    About 40 buses were impeded by the group, which blocked  traffic on the streets and avenues on its path. Mr. Ricardo  Barco, one of the leaders of the Independent Proletariat  Movement, said a peaceful agreement between the warring sides in  Chiapas was necessary.    There were also two demonstrations in Mexico city during the  morning. A group of university professors picketed outside the  Government Secretariat. With placards and banners, they  protested the violence in Chiapas and the manipulation of Indian  groups in the conflict. Afterward, 150 people from the Mexico  City Neighborhood Assembly demonstrated outside the Televisa  building on Chapultepec Avenue, demanding clear reportage of the  events in Upper Chiapas. This group, headed by Marcos Rasconi  and Javier Hidalgo, members of the Party of the Democratic  Revolution, marched toward the Government Secretariat, where it  joined the group of university professors in a rally.</p>

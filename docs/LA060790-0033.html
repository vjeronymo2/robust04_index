			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: LA MIRADA;  </P> <P> TOY STORE SURRENDERS LEASE FOR PRIME SPOT IN NEW MALL  </P> <P> The city of La Mirada has tentatively settled a toy company lawsuit that had  been one of the hurdles delaying a proposed $130-million commercial and  residential project on a 70-acre tract at La Mirada Boulevard and Rosecrans  Avenue.  </P> <P> The company, Toys 'R' Us, will surrender its long-term lease in the old,  partially demolished La Mirada Mall in exchange for a prime spot in a new  commercial development on the same property, said Don White, director of  economic development for the city's Redevelopment Agency.  </P> <P> Legal fees in the case cost La Mirada about $35,000.  </P> <P> The city is involved in another lease-settlement lawsuit with the El Torito  restaurant chain. Because the restaurant was vacated in February, however, an  anticipated court trial will not delay new construction.  </P></p>

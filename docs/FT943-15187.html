			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Arts (Openings): Savoy Theatre The 1963 musical 'She Loves Me' is about little things - staff squabbles in a 1930s Budapest parfumerie and two correspondents in a Lonely Hearts Club - but it is not a little musical. Written by the team that wrote 'Fiddler on the Roof' (Jerry Bock, music; Sheldon Harnick, lyrics), it has been enjoying a triumphant Broadway revival since last year. Several of the songs - 'Will He Like Me?', 'Dear Friend', 'Ice Cream' - have also been kept famous in concert by Barbara Cook, the original Amalia. 'She Loves Me' opens in London on Tuesday at the Savoy. Scott Ellis, director of the current Broadway staging, directs this one too; the cast is led by John Gordon-Sinclair and Ruthie Henshall.</p>

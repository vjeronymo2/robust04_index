			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / NZ pursues monetary restraint The New Zealand Reserve Bank will continue to lean towards monetary restraint because of the country's strong economic growth, running at 6.1 per cent, the governor, Mr Don Brash, said early today. The Reserve Bank is facing its most testing time since it was placed in charge of monetary policy in 1989 because of strong growth and concerns about inflation pressures. Mr Brash, who has signed a price stability contract with the government under which he must keep inflation below 2 per cent, agreed his 'job was on the line' if his handling of monetary policy failed. He said he had decided against further tightening monetary policy at present because of sharp rises in interest rates over the past two weeks. Short-term rates have risen by around 1.25 points to 10 per cent, matched by a strong lift in the value of the dollar. This followed a statement to market dealers in late November that the bank wanted firmer monetary conditions. 'By enforcing restraint the bank is aiming to ensure more steady and sustained economic growth and avoid the disruptive boom-bust cycle New Zealand has endured in the past, ' Mr Brash said. He told a news conference he expected trading banks would now lift their home mortgage rates, but it was up to them to decide much.</p>

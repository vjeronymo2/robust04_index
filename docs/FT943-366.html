			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Axa to take control of Equitable Axa, the French insurance group, is to take majority control of Equitable, the US life insurer, by the end of this year. News of the move comes shortly after the September 19 expiry of a stand-still agreement between the two companies. Under that deal, Axa had been limited to a 49 per cent interest it acquired in 1992. The deal will take the French group's stake in the US insurer to 60.1 per cent, and heralds the culmination of an ambitious move by Mr Claude Bebear, Axa's chairman, to enter the US life insurance and investment market. The 49 per cent interest, acquired for Dollars 600m at a time when Equitable was struggling under the weight of underperforming junk bond and real estate investments, is worth about Dollars 1.4bn. Axa injected Dollars 1bn in all into Equitable, some in the form of preference shares, as part of a rescue plan for the US insurer. Subject to the approval of Equitable shareholders, the preference shares would be converted into ordinary stock sometime before the end of the year, the US insurer said on Tuesday. The deal effectively brings forward Axa's assumption of full control over the US group. Part of the preference stock was due to convert into ordinary shares next July. The timing of the deal could point to a further injection of capital by Equitable into its core US life insurance subsidiary before the end of this year. At the end of 1993, the US life company had a regulatory capital ratio of 125 per cent, considerably lower than its main competitors. This was due largely to its big real estate holdings. The planned changes to Equitable's capital structure would strengthen its balance sheet and cashflow, said Mr Richard Jenrette. One of his first actions as chairman of the US group had been to negotiate the original deal with Axa. Equitable said it planned to file a shelf registration for Dollars 300m of debt, a move which would further add to its cash resources and increase its ability to inject capital into the life business. Aside from the need to bring its regulatory capital position closer to the level of its competitors, the US life business's demand for additional capital has grown as its business has expanded. Equitable has been one of the most successful US insurers in the variable life and annuities business, one of the fastest-growing parts of the personal investment market.</p>

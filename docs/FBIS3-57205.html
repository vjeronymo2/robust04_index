Lawmakers' indignation was caused by a scandalous arrest in  the Belarusian capital Minsk on January 15 of two leaders of the  banned Communist Party of Lithuania, Mykolas Burokevicius and  Jozas Jarmalavicius, who were on a wanted list in their republic  and their further extradiction from Belarus.    Another scandal followed when interior troops were sent  close  to the building where the parliamentary session was considering  whether the arrest was legal. Lawmaker Ivan Gerasyuk asked the  parliament to clear up on whose orders the troops arrived and  lawmakers demanded to sack the interior minister and the KGB  chief.    The government has adopted the minister's resignation and  decided to inform the parliament on the matter.</p>

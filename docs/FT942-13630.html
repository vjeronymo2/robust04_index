			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Mix 'n' match for new drugs - The Nature of Things / A look at how chemicals are being combined Where will the new drugs of the 21st century come from? Biotechnology industry propaganda might make you assume that the swift pace of genetics research is going to cure many ills. But the source of most of today's medicines, the long 19th and 20th century tradition of organic chemistry, is set to produce pharmaceutical breakthroughs for the foreseeable future. The latest chemical technique, combinatorial chemistry, will enable researchers to generate a previously unimaginable diversity of chemical structures, not known in nature, for testing as potential drugs. Although pharmaceutical researchers like to talk about 'rational drug design', most new drugs originate in the traditional hit-or-miss process of 'screening' as many chemicals as possible for pharmacological activity. Some are synthetic compounds which industry buys in from universities, specialist companies and other sources. Others are naturally occurring chemicals extracted from plants and micro-organisms.( The latter often come from soil samples which researchers collect on holiday. For example, the two drugs used to prevent transplant patients rejecting their new organs, cyclosporine and FK-506, originated in mountainside dirt from Norway and Japan respectively.) As well as screening random compounds, drug companies also test variants of existing medicines, the molecular structures of which have been altered in the hope of producing more powerful pharmacological activity and / or fewer side-effects. Even the largest companies cannot screen more than about 100,000 new compounds a year, using conventional processes. Yet the number of potential combinations that might lead to a useful drug is virtually limitless. Combinatorial chemistry will enable researchers to make compounds for screening at a rate thousands, or even millions, of times faster than anything possible today. They will be able to test billions of new chemical structures. Although only a tiny fraction of these will show any pharmacological effects, the sheer scale of activity is bound to lead to many new drugs. Indeed combinatorial chemistry - or molecular diversity, as the technology is also known - may turn out to be the most important new approach in organic chemistry for many years. It has, however, received little attention beyond a relatively narrow circle of pharmaceutical researchers, partly because few chemists make an effort to communicate with the outside world and partly because most science journalists see chemistry as too boring to produce good stories. Combinatorial chemistry represents something of a break from the traditional philosophy of chemical synthesis, which is devoted to producing a single pure compound in sufficient quantity - at least a milligram - for testing and analysis. The new idea, in contrast, is to make simultaneously the greatest possible variety of compounds in amounts measured in nanograms (millionths of a milligram). That is just enough to screen for biological activity - for example with an enzyme test - using the most sensitive modern techniques. The challenge is not so much how to make a mixture of millions of compounds as how to 'label' each one unambiguously. Then, if it gives positive test results, it can be identified and synthesised in much larger quantities for further investigation and refinement. Combinatorial chemists have invented several different methods for achieving this. A favourite way is to attach the new compounds chemically to the surface of microscopic plastic beads (which are similar in size to animal cells and can be manipulated with the instruments used in cell biology). In bulk, they look like talcum powder. Separately, inert chemical 'tagging molecules' are linked to the beads, to record the series of reactions each bead has undergone. The tags are designed to be removed and decoded easily with standard laboratory instruments. For example, Affymax of Palo Alto, California - a leader in the new wave of start-up companies specialising in combinatorial chemistry - builds up short tagging chains of nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA. Pharmacopoeia, in Princeton, New Jersey, labels its beads with simple molecules containing fluorine and / or chlorine. The combinatorial process starts by dividing the microscopic beads between a number of flasks - say, 20. Each undergoes a different chemical reaction, in which the first molecular building blocks and tags are attached. Then the beads are mixed back together and divided again into 20 vessels to undergo a second set of reactions and tagging. By the time the process has been carried out five times, there are 20 x 20 x 20 x 20 x 20 different chemical combinations on the beads. That makes 3.2m new compounds, each with distinctive tags showing which reactions it has undergone. The reactions chosen will depend on what sort of 'chemical library' the researchers want to create. Early work has concentrated on a relatively simple combinatorial project: building up compounds called peptides (miniature proteins) from different combinations of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. But chemists are now designing combinatorial reaction schemes for other chemical families, including the types of small molecule that are the mainstay of the pharmaceutical industry. One sign of excitement is the flow of American venture capital into small companies specialising in combinatorial chemistry. The large, established pharmaceutical companies are also starting to exploit the technology. Although combinatorial chemistry is already beginning to boost chemists' confidence, it is too soon for it to have produced any proven drugs. However, by generating billions of new compounds over the next few years, the technology will undoubtedly throw up useful medicines that would never have emerged through traditional screening or biotechnology.</p>

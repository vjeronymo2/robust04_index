			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Ecus surge ahead - Scheherazade Daneshkhu on their attractions IS IT now time to get serious about the Ecu (European Currency Unit)? Once a curiosity in the foreign exchange markets, Ecu-denominated funds have expanded considerably over the past few years. As well as Ecu bonds, there are now Ecu deposit accounts, Ecu gilts, Ecu-denominated managed funds, even Ecu cheque accounts - but, of course, still no Ecu cash. While the continuing recession, plus political and economic uncertainties caused by the coming UK general election, have made the fate of the pound uncertain, British investors with sterling-denominated accounts may be wondering if the Ecu is a safer haven for their funds. The value of the Ecu is fixed as a weighted basket of the value of the currencies of the 12 European Community member countries. Each of these currencies is pegged within the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System (EMS). The present exchange rate of the Ecu is around 1.4 to the pound. The main feature of the ECU is that its value is roughly an average of the EC currencies. It cannot perform as well as the healthiest currency but it cannot do as badly as the weakest. Since sterling is the weakest member of the ERM, then a switch into Ecu deposits holds out the possibility that the value of an investor's funds will rise if the pound then devalues. There are, however, obvious risks. If sterling is not devalued and is, instead, defended by a rise in British interest rates, then the investor who switches into Ecus will lose out. Over five years, high UK interest rates made the average growth in offshore sterling funds 68 per cent compared with 41.5 per cent for Ecu funds. Last year's cut in interest rates meant that Ecu returns were more competitive over one year: 9.9 per cent against 10.6 per cent for sterling. There is also a long-term point. It is one thing to hold dollars in the knowledge that you will be packing up to go to the US when you retire, but quite another to hold your assets in one currency and your liabilities in another. You are vulnerable to exchange rate rises and falls on income and capital. But those who hold two or three European currencies already are likely to find it makes sense to hold Ecu funds as a way of equalising risk between the different currencies. Howard Flight, managing director of Guiness Flight Global Asset Management, describes the Ecu as a 'valid vehicle for someone who wants middle-of-the-road European currency block exposure.' For the private investor, one attractive way of holding Ecu funds is in an offshore fund where interest is rolled-up within the fund instead of being paid out. Although this does not avoid liability to tax, it can postpone the evil day. You will not be taxed until you decide to redeem your investment (wholly or in part), but the advantage is that you choose when to do this. If, for instance, you are a higher-rate taxpayer, you can wait until retirement when you would become a basic rate-payer. At the moment, Rothschild Asset Management is paying 9.77 per cent on its sterling offshore roll-up funds and 9.73 per cent on its Ecu funds. There is no minimum deposit. Fidelity Investments also has an Ecu money fund. The gross yield is 9.7 per cent compared with 9.9 per cent on the sterling fund, and interest is paid gross. You can decide whether to have it accumulated or paid out at six-monthly intervals. There is no minimum investment and an annual 1 per cent management charge. If you are a UK resident, you will have to pay income tax on the interest. Investors who prefer government bonds can buy the 10-year Ecu gilt issued last year by the UK government and yielding around 8.4 per cent. But the Ecu gilts do not enjoy the favourable tax treatment of sterling-denominated bonds, which are exempt from capital gains tax. The income is paid gross but must be declared for tax purposes. Minimum investment is Ecu1,000 and both interest (paid annually) and eventual redemption (in 2001) are payable through agents - usually the large international banks and financial houses which trade in the bonds  - in Ecus. You would need to set up a currency account with your bank, denominated in Ecus, to receive the proceeds of the investment. The large banks will open Ecu current and deposit accounts but these are usually subject to a much higher minimum deposit than for sterling. The National Westminster bank, for example, requires a minimum deposit of the equivalent of Pounds 1,000 in Ecus. Although the Ecu market has grown, particularly in the corporate sector, it is still a long way from being the everyday Euro-currency dreamed-of by its supporters.</p>

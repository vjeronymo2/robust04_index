			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Observer: Opting in How does the recipient of a Pounds 250,000 salary make it sound as if he's setting a trend in modest executive rewards? Alan Bowkett, new chief at Berisford, explains that by putting in over Pounds 1m of his own money - subscribing for 6m new shares at 19p, a 2p premium over Tuesday's close - he's more than covering four years' salary. But is that quite the point? Bowkett, famed for flogging United Precision Industries to the Japanese at a vast profit in 1990, may be showing faith in his ability to breathe new life into the Berisford shell. But the up-front investment has also secured him a very nice options package if all goes well: 6.25m shares under the company scheme at a price of 16p (attractive even if all goes only passably well); and a further 16m shares under certain favourable conditions if the share price tops 50p in the next two or three years. He was off to a propitious start yesterday with the shares closing at a high of 20p.</p>

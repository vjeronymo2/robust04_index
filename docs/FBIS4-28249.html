			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 9 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  said Thursday the tension over North Korea's refusal of  international inspections at its nuclear reactor is in a "very  severe" state, expressing deepening concerns about the  deteriorating dispute.    Hata told a session of the House of Councillors Budget  Committee that global apprehension is rising because of North  Korea's failure to respond to the international call for a full  inspection of its nuclear facilities.    "Japan should make the proper, possible response, keeping in  step with the international community. The current state is  very severe," he said.    North Korea has been recalcitrant in its refusal of  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) at  the nuclear complex at Yongbyon to determine if nuclear fuel has  been diverted to make atomic bombs.    Hata said Japan should play an active role in solving the  issue.    At the committee session, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa  said  Japan will continue to seek a peaceful solution.    Frustrated by North Korea's stubborn stance, the United  States is now seeking sanctions against the country, either by  the UN Security Council, or if such a move is thwarted by a  China veto, in coordination with its allies like Japan and South  Korea.    "North Korea seems to have no intention to resort to a  military counterattack (against sanctions)," Kakizawa said.    "It is important to try to persuade North Korea to change  its  stance...While avoiding any provocative language," he added.    Kakizawa also said he will try to talk China into toeing the  international line on the issue during his forthcoming visit to  Beijing.    "I hope for joint action with China's participation," he  said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Large urban hospitals lose 0.6 percent because, as a group, they have the smallest percentage of hospitals that are reclassified, fewer than 6 percent. There are enough hospitals in other urban areas that are reclassified to limit the decline in payments to this groups to 0.1 percent. Consequently, their payments are reduced by the budget neutrality factor. Among urban hospital groups generally, payments fall between 0.3 and 0.5 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Among hospitals grouped by reclassification status during FY 1994 and FY 1995, the changes are predictable. Hospitals reclassified for FY 1994 but not for FY 1995 experience lower payments when reclassification is taken into account compared to the previous column. Because the rural payment rate now equals the other urban amount, the loss of reclassification is not as detrimental in rural areas. Payments to formerly reclassified rural hospitals fall by 0.5 percent, compared to a decline of 1.1 percent for urban hospitals reclassified in FY 1994 but not in FY 1995. Significant positive impacts are evident for hospitals reclassified for FY 1995. Rural hospitals reclassified for FY 1995 that were not reclassified for FY 1994 experience a 6.0 percent payment increase, and rural hospitals reclassified during both years experience an 8.5 percent increase.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table II compares reclassified hospital payments for FY 1995 with payment levels that assume reclassified hospitals are paid on the basis of their geographic location rather than reclassified location. The difference between Table II and Column 5 in Table I is that the simulations in Table II incorporate all of the policy changes we are proposing for FY 1995, as well as the statutory changes, before and after reclassification. Specifically, Column 5 in Table I does not include the outlier change enacted by section 13501(c) of Public Law 103&hyph;66. This change is reflected in the simulations in Table II.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Arts: After the coal face - Radio MINERS (Radio 4, Tuesday) was the second of three programmes about four young men made redundant by the closure of their pit, Houghton Main, 'the focal point' of Darfield village in Yorkshire, where they live. Each has some Pounds 20,000 redundancy money but, as they tell the presenter, Allan Beswick, don't want to invest in stocks and shares or start a new business. At the moment, three have work, salvaging or under contract at nearby pits, not likely to last long; the third has an injured thumb. Their wives are more talkative than they, with notions about Range Rovers and starting a new business, so that in two months their men could have nice white hands: spending priorities, modest enough for people with Pounds 20,000 or so in hand, are holiday, car, redecorate the bedroom. The men, who have never known anything but mining, find nothing else interesting and anyway are against risks. 'I hate the dole office,' one said; asked what wages he would expect, he entered 'Pounds 210 a week,' what he was used to. 'I'd rather give the money back and be my own man,' was typical. 'I'm not proud of the industry - they can do what they want, I'm not bothered.' On Thursday, Radio 4 dealt again with current problems in The Enemy Within. Presented by Marek Kohn, about drugs, but historical rather than critical. There were references to Police-Sergeant Lyle and jazz drummer Flash Winston in the 1950s (who they?); but before them we went back to Coleridge, de Quincey and others who used laudanum, including Gladstone and Mrs Beeton. The 1868 Pharmacy Act boosted the 'opium dens'; then we turned to fiction, with a reading from Dorian Gray and a sketch of Dr Fu Manchu. Marijuana became more prevalent after the end of the 1914-18 war, with Club Eleven (Winston's joint) notorious. Some black immigrants retained theit accustomed habits. Of inside knowledge of current drug usage, hardly a word; any day's broadsheet newspaper will probably tell more. It isn't likely that Radio 1 FM was influenced by Plato's Symposium on Radio 3 last Sunday, but on Monday it had the first Loud and Proud, a programme dedicated to gays and lesbians - I use the current words as in the programme. I heard the first quarter-hour, but felt the atmosphere too private, mates swopping their own affairs. We were told the best places in Glasgow for pick-ups (though Paulette, the presenter, is a Manchester girl), and how you could distinguish your targets. A teacher said he reckoned one schoolchild in ten was potentially gay; it was proposed that sex education in schools should include the question. I dare say a fair number of gays and lesbians listened, out of curiosity if nothing else, but apart from the tips to likely scenes they would not have found it very helpful, still less amusing. How many listeners to Loud and Proud heard Radio 3's Sunday play, The Leftover Heart by Andrew Alty? It has a similar theme, but used in a more less frivolous way. Its hero, Tom, is based on Tennessee Williams; he is a successful writer, lives on booze and tablets, has a craving for young men, and a sister, Rose, in a home for the insane. The family details are like those that are known; the fiction woven around them is simple. Tom is visited in a Chicago hotel by Johnny, a young man from a dating agency, who reveals that, 20 years before, Tom had slept with his mother in Kansas City, that they are, in fact, father and son. Tom decides to quit writing, to settle down with Johnny, to sack his long-established secretary Vi (a man). But guilty recollections of poor mad Rose, interpolated as anachronistic interludes, are too hard for him; and Vi persuades Johnny that his hopes will prove optimistic. So Vi is back, Johnny is out, and Tom is writing again. Not a very convincing tale, and only moderately played under Miriam Segal's direction.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Hachette-Matra merger plan outlined by chairman A PLAN to merge the Hachette publishing group and Matra, the missiles and electronics maker, was outlined yesterday by Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, the chairman of both companies. 'I am reflecting today on integrated financial structures which could unify the group without weakening control over it,' Mr Lagardere told La Tribune de l'Expansion, a French newspaper. The plan, designed to allow cash to flow more freely between the two French companies, received a sceptical response from analysts, who argued that it produced few clear benefits apart from making both companies perhaps more resistant to hostile takeover than they already are. Both are majority controlled by Mr Lagardere and shareholders loyal to him. The scheme would create a group with FFr54.3bn (Pounds 5.55bn) sales and FFr1.1bn net profits based on their 1990 accounts, which showed group net profits of FFr492m on turnover of FFr30bn for Hachette and FFr606m of profits on sales of FFr24.3bn for Matra. However, Hachette swung into loss in the first half of last year and faces heavy losses at La Cinq, its 25 per cent owned television station, which is seeking a rescue after filing for bankruptcy. Matra announced a steep profits decline over the same period, hit by falling demand for defence and telecommunications products. 'In these businesses, continuity, independence and long-term strategy are indispensable and one cannot build in the fear of a hostile bid,' said Mr Lagardere. Once La Cinq's problems were settled, both companies would be very profitable, he said. 'The objective is not to cover the possible losses of one by the profits of the other, but to allow cash flow to circulate to invest in the most promising domains,' Mr Lagardere explained. Officials at Hachette and Matra made it clear that there was no timetable and that the project was in its initial stages. Mr Lagardere pointed out that Hachette's share of La Cinq's expected FFr1.12bn losses for last year would be covered by the FFr2.5bn profit from the sale by Hachette of the Paris headquarters of its NMPP press distribution company. Mr Lagardere described Hachette and Matra as a 'two-headed eagle' and argued that they had been unable to draw the benefit of belonging to the same group. He bought a stake in Hachette in 1980, and wanted to merge it with Matra at the time. But Matra was nationalised a year later by the first Socialist government, to be privatised again by the Gaullist administration in 1987. Today, Hachette and Matra are linked through Mr Lagardere's private holding group, MMB, the ultimate owner of controlling stakes in both.</p>

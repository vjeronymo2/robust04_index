			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE COLLEGES;  </P> <P> COLLEGE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> FLENER PITCHES TITANS PAST PEPPERDINE, 7-2  </P> <P> Huck Flener allowed seven hits over 7 1/3 innings and Cal State Fullerton made  the most of its opportunities to post a 7-2 victory Tuesday at Pepperdine.  </P> <P> Flener, a sophomore left-hander, improved to 4-0 by holding Pepperdine (9-8-1)  scoreless until the sixth inning. By then, the Titans had taken a 7-0 lead.  </P> <P> The Titans took a 2-0 lead in the first inning when Rex Peters doubled home one  run and scored the other. Peters has a hit in all 17 Fullerton games this  season.  </P> <P> Fullerton (11-6) scored three times in the third, thanks in part to pitcher  John Kuzmic's wildness.  </P> <P> Kuzmic hit Mate Borgogno with a pitch to open the inning, committed a balk and  threw a wild pitch before walking Peters and Brent Mayne. David Staton hit a  two-run single and later scored on a double by Randy Graves.  </P> <P> Borgogno singled home a run in the sixth and scored on Mayne's sacrifice fly to  cap the Titans' scoring.  </P> <P> Flener left with runners on first and third and one out in the eighth. But  Chris Robinson got Jim Doyle to hit into a double play, then struck out two  batters in pitching a perfect ninth inning.  </P> <P> In a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. baseball game:  </P> <P> Chapman College 9, Cal State Northridge 3 -- Rod Turner hit two home runs and  had three RBIs, and Mike Grahovac knocked in two runs with two doubles for  visiting Chapman (10-10, 4-1). David Bird pitched his third consecutive  complete game in conference play. Northridge is 10-3, 3-2.  </P> <P> In men's college tennis.  </P> <P> UC Irvine 8, North Carolina State 1 -- Host Irvine, ranked seventh nationally,  swept the singles competition. At No. 1, Trevor Kronemann defeated Alfonso  Ochoa, 6-4, 6-2, for his sixth victory in a row. At No. 2, Mark Kaplan beat  Glen Philp, 6-3, 6-2, and at No. 3, Mike Briggs beat Eddie Gonzalez, 6-4, 6-4.  </P></p>

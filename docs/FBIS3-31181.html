According to Mr. Daskalov, the meeting was useful and the  participants expressed a wish to hold, if necessary, similar  meetings in future as well.    The main issues discussed at the meeting were how the  neighbouring countries could help the solution of the crisis in  the former Yugoslavia and the impact of the Yugo-embargo on  them. A report was circulated unofficially estimating the  Yugo-embargo losses sustained by the neighbouring countries,  Foreign Minister Daskalov said. Each of the participating  countries is to make its comments on this report.    Bulgaria has invariably been for a peaceful solution and  non-intervention in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. But  should the need arise to resort to restricted air strikes as an  extreme measure, these should meet a number of conditions, the  Bulgarian foreign minister said regarding the NATO ultimatum.  According to him, these conditions are that the air strikes  result in no casualties among the peaceful population, that they  do not lead to the spread of the conflict and that they do not  threaten neighbouring states.    At the meeting no one gave guarantees that neighbouring  countries would not be affected, Foreign Minister Daskalov said.</p>

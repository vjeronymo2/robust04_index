			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Dixons counts the cost of Silo closures: With competition hotting up analysts remain sceptical about formula for change THE REPUTATION of the US as the graveyard for UK retailers' ambitions looks set to continue after Dixons' announcement yesterday of increasing losses and higher-than-expected closure provisions at Silo, its US offshoot. When Dixons acquired Philadelphia-based Silo in 1987 for Dollars 320m (then about Pounds 200m) it was one of four rapidly-growing 'power retailers', specialist superstore chains which were making substantial inroads into a Dollars 40bn electrical goods market long dominated by independent traders and department stores. However, the US then went into recession and Silo, which had over-expanded, found itself unable to compete with powerful rivals such as Circuit City and Best Buy. Silo's losses increased this year from Pounds 16.9m to Pounds 22.4m, and Dixons' group pre-tax profits were further depressed by Pounds 36.2m of exceptional costs for closing 56 Silo stores. One analyst, otherwise positive about Dixons' prospects, recently parodied the poet Sir John Betjeman, urging 'Come friendly bombs and fall on Silo.' Dixons has been struggling hard to inject its own skills in buying, systems, management and customer service into the chain, but has little to show for its efforts. It did, however, claim many markets showed an improvement in sales last year, with the overall results being dragged down by falls in sales in its largest markets, especially California. In the past year it has taken more aggressive steps. In February, it replaced Mr Robert Sirkis, Silo's American president, with Mr Peter Morris, previously Dixons' group property director. That move came only weeks after Dixons announced the closure of 45 stores - nearly a fifth of the total - in Illinois, Tennessee, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Kentucky and Oklahoma. They accounted for 37 per cent of Silo's markets but only 11 per cent of sales. It has since closed a further five stores, and 11 more will go in the coming year. The recovery plan now has three main elements. One is revamping existing stores, doubling the space given to the computer/home office departments. In-store product service departments are being added to many stores, as are car radio and alarm fitting bays. The second element is closing many of the smaller, poorly-located stores, and replacing them with new superstores, of between 20,000 and 30,000 sq ft, parallelling what Dixons is doing successfully with its Currys chain in the UK. That would mean the chain gradually shrinking from its current 185 stores. Thirdly, Silo is experimenting with new formats to form the basis of that superstore expansion. Four stores in Rochester, New York State, have been refurbished and renamed YES - Your Electronics Store. As the name suggests, the stores concentrate heavily on electronics, and white goods have been dropped. New brands have been added to Silo's usual range to add 'authority'. Silo is experimenting with a second store revamp formula in Chicago, although the name has not been changed, and white goods are retained. Dixons said it wants to give the reforms at least until early next year before assessing their success. But analysts remain sceptical about Dixons' chances, especially with competition increasing in its biggest California and Chicago markets. Mr John Clare, managing director, said underlying improvements so far have convinced Dixons that it can turn Silo around 'over time'. 'But we well understand that we cannot continue as a company to see a situation where Silo makes significant losses year after year.' Mr Nick Bubb, retail analyst at Morgan Stanley, estimates the cost of closing Silo at a prohibitive Pounds 150m. But if there are no signs of improvement before the half-year results in January, he suggests 'major surgery' may be necessary. Dixons, he said, may eventually have no alternative but to make a 'slow, miserable retreat'. See Lex</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Willink Leans Toward `Purple' for </F> the Time Being"]    [Excerpt] Tjeenk Willink, who is assessing on behalf of the  crown whether a proposed cabinet formation will succeed, will be  speaking today with the chairmen of the PvdA [Labor Party], the  VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy], and the D66  [Democrats 66] about the formation of a "purple" coalition  comprising these three parties. For the time being, the CDA  [Christian Democratic Appeal] will not be taking part in the  discussions.    Together with the party leaders Kok, Bolkestein, and Van  Mierlo, Tjeenk Willink wants to establish whether there is  sufficient political will for a three-party government without  the Christian Democrats. On Monday [9 May], the day on which  Willinks received all the party leaders from the Second Chamber,  Kok and Bolkestein, in particular, were still expressing doubts  about a coalition of this kind.    From the round of talks held yesterday, the possibility of a  "purple" coalition emerged as the "greatest common denominator."  Especially D66 leader Van Mierlo, his CDA colleague Brinkman,  and the Green Left leader Rosenmoeller were clearly of the  opinion that only a government including the PvdA, the VVD, and  the D66 should be given a chance. Several smaller parties also  expressed a similar opinion to Willink.    Following his talks with Tjeenk Willink, PvdA leader Kok  said  that he was prepared to assess over the next few days as to  whether such a "purple" coalition is possible. However, he  explained that he could not cry victory. "I am not convinced  that there is sufficient support for a coalition of this kind,"  he said.    Kok said that he could see "substantial bottlenecks,"  particularly regarding cooperation with the VVD, "not only  regarding the social issues, but also on the subjects of  immigration and integration, development aid, and the  environment. It is not a question of political will, as Van  Mierlo says, but of the objective possibility of the PvdA and  the VVD joining forces. This must first be a possibility.  Sometimes differences are too great to be bridged."    In his reaction to this, Van Mierlo said: "First you must  want to do something, then you can decide how to bring it about.  We all have the key to this affair, and we can all make it  fail." The D66 leader does not regard the fact that Kok is  acting in such a reserved manner as "writing on the wall."    "It is a question of those parties slowly getting used to  the  idea. The past of the PvdA and the VVD is simply rooted in the  self-evidence of the presence of the CDA [in government]. The  PvdA and the VVD are used to distrusting each other in the  formation, with one playing on the left wing of the CDA, and the  other on the right. That distrust must gradually disappear, and  it must do so soon," Van Mierlo claimed.    VVD party chairman Bolkestein did not want to make any  comments on his talk with Willink. The liberals have always  spoken out in favor of a coalition between the two winning  parties, the VVD and the D66, complemented by one of the losing  government parties. Bolkestein has always desisted from stating  a preference for the PvdA or the CDA. However, during the  election campaign, the rift between the VVD and the PvdA grew  larger rather than smaller. "Our program, and that proposed by  Kok, are two extremes," Bolkestein said, for example, referring  to the paragraph on employment in the VVD and the PvdA  platforms.    Furthermore, Bolkestein considers the total of cuts that the  PvdA intends to make in the upcoming period of government,  approximately nine billion guilders, to be too low. He has said  that the VVD will not enter into the government if the amount  set aside for rationalization remains stuck at between 8 and 10  billion.    CDA leader Brinkman reiterated to Tjeenk Willink that the  CDA, in view of its loss of 20 out of 54 seats, would prefer him  to look into the possibility of a "purple" coalition.    Tjeenk Willink has taken it upon himself to give his opinion  to Queen Beatrix on around 17 May, the day on which the Second  Chamber is established. By then, Willink expects to be able to  present three potential government parties that have committed  themselves to "undertake to make an effort," as well as a list  of matters for which it has been decided a settlement must be  found.

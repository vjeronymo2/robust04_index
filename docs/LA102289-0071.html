			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. REMODELING OUTPACES NEW HOME CONSTRUCTION  </P> <P> Americans are on a multibillion-dollar home remodeling binge that will soon  find them spending more to fix up old houses than to build new ones, according  to a survey released Wednesday.  </P> <P> The favorite remodeling target is the kitchen, followed by bathrooms, room  additions and porch enclosures, according to Professional Builder magazine,  which published the survey.  </P> <P> This year Americans will spend $104.7 billion on remodeling for both  professional and do-it-yourself projects, an economist for the magazine  estimated. That compares to a projection of $139.7 billion for residential  construction in 1989.  </P> <P> At some point, probably in the mid-'90s, the remodeling figure will outstrip  spending for new construction, the magazine said.  </P> <P> One factor in the trend is that 60% of the homes in the United States were  built prior to 1970. In addition many are owned by members of the post-World  War II "baby boom" generation who have money to spend and are attached to the  neighborhoods and schools in areas where they live.  </P> <P> According to the survey, which covered a representative sample of 819 home  owners, the average home remodeling project will cost $5,000 next year and the  most expensive project, a room addition, will cost an average of $15,000.  </P></p>

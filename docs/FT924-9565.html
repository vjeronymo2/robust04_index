			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Late payment of bills endangers companies' survival, says survey BRITISH INDUSTRY remains locked into a 'vicious circle' of late payment of bills which is endangering the survival of increasing numbers of businesses. A survey of more than 800 companies by Trade Indemnity, the credit insurance group, shows that in spite of moves intended to change corporate attitudes, delaying the payment of bills is still widespread. According to Trade Indemnity, none of the companies it approached said it was typically paid on time, with the average payment almost four weeks late. Nearly a quarter of the companies said they had to wait 30 days or more beyond the stated payment date. Some recorded delays of up to 80 days. Mr Clive Brand, Trade Indemnity's senior economist, said the survey highlighted a 'cultural problem throughout industry from which no company or industry escapes'. 'Those who are badly hit by the problem often have no choice but to adopt the same approach in order to relieve their own cash flow problems,' he added. Mr Brand said smaller companies continued to be hit hardest, but noted that overseas customers were also guilty of late payment. Delays in payment by export customers cast a shadow over the expected benefits from the devaluation of sterling. The survey said the sectors worst hit by late payment were engineering, paper and printing, timber, motor manufacturing and chemicals. The average value of debts at least 30 days outstanding is now Pounds 120,000, compared with Pounds 102,000 in June. In the last Budget, the chancellor announced measures to tackle the problem, including the financing of three pilot schemes within trade associations to provide late payment 'hot lines' for members. Large companies will also have to state in their accounts how quickly they pay their bills.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (13): Take your time - things are changing - Life assurance In the bad old days, when there were fewer controls on the way life insurance was sold, it was easier for a sales agent to influence a customer who sounded interested but wanted to postpone the decision. One way of injecting urgency into proceedings might be to invite a potential client to consider his family's circumstances if, without having bought a policy, he were to die immediately after the sales agent's departure. The case for people with dependants to have cover remains powerful. But the life insurance industry is in such a state of uncertainty at the moment that there may well be a case for delaying any decisions that can reasonably be left for a while. One important change in the industry is the new requirement that life company sales agents and advisers volunteer to their customers more information about the policies they sell and the charges that the customer will be required to pay. This rule comes into effect from January 1. In response, many life companies have either already launched new ranges of products, or will do so before the end of the year. The new disclosure regime highlights not only the charges attached to a policy but also the amount that customers will receive if they give up a long-term plan in the first few years. So life companies are working hard to cut their costs. This should mean that customers get better value, because, out of premiums paid, more is invested and less is taken out in charges. While cost-cutting is common across just about all life companies, some life insurers are also increasing the surrender values in the early years. Standard Life, for example, will be offering a better deal to customers who need to surrender a policy prematurely, though in some cases this will mean a small reduction in what they would receive were the policy to run its full term. Other companies are rationalising their product ranges by deciding not to sell policies that are not popular or which are too inflexible. Norwich Union, for example, is hastening the disappearance of its conventional with-profits policies in favour of unitised with-profits policies. While, in terms of what the customer receives, there may seem to be little difference between the two, unitised policies allow the insurer to introduce flexible commission arrangements, which give independent advisers and their customers more choice about how the charges are made. Further changes seek to make products more straightforward. These can include 'unbundling' - the separation into two distinct, but complementary, products of the protection and investment elements that make up packaged life insurance products. For example, the TSB group said that, from the start of last month, it would consider customers' life insurance requirements separately from savings, and that its range of products, such as term (or pure protection) insurance, would be an average 20 per cent cheaper than before. Overall, the changes to products should give better value for money: so if a decision can be delayed until the new year, it may well be worth waiting.</p>

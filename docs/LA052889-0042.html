			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HISTORICAL SOCIETY  </P> <P> I'd like to respond to some statements in the article (Part I, May 12) about  the meeting of the 70 California Historical Society members, librarians and  historians called to discuss the closure of the CHS library, among other  things. A coalition called the Friends of the California Historical Society was  formed, whose goal is to re-open the library and stop the sale of its Whittier  Mansion headquarters.  </P> <P> This group of concerned people is not, as Nancy Maushardt (president of the  board of trustees of CHS) said, mostly "loyalists to former executive director  (James) Holliday." He did not call the meeting, and most of us never met him  before. He was just one of many people that night who spoke up and gave an  opinion. Mrs. Maushardt herself was invited to the meeting.  </P> <P> Also in the article she stated " . . . This group has possibly a different  philosophy on how the society should be run. I'm a fiscal conservative. I don't  believe in running deficits." Well, neither do we. We, as members, want to  investigate how the society got into its deficit position. I personally believe  that it's due to a lack of proper fund-raising and incompetent management of  funds.  </P> <P> CHS is a membership organization, and the members would like to have input into  how the society is run. With the current board of trustees, we have been left  in the dark.  </P> <P> DEBRA RICHARDS  </P> <P> San Francisco  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> IF JACK CLARK RETURNS, AT LEAST ONE FAN WON'T  </P> <P> It seems that most Padre fans automatically, without question, assume that Tony  Gwynn is being unfairly critized by his teammates.  </P> <P> They base these assumptions on the fact that he has been an outstanding player  and has had a high profile in the community.  </P> <P> I don't pretend to have any first-hand knowledge of the Padre locker-room  situation, nor do any of the fans who automatically support Tony. I do know  that the Padre fans were fooled once before. Remember, we were led to believe  that Steve Garvey was the clean-cut, all-American boy. That image was certainly  shattered, so let's reserve judgment on the Gwynn or Padre situation.  </P> <P> BILL TAPP, San Diego  </P></p>

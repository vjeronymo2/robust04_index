			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source has revealed that the  government will broach the issue of the joint waters of the  al-Yarmuk River with Syria after reaching an agreement with  Israel in the talks slated to be held in the region next month.    The source, which requested anonymity, added that Jordan  feels that it is being done an injustice by the Syrian  practices, particularly since Syria is monopolizing the use of  the al-Yarmuk River tributaries by building dams on them. The  source noted that Jordan was sympathetic with the Syrian  position before the start of the peace process. But, now, Syria  must seriously examine our grievances, the source said.</p>

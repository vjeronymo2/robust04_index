			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Alexon warns of downturn DISAPPOINTING sales of Dash leisure wear led Alexon Group to issue a profit warning yesterday, and the share price fell a further 27p to 98p. At that level it is less than a quarter of the 444p high hit in September last year, a few months after its demerger from Claremont Garments (Holdings), the Marks and Spencer supplier. Alexon said that although autumn trading started well, sales had been disappointing since September 16, particularly in Dash. Analysts downgraded their profit forecasts from Pounds 7m to about Pounds 4m pre-tax, against last year's Pounds 11.3m. They also pencilled in a dividend cut. One forecast that the final would be cut from 7.6p to 3p.</p>

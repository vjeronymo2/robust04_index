			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Doubts about Mr Delors THE WEEK that has passed since the narrow rejection of the Maastricht Treaty by the Danish people has generated far more heat than light. This was inevitable. But light there has been, nonetheless. It seems clear, first, that the European Community cannot make progress without ratifying something not too different from the Maastricht Treaty; second, that some modifications to, or reinterpretation of, that treaty may be needed; and, third, that securing the necessary ratification will be difficult. In so delicate a situation, many might wish for a cessation of normal business, while the EC grapples with its internal crisis. The EC has no such luxury. Two pieces of business, in particular, are so interlinked with hopes of ratification that they must be confronted head on. These are the futures, respectively, of the EC budget and of Mr Jacques Delors. Mr Delors has been the principal protagonist of 'more Europe' since his appointment in 1984. A far-sighted, yet practical visionary, nobody, be he devoted friend or enraged foe, can fail to respect his clarity and his courage. But he has made enemies, partly because of his zeal for the cause, but also because of the way he has lectured ministers and heads of government as if they were children. He has lost none of his outspokenness. Yesterday in his speech to the European Parliament he chided the finance ministers of the richer EC nations for their failure to accept the fiscal implications of the Maastricht commitment. 'There cannot be political union,' he opined, 'if it is not founded on a bloc which is economically and socially unified and coherent.' Debatable view The economics of this view are debatable. An economic and monetary union can be combined with huge discrepancies in standards of living, provided differences in productivity are reflected in wages. But the politics are rather different. Poorer countries on the periphery of Europe insist that a political union implies a commitment to narrowing of income differences. They also insist that the pain of inflationary convergence and lower fiscal deficits needs to be eased if their still fragile polities are to survive the strain. They are quite probably right. It is, in any case, difficult to accept that the budget increase Mr Delors is proposing, from a ceiling of 1.2 per cent of the EC's gross national product to one of 1.37 per cent, can be a serious obstacle. Having swallowed the camel of economic and monetary union, the finance ministers are straining at gnats. Flood of directives As so often before, Mr Delors is doing little more than pointing out the logical consequences of the governments' own purposes. The same applies, as he noted, to the flood of directives, most of which have been necessitated by the single market programme. Even where the EC has most irritated particular member states - over fiscal harmonisation, for example, or the social charter - it has done so only as the mouthpiece for other governments. Even if Mr Delors has done little more than try to put the agreed goal of European union into practice, his reappointment for a further two-year term is not necessarily wise. The problem now facing the EC is how to secure ratification of a treaty that the Danes have already rejected. Failure to secure a treaty at all would be disastrous for the EC's credibility. But reopening the treaty would take a great deal of time and might fail altogether. The most plausible strategy for getting over the present quagmire rests on making the notion of 'subsidiarity' more credible. The British are not alone in objecting to the way the Commission probes into the 'nooks and crannies' of national life. German officials are saying the same thing, partly to bring the Danes back into the fold. Mr Delors speaks the same language. He told the Parliament that he wants to make the EC more open and accountable, to secure extension of respect for national diversity and to clear up the debate about sovereignty. This is, indeed, the right way forward. The question is whether Mr Delors, a man inescapably, however unfairly, identified with the aggrandisement of Brussels, can convince the parliaments and peoples of Europe of this apparently new direction. Mr Delors' arguments are, as always, worth listening to. The question governments must ask is for how long he can remain the best person in the EC to express them.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As demands on adults' time continue to escalate_with more people working longer hours, commuting greater distances, and coping with day care and elder care issues_the traditional, tutorial/classroom-based approach to adult education may not be the best mechanism, in many cases, for attracting and retaining adult education students. Incorporating new technologies into adult literacy programs may be one way to address the time constraints of the adult education student. The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) found in a 1993 study that technology could help transform the field of adult literacy by, for example, allowing students to proceed at their own pace, customize their studies, and establish a schedule that is compatible with their daily lives. However, OTA also suggested that technology does not play a central role in most adult literacy programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Should the Federal Government encourage the use of more technology in adult literacy programs? If so, how can technology of proven effectiveness in enhancing learning be incorporated in cost-effective ways that learners will find beneficial?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Linking Adult Education to Other Domestic Initiatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In recent years, policymakers have begun to turn to adult education services as a means of addressing other societal problems, for example, requiring participation in literacy programs for prison parole, continuation of welfare benefits, or, through Even Start, making adult literacy instruction a component of elementary and secondary education improvement. Should the Adult Education Act continue to address very general purposes, or should it be tied explicitly to national efforts to redevelop poor neighborhoods, end welfare dependency, fight crime, or ensure a smooth integration of new immigrants into American society? If the Adult Education Act is linked to other domestic initiatives, should the Act be revised to reflect the impact that mandatory participation requirements of certain programs, such as JOBS, have on adult education programs?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. State Literacy Resource Centers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Literacy Act created the State Literacy Resource Centers program to stimulate the coordination of literacy services, enhance the capacity of State and local organizations to provide literacy services, and serve as a link between the National Institute for Literacy and service providers to share information and expertise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Are State Literacy Resource Centers effective at meeting the goals of the Act? What steps, if any, should be taken at the Federal level to improve the effectiveness of the Centers? Should the funds allotted under this program continue to be channeled through State Governors?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Discretionary Programs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current law authorizes several discretionary grant programs. Most of these programs are small and fund a limited number of recipients. Although the purpose of the programs is generally the demonstration of effective strategies for addressing particular issues or problems, funds often support local projects that, while beneficial to the recipients, are not designed in a way to yield lessons for broader use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> What role should Adult Education discretionary programs play in helping the Nation achieve its education goals? Would these resources be more effectively utilized under broader authorities, such as the Adult Education State formula grant program? Do the current programs encourage a piecemeal, rather than comprehensive, approach to adult education reform (with service providers devoting too much attention to applying for and administering separate competitive grants), or do they focus attention where it is needed? If there is a need for Federal demonstration programs, what changes are needed to ensure that they are designed as true demonstrations and serve their purposes effectively? What types of evaluation and reporting ought to be required?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Workplace Literacy Partnerships <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At current funding levels, the National Workplace Literacy program makes discretionary grants for demonstrations that provide literacy training to meet workplace needs. Since its inception in 1988, this demonstration program has generated important information about effective workplace literacy practices. The program has produced curricula transferable for use by specific types of industries, and a national evaluation, currently underway, will generate additional information about program effectiveness. However, after eight years and 261 grants the continuation of the National Workplace Literacy program, in its current form, may not appreciably add to our base of knowledge in this area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / International Company News: French insurance industry braced for tough year THE FRENCH insurance industry is poised for another difficult year in 1992 according to Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) and Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the state-controlled companies which are two of France's largest insurance groups. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman of UAP, warned a shareholders' meeting in Paris that his group faced a tough time in some areas of business. He said its performance in the intensely competitive French non-life sector would be 'at least as bad as last year'. His concern was echoed by Mr Michel Albert, chairman of AGF, who told shareholders the situation was particularly serious in the motor insurance market because of the steep increase in car theft. He also expressed concern about the 'extremely worrying' state of the commercial risks sector across Europe. Both UAP and AGF, like almost all the other leading French insurers, came under intense pressure in 1991 because of competitive market conditions and exposure to the unstable Paris property sector. These difficulties come at a sensitive time given that UAP and AGF, together with GAN, the other leading state-controlled insurance company, are candidates for the French government's partial privatisation programme. Mr Peyrelevade said UAP was ready to increase its capital, but that the share sale should wait until stock market conditions were more favourable and its share price was higher. Both UAP and AGF are pressing ahead with plans to expand into Germany.</p>

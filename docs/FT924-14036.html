			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Italy to be open about plans for far-reaching privatisation of public holding companies ITALY'S industry minister yesterday promised to be as open as possible with the European Commission about plans for a far-reaching privatisation of the country's public holding companies, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. Prof Giuseppe Guarino told Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, that Rome wanted to co-operate during the three- or four-year process which will end with the sale of shares in the public-sector groups. The detailed privatisation programme will be published early next month. EC competition authorities will be on the look-out for disguised state aid - in the form of debt write-offs, for example - during the penultimate phase of the project, when the government is preparing the companies for sale. Brussels will also look askance at any attempt to impose discriminatory terms on the flotation. Italian diplomats said yesterday that Sir Leon ought to welcome the increased openness and competition which privatisation would bring to the Italian state sector. Sir Leon is already looking at some sensitive state aid cases involving large Italian companies such as Ilva, the state-owned steel-maker, and car-maker Fiat.</p>

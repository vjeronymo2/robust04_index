			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 2 VICTORIES FOR PRO-CHOICE ADVOCATES;  </P> <P> INDIANA SENATE KILLS ABORTION BAN; MICHIGAN BILL VETOED  </P> <P> Pro-choice forces won two battles when the Indiana Senate defeated legislation  to ban abortions in public hospitals and Michigan Gov. James J. Blanchard  vetoed a bill today requiring minors to obtain permission for abortions.  </P> <P> Abortion rights activists in Indianapolis clapped in the Senate gallery and  hugged in the hallway when senators turned back the public hospital ban on a  26-23 vote Thursday night. The move followed a two-hour debate.  </P> <P> "We're not going to be debating this issue again in the Indiana Senate during  this session," said Dinah Farrington, a lobbyist for Planned Parenthood Inc.  "Attempts will be made to bring it back, but I really don't think we're going  to see it on the Senate floor again for a vote."  </P> <P> Today, Blanchard announced his veto of the Michigan bill, which would have  required minors to get permission either from their parents or a court. The  governor said that he supports parental involvement in such decisions but that  the bill "takes a woman's right to help herself away from her."  </P> <P> The actions marked the latest swings in the seesawing fortunes of abortion  legislation around the country. Earlier in the week, legislatures in South  Carolina and Michigan gave final approval to bills requiring parental consent  for teen-agers seeking abortions.  </P> <P> The veto of the measure in Michigan leaves only one question in the abortion  dispute in the state -- whether abortion foes will make a doomed override  attempt or head straight to the voters.  </P> <P> Blanchard's counterpart in South Carolina, Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr., has  not taken action on the parental consent bill passed there this week but has  said he supports it.  </P> <P> The Indiana legislation would have prevented doctors in public hospitals or  clinics from performing abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when the  life or health of the mother is threatened.  </P> <P> Under current law, no public money can be used for abortions, but some public  hospitals perform the procedure by using private donations and fees.  </P> <P> The measure also would have required doctors to perform viability tests before  performing abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy. Doctors failing to  conduct the tests could have been jailed.  </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court in July gave states more power to restrict abortions.  The ruling upheld a Missouri law that banned abortions in public hospitals and  stopped public employees from counseling women about abortions.  </P> <P> It also required doctors planning to perform abortions to first test any fetus  over 20 weeks to determine if it could live outside the womb.  </P></p>

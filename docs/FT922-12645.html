			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Merck registers 18% increase in earnings MERCK, one of the biggest US pharmaceutical companies, yesterday unveiled an 18 per cent increase in first-quarter earnings on sales which rose 9 per cent. Net income in the three months to March 31 was Dollars 568.7m or Dollars 1.47 a share, up from Dollars 483.5m or Dollars 1.25 in the first quarter of 1991. The results do not reflect Merck's three-for-one stock split which will take effect on May 6. Sales in the quarter were Dollars 2.22bn, against Dollars 2.05bn a year ago. Foreign exchange translations cut sales by one percentage point. Mr Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive, said sales growth was led by newer products. Although profits were in line with expectations, the 9 per cent growth in sales was slower than expected and Wall Street marked Merck's shares Dollars 2 1/2 lower to Dollars 152 3/4 in morning trading.</p>

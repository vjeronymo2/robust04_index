			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER TAPED POLICE 'STING'  </P> <P> I was saddened but not surprised to read of Jackson's racially motivated  physical and verbal attack at the hands of the Long Beach Police Department.  </P> <P> Five years ago I was pulled over, in a very similar manner, in the city of Long  Beach. When I objected to my arm being painfully twisted behind my back during  a body search, I was handcuffed and punched. I endured anti-Hispanic racial  epithets from the two white officers on the way to the station and when my  blood alcohol level was found to be less than half the legal limit, a bogus  traffic citation was issued for another offense.  </P> <P> I found that to file a complaint, you must file it with the LBPD which  consistently finds no wrongdoing by its officers.  </P> <P> DAN DUARTE  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

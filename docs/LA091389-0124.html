			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHANGING DIAPERS;  </P> <P> SMALL O.C. FIRM HOPES BIODEGRADABLE PRODUCT SUCCESSFUL IN SOUTHLAND MARKET  </P> <P> If a small Orange County firm has its way, the $3-billion disposable diaper  industry is in for a change.  </P> <P> This week Vons' 350 stores in California and Nevada began carrying throwaway  diapers that the manufacturer, American Enviro Products Inc. of Placentia, says  are almost entirely biodegradable.  </P> <P> The move marks the first big breakthrough in Southern California by American  Enviro, which has been selling the Bunnies diapers mostly in the Southeast  United States since July.  </P> <P> The difference between American Enviro's diapers and conventional disposable  models, according to the manufacturer, is that the regular diapers take up to  200 years to break down. American Enviro has developed a product that can  dissolve within 1 1/2 to 2 years, said company President Robert Chickering.  </P> <P> Depending on the size of the diaper, American Enviro's products are 85-92%  biodegradable, Chickering said Tuesday. "Our goal is to make a product that's  100% biodegradable," he added.  </P> <P> American Enviro is not the first to come up a diaper using plastic that quickly  rots. At least two other firms already market biodegradable diapers, which are  supposed to decompose quickly through natural processes once they are  discarded.  </P> <P> If the manufacturers are right, they could be going a long way toward solving a  big solid-waste problem.  </P> <P> About 85% of babies in the United States wear disposable diapers, totaling up  to 18 billion discarded diapers each year -- which account for as much as 2% of  U.S. landfill use.  </P> <P> Environmentalists contend that the plastic-and-paper diapers do not decompose  once they are thrown away. Instead, they become a potential source of viruses  and bacteria that cause infectious disease.  </P> <P> The biodegradable diapers use plastics mixed with cornstarch that allow  microorganisms to attack the plastic once it is in the soil, Chickering said.  There are also enhancers in the plastic that allow the plastic to break down  even in landfills, where the lack of air and moisture makes decomposition  virtually impossible, according to Chickering. A biodegradable absorbency  powder also is used, he said.  </P> <P> The technology has been available for 10 years. What has happened in the past  two years, Chickering said, is that it has become practical and cheap enough to  use.  </P> <P> That means that Bunnies diapers retail for about $9.99 for 32 to 60 diapers,  depending on the size. (Vons, which sells all baby products at wholesale costs,  is selling them for $9.40 per package.) Conventional disposable diapers retail  for $9.99 to $10.25.  </P> <P> Since American Enviro began shipping Bunnies in July, about 7.5 million have  been sold at retail outlets including Longs Drugs, Target stores and Lucky  Stores Inc.'s Northern California supermarkets.  </P> <P> By the end of the year, Chickering estimates the 9-month-old, privately held  company will have sold 65 million to 75 million diapers. The products are  manufactured under contract in Porterville, Calif., Eau Claire, Wis., and  Indianopolis. The firm employs five people at its Placentia offices.  </P> <P> The disposable diaper market is dominated by Proctor &amp; Gamble Co. and  Kimberly-Clark Corp.  </P> <P> By comparison, Cincinnati-based Proctor &amp; Gamble, the largest disposable  diaper maker, sells $1.65 billion worth of Pampers and Luvs annually.  </P> <P> Officials at both major manufacturers have said that their diapers are as  biodegradable as any on the market. Both are skeptical about claims by the  biodegradable makers.  </P> <P> But American Enviro and some retailers are unfazed.  </P> <P> "We're very concerned as a grocery company about the environment and want to  offer an environmentally friendly product," said Mike Roberts, grocery buyer  for El Monte-based Vons Cos. "We have documentation from (American Enviro) and  their test results. . . . We want to be the first (supermarket) to offer a  biodegradable product."  </P></p>

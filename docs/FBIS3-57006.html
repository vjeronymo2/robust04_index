In his opinion,  such a decision would be a violation of the international acts  on human rights whose legitimate character is confirmed by the  authorities in Kiev."    Meshkov believes that "the Russian State Duma in its present  composition will react to such violations of human rights very  tough putting Russia's state administration in an embarrassing  situation." "It (the Russian administration -- Interfax's note)  will have to either agree with the State Duma and extremely  heighten tensions between Ukraine and Russia, or oppose to the  Duma's decision and bring closer early presidential elections,"  Meshkov stated.    The candidate pointed out that "neither this, nor that  variant is desirable for Ukraine" hoping for that "Leonid  Makarovich Kravchuk, being a sophisticated and clever  politician, will avoid making wrong decisions."    Meshkov met with the Black Sea Fleet commander, Admiral  Eduard Baltin, in Sevastopol on January 21. The fleet's press  service said the parties "discussed the results of the first  round of presidential elections in the Crimea and the prospects  for the developments in the region."    At the Crimean presidential elections on January 16, Meshkov  canvassed a majority of votes and left behind his closest rival,  current Crimean Speaker Nikolai Bagrov. The two candidates will  race for presidency at the second round of the elections  scheduled for January 30.    During the meeting, Baltin said that the fleet's command was  ready to maintain a constructive dialogue with any party or  movement which understand the fleet's problems and take them  close to heart, the press service pointed out.</p>

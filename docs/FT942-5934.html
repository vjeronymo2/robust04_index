			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Technology: An adjunct to success - Christopher Brown-Humes concludes a series on research by looking at the links between industry and academia in Sweden president of Sweden's high-flying pharmaceuticals group Astra, last week launched a wide-ranging assault on the state of the country's research industry. There were too few qualified researchers in Sweden, he said. The education system was insufficiently geared to industry. Astra was increasingly having to locate research capability abroad. Mogren, one of the country's most respected business leaders, should know what he is talking about. Not only is Astra the country's biggest company judged by market capitalisation, but it has done as much as any Swedish company to foster links between industry and academia. Is the picture fair? Sweden spends 2.9 per cent of its annual GDP on R&amp;D, a level which puts it towards the top of the world league. It also has a well-developed framework for contacts between industry and universities. Is it simply that the country is not getting value for money? One must first consider the distorted structure of Swedish industry. The big multinationals, where the country's industrial strength is concentrated, have built up good contacts with universities. They are led by Astra and Pharmacia in pharmaceuticals, Ericsson in telecommunications, ABB in engineering and the vehicle groups Volvo and Saab. But Sweden does not have enough medium-sized companies and it is at this level (and the small company level) that contacts are much less well developed. Camille Modeer, a director of the Federation of Swedish Industries, says: 'The problem in Sweden is not lack of ideas. The problem is lack of possibilities to develop them.' She attributes the lack of entrepreneurial activity to a cultural and political environment which has favoured development of the welfare state and eschewed risk-taking for the last half century. Turning the situation round will not be easy. For Modeer, a key priority is getting more people with PhDs into industry and particularly into small and medium-sized companies. Modeer also says Sweden must make more use of its research. Academics have not always been commercial enough in their approach, stopping 'when they have had an article printed in some distinguished scientific journal'. It is not that Sweden is short of mechanisms for promoting collaborative research, nor does it lack private-sector funding. More than 60 per cent of R&amp;D expenditure is financed privately, with the government accounting for 35 per cent. It also has the advantage of being a small country where people tend to know everyone else in their field. A system of 'adjunct professorships' is one way the cross-fertilisation works. An adjunct professor will typically spend 80 per cent of their time with a company and 20 per cent at a university. But adjunct professors are just one strand in a web of industry and academic ties embracing science parks, industrial research institutes, industrial liaison offices and strategic research foundations. The research foundations are relative newcomers: endowed with SKr10bn (Pounds 850m) after the break-up of the old wage earner funds, their task is to create centres and fields of research excellence over the next 15 years. Astra is particularly sensitive to the Swedish research climate because it has placed strong emphasis on contacts with universities and medical schools. The basis for the company's rapid development was its acquisition of the rights to the compound Xylocaine, a pain-killer developed by two researchers at Stockholm University. Claes Wilhelmsson, Astra's head of R&amp;D, says a free flow of ideas is vital for keeping the company in the front line of medical knowledge. The group has 30 adjunct professorships and stresses physical proximity to academic centres not just in Sweden but abroad. It already has four overseas centres  -in Montreal, London, Bangalore and Brisbane - and plans to expand to six. At the University of Montreal, Astra is looking to tap the institution's specific expertise in the field of pain research and it talks of having a unit of up to 100 researchers there eventually. Wilhelmsson says that only by having a large number of small units working in different areas will Astra get access to the broadest possible range of new ideas for treatments. Besides, he argues, small decentralised units are more innovative and creative than big ones encumbered by bureaucracy. But he accepts there are drawbacks to the approach. One is duplication of cost. The other is the risk of commercial secrets leaking out. Ericsson also stresses academic contacts, although Bengt Gallmo at the group's university liaison office cannot link one specific product directly to the collaboration. 'We wouldn't get a complete product from a university system. What we would get is a solution to a particular problem,' he says. In Sweden, Ericsson has developed close ties with the Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg and Lund University. Abroad, it has set up laboratories near universities in Germany, the Netherlands, and North Carolina. The contacts with Lund are a good example of the way collaboration has worked to the advantage of both parties. A few years ago, Ericsson decided analogue electronics were being neglected and established an adjunct professorship in the field at Lund. The move helped attract PhD students to the university. The professor took on a full-time role at Lund and was hired back by Ericsson as a consultant. The relationship continues today. Gallmo says Ericsson is big enough to build up its own relations with universities. But he thinks links between Swedish industry and research centres are 'generally rather weak', particularly at the level of small and medium-sized companies.

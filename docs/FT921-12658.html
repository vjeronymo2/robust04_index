			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Letter: Need for more discipline Sir, Once again the absurdities of the relationship of banks and building societies with their customers has been highlighted by the Halifax's new schedule of charges ('Halifax to set new charges', January 18). What lawyer would advise his client to enter into a contract with another party which enjoyed vastly greater economic power and retained the right unilaterally to alter that contract, inevitably, in the latter's favour? Surely the time has come for binding contracts and the advertising of charges, the discipline of which would benefit both parties. It would remove much of the suspicion with which most customers hold their banks. Some measure of equality would be achieved. John Carruthers, 1 Greenholme Street, Cathcart, Glasgow G44 4DU</p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Milan - Other Markets The November trading account, which starts today, will be marked by several capital increases, the largest being that of Credito Italiano, which is launching a rights issue, priced at L1,500, to raise more than L1,000bn. UBS notes that Credito is following in the steps of BCI, which raised money after the summer and, like BCI, is talking of a possible large acquisition. 'Rumours are already beginning to circulate about various possible targets and, with the improvement of banking margins in the second half of this year, this would help to lift the banking sector out of its doldrums.' Meanwhile, Milan's new Mib 30 index, to be used as a base for futures contracts, is launched today calculated on a basket of 30 blue chip shares. The index will be adjusted every five minutes and every minute when the futures contract is in place. The base value of the Mib 30 was set at 10,000 using the value of December 31 1992. Further measurements are based on the existing BCI-30 index run by Banca Commerciale Italiana. The new index will be assessed daily from start of negotiations and will finish with the end of contract cancellations.</p>

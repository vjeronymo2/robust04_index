			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Victor B. Carriba] </F>   [Text] Mexico City, 22 Mar (PL) -- The third Solidarity  with Cuba caravan took advantage of its return to the United  States to conclude a pending matter: sending to the island part  of the humanitarian aid that had been detained by U.S. Customs.    A day after returning from Havana, the members of the  caravan  went back to the U.S.-Mexico border, set up the portable  satellite communications station that was not taken to Cuba two  weeks ago, and nonchalantly moved it into Mexico.    According to caravan members, the driver of the vehicle told  the customs officers that the equipment was being sent to Cuba,  but they "did not respond or stop the vehicle," which crossed  the international bridge and headed into Mexican territory.    Later, two members of the convoy who were riding in a  station  wagon behind the vehicle transporting the portable station were  stopped and arrested by the municipal police. The station wagon  was loaded with powdered milk and school supplies.    The two persons arrested were Reverend Lucius Walker,  executive director of the Interdenominational Foundation of the  Communities (IFCO) and founder of Pastors for Peace, and  Cuban-Canadian Camilo Garcia. Force was used to remove Walker  and Garcia from the vehicle. During the incident the police  fractured Garcia's nose. Garcia also suffered blows to his back  and one of Walker's hands was injured. The two men were  released on bail yesterday afternoon.    On 9 March, Laredo Customs officials prevented the group  from  crossing into Mexico, from where they would go to Cuba. The  excuse used by the Laredo customs officials at that time was the  bans established by the Torricelli Law aimed at heightening the  blockade imposed by Washington on Cuba more than 30 years ago.    The communications system was part of the more than 140 tons  of humanitarian aid for Cuba the third solidarity caravan had  collected in Canada and the United States.    Sources from Pastors for Peace, an organization that  sponsors  this type of action to help Cubans, pointed out that in addition  to the communications system, 22 boxes of various products to be  sent to Cuba were also taken across the border.    The 22 boxes taken across the border contain computers,  typewriters, spare parts for electrical appliances, a monitor  for blood transfusions, toasters, and other supplies that had  been retained by the customs officers.    According to Tom Hansen, a Pastors for Peace director, the  portable station will be installed at the Martin Luther King  Center in Havana to receive U.S. programs that will later be  distributed by the churches on the island.    The Cubans have requested people-to-people diplomacy. Since  the U.S. Government refuses to talk to the Cubans, with this  system the peoples will be able to talk to one another. We can  break the information blockade established by the U.S.  Government on the people of the United States, Hansen said.    When the second caravan crossed the border last summer, U.S.  Customs officials also detained a school bus. It was released  23 days later after a hunger strike staged by some caravan  members. Today, the school bus is being used by the Ebenezer  Baptist Center in Havana.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Traders turn a swift foreign exchange profit AFTER 12 hours at his desk on Wednesday Mr John Banerjee, a 24-year-old foreign exchange dealer at Chemical Bank, was back in the office at 7am yesterday, taking over from the bank's regular night shift. He normally concentrates on trading the dollar/Swiss franc and the D-Mark/Swiss franc rates, but in the last few days, dealers have abandoned their regular patches. 'We've all just pitched in,' Mr Banerjee explained. 'I've been trying to arbitrage the sterling market.' Since the Bank of England was publicly buying sterling at DM2.7780 on Wednesday, dealers were able to buy sterling against the dollar and then sell it to the Bank of England, earning handsome profits as sterling continued to dip below the floor. As he walked into the office yesterday, after the pound had been suspended from the European exchange rate mechanism, sterling was still being sold. Although volume had subsided somewhat, trading conditions remained difficult. 'The market is very nervous today, and it is difficult to get people to make prices and difficult to get client business done,' Mr Banerjee said. He did not get a lunch break yesterday - but then, he never does. Instead, like his colleagues, he consumes sandwiches delivered to his desk. Liquidity improved when the US market opened around midday, and by the end of the trading day sterling appeared to have stabilised somewhat at about DM2.63. By 4.30pm yesterday the roar of orders and price quotes across Mr Banerjee's desk had started to subside. Traders normally start to leave from 5pm. Even when markets are busy, a night staff is at hand to take over when European markets close. Mr Banerjee joined Chemical Bank two years ago after gaining a degree in economics from Sussex University. 'When I was at university I studied theoretical foreign exchange models,' Mr Banerjee remembers. 'They may have some relevance to the big picture, but what people actually do in the markets is another matter.' In spite of his relatively short time in the market, Mr Banerjee has already experienced frantic market conditions. 'The day after the Soviet coup (last summer), the volume in dollar/D-Mark was phenomenal,' he said.</p>

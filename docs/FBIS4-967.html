			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Mahamadou Issoufou received the heads  of diplomatic and consular missions in Niger and representatives  of international organizations this afternoon to brief them on  the political situation prevailing in our country.    The prime minister summoned the diplomats as observers of  the  Niger political scene and witnesses to the government efforts  made on economic, social, and political levels. During the  meeting, Mr. Issoufou recalled the progress recorded in our  country since the new political authorities came to power. The  head of government reassured the members of the diplomatic corps  that today, despite the crisis prevailing in Niger, one can  nonetheless note improvements both in the democratic ideals and  socioeconomic issues. The progress was acheived thanks to the  assistance from friendly countries and international  institutions.    Tackling the main issue at stake during the meeting, Mr.  Issoufou indicated that unfortunately in this era full of hope,  a new hotbed of tension (?bore a burden) on the nation and  tension was brought about by the opposition political parties'  refusal to respect the democratic and republican laws the Niger  people had enacted for themselves through the 26 December 1992  Constitution. To safeguard national unity and revamp the  economy, the government reacted in order to preserve the  Constitution, the laws and regulations as well as human rights  principle. Niger authorities will continue to strive to save  Niger from risky ventures and useless sufferings seen in other  countries.    Mr. Issoufou also said that the government remains open to  all initiatives from the civil society and friendly countries  that will enable Niger to strengthen its young democracy,  restore security and peace, and respect constitutional values.  After this brief introduction, the prime minister gave the  floor to his interlocutors. The Moroccan ambassador to Niger,  Mr. Tahar Nejjar, also dean of the diploamtic corps, took the  floor and asked the prime minister to use parliamentarian  immunity since several parliamentarians were arrested. In  response, the head of government explained that the  parliamentarians who were arrested were caught in the act.    Asked about what kind of initiatives the government was open  to, Mr. Issoufou said that the authorities of the Third Republic  are in favor of any action susceptible to help Niger advance on  the path of social, economic, and political progress.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] General Ramon Vega Hidalgo, commander in chief of  the Chilean Air Force [FACh], has said the institution is  analyzing Russian aerospace technology and will possibly  introduce it into the systems it currently possesses.    He pointed out that "together with the Russians, we are  evaluating the possibility of introducing their technology into  our national systems, and then establishing programs with them."  He explained that it is a slow process.    Gen. Vega reported that for many years the FACh has been  working on concrete technological programs with U.S. academies  and universities, and training engineers in electronics,  communications, and computing, as well as creating new systems  for the institution.    At noon yesterday, the FACh commander in chief granted an  interview to the media at the end of a ceremony celebrating the  57th anniversary of the Air War Academy. [passage omitted]</p>

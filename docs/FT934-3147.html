			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / World Trade News: US insistence on detail points to two-stage Gatt deal - Line-by-line bargaining has meant accord will at first involve just 15-20 countries Mention 'the formula approach' to almost any trade negotiator, and there will be a wince: it contrasts with the 'request and offer approach'. In the arcane world of Uruguay Round aficionados, the victory of the latter over the former has been, if not the source of all evil, at least the bane of many of their lives during the past three years. European Union negotiators in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade still today blame the refusal by the US to accept a formula approach as the reason so many thousands of hours have been spent arguing line-by-line tariff cuts with each separate trading partner as they have worked towards completion of a market access agreement in Geneva. Under the formula approach, supported by most trading nations but blocked by the US in January 1990, once negotiators had agreed a formula for cutting tariffs, then calculation of the product-by-product cuts would have been a quick and simple affair. As has been seen in the protracted US-EU market access negotiations, the request and offer approach to dealing with cuts product by product, country by country, has added many person-years to the process of concluding the round. It explains why the EU said yesterday it had abandoned hope of reaching line-by-line tariff cutting deals by the December 15 deadline with all 116 countries negotiating the round. Instead, it hopes to finalise deals with 15-20 countries which account for about 90 per cent of global trade. They insist the delay will not jeopardise the round. Other countries will agree in principle to finalise line-by-line schedules as soon as practicable in the new year. But it has added to the frenetic pressures mounting on negotiators in the few days remaining before December 15. As details of the US-EU deal begin to surface, it is possible to understand why the US - adamant about the need to preserve peak tariffs (higher than 15 per cent) in sensitive sectors and to tailor each deal to the idiosyncratic details of trade with each trading partner - would not swallow the sweeping formula approach. Take the non-ferrous metals sector. Under the US-EU deal, tariffs on most copper, tin and nickel goods fall to zero. Tariffs on zinc and most other non-ferrous metals will fall below 5 per cent. Tariffs on aluminium goods will range from 6.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent. All will be conditional on other key importers making similar commitments. Japan's agreement is key. Many of the tariff cuts revealed sweepingly by Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, his EU counterpart, are in fact conditional, and pitted with exceptions. The true global value of tariff cuts will only be calculable when the offers of all 116 participants are in the bank. So far, the following details of the US-EU deal are clear: Elimination of tariffs: in addition to the eight product sectors conditionally agreed in Tokyo at the Group of Seven summit in July - listing pharmaceuticals, construction equipment, medical equipment, steel, beer, furniture, farm equipment and spirits - the US and the EU have agreed zero tariffs for wood and paper products and toys. The phase-out for these last three will be over 10 years, rather than the six years targetted elsewhere. Tariffs on some fish products have been cut to zero. Tuna is excluded. However, the deal on wood products depends on Indonesia and Malaysia dropping their current bans on the export of raw logs. As a result, tropical hardwoods may be left out until agreement is reached with these leading timber exporters. Low-level harmonisation: tariffs on chemical products are to be harmonised at around 3 per cent following agreement outside Gatt by the world's leading chemical companies. Significant tariff cuts: tariffs on scientific equipment are to be cut by an average of 50 per cent. Tariffs on industrial electronics will also be cut by 50 per cent or more. The trade-weighted average of tariffs on semi-conductors will fall to 6 per cent from 14 per cent, while tariffs on semi-conductor manufacturing equipment will be cut to zero. Computer peripherals will have tariffs eliminated, while tariffs on computer parts will be cut from around 4 per cent to 2 per cent. Consumer electronics - of critical importance to Japan, and south-east Asian exporters - were not addressed. They will be looked at in bilateral negotiations with these countries. The attack on tariff peaks: cuts in the textiles and clothing sector will need line-by-line examination. The US-EU deal cuts US tariffs on sensitive items such as wool suits to around 17 per cent, with other wool items down to about 25 per cent. In deference to Europe's cotton textile manufacturers, mainly in Greece and Portugal, modest cuts have been agreed which ignore dogmatic concentration on tariff peaks but instead focus on items of significant export interest to these countries. The high tariffs protecting US glass and ceramics manufacturers will not be lopped across the board, but will reach 25-50 per cent 'on a few items'. Farm trade: while the modifications to the US-EU Blair House text have become clear, details of improved access to the EU food market are more elusive. Mr Mike Espy, US agriculture secretary, says the EU tariff cuts and new quota entitlements cover wheat and other cereals, meat, dairy products and speciality crops such as nuts, processed foods, fruits and vegetables. The US pig meat quota in the EU will rise by 39,000 tonnes. It is clear that other farm produce exporters will benefit from restraint on subsidised US and EU food exports, but what they might gain in terms of bigger EU import quotas, or improved market access opportunities, remains obscure. Services: the scope and balance of offers to open markets to financial services remains unclear. A financial services deal remains contested. A conciliatory US move to open its ocean shipping sector appears to have been withdrawn. The US and the EU remain at loggerheads on access to Europe's film and television markets. There is still a danger a services deal could crumble.</p>

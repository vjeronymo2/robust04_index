			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Part of the Brazilian population woke up 28 February  with more optimism. The rest began the day praying. In general,  people are insecure and poorly informed. Even some politicians  very close to the government have said they know very little  about the new economic plan. URV [Real Value Unit] is an acronym  that means hope for some people and loss and injustice for  others. There are various reactions to this still unclear  acronym. Some people vow to incorporate it into routine life  swiftly and with confidence, while others threaten to fight it  with a general strike.    There are many doubts about the plan. The salary  deterioration issue is one of the first problems Brazilians  would like to see clarified. Few people believe Finance Minister  Fernando Henrique Cardoso's promise that workers will not be  harmed. The directors of the main Brazilian industries -- even  though willing to support the change -- are concerned about the  government possibly increasing the ICMS [goods and services  distribution tax] and the possibility of costs being pressured  by suppliers and manpower. Minister Cardoso's leading role in  the plan's implementation, at the time of presidential  elections, is another source of doubts.    Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes: "I listened  carefully to everything. The minister talked a lot but I could  not understand anything. I am in the same situation as 150  million Brazilians who do not know anything. I am a good  Brazilian and I want it to succeed. I will pray and ask God for  the plan's success. Since I am close to the Lord of Bonfim, I  will pray to him."    Brazilian Federation of Banks (Febraban) President Alcides  Tapias: "The financial sector will gradually adapt itself to  the plan. Society needs to understand the URV, and the  government has to control spending. The plan depends on  credibility. It would be ideal to delay implementation of the  new currency so society can see the government's transparent  behavior. I am not concerned about strikes because the  conversion of salaries is fair."    General Workers Confederation [CGT] President Francisco  Caninde Pegado: "The CGT has total distrust in the new  government economic plan's measures. The proposal to convert  salaries by an average value, disregarding February's inflation  rate, leads to the conclusion that we will have major salary  losses. There is no magic in this. Workers have not received an  answer yet on the possible inflation rate in URV's. We cannot  support a plan like that."    Sole Workers Center (CUT) President Jair Meneguelli: "The  plan does not have anything that can improve the economy or  reduce inflation. It will produce salary deterioration, and its  only merit is that it will institute a salary policy with daily  adjustments. But what will happen if the inflation rate affects  the URV? We will have no salary policy at all, and this could be  chaos."    Workers Party (PT) President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva:  "Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic plan follows the  IMF's guidance for stabilizing the currency and resolving the  problems of Brazilian creditors. Even if conditions at this time  are not ripe, the atmosphere for a general strike will surely  develop, depending on the size of the loss that workers will  suffer."    Former Central Bank President Ibrahim Eris: "It is a plan  that calls for moderate sacrifice from society, nothing  dramatic. With the URV's adoption, difficulties will tend to  disappear. Brazil's indexation is so sophisticated that only  those without access to the financial sector will suffer  inflation losses. That is why those people will be the main  beneficiaries of the plan, of the economy's stabilization.  Society will become accustomed to the new index in 60 days."    Ricardo Yazbek, president of the Association of Sao Paulo  Real Estate Enterprises (Secovi): "It is a plan without magic  and with the conditions essential for success: The deficit was  eliminated, there is a high level of reserves, and the minister  has credibility."    Ruy Altenfelder, director-treasurer of FIESP [Sao Paulo  State  Federation of Industries]: "There is a consensus among  entrepreneurs that the working class should not suffer salary  deterioration. Anything in this regard will be negotiated."    FIESP Department of Economy Director Mario Bernardini:  "Everything leads to the conclusion that there will be  inflationary pressure and if appropriate measures are not  implemented, the inflation rate's drop will be temporary."    Carlos Eduardo Uchoa Fagundes, president of the Brazilian  Association of Lighting Equipment Manufacturers (Abilux): "We  should not forget that it is a temporary plan. Only structural  reforms, especially tax reform, can turn it into something  stable."    Jose Joao Locoselli, president of the Brazilian Association  of Cleaning Product Manufacturers (Abipla): "If the public  deficit does not disappear, we will be simply changing our  currency and nothing else. An artificial plan will not resolve  anything."    Eduardo Capobianco, president of the Civil Construction  Industry Association (Sinduscon): "Our contracts were frozen  for one year because over this period the sector's index that  reflects our cost variation will not be used. This can produce  turbulence."    Siemens President Herman Wever: "Conflicts in negotiations  between enterprises will increase. But this is healthy. I have  not yet reported the plan's details to our headquarters because  I believe they will not understand anything."    Olivetti President Enrico Misasi: "The government will  have to make a great effort to implement the fiscal adjustment  before replacing the real cruzeiro with another currency.  Without this, I see no possibilities for controlling inflation."    Ivan Botelho of the Cataguazes-Leopoldina enterprise: "The  plan did not change anything and, summarizing, it is only a  salary plan and a plan for controlling new contracts. There are  no major changes for the population."    Eduardo Eugenio Gouveia Vieira, director of the Federation  of  Rio de Janeiro Industries: "Article 34 of the provisional  measure provides for some price control, and even seems to be a  disguised freeze."    Bradesco [Brazilian Discount Bank] President Lazaro de Mello  Brandao: "The plan's good point is its strong budget balance.  The salary policy already has been approved and the URV is being  properly assimilated."    Embraer [Brazilian Aeronautics Company] President Osires  Silva: "I am optimistic. I believe it will work better than  Argentina's Cavallo plan because in that country the measures  were strongly orthodox. I believe the plan will benefit both  enterprises and workers."    Alvaro Augusto Vidigal, president of the Sao Paulo Stock  Exchange (Bovespa) and the Paulista Bank: "The URV is simply a  salary and contract index. Inflationary expectations -- which  will continue -- will be embedded in the price of products."    Edward Amadeo, Rio de Janeiro Catholic University economics  professor: "The inflationary trend in real cruzeiros could  speed up because prices are uncontrolled and some enterprises  already have said they will not set prices in URV's. This would  make any increase very obvious."    Lawyer Ary Oswaldo Mattos Filho: "The plan has been  gradually discussed; it has been implemented without shocks and  respecting all contracts. One of its major merits is that it is  the plan that is causing the fewest number of jolts, especially  in the transition period between enforcement of the URV and  creation of the real."    Reynaldo Goncalves, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro  (UFRJ) professor: "The government feels comfortable with its  $33 billion reserve that supports the plan, but it is actually  sitting on a powder keg."    Celso Bastos, Sao Paulo Catholic University constitutional  law professor: "In general terms, the plan is positive and more  legal than all the others because it does not include conversion  tables and confiscations, which were negative measures because  of the distortions they caused. This plan does not imply great  violence."    Lawyer and taxation specialist Ives Gandra: "The bonus that  the government has granted to state-run enterprises has once  again created first- and second-class Brazilians. It is  unethical and unjustified because the government preaches  austerity."    Guilherme Afif Domingos, president of the Brazilian  Confederation of Commercial Associations: "The plan's success  depends on the presence of Fernando Henrique Cardoso.  Oligopolies can manage to impose prices, but the others cannot.  If businesses adjust prices by the highest rate, they will have  to reduce prices in URV's after a drop in sales. My doubts refer  to the plan's management because we are in a time of a  presidential succession."    General Motors do Brasil Vice President Andre Beer: "The  plan was intelligently managed, without pressure or a freeze.  There is an atmosphere of tranquillity and optimism. But we will  have to see what happens with our suppliers and labor, and  whether they will pressure costs. The point we feel most  concerned about is the threat of the states, through the  National Fiscal Policy Council (Confaz), increasing the ICMS."    Sergio Reze, president of the National Federation of Vehicle  Dealers (Fenabrave): "We suggested dollarization of car prices  in January 1993 and we were criticized, even by the government.  The URV is important because it will give consumers a reference  for evaluating the real cost of products. Most car manufacturers  are already adjusting prices on a daily basis, and the trend is  to immediately adopt the URV."    Luiz Adelar Scheuer, president of the National Association  of  Automotive Vehicle Manufacturers (Anfavea): "Everybody tends to  adopt the URV. What we should now is see the behavior of taxes,  raw material prices, and salaries. If they are increased, this  will be passed on in final prices. But I do not think there will  be cost increases."</p>

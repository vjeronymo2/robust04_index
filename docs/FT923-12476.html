			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Perot's sudden departure helps to calm US nerves - But equities are likely to remain in a narrow range until after November Ross Perot has really put the cat among the pigeons now. The US stock markets had only just got used to the idea of a three-horse race for the presidency, and of the possibility of a maverick Texan billionaire occupying the White House and pulling the economic strings, when Mr Perot suddenly pulled out of the race on Thursday. Mr Perot's withdrawal certainly shocked the markets, although the previous night's resignation of a senior adviser had hinted heavily at major fissures within the campaign. The share price reaction to the news would probably have been greater were it not for the day's other big story, the rise in German interest rates, which commanded more of investors' attention given the decline in the dollar triggered by the Bundesbank's move and the implications it had for global economic growth. But the initial reaction of investors to the Perot news revealed the gut thinking on Wall Street. The Dow jumped more than 15 points after the Texan pulled out of the race because the markets interpreted the development as improving Mr Bush's chances of winning re-election. The thinking was simple: most of the recent polls had showed that Mr Perot was winning over more Republicans to his cause than Democrats. His departure, therefore, gives Mr Bush the chance to win back those lost voters. The reaction also revealed how concerned markets had been about Mr Perot. His opposition to the North American Free Trade Treaty between the US, Canada and Mexico, and his hawkish view of economic relations between the US and Japan, had deeply unsettled not just US, but world markets (especially in Mexico) during June, when the world's major bourses all took a tumble. Now that Mr Perot is gone, trade returns to the back burner (Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, and Mr Bush have many policy differences but trade is not a notable one), and markets have one less political issue to worry about. Mr Perot's mere presence in the election race also added to the uncertainty surrounding the outcome in November, and stock markets like nothing less than uncertainty. The reversion to a traditional, straight two-party fight eliminates some, but of course not all, of the political uncertainty. The downside for the markets of the Perot withdrawal, however, is that investors will have to take a harder look at Mr Clinton and what he intends to do with the economy. The bond markets have already passed judgment on the Democratic contender. Long-term bond rates have remained high partly because Treasury investors are fearful that a President Clinton would boost government spending, and with it, the already monstrous federal budget deficit. As Mr David Ader, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said on Thursday: 'While the Democrats scream 'Jobs] Jobs] Jobs]' the Street only hears 'Spend] Spend] Spend]' and backs off.' The stock markets appear to have taken a similar view of the Democratic platform. The big institutional investors, the real power in the market these days, are worried that higher government spending under a President Clinton would increase the deficit, which would trigger a rise in interest rates, which would then threaten the vulnerable US economy. There is little doubt that the best result would be a clear Bush victory. The problems the president seems to be having, however, and the likelihood that the economy will not turnaround swiftly enough to sweep him back into power, means that in the second half of the year political risk in equities is considerable. The recent declines in stock prices were seen by analysts as a case of investors giving back the discount on a Bush triumph that they had taken out last year in the euphoria following the Gulf war. That cushion has now gone, so any further signs of weakness in the president's chances of re-election could lead stock prices into another negative reaction. Similarly, if Mr Clinton continues his recent advance in the polls (inspired by the successes of an upbeat New York convention) and builds up a wide lead on the president by the autumn, the market could give up even further ground over the coming months. At least with the Democratic convention now out of the way, the markets can look forward to the Republican convention in Houston next month, which will train the spotlight back on Mr Bush and, the markets hope, energise his supporters across the US and boost his poll standings. In the meantime, however, and probably for most of the summer, stock prices are likely to remain cramped by the gathering speed of the election race. The Dow has moved in an tight trading range between 3,300 and 3,400 for the last four months, and more of the same is likely to be on the menu for the next four months, barring any unexpected political earthquakes.</p>

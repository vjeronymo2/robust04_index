			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / L'Air Liquide ahead 3.9% L'AIR Liquide, the French technical gases group, saw net profits rise by 3.9 per cent to FFr1.37bn (Dollars 249m) in 1992 from FFr1.32bn the year before, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. The group, which last year invested heavily in eastern Germany by commiting DM267m in an air dispersion plant, also managed to increase turnover by 2 per cent to FFr29.26bn from FFr29.34bn. L'Air Liquide benefited last year from a positive contribution from the disposal of its Lipha business in 1991, which reduced its debt ratio to 20 per cent by the year end from 27 per cent. The directors decided to maintain the dividend at FFr14 a share.</p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Banana row may end soon Costa Rica is expected to agree on Monday to a plan put forward by the European Union for increasing its access to the EU banana market. The agreement would mark the end of a bitter dispute between the EU and Latin American banana suppliers which has soured relations since last July. The deal would mean exporters could ship 2.1m tonnes of Latin American bananas to the EU this year rather than the current 2m tonnes, rising to 2.2m tonnes next year. Latin American banana exporters complained to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade about the EU's arrangements for the banana trade. Their complaint was upheld by a Gatt panel which ruled the EU's trading deal for bananas with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries under the Lome Convention ran counter to Gatt rules. The EU has made its offer of a greater quota for Latin American fruit conditional on exporters dropping their Gatt complaint. Colombia, Nicaragua and Venezuela have all agreed to the EU's new plan. The panel report on bananas will be discussed at a Gatt council meeting next Tuesday and Wednesday. Costa Rica, still hoping for last minute concessions, has indicated it could signal its agreement on Monday which would remove the panel report from the agenda. Guatemala, the other Gatt complainant, is unlikely to agree but represents only 1.5 per cent of the market and the Commission has indicated that the new plan could go ahead if the four main suppliers agreed.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Air Force Chief Lieutenant General Datuk Abdul Gani  Aziz says Malaysia needs more Hawk 200 jet fighters to  strengthen its air defense. He is of the view that the 20 Hawk  aircraft being acquired to replace the A-4 Skyhawk are  insufficient. The Air Force plans to increase the number of  Hawk aircraft in the future. He told reporters this at the RMAF  [Royal Malaysian Air Force] base in Butterworth. Earlier, Datuk  Abdul Gani was present at the handing-over of a Hawk 100, one of  the two aircraft acquired from Britain for the purpose of  training. The purchase of the 20 Hawk was made under a  memorandum of understanding signed by the Malaysian and British  Governments three years ago.</p>

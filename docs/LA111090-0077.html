			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KID BEAT: FUN FODDER FOR A FAMILY SING-ALONG;  </P> <P> AUDIOCASSETTES: NEW OFFERINGS, WITH TUNES SUCH AS 'THE DINOSAUR DIP,' PLAY TO A  YOUNG AUDIENCE.  </P> <P> No longer is it just Raffi or Sharon, Lois and Bram dominating the children's  music market. The recent explosion in the marketplace has meant rapidly  increasing listening options for young consumers.  </P> <P> Here's a look at four recent additions to the children's music market,  beginning with two choice selections on the Golden Music label, from the  publishers of Golden Books (Western Publishing Co. Inc.):  </P> <P> Bob Schneider's exuberant tribute to an American tradition, "Playing Baseball,"  captures the myth and the magic of the sport with an infectious combination of  musical styles from '50s rock and turn-of-the-century pop to gospel and  ballads. Titles include "De Ump," "Run Do Run, "Play by Play" and "Spring  Training Delight." An evocative ballad, "Baseball Hall of Fame," pays homage to  such greats as Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio and Willie Mays. It's a treat for fans  of any age.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, upbeat David Jack scores with "Gotta Hop!" Like his winning "Dance  in Your Pants" album, "Gotta Hop!" is sheer whimsy, cleverly executed and  tuneful enough to prevent parents from climbing the walls during repeat  playings. 1950s-style rock, calypso rhythms and kid-pleasing silliness  highlight original songs such as "Mookie-Pookie Yodelin' Cow," "The Dinosaur  Dip" and "Walkin' Through the Jungle."  </P> <P>  At toy stores, department stores and bookstores. Cassette, $6.99 to $8.99.  </P> <P> </P> <P> For a smoother road trip, don't leave home without "A Car Full of Songs,"  written and sung by folk great Tom Paxton. It's a mellow sing-along, a  grin-producing grab bag full of tunes such as "Are We There Yet?," "Somebody's  Hungry," "I've Gotta Go" and "Dad's Not Lost"; game songs "License Plate," "I  Spy" and "The Wheels Go 'Round" and a warm, nostalgic lullaby for weary young  travelers, "Sleepin' in the Back Seat." Paxton's buttery voice and wry wit make  an effortless transition from adult to children's fare.  </P> <P>  From Pax Records, distributed by Alcazar in Vermont. Available at specialty  children's book and music stores, and Waldenbooks. Cassette, $9.98. Distributor  information: (802) 244-5178.  </P> <P> </P> <P> "Aesop's Fables, the Smothers Brothers Way" is a curiosity, more likely to  appeal to adults than children. In this re-release of their '60s album, Dick  serves as storyteller, interrupted by the ever-befuddled Tom, who can't quite  grasp such Aesop conclusions as "honesty is the best policy" and "necessity is  the mother of invention." "Are we going to be authentic Aesop's fablers, or are  we going to be derivative?" Tommy asks.  </P> <P> Dated references to the Culligan Man and "the little old winemaker" may lose  young listeners, as may the smart brother/dumb brother,  "Mom-always-liked-you-best" bickering that stops each story in its tracks. When  they get around to singing, however, the battling Brothers' smooth folk  harmonies are as appealing as ever.  </P> <P>  From Music for Little People: cassette, $9.98; compact disc, $12.98. To order:  (800) 346-4445.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> A ROBIN COOK NOVEL THAT JUST WON'T FLY;  </P> <P> VITAL SIGNS, BY ROBIN COOK. PUTNAM. $21.95, 394 PAGES  </P> <P> I never want it said that I don't love "airplane literature." I do! What the  world needs, as much as fluorescent lights, or elastic waistbands on skirts, or  really excellent french fries, is splendid airplane literature (otherwise known  as post-operative literature) -- the kind where, when you pick up the book, all  turbulence falls away, all fear of pain disappears and death itself seems a  pale mirage.  </P> <P> Every few months or so, I write these reviews on a plane, as I do this moment.  Across the aisle, a woman is reading Sidney Sheldon's "Memories of Midnight."  She is one lucky woman. I flew into this place reading Robin Cook's "Vital  Signs," and will fly out of this place writing the review.  </P> <P> If I ever catch this doctor-writer Cook on solid ground, he's going to have  plenty to answer for. "Vital Signs" is as dreary as a game show, as unthrilling  as the last car chase you saw on TV, as wretched as the kid two seats back from  me, screaming and throwing up. I need hardship pay for this one.  </P> <P> Here's the story: Dr. Marissa Blumenthal, a feisty pediatrician, has just  married a four-star jerk named Robert who whines incessantly about money.  (Robert is so awful that an ordinary woman would never go out with him more  than once, but the author wants Marissa married to him, so, OK. Marissa  desperately wants a baby by this subhuman specimen, so, OK.) She goes to a  private woman's clinic, whose records are totally confidential, because she  doesn't want any other doctors gossiping about her personal medical condition.  With nothing wrong with her yet, Marissa goes in for a "routine" medical  procedure, where a mysterious Asian pokes a foot-long needle far into her  reproductive organs.  </P> <P> OK, OK! This is, after all, Robin Cook: medical porn is his metier. But all  that anyone ever really wants in these "popular" novels is escape, blessed  escape, and with those foot-long needles, escape is out of the question. The  reader is imprisoned with dreadful prose, horrible bickering characters, and a  lot of stuff about a kind of tuberculosis not often found in the modern world,  but turning up pretty often in the fallopian tubes of upper-middle-class women  who have come into these "confidential clinics" first for routine female  problems and then finally for in-vitro fertilization. Generally speaking, these  women have success after about eight or 10 tries.  </P> <P> There comes a moment in this book where you just throw up your hands. We're  talking a Pacific Rim heroin-smuggling cartel, whose members sterilize innocent  American women with "barefoot doctors" recruited from the People's Republic of  China, just as a sideline.  </P> <P> Marissa gets wind of all this, journeys to Australia, where the headquarters of  this dastardly headquarters is reputed to be. (By this time her own fallopian  tubes have been trashed, so she has nothing to lose when she befriends  Tristram, a handsome, Outback pilot/doctor who has already been cursed by the  aforementioned cartel.) They begin a chase after these Pacific Rim villains.  </P> <P> And everything changes! Marissa's girlfriend, Wendy, is gutted by sharks in the  Great Barrier Reef. Tristram and Marissa check into Hong Kong's Peninsula Hotel  . . . without any trouble! (This checking in to hotels without trouble happens  three separate times in this exciting novel.)  </P> <P> Also, at least three times, Asian villains "melt into the crowd." They don't  "disappear," they don't "run," they don't "scramble"; they "melt," every time.  </P> <P> You could describe this, then, as a melt-and-check-in novel.  </P> <P> The medical problem is far-fetched. The slur on the People's Republic is  uncalled for. The search for the drug triads is boring beyond words.  </P> <P> This isn't at all a question of "popular" versus "literary" fiction.  </P> <P> From the grave, Louis L'Amour keeps sending his readers wonderful stuff.  </P> <P> Sidney Sheldon, whether you admit to reading him or not, is marvelous when your  marriage is falling apart, or your appendix ruptures, or the wind shear is  acting up just as your plane comes in for a landing.  </P> <P> Jacqueline Briskin weaves her carefully researched novels with as many perfect  threads as a beautifully worked Oriental rug.  </P> <P> Dr. Richard Selzer, our other medical literary man, is a genius with language.  </P> <P> And Judith Krantz works and works to obtain the effects of her hard-earned  glitz.  </P> <P> What is it with this Robin Cook?  </P> <P> Lazy is the word that most accurately describes his prose. His career today is  totally assured. But that doesn't mean we have to read him -- in the air, or on  the ground.  </P> <P> Next: Bettyann Kevles reviews "The Invisible Invaders" by Peter Radetsky  (Little Brown).  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Storm over union block vote causes few ripples in Bridgwater - Roland Adburgham returns to Somerset to gauge the reaction of voters to the Labour conference THE ISSUE that electrified the Labour conference in Brighton this week caused only the mildest of shocks in Bridgwater, Somerset, a Conservative-held constituency which is more concerned with such matters as a local unemployment rate of 10.9 per cent. If the Conservatives are to retain power at the next election, Bridgwater - where Mr Tom King has a majority of 9,716 - is the kind of seat they must hold against the Liberal Democrat challenge in the south and south-west. Labour came a strong third at Bridgwater in last year's general election and, next time, tactical voting could make the Tories vulnerable. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, greeted the conference backing for one-member-one-vote in the selection of parliamentary candidates as 'a great day for the Labour party'. But the FT's small panel of Bridgwater voters was less convinced that the reduction in union power would mark a turning point in the party's election fortunes. 'One decision is not a watershed,' said Mr Allan Challenger, a former Labour member who is a psychiatric social worker. 'It might lead to John Smith getting a few more points in the opinion polls for a few weeks . . . But I don't think it has any long-term relevance. 'The issue has never stopped people electing Labour governments in the past  -what stops people electing Labour governments is when they don't have any confidence in the policies.' Ms Glen Burrows, a shop steward with Unison, the public-services union, agreed. 'For most voters, the question of whether the individual or union block vote selects candidates is completely irrelevant,' she said. 'People aren't going to say 'Oh goody, now we can vote Labour'.' She thought the debate distracted attention from the substance of policy. 'The Tories are setting the agenda all the time for John Smith,' she said. 'In his 40-minute speech, he spent 20 minutes making jokes about the Tories. We've heard it all before. Labour leaders should stop dining out on how awful the Tories are and put some beef into their policies.' Mr Ian Weston, who owns a Bridgwater travel agency, thought the vote was more significant - and would make the party more attractive to the undecided voter. Mr Hugh Barran, a solicitor and Liberal Democrat supporter, was sceptical. 'John Smith says on the one hand that the vote is important, and on the other that he wants to maintain and strengthen links with the unions,' he said. Mrs Beatrice Forber, a committed Conservative supporter, was dismissive. 'I think it is a wonderful colour scheme: paint the room in pale pink and everyone will look nicer,' she said. 'But Labour still looks totally unconvincing as a government and still ominous, with its hidden left waiting to pounce if they come to power.' Roland Adburgham will visit the voters again after the Conservative party conference next week. The first article in this series, gauging reaction to the Liberal Democrat conference, appeared last Saturday.</p>

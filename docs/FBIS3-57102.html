			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian  at 1315 GMT on 19 January broadcasts an interview with Sergey  Nikolayevich Yushenkov, head of the parliamentary defense  committee, by an unidentified correspondent. During the  interview Yushenkov is asked to describe the committee he heads.  He says that currently 18 people representing various parties  are on the committee, almost all of them with military  experience. Among them, he says, are Aleksandr Aleksandrovich  Piskunov, one of the leaders of the former Supreme Soviet's  defence and security committee, Colonel General Yuriy  Nikolayevich Rodionov, former deputy defense minister and  currently deputy chief of the Armed Forces Inspectorate, Colonel  General Dmitriy Antonovich Volkogonov, and Georgiy Grigorovich  Lukava. The committee's main task, according to Yushenkov, is  to "restore officers' prestige" with particular reference to  restoring the role of the Russian officer and gentleman. He  adds that welfare issues, military doctrine, and army reform are  among other questions the committee wishes to deal with,  ensuring that the army is "on a proper level of combat  readiness."    Yushenkov then lists other committees headed by Russia's  Choice members.    Commenting on the fact that some government members have  decided to focus on their Duma duties, Yushenkov says it will  affect the work in the new parliament: Democrats have about  one-third of the votes, or perhaps a little more. About 40 to  42 percent of deputies oppose the president and the government,  he says, adding that "the battle now will be for those who are  undecided." Those who succeed in enticing them will probably  get majority in the State Duma, "although it seems to me that  not a single competing group will get a stable majority,"  Yushenkov says. He goes on: "As for members of the government  leaving the government, it is due to the fact that it is not  possible to continue with effective reforms. Moreover, since  mid-December Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov have, in fact, been  unable to influence the financial stabilization, nor have they  been able to influence in any effective manner any other  decisions connected with the economic or welfare sphere and that  is the reason why they left that government, together with Ella  Panfilova and this will, of course, make itself felt on the work  of the State Duma." Gaydar, he says, will now be a more active  participant in parliamentary proceedings -- yesterday he was  applauded for opposing the squandering of taxpayers' money on  the building of new premises for the Federal Assembly.    Yushenkov concludes his interviewe by noting: "I think that  the truth that the center of power is currently being shifted in  the structures of executive authority from the president to the  prime minister is becoming more and more obvious -- it is a fact  which must be taken into account in further activities."</p>

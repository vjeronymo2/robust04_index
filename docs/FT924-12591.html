			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / International Company News: Sentrachem scores 15% earnings rise LOWER finance charges helped Sentrachem, one of South Africa's largest chemical groups, record a 15 per cent rise in earnings for the year to August. It achieved the advance despite trading conditions described by Mr John Job, managing director, as 'the worst in the group's history'. He said the group had profited from focusing on its core businesses and maintaining strict operational discipline. Turnover rose by 6.9 per cent to R2.43bn (Dollars 849m) from R2.27bn, and operating profits advanced by 5.9 per cent to R226.5m from R213.9m. Lower capital expenditure and improved asset management saw net finance charges drop by 23.3 per cent to R81.4m from R106.1m. This was sufficient to offset a 60 per cent increase in tax to R48.3m from R30.2m, and lift attributable earnings to R71.6m from R62.1m. The dividend was lifted to 20 cents a share from 18 cents, on a rise in earnings to 62 cents a share from 53.8 cents. Mr Job said all divisions had compensated for the weak domestic market through exports, which accounted for 11 per cent of turn-over. He added that, while no upturn in economic conditions seemed likely in the short term, he expected the group to maintain earnings in the year ahead.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Campaign aims to curb late payments THE Cashflow Commitment, an attempt to shame businesses into paying their bills on time, is to be launched by Manufacturing Challenge, the self-help campaign to boost industry based in the north-east. Companies in the region are to be offered a rubber stamp which will print on contracts and invoices the words: 'We promise to pay on time - what about you?' The uncomfortable slogan is intended to exert pressure so that late payment, which destroys some companies and cripples others, is reduced. 'Money is like manure - it only works if it's spread around,' said Mr Karl Watkin, founder of Manufacturing Challenge and chairman of Crabtree, the Gateshead-based metal-decorating equipment producer. 'If the cash locked up in unpaid bills was released into the system it could be used by small- and medium-sized businesses to grow and thrive.' Late payment of bills was the main issue raised by north-east businesses at clinics held this summer by Manufacturing Challenge. The 'challenge' is to double the region's manufacturing base and treble its exports within a decade. The Forum of Private Business has estimated that British companies are owed about Pounds 50bn in overdue debts.</p>

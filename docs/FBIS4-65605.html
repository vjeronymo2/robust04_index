			<p>BFN     [Text] The Foreign Ministry is insisting on serious  preparations for the Greek-Albanian meeting. It is also  proposing a substantive preliminary meeting between the  officials who are in charge of preparations for the meeting of  the two foreign ministers.    Acting on instructions from the Foreign Ministry, Greek  Ambassador in Tirana Khristodhoulos Tsalikis conveyed this  "issue" to Albanian Deputy Foreign Minister Arjan Starova.    The Greek side insists on all questions and decisions being  raised before the meeting, which is anticipated to be held  before the end of July, so the two ministers will be in a  position to "close" the differences.    According to the Greek proposal, these meetings could be  held  at the border-crossing of Kakavia, alternatively on Greek and  Albanian territory.</p>

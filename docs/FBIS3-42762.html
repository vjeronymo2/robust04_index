			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Road Machinery for Baltic States"] </F>   [Text] (TT)--The government is recommending that the  National Road Administration send surplus equipment to the  Baltic states.    One result of that agency's reorganization was to make  certain road machines and trucks superfluous.    The National Road Administration is selling off its surplus,  but there is no demand for some of its older equipment. There is  , however, a serious lack of that kind of equipment in the  Baltic states. The government therefore considers it reasonable  that the National Road Administration should send its unsalable  older equipment over there.</p>

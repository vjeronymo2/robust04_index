			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Audit reform to help small companies Companies with assets of more than Pounds 1.4m must still obtain annual audits of their accounts, according to details of the government's reform of auditing requirements for small companies announced yesterday. The government said last year that companies with a turnover below Pounds 90,000 would be freed from the annual audit requirement, while the rule would be relaxed for companies whose turnover was less than Pounds 350,000. Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said yesterday that companies satisfying these turnover thresholds would be automatically exempted. But companies would not be exempted if their balance sheets exceeded the Pounds 1.4m limit, or if they were public companies, part of a group structure or subject to a statute-based regulatory regime. Shareholders holding 10 per cent or more of a company's capital can veto the exemption. The accounts of companies whose turnover is between Pounds 90,000 and Pounds 350,000 must be verified by a 'compilation report' prepared by an independent accountant and filed with their annual accounts at Companies House. This is less exacting than an audit but the report must be prepared by an accountant or auditor registered with one of the following recognised professional bodies: the institutes of chartered accountants in England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland; the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants and the Association of Authorised Public Accountants. An estimated 500,000 companies across the country will benefit from the changes, which have followed heavy lobbying by small business organisations. Under the present law all companies, however small, are required to appoint auditors and have their annual accounts audited. The government intends to bring these measures into force in the summer by regulations under the companies act. Mr Hamilton said: 'We will see how the measures work in practice and consider, in due course, whether any further changes might be appropriate.' He said the changes were part of the government's drive to 'free businesses from unnecessary burdens'. He said these changes would 'be warmly welcomed by both small business and the accountancy profession'.</p>

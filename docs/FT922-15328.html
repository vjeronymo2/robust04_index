			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Nato fails to resolve ex-Soviet missile row A MEETING designed to promote new areas of defence co-operation between Nato and its former Warsaw Pact adversaries yesterday failed to break the deadlock between Ukraine and Russia over the remaining stockpiles of tactical nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory. Nato defence ministers expressed continuing concern over the dispute. Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, held separate talks in Brussels with ministers from both countries as well as representatives of Belarus and Kazakhstan, the other two former Soviet republics where nuclear arms are stationed. He said all four had reiterated their 'basic commitment' to the principle that nuclear weapons should be concentrated in Russia and the stockpile reduced. 'I'm inclined to take them at their word until I have evidence to the contrary,' he said. General Konstantin Morozov, Ukrainian defence minister, said shipments of tactical nuclear arms to Russia, which were suspended last month, would not resume unless Russia agreed to place the dismantling of the weapons under international supervision. But General Pavel Grachev, representing the Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, said this was not part of the agreement reached between the four republics at Alma Ata, Kazakhstan, last December. Kazakhstan has already transferred all its short-range tactical weapons and Belarus about 70 per cent. Ukraine says it had shipped 57 per cent of its stockpile, reckoned to be more than 2,000 warheads, when it halted transfers. All three also have strategic weapons sites. Both the Russian and Ukrainian ministers said they hoped the dispute could be resolved in time to complete the transfers of tactical arms by the July 1 target date. Mr Tom King, UK defence secretary, said Nato expected all the non-Russian republics to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. If there was any departure from these assurances, he said, assistance to these countries 'could be put in jeopardy'.</p>

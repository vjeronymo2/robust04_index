			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Treasury to pay Pounds 380,000 over canteen irregularities The Treasury has agreed to pay the Inland Revenue Pounds 380,000 after its catering arm made irregular payments to staff over 10 years. The sum will cover tax and national insurance contributions which should have been deducted from the pay of casual staff employed by Forward Civil Service Catering, a Treasury agency. The National Audit Office last year revealed financial irregularities in the agency, including mismanagement and fraud. Sir John Bourn, head of the audit office, says in his report on the Treasury's 1992-93 accounts that the total loss to public funds could be Pounds 900,000. Sir John welcomes efforts to tighten up on financial management and improve controls over cash, stock and credit sales, but remains critical of Treasury failure to deal with continuing weaknesses, which include: Delegation of audit checks to junior staff with insufficient follow-up to remedy deficiencies. Poor record keeping at headquarters, particularly on departmental budgets and management fees. Weak controls over cash in tills and vending machines, with receipts not fully banked and paperwork missing. Poor stock control procedures, including lack of security and unreliable records. While Forward's performance was within 1 per cent of its target gross profit margin, the audit office found 'considerable variations' from budget in individual items. Sir John says: 'Such variations can be a valuable indicator of matters perhaps going wrong. There were still some cases where variations did not appear to have been thoroughly examined.'</p>

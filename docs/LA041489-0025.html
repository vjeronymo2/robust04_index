			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FLEEING SUSPECTS LEAVE MARIJUANA BEHIND AT BORDER  </P> <P> A duffel bag containing more than 11 pounds of marijuana, with a street value  of $5,840, was found at the bottom of a flood-control channel on the U. S. side  of the Tijuana River Wednesday night, Border Patrol agents said Thursday.  </P> <P> The bag contained five "bricks" of marijuana weighing about 2 pounds each, plus  two small packages of marijuana, said Norbert Gomez, public information officer  for the Border Patrol.  </P> <P> Gomez said Border Patrol agents observed a group of aliens in the river bottom,  and agents on all-terrain motorcycles went to investigate. They found the  duffel bag but no people, he said.  </P> <P> "The group may have been trying to bring it north, and when they observed the  agents approaching the area, probably dumped the drugs and ran back to the  Mexican side of the border," Gomez said.  </P></p>

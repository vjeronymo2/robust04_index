			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Taiwan aims to attract investors TAIWAN yesterday approved a draft economic programme and a package of measures to promote private investment in manufacturing and to stem the flow of capital to China. The draft, prepared by the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), highlighted the sluggish state of manufacturing and emphasised the need to promote private investment. Superficially, Taiwan's economy seems strong. Average real economic growth between 1988 and 1992 was 6.7 per cent compared to the average world rate of 2.4 per cent over the period. Government planners expect a 6.33 per cent rise for 1993. However, the growth in fixed capital investment has been declining from between 25 and 30 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the early 1980s to 21.6 per cent of GDP over the past five years. Private capital investment has been rising by an annual average of only 8.5 per cent from 1988-92. Mr Vincent Siew, chairman of the CEPD, acknowledged that many manufacturers 'have set up factories in foreign countries or the (Chinese) mainland'. Estimates of the accumulated capital outflow from Taiwan to mainland China range from Dollars 10bn to Dollars 20bn since mid-1987 when Taipei began to lift restrictions on contacts there. Data from the Central Bank of China show that total net outflow on the capital account of Taiwan's balance of payments amounted to Dollars 61.9bn from 1987-91, third only to Japan and Germany. Mr Siew said the CEPD hoped the measures 'could effectively solve a wide range of problems faced by private investors such as access to land, labour supply and higher levels of technology.' He also said the plan would further Taiwan's development as a regional centre for research and development, manufacturing, transport and communications. The programme includes a medium-term plan to establish a free trade zone on Taiwan's west coast. It also promises financial help for large and small-to-medium sized manufacturers through a NTDollars 40 billion (Dollars 1.5bn) allocation from the postal savings system. A NTDollars 20bn fund will also be set up to support technology investments. Among other measures are a review of Taiwan's land-use development rules, a review of policy regarding foreign workers to ease labour shortages and stepped-up efforts to revise the island's working practices. The plan also calls for streamlining of government organisations and accelerated efforts to privatise state industries and utilities.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Minding Your Own Business: The big guns aim down market - Computing SOFTWARE companies have become busy in the last six months releasing cheap versions of well known packages. This change was prompted by the arrival of the Windows 3 operating system. Windows is (we are told) being adopted extensively by big corporate users. The software package market is therefore starting to split into two - the corporate sector based on Windows and the mass market based on traditional DOS. As DOS becomes severed from the corporate market, DOS package prices are starting to fall. The result is eminently satisfactory - for the corporate user big, slow and expensive packages running under Windows, for the rest of us simple, fast and now cheap packages running under DOS. As part of their approach to the mass market, leading software suppliers such as Borland and Lotus are experimenting with sales through the 'retail channel'. You will not find Quattro Pro SE or Lotus Executive (see below) in PC magazines or dealers: they are only available through high street shops such as Dixons, Wildings, Rymans. A word here - in order to justify the low price, cheap packages are often promoted as 'cut-down' versions of the premium product. However, it is easier for the software companies to take a proven, product rather than produce a special cut down version which then has to be tested in the field and requires specialist support. As we saw recently with Quattro Pro SE, they are equally likely to dust down and repackage the previous full-price version of the software. It is easy to support because there are still thousands of people out in the field using this old version. So in many cases you are getting the full-price version minus the latest bells and whistles. Or look at it another way: instead of buying a package which gives you five times as many functions as you need, you are only buying one with three times as much. Much of the pace in the mass market is being made by Borland. Apart from the spreadsheet Quattro Pro SE (Pounds 49.95) which is a bargain of bargains, they have also bought out the database Paradox SE (Pounds 79.95), equivalent to the premium product Paradox 3.5 (Pounds 595) except that it lacks one or two advanced functions for power users such as SQL linking and Personal Programmer. With a helpful Sybex self-teach guide as documentation, Paradox SE can be recommended to non-programmers who wants to try writing their own applications. Lotus Corporation has recently set up a small business unit and late last year dipped its toe in the water with its first offering, a slightly convoluted affair called Lotus Executive with Filofax at Pounds 149.99. Lotus Executive is basically Lotus 1-2-3 release 2.3 (the standard version of 1-2-3, RRP Pounds 299) minus one or two esoteric features such as the Macro Manager. The documentation is brief but excellent, being a re-badged self-teach book called 'The 10-minute Guide to Lotus 1-2-3'. Lotus Executive with Filofax comes with an attractive leather binder, a set of Filofax pages for 1992, and some Filofax 'templates' written under 1-2-3. An obvious must for any Filofax user; anyone else can buy it in order to get a half-price version of Lotus 1-2-3 and then give away the Filofax to an unsuspecting friend as a present. This product is only available at a few city centre branches of Rymans and 16 branches of Dixons. However, your local branch of Dixons will order a copy for you if you ask them. Lotus is getting its act together in the small business market and we shall see more of Lotus Executive. Next week it will release Lotus Write, again at Pounds 149, a Windows-based word processor based on its top of the range Ami Professional 2 (RRP Pounds 499). Lotus has also announced that it is working on a new version of its entry-level integrated package Lotus Works (combined spreadsheet, word processor and simple database). When it comes to DOS-based word processing packages, the world's top selling package by a wide margin is WordPerfect 5.1 (RRP Pounds 399), made by the company of the same name. Early last year it brought out LetterPerfect (Pounds 169), available through dealers, not the high street. A subsequent survey of budget packages in a PC magazine found that if you are using LetterPerfect and 'need to upgrade to 5.1, you will find you know it already.' Run side by side the two programs looked virtually identical. 'The fact is that LetterPerfect beats many 'full-featured' programs, and nothing else in the market comes close to it'. LetterPerfect is completely compatible with WordPerfect, allowing you to transfer documents between both programs. The only difference of major importance seems to be that you cannot print in columns. WordPerfect claim that LetterPerfect is aimed at users of portable computers. A jolly good effort by the marketing department, but really this is pure baloney. Unless you have to produce newsletters with columns, buy LetterPerfect every time.</p>

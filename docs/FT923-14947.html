			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): CGT on legacies A PERSON died two years ago and left a substantial legacy mainly in private company shares - the valuation of which is still under negotiation with the Inland Revenue. Aside from inheritance tax on the estate which as residuary legatee I am liable to pay, are capital gains tax also involved, viz: any gain from a 31 March 1982 base point and whatever the decided valuation is at the person's death on the shares I inherited. Also, about a year ago, I gave a nephew a small parcel of shares in the same unquoted private company - will I be liable for capital gains tax on these from 1982 or from eight years earlier when I first had them? 1) No: Capital gains tax on death was abolished in 1971. 2) You are deemed to have acquired the shares on the day of the previous shareholder's death, at the value which is ultimately agreed. Ask your tax office for the following free pamphlets: CGT14 - Capital gains tax: an introduction, CGT16 - Indexation allowance: disposals after 5th April 1988 and IR45 - What happens when someone dies. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

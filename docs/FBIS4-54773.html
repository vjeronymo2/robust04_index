			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague May 4 (CTK) -- President Vaclav Havel  welcomed today's signing of Palestine self-rule accord and said  he considered it the beginning of Middle East settlement. He  told Czech Television that former Czechoslovakia and later on  the Czech Republic had always supported peaceful and just  settlement of the situation in the region. This attitude has  been evidenced by balanced relations with the two parties, Havel  added. "The Czech Republic is undoubtedly ready to continue its  assistance, especially regarding the reconstruction of the  self-rule areas," Havel stressed.</p>

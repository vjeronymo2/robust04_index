			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Queue forms to praise Smith, not bury him - Alison Smith checks reaction to the party leader's speech AS delegates streamed out of the conference hall after Mr John Smith's speech, union leaders and MPs - even those hostile to his planned reform of Labour's links with the unions - queued up to praise the vision the party leader had set out. Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TWGU, said it was a 'speech delivered by a prime minister in waiting'. Slightly less enthusiastically, Mr John Edmonds, the GMB leader, called it 'a very solid speech, made for the country as a whole'. But Mr Edmonds and almost all the other delegates were in no doubt that at least one passage - the coded reference to today's debate on reforming union links - was directed solely at the conference. To win the battle for constitutional reform, Mr Smith argued, 'we must have the courage and the confidence to reform our own constitution as well'. In this politically sophisticated audience, the significance was clearly marked, as was the sustained applause that greeted it. Ms Dawn Primarolo, a party health spokeswoman who has expressed opposition to the reform and failed to win a seat on the national executive committee on Monday, was alone in saying that she had not been sure exactly what Mr Smith was referring to. Mr Smith's aides appeared to think the speech had succeeded in swinging the votes of enough constituency delegates to win the vote on reforming the role of the unions in the selection of parliamentary candidates, but some senior frontbench spokesmen were still not convinced. Certainly not every delegate had been converted. 'Good but not inspiring' was the verdict of one unmandated delegate from a southern constituency party. 'His delivery was that of a Presbyterian minister, so I'll wait and see what he says about union reforms'. Many, however, said they liked the way the speech had concentrated on employment rights and had underlined the party's commitment to trade unionism. Others said they agreed that to make the case strongly for constitutional reform, the party should reform itself. Perhaps the best sign of the way Mr Smith's speech has maintained the momentum for reform came from the delegates who have been mandated to vote against the leadership but are now having a crisis of conscience as they consider breaking their mandate to support a change to the links. 'I will not change my mind on the basis of the speech,' said one. 'I'll wait and see what he says about the reforms. But I liked what he said about employment rights and low pay, and I agree we have to practise what we preach on constitutional reform.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Elishev'a Aylon] </F>   [Text] The writer, A. B. Yehoshu'a, stirred up quite a  public outcry some months ago when he asserted that any of the  settlers who want to stay in the territories under the  Palestinian governing authority have to make that possible.    Now, when it is obvious that the hard core of the settlers  will steadfastly refuse to vacate their homes, and certainly  will refuse to accept the new laws to be applied by the  Palestinians, the question arises whether, and to what extent,  the government must take responsibility for those who will not  obey the law.    "What this means," says Yehoshu'a, "is that two  possibilities  exist under a permanent agreement with the Palestinians. Either  the settlers will prefer to receive compensation, leave their  homes and come back inside the Green Line, or they will  acquiesce to Palestinian jurisdiction and a Palestinian ID card."    It is difficult to believe that the fanatic hard core will  submit to Palestinian jurisdiction. After all, they do not even  accept the laws of Israel.    "They still recognize the state of Israel. We are talking  about a Jewish minority facing a million Arabs after the  agreement. None of them is so stupid that he won't accept  Palestinian control when the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is  gone."    [Aylon] If they do not accept one of the two possibilities,  will Israel still have to risk the lives of IDF soldiers to  protect them?    [Yehoshu'a] The IDF is leaving. It won't be there to protect  anyone. There will be Palestinian policemen. They will deprive  the settlers of their weapons, although only pursuant to the  Oslo agreement, of course. So, the settlers will have only one  of two options. There is no third alternative. The handful who  will cause problems will have to be removed. It will be one man,  maybe two. This is not going to become the Wild West. Just as  there will be running water and electrical service, so there  will be proper laws. And what can they do? If they do something,  the Palestinian police will deal with them just the way the  Palestinians will deal with any Jewish civilian who sneaks into  territory under their authority.    [Aylon] Do you think that the massacre that Goldstein  perpetrated in the Cave of the Patriarchs will speed up the  peace process?    [Yehoshu'a] I hope it will.    Recent events have far outpaced the government's rate of  thinking and analysis. Nonetheless, Rabin, on the basis of what  he has said, is confident that he is in control of things, that  the negotiations are proceeding exactly in accordance with the a  priori concept under which he entered negotiations with the  Palestinians. He even promised during the election campaign to  make peace within nine months. He just did not say what he meant  by peace. But nine new moons are already behind us, the  gestation period for delivery is receding into a vague horizon,  and there still is no baby to kiss. Some will say that it is too  early and that we need to let more time pass. Somehow, the  politicians always say that it is too early to tell, too early  to act. The only question is, when will real peace stop being  too early? Perhaps when it is too late.    Goldstein's wife, Miriam, told the press yesterday that her  husband was not insane, he just wanted to halt the peace  process. A single sentence loaded with so many signs of the new  historical situation that is unfolding before our eyes. This is  not something that began today or the day before. Nor last  Friday, with Goldstein's death toll. It might have begun during  the first days of the intifadah when, just as occurred  elsewhere, a local seed of rebellion was planted. We are talking  about global processes playing out in our own arena; you can  feel them in such a tangible way that only obtuse fanatics  cannot see what is happening to them right under their noses.    Isn't it clear that the dominating idea of the next  millennium will be the liberation of man and respect for him for  what he is? If, until 50 years ago, no conquering state would  ever have considered returning the land it had occupied, it will  be almost unthinkable in the 21st century that occupied lands  can remain in the hands of the conqueror. That happened in the  Soviet Union, it happened in Europe, it is happening now in  Bosnia, and it is happening here, in Israel. Here, however, it  sometimes seems that the Middle Ages have not yet ended and that  the Crusades are still in fashion. That, more or less, is what  Goldstein did. And now he is in the earth, sanctified.    He was not crazy, says his wife without realizing that she  is  insulting the insane. Statistically, every director of a  hospital psychiatric ward will tell you, the mentally ill  usually are not violent, and if they hurt someone, it usually is  themselves. Barukh Goldstein was a normal man. Apparently, he  planned his killing operation over the course of many months. He  went about it as though it were a proper military mission. No  one would have accepted the excuse of temporary insanity if he  had been tried for his crime.    Given that, Goldstein may have been an extremist although  absolutely normal, and none of us can hide behind the  supposition that he was deranged. Nor can anyone absolve us of  the collective feelings of guilt submerged under the club of  occupation for the last 27 years. Nevertheless, Goldstein will  be unable, although that was his declared intention, to stop the  peace process. For the peace process, even in the local sense,  is not a process of coexistence and brotherhood but a process of  self- and national-liberation, and no power on earth can stop it.    If Rabin is still angry at [Nisim] Zvili for saying that a  Palestinian state definitely will arise, it is only  political-strategic anger, feigned merely so that the other side  in the negotiations will not think that it already has all its  freedom in its pocket. It also implies that we, not they, are  the ones who will decide when, where and how freedom will be  granted.    So, if Goldstein is not plain nuts, nor someone who will  succeed in stopping the peace process, he at most is one of the  settler/terrorists, as the radical settlers are prepared to be.  The act he did has caused a wave of identification among the  extremists, some of whom had decided even before last Friday  that the laws of the state are a Zionist farce not to be taken  seriously. And so, while the government ponders who, if anyone,  is to be prohibited arms, they are interviewed on television,  announcing that they have no intention of giving anyone their  weapons no matter what the government decides. Another wave, no  less extreme, has already declared that it is joining the hard  core of those who do not recognize the existence of the state of  Israel. It is this group of radicals, those who have decided to  embark on a suicidal crusade but not before taking others with  them, that Goldstein has represented since last Friday.    Now the question arises, what will the government do when  the  time comes--and that will be much sooner than people think--and  a comprehensive settlement between Israel and the Palestinians  is enforced to the hilt against the settlers, too?</p>

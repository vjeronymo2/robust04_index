			<p>BFN     [Text] Naples, Italy, April 16 (AFP) -- NATO Southern  Command confirmed here late Saturday [16 April] that a British  Sea Harrier fighter was shot down over the eastern Bosnian  enclave of Gorazde, but that the alliance had launched no air  strikes.    In a statement issued at 8:00 p.m (1800 GMT), the North  Atlantic Treaty Organisation command said the plane and a second  aircraft were patrolling over Moslem enclave when the downing  occurred.    The Southern Command said the pilot was "reported to be safe  and not seriously injured after he ejected from his jet while he  was responding to a (United Nations Protection Force) request  for close air support in the Gorazde area."    The statement added: "The Sea Harrier was flying from the  (British aircraft) carrier HMS Ark Royal. The pilot of another  Sea Harrier observed the pilot ejecting from his aircraft and  parachuting to the ground."    NATO added that the two aircraft "were attempting to conduct  a close air support mission against a tank reported to have been  firing directly into Gorazde," stressing that no NATO air  strikes were launched.    The statement added: "Information avalaible to this  headquarters suggests the situation around Gorazde is quiet at  this time."    Earlier Saturday afternoon in Zagreb, a source close to  UNPROFOR said air strikes were underway at 6:30 p.m. (1630 GMT)  Saturday around the enclave.    But the source later said that the NATO air manoeuvres  around  the besieged enclave had been flights providing close air  support and not bombing raids.    The UNPROFOR source, who declined to be named, said no Serb  target had been destroyed.</p>

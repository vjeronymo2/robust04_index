			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Clinton plays to women's gallery THE Clinton-Gore ticket, cruising to overwhelming endorsement by the Democratic party this week, played to its strengths yesterday. Mr Clinton's only scheduled public appearance was in front of the Democratic women's political caucus, already potentially swelled by the addition of six women candidates for the Senate, 34 for the House, and, as the prospective nominee said, with the prospect of more to come. The Arkansas governor laid out his feminists credentials. 'I am the grandson of a working woman, the son of a single mother, the husband of a working wife who earns far more than I and the father of a daughter who wants to build space stations in the sky.' He added: 'I have learned that building up women does not diminish men.' But the biggest applause was reserved for his commitment to defend freedom of reproductive choice ('being pro-choice is very different from being pro-abortion') and for his assertion that the country needed 'not just a new generation of leadership, but a new gender of leadership'. Senator Al Gore took his well-known commitment to the environment to a meeting of environmentalists. President George Bush's performance at the Rio de Janeiro earth summit, which he had also attended, was 'a disgrace'. The focus on both issues made sense because yesterday the convention reserved its principal business for the party platform. Although Mr Clinton was accosted by anti-abortion activists on his morning jog and though Governor Robert Casey of Pennsylvania insists on speaking out against abortion, the party itself is united in committing itself to freedom of reproductive choice and greater concern for the environment. To the extent that dissent exists outside former Governor Jerry Brown's band of insurgents, it is on economic and trade policy. Governor Mario Cuomo of New York is on record as recommending that Mr Clinton should admit a tax increase might be necessary, while Mr Paul Tsongas continues to grouse a bit that not enough is being done to promote more investment. Mr Clinton himself made one marginal hedge in policy in a TV interview, by at least allowing for the possibility that the wealthiest Americans might have to pay a bit more in social security taxes. But, unlike the British Labour Party, he was careful to avoid specifics. Equally, now that he has abandoned his earlier promise of a middle-class tax cut, he is also not keen to entertain talk of any income tax increases.</p>

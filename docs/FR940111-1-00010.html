			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> 4. Reduction of Domestic Content Required Percentage (&sect;723.505)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 320C(f) provides that the Secretary may reduce the 75 percent domestic content requirement for a calendar year following a crop loss if the Secretary, in consultation with the producer owned tobacco associations, determines that: (1) Because of drought, insect or disease infestation, or other natural disaster or other conditions beyond the control of producers, the total quantity of a crop of domestic burley or flue-cured tobacco which is harvested and suitable for marketing is substantially less than the expected production for the crop and (2) loan stock inventories for the kind of tobacco have been depleted. Under the proposed rule, the expected production would be calculated based on the planted acreage of the kind of tobacco, as reported by the NASS, multiplied by the average of the 5 most recent years' average yields per acre as published by the NASS for that kind of tobacco. The loan stock inventory of a kind of tobacco would be considered to be depleted if the Secretary, in consultation with the associations, concluded that the loan stock inventories at the beginning of the next marketing year for such kind of tobacco would not likely exceed 25 percent of the reserve stock level. Under the proposed rule, the Secretary would make the determination to announce any reduced percentage for the domestic content requirement by November 30 of the year preceding the year of the reduction. Under the proposed rule, the Secretary's authority for making the determinations on reducing the domestic content percentage would be delegated to the Director, Tobacco and Peanuts Division.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> 5. Required Records and Reports (&sect;723.506); False Statements (&sect;723.507); and Confidentiality (&sect;723.508)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 320C(b) of the 1938 Act requires that manufacturers maintain records and make such reports as are necessary to show compliance with the domestic tobacco content requirement. That section also provides that the Secretary and the USDA Office of Inspector General may examine such records and other matters as the Secretary has reason to believe may be relevant and that the Secretary may charge a fee to the manufacturer for the reasonable cost of any such examination. Section 320C(b) provides, as well, that any person who fails to provide requested information or provides false information shall be subject to 18 U.S.C. 1001 which, generally, provides that persons who knowingly and willfully supply false or misleading information, or cover up information, on matters within the jurisdiction of federal agencies, may be fined up to $10,000 or imprisoned up to five years. Section 320C(b) also provides that information submitted regarding cigarette content and levels of production will be exempt from disclosure to other members of the public under the Freedom of Information Act provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552. These provisions of section 320C are implemented in &sect;723.506 through &sect;723.508 of the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed rule, with respect to records and reports, manufacturers would be required, at a minimum, to file reports and maintain records concerning the kind, quantity, form (stemmed, unstemmed, reconstituted, etc.), and country of origin of all tobacco which is:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) In inventory at the beginning of the calendar year,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Acquired during the calendar year,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Used to manufacture cigarettes in the United States during the calendar year, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Disposed of other than through the manufacture of cigarettes in the United States during the calendar year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Separate records would be required for each lot, batch, or blend that is used to manufacture cigarettes. These records would be required to indicate the quantity of tobacco by category, domestic or import, and the total quantity of tobacco for each specific lot, batch, or run of tobacco. Regarding confidentiality, while the provisions of the statute controls disclosure of information regarding individual manufacturers, summary statistical data and general statements that are not related to a specific cigarette manufacturer could be released.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 723  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Acreage allotments, Assessments, Marketing quotas, Penalties, Recording and recordkeeping requirements, Tobacco.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> For the reasons set out in the preamble, it is proposed that 7 CFR part 723 be amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=2 --> PART 723_TOBACCO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> 1.

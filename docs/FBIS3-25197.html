			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Port Elizabeth branch of the Azanian Students'  Movement [Azasm] says it will increase efforts to remove all  white teachers from schools in the townships. At a media  conference today the students' movement said that it would use  violence if other means failed. Mike Proctor-Sims reports:    [Begin recording] [Proctor-Sims] Port Elizabeth township  schools have been the most affected by Azasm's campaign,  possibly because Azasm's national president, Phumzile Msutu,  lives here. Mr. Msutu claimed this week's removal of white  principal Chris de Wet from the (Tilulwazi) Secondary School in  Zwide as a victory for affirmative action and Azasm.    A visit to the school by television news today showed  another  story. Teachers, both black and white, had downed chalk, and  pupils had gone home early. About 1.5 percent of the 12,000  teachers at Department of Education and Training-run schools in  the region are white. Fifteen of the white teachers teach at  Khwezi Lomso in Zwide. This school had a 62.6 percent matric  pass rate last year, more than 25 percent better than the  average in the second worst year ever. Parents have demanded  their retention. Headmasters and teachers at black schools  would not talk on camera today, fearing for their careers and  lives. The majority of township residents seem against the  indiscriminate removal of white teachers.    [Unidentified parent] I would like them to be there, because  at the end of the day it is how my child is best equipped at  high school, so that child will be able to stand a chance when  it comes to university.    [Unidentified student] We don't believe in the removal of  white teachers. We believe in a nonracial struggle, and we want  the expertise of those teachers. [end recording]</p>

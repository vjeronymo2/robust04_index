			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SURF COUNTY, USA;  </P> <P> BUILDING A SURFBOARD STARTS IN SOUTH LAGUNA  </P> <P> Gordon Clark is not your typical surfing capitalist. He's over 50. He's not  much of a salesman. He hates beach fads. And his employees don't run around in  Day-Glo surfwear or hit the beach at lunchtime.  </P> <P> In fact, were it not for the racks and racks of surfboard-shaped pieces of  foam, one would be hard-pressed to imagine that Clark's South Laguna factory  had anything to do with surfing at all.  </P> <P> In one foul-smelling room, respirator-equipped workers pour a  computer-controlled quantity of viscous white liquid into a small bucket, hold  it under a stirring machine for a few moments, and then run across the room and  pour it in thin strips into a long, rectangular mold. Not exactly the laid-back  image of a beach business.  </P> <P> But this is the guts of Clark Foam, the world's dominant supplier of the  polyurethane "blanks" that are shaped and then covered with fiberglass to make  surfboards. It is one of the most venerable -- and probably one of the more  profitable -- companies in the fast-changing surf business.  </P> <P> Centered largely in Orange County, the surf industry boomed throughout the  1980s and now generates an estimated $1 billion to $2 billion in sales  annually. Most of that is accounted for by the clothing firms -- such as Ocean  Pacific, Quicksilver and Gotcha Sportswear -- that have added the word surfwear  to the international fashion vocabulary.  </P> <P> But surfing has spawned a wide variety of businesses, from tiny firms that make  surfboard wax or leashes, or distribute surfing movies, or build a few dozen  surfboards a year, to San Juan Capistrano-based Surfer Magazine and its bitter  San Clemente rival Surfing.  </P> <P> This year doesn't look to be one of the better ones for the notoriously  volatile business. Surfer Magazine publisher Steve Pezman and Surfing publisher  Bob Mignona -- who are loath to agree with one another -- both say advertising  revenues have leveled off.  </P> <P> And the two magazines, which have played a central role in moving surfing from  the cultural fringe to the commercial mainstream, are considered good  barometers of the state of the industry.  </P> <P> Gordon (Grubby) Clark, paradoxically, would welcome a return to stable,  predictable sales. Like a number of his compatriots in an industry where  salesmen entertain their clients by taking them surfing, Clark seems to view  making money as something of a sideline.  </P> <P> "The 1980s were the years of the fads," the tall, lanky 57-year-old says with a  disconsolate chuckle. Though some of his friends are in the clothing business,  he doesn't have much use for the fashion-defined "surfer lifestyle."  </P> <P> "Some guys figured out they could use surfing to sell rags, and that screwed  everything up, created a lot more demand than there would have been otherwise,"  said Clark, who was a partner of pioneering surfboard maker Hobie Alter and  took over Alter's foam business in 1961.  </P> <P> That attitude results in part from the complexity of Clark's operation. Unlike  a surfwear vendor, he cannot simply buy more fabric and hire more sewing  subcontractors when business picks up. He has to buy expensive capital  equipment, such as the 12-foot-high, $50,000 chemical boiler that was recently  installed.  </P> <P> Raw commodity chemicals are mixed in such tanks at high temperatures to produce  polyurethane resin, and computer-monitored quantities are then released through  a hose into buckets and poured into molds. In precisely 26 1/2 minutes, the  thin layer of foam expands and hardens to fill the mold.  </P> <P> After the foam is removed, a light is shined through it to check for  imperfections. Then, the blank is sawed in half and a thin strip of wood,  called a stringer, is placed between the two halves and the whole thing is  glued back together.  </P> <P> The stringers, which come in many varieties, give the board strength by  maintaining a constant distance between the sheets of fiberglass that will  eventually be layered onto the blank. And they also fix the "rocker," or  end-to-end curvature, of the board.  </P> <P> Keeping track of the hundreds of blanks that are produced each day is not easy,  since Clark Foam offers 75 different shapes and four different densities of  polyurethane, for a total of 300 different blanks.  </P> <P> Clark Foam makes all its own cement molds, cuts all the stringers from raw  lumber and even produces its own glue. "I can't integrate forward because I'd  be competing with my customers, so I've integrated backwards," Clark explains,  revealing the strategic thinking that lies behind the self-effacing modesty  about his business acumen.  </P> <P> The company also makes slabs of polyurethane which are sold to boat makers and  others who need what is known simply as surfboard foam.  </P> <P> Clark, friendly but evasive, won't discuss his private company's finances. Nor  will he say how many blanks his 100-strong work force produces each year.  </P> <P> But surfing industry experts believe he produces as many as 100,000 per year  and commands a majority of the worldwide market for surfboard innards, with the  balance accounted for by several Australian companies and by large chemical  firms that sell standard polystyrene foam.  </P> <P> With blank prices ranging from $30 for a basic model up to $200 for customized  jobs, Clark Foam is certainly pulling in some tidy sums. Enough, at least, to  give the publicity-shy Clark plenty of time for surfing and trail-bike riding.  He has a home in Hawaii, as well as one overlooking Capistrano Beach.  </P> <P> Though he downplays the novel nature of his business -- "I'm just a resin  producer. We might as well be making toilet seats" -- Clark concedes that he  enjoys being involved in the design and development of surfboards.  </P> <P> His customers, many of them individual craftsmen and surf-shop owners, "shape"  the blanks in a variety of ways, cover them with fiberglass, install the fins,  paint them, and sell them for $300 to $500 retail -- proudly advertising with a  distinctive logo that they use Clark Foam.  </P> <P> A stable core of customers, in fact, makes Clark Foam among the most fad-proof  of all surfing businesses. Trends may come and go, but there will always be  surfboards. And for as long as there have been fiberglass-covered foam  surfboards, there has been a Clark Foam.  </P></p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / West Germany retail sales forecast West German retail sales will increase by no more than 1.5 per cent in real terms this year, Mr Hermann Franzen, president of the HDE retailers' association, said yesterday, writes Christopher Parkes from Bonn. The boom of early 1991 was snuffed out later in the year as increased taxes and duties and the economic downturn took their toll, he said. Total sales in the west were almost DM750bn (Pounds 262bn), representing a volume increase of 8.6 per cent. Volume in the east, where there are no comparable figures for 1990, reached around DM90bn.</p>

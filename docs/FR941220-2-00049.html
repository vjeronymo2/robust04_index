(``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange proposes to: (1) Amend its listing guidelines for stock index (``stock index'' or ``index'') warrants and currency warrants (``currency warrants''); <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  (2) establish various new rules for the trading of stock index and currency warrants; and (3) establish special customer margin requirements for positions in stock index and currency warrants. On Dec. 5, 1994, the PSE amended certain surveillance related matters addressed in the filing. See footnote 3,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> infra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Currency warrants, as used in this filing, may refer to warrants on individual currencies (or cross currencies) or to warrants on a specific currency index group (``currency index warrants'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, PSE, and at the Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Section (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PSE proposes to: (1) Amend its listing guidelines and establish uniform rules for the trading of stock index and currency warrants, and (2) establish special customer margin requirements for positions in stock index and currency warrants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PSE seeks to amend Rule 7.18 to provide higher standards for warrant issuers than currently exists. In particular, future warrant issuers would be expected to have a minimum tangible net worth in excess of $150 million. In addition, the aggregate original issue price of all of a particular issuer's warrant offerings (combined with offerings by its affiliates) that are listed on a national securities exchange or that are National Market securities traded through NASDAQ would not be permitted to exceed 25% of the issuer's net worth. The proposed amendment will require that each warrant issue will be automatically exercised on either the delisting date (if the issue is not listed upon another organized securities market) or upon expiration. Rule 7.18 also will be amended to provide that opening prices (``a.m. settlement'') for all U.S. traded securities will be used to determine an index's settlement value where 25 percent or more of the value of the index is represented by securities whose primary trading market is in the U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 2.16 is being amended to apply the current customer margin requirements for broad based stock index and currency options to stock index and currency warrants, respectively. Thus, purchases of stock index and currency warrants will require payment in full, and short sales of stock index warrants will require initial margin of: (i) 100 percent of the current value of the warrant plus (ii) 15 percent of the current value of the underlying broad stock index less the amount by which the warrant is out of the money up to a maximum of five percent of the index value. Short sales of currency warrants will follow the margin requirements applicable to listed currency options. The Exchange proposes that its stock index and currency warrant margin requirements be permitted offset treatment for spread, straddle and covered positions. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  Proposed Rule 8 of the Exchange rules applies to the trading of index warrants and currency warrants. Proposed Rule 8.1 provides that, unless the context otherwise requires or a specific provision of Rule 8 applies, the provisions of the Constitution and all other rules and polices of the Exchange apply to trading of such securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The staff of the Commission has indicated to the Exchange that it must request and obtain appropriate interpretive or no-action relief from the Commission in order to permit its index and currency warrant margin requirements to allow offset treatment for spread, straddle and covered positions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Rule 8.4 states that no member or member organization shall accept an order from a customer for the purchase or sale of index or currency warrants unless the customer's account has been approved for options trading pursuant to Exchange Rule 9.18(b). Furthermore, proposed Rules 8.5&hyph;8.8 require that the option rules pertaining to suitability, discretionary account trading, supervision of accounts and customer complaints be applied to stock index and currency warrants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Rule 8.9 requires approval by a Compliance Registered Options Principal of all advertisements, sales literature and educational material issued by a member organization pertaining to stock index and currency warrants. The rule further requires Exchange approval of all advertisements and educational materials pertaining to stock index and currency warrants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Rule 8.10 provides that position limits for stock index warrants on the same index with original issue prices of ten dollars or less will be fifteen million warrants covering all such issues. The rule provides that warrants with an original issue price greater than ten dollars will be weighted more heavily than warrants with an original issue price of ten dollars or less in calculating position limits. The rule also gives the Exchange the authority to require the liquidation of a position in stock index warrants that is in excess of the position limits set forth in the rule, and Commentary to the rule provides procedures for allowing limited exceptions to the position limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Albert Kochetkov] </F>   [Text] Tbilisi June 12 -- Murman Omanidze, who was the  foreign minister in the Zviad Gamsakhurdia government, has  returned home after a two-year exile and is now taking part in  the elections of a deputy to the parliament from the Rustavi  constituency. The new deputy will replace Zhiuli Shartava,  chairman of the council of ministers of the autonomous republic,  who died a tragic death in Abkhazia.    At first nine candidates were vying for the seat in  parliament. Later three candidates withdrew from the electoral  campaign, and two of them urged the electors to vote for Murman  Omanidze.    Omanidze, 56, is in perfect health. In younger years he  actively practiced sports and got the title of master of sports  for unarmed self-defence. Aside from it, he showed a special  gift for business, when he was still a student of the law  department of Tbilisi university. Now he is vice president and  executive director of the joint Austrian-Finnish firm Stellar  with the turnover of hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars and  tens of billions of roubles.    Once speaking at a press conference, Omanidze said that if  he  came to power, he would make Georgia into a flourishing country  in two to three years. He, a wealthy man with numerous  connections in the business circles of Russia and other  countries and without nationalistic prejudices, is giving  priority to economic interests.    According to reliable sources close to the Georgian  leadership, if Murman Omanidze is elected deputy to the Georgian  parliament, he may soon become prime minister of the republic.</p>

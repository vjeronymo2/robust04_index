			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Markets: Simple advice that made Buffett rich - Serious Money This evening many of America's most serious investors will be watching a baseball game in Omaha, Nebraska. Throwing the first pitch will be America's second richest man, Warren Buffett, who has made Pounds 5.5bn by inspired but prudent investment. The baseball game is the prelude to the annual general meeting on Monday of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, the company Buffett runs with his partner, Charlie Munger. Over the last 29 years, Berkshire's asset value has risen at an average annual rate of 23.3 per cent compound. Less successful investors scour the chairman's annual statement for hints from the master. Buffett is routinely scathing about ''institutional investors' - one of those self-contradictions called an oxymoron, comparable to 'lady mudwrestler''. His own strategy is to search for good businesses which he can understand, run by honest and competent people, offering outstanding long-term value and available at a very attractive price. Having tracked down these rarities, he holds on to them for a very long time. This year the first butt of his annual sermon is 'standard diversification dogma' - the conventional wisdom that all investment portfolios should contain a wide spread of different shares. He goes on to query the usefulness of constructing portfolios using 'beta' analysis - measuring their investment risk by the relative volatility of the individual shares or of the whole portfolio. Buffett does not attempt to defeat the academic theorists on their own abstruse grounds. He uses two complementary commonsense arguments. First, his own strategy breaks all the beta-theorists rules, but he regards himself as a prudent investor - so maybe there is some fundamental flaw in beta-based theory. Secondly, beta-theory produces some absurd consequences - so maybe the theory is bunk. His own portfolio consists of a few lumpy holdings - risky according to the academics. But 'portfolio concentration may well decrease risk if it raises, as it should, both the intensity with which an investor thinks about a business and the comfort-level he must feel with its economic characteristics before buying into it.' He suggests that investors should stick to his knitting: limit the number of decisions he needs to make and concentrate on getting those right: 'By confining himself to a relatively few, easy-to-understand cases, a reasonably intelligent, informed and diligent person can judge investment risks with a useful degree of accuracy. 'If you are able to understand business economics and to find five to 10 sensibly-priced companies that possess important long-term competitive advantages, conventional diversification makes no sense for you . . . In the words of the prophet Mae West: 'Too much of a good thing can be wonderful.'' And what if you do not understand business economics but want a long-term stake in industry? Buffett has a superficially surprising suggestion: regular investment in an index tracking fund. The tracker gives you the conventional wide spread, but ensures that you do not seriously undershoot the market. A regular investment scheme, which buys more shares when the market is low than when it is high, helps you beat the market. 'When 'dumb' money acknowledges its limitations, it ceases to be dumb.'                              *      *      * Next week 3i, Britain's largest venture capital group, takes its first step towards a stockmarket launch in late June. With shareholders' funds of around Pounds 1.6bn, it is a plausible candidate for the FT-SE 100 share index, and will be a giant among investment trusts. On Tuesday, nearly 100 private client stockbrokers are due at the seminar where 3i peddles its charms. Not that there should be much trouble whipping up interest. The group is owned by the major banks and only a third of the equity is likely to be sold. Professional investors will be keen buyers. The boring reason for their enthusiasm is their desire for an appropriate 'weighting' in any FTSE company. The interesting one is that 3i provides a unique opportunity to invest in small growing companies, without any of the normal technical problems. And the small company sector should benefit disproportionately from Britain's economic recovery. How would 3i shape up to Buffett criteria? 3i is far more diversified - 3,500 different investments - than Buffett's own portfolio. But it operates in the part of the economy that is, almost by definition, growing over the long term. And 3i's unusual willingness to give the companies in which it invests the chance to grow without imposing a penal timetable keeps new customers knocking at its door. Buffett would surely approve of its commanding position in its own market, and of its stress on good management. To claim that all its hundreds of employees are Buffett clones would be stretching your credulity. But both at 3i and in Omaha, Nebraska, the emphasis is on thinking like a businessman - not like an institutional investor or a lady mudwrestler.                              *      *      * Record-breaking unit trust sales of over Pounds 1bn in March provide a classic case of greed (for Pep tax breaks) overcoming fear of sliding share prices.</p>

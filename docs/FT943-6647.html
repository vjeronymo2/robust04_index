			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Debt traps that make student life a misery - Bethan Hutton offers some advice on avoiding the worst of the pitfalls When the grant cheque first arrives in freshers' week, many students feel richer than they have ever been. But, by the end of the first term, some are already in debt. By graduation, the average student owes more than Pounds 2,000. Coping with money - or, rather, the lack of it - is one of the least pleasant aspects of student life. Nothing can make it easy, but knowing how the system works can help students avoid some of the worst pitfalls. Banking. Banks woo student customers with everything from free jeans to hard cash, but it is better to look for convenience, free banking and cheap borrowing. The best student bank account this year seems to be with a building society. The Halifax is offering the largest interest-free overdraft, the highest rate of interest for those in credit, and the lowest interest rates for both authorised and unauthorised overdrafts above the interest-free limit. Some general advice for students: Before making a final choice of bank (or building society), students should check that it has at least one branch and plenty of cash points near your place of study. New students with existing bank accounts should demand all the student conditions and privileges - or open an account with another bank if terms are better elsewhere. Check regularly how much (or how little) you have in the bank; it is easy to let debt creep up on you. Allow, too, for the fact that balances given out by cash machines are a day or two out of date and that cheques take several days to clear. Always talk to the bank before exceeding an overdraft limit. Bounced cheques are expensive. Avoid credit cards unless you have good self-control or parents with deep pockets. Grants. These were cut by 10 per cent in the last Budget, although the maximum loan was increased to compensate. More grant cuts are expected to push the balance further towards reliance on loans over the next few years. Grants for most students aged under 25 are means-tested on their parents' income. Parents start having to contribute if they earn more than about Pounds 15,000 a year, and those with income of more than about Pounds 35,000 must meet the full cost of a son or daughter studying outside London. Loans. Debt has become impossible to avoid for most students. The cheapest way to borrow is an interest-free student overdraft, but student terms last for a maximum of a year after graduation. Then, no matter what your financial situation, you must pay off the overdraft or be charged market interest rates. Loans from the official Student Loans Company are repayable over five years, starting the April after graduation, as long as you are earning more than 85 per cent of average earnings (now about Pounds 14,000 a year). If you earn less, the loan can be deferred. Technically, the loan is interest-free, but the amount you owe will rise in line with inflation. You can apply for a loan once each academic year. If you ask for less than the maximum amount, you cannot make a second application if you need more later. Other sources of money. The government gives each university or college a sum of money for distribution as 'access funds' to help students in dire need. The amount of money is limited, and demand is heavy, but if you have a good case it is worth a try. Some institutions also have their own hardship funds or scholarships. Sponsorship is a very attractive option. It is easiest to obtain for engineering students, but a growing range of employers, from the armed forces to accountancy firms, are willing to sponsor students on other courses. Careers offices may have more information, or get a copy of Sponsorships for Students 1994 (Hobsons), Pounds 5 from the Careers and Occupational Information Centre, PO Box 348, Bristol, BS99 7FE. Some large companies have schemes to provide financial help to employees' student offspring - parents should make enquiries. A few charities also make small grants to students who meet certain conditions. For details, look in your library for the Charities Digest, Money to Study, or The Grant Register. Tax. Grants, loans and parental contributions, to the level of the maximum grant, are not treated as taxable income. Students can earn up to the full personal allowance of Pounds 3,445 on top of their grant before paying any tax. Most students will not earn enough from part-time or temporary work to be liable for tax, but it is often deducted automatically from wages. To avoid this, fill in Inland Revenue form P38S before starting work. Further reading.

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Books: Emotionally fraught women - Fiction NET OF JEWELS by Ellen Gilchrist Faber Pounds 14.99, 360 pages THE BLINDFOLD by Siri Hustvedt Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 8.99, 221 pages SUN DIAL STREET by Marti Leimbach Picador Pounds 8.99, 276 pages RHODA MANNING, the heroine of Ellen Gilchrist's Net of Jewels, is an impossible young woman. Coming of age in a rich Alabama family in the 1950s, she is as highly strung as a poodle on Dexedrine, driving her parents, classmates and lovers to distraction as she seeks to find a place for herself in the make-believe world of the pre-Civil Rights South. Everything she does - college, sex, marriage, childbirth - becomes a crisis. She causes the death of a suitor in a drunken car accident, abandons her children when they become inconvenient, ingests drugs and alcohol in fruitless attempts to stay thin and happy, and even undergoes an unnecessary abortion after an adulterous love affair. For all the storm and strife she brings to her life, however, her six-year stumble toward womanhood lands her right back where she started - being provided for in her father's antebellum mansion. Gilchrist's novel is a realistic and urbane evocation of that breed of southern woman often encountered in Tennessee Williams plays. High strung, pretentious, passionate, painfully self-conscious, Rhoda is like a hothouse flower that wilts the moment the lights are taken off it. It is a fascinating character study, delivered with considerable skill and precision. But the problem with the book is the problem with impossible women - their manic charm eventually becomes cloying, forcing you to search out more convivial company. You sure won't find it in The Blindfold, another story of an emotionally fraught young woman. Siri Hustvedt's heroine, the anagrammatic Iris, arrives in New York City with little more than her fragile psyche as she prepares to study English at Columbia University. She soon finds herself involved with all manner of weird souls, including a recluse who hires her to recreate the life of a murder victim on audio tape, a photographer who takes a strangely provocative picture of her, as well as the fellow patients in the hospital where Iris is treated for migraines. She also manages to find the time to engage in a few unsatisfactory love affairs and, most distressingly, a bizarre relationship with an art critic named Paris who likes to wear pink suits as he peers into Iris's troubled soul. Told in a series of episodic, loosely connected chapters, The Blindfold is a prolonged study in angst and enervation that is hard to read for more than few pages at a time. This is not to say that it lacks striking moments, particularly the long, crazed night that ends with Iris grabbing a cop's gun in a strip bar just to see what will happen. But with little humour or plot, mood becomes everything, and the mood here is decidedly bleak. It is the sort of book that should appeal primarily to writing students and people with monochromatically black wardrobes. The narrator of Marti Leimbach's Sun Dial Street is not a nervous young woman, though you feel the book might have been better if he had been. Sam Haskell is a strangely naive manager of rock bands who travels to LA to visit the mother and sister he has not seen in four years. Mom has changed her name and is still a manic depressive, but his sister Ginny is now a striking young woman. Sam quickly starts playing the protective and slightly obsessive older brother, especially when it comes to Ginny's relationship with a seedy club owner, who also happens to be a former lover of Sam's new girlfriend. What follows is the stuff of TV movies - a rapid progression of murder, star-crossed love affairs, irate husbands and illegitimate children. By making her narrator a man, Leimbach has robbed the slim story of the emotional power that might have saved it. Sam's voice only rarely rings true, and his musings about the inner lives of the other characters are downright annoying. The result is a book that reads like a hasty and ill-conceived novelisation of a melodramatic film.</p>

			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LUNGREN WANTS USERS TARGETED IN WAR ON DRUGS;  </P> <P> CANDIDATE: THE GOP CONTENDER FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL PROPOSES FORFEITURE OF  PRIVILEGES, SUCH AS DRIVING A CAR. HE URGES A CHANGE IN FOCUS OF PROGRAMS  AGAINST DRUGS.  </P> <P> Calling America's war on drugs another Vietnam when it should be another World  War II, attorney general aspirant Dan Lungren suggested Monday that the  forfeiture of essential privileges, such as driving a car, should be employed  to punish the casual drug user.  </P> <P> For too long, the former Republican congressman said, the prime emphasis of  drug programs has been on the trafficker, when it should also have been aimed  at the average "Joe Doaks" who may only have been caught smoking a joint.  </P> <P> Lungren proposed that a series of laws be passed to deter the casual user by  forcing him or her to risk the loss of driving privileges, a professional  license or eligibility for state and federal benefits if discovered possessing  even a small amount of drugs.  </P> <P> "If we're going to have a war on drugs, we ought to decide whether it's going  to be the Vietnam War or World War II," he said. "We as a society have to make  a major commitment to eradicate drugs in this country. Either that, or we ought  to give up. And I don't believe in giving up. . . .  </P> <P> "We have to recognize the user is as much involved in the drug process as the  trafficker because without the user, there's no use for a trafficker. What's  the message when you condemn the trafficker and excuse the user?"  </P> <P> Lungren, the only Republican so far to enter the race for attorney general,  gained public visibility two years ago when he was appointed by Gov. George  Deukmejian to become state treasurer but failed to win Senate confirmation.  </P> <P> Now back in the public spotlight as a candidate for his party's nomination for  one of the the state's highest offices, he gave his views on a variety of  topics during a breakfast with The Times' Sacramento Bureau. They included:  </P> <P> * Abortion: Characterizing his position as strongly pro-life, Lungren pledged  as attorney general to carry out the law, but acknowledged that in a "perfect  world," he would like to see all abortions outlawed except those to protect the  life of the mother.  </P> <P> * Ethics: He promised that if elected, he would establish a special unit to  deal with public integrity issues. He said the unit would investigate and  prosecute cases of public misconduct when there were multiple jurisdictions  involved or when a local district attorney for whatever reason might want to  "hand off" the case to someone else.  </P> <P> Lungren also said the Legislature should be required to rotate memberships on  "juice" committees, influential panels where members tend to receive a steady  stream of contributions from special interests.  </P> <P> * Death Penalty: If he is elected attorney general, he said, he would appoint  his best "legal minds" to handle capital punishment cases. But he said the  timing of executions is still "in the hands of the court."  </P> <P> * Public Confidence: To improve public awareness of state government, he said a  television channel similar to C-Span should be established to enable viewers to  watch the conduct of state business. At the same time, he said campaign  financing laws should be reformed to increase voters' confidence in elected  officials, but the reform should not go so far as to require the public  financing of elections. He said he would favor a law requiring candidates to  raise half of their campaign funds in their district.  </P></p>

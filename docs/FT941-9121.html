			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: TR Pacific net assets surge Net asset value per share of TR Pacific Investment Trust rose from 114.6p to 242.4p over the 1993 year. Net revenue declined from Pounds 490,000 to Pounds 475,000, equal to earnings of 0.709p (0.731p) per share. A same-again single dividend of 0.35p is recommended. A 1-for-1 scrip issue is also proposed. The trust's investment policy is targeted towards capital growth and revenues are normally low. A 14 per cent improvement in gross revenue to Pounds 2.33m (Pounds 2.04m) was more than offset by higher costs - interest charges increased to Pounds 547,000 (Pounds 282,000). Directors said the rise in Pacific stock markets was 'broadly based with strong gains achieved across the region'. Hong Kong remains the trust's largest investment area. They added that the outlook for economic growth and company profits 'continues to be encouraging in most countries and . . . long term, the prospects for the region and its stock markets continue to be excellent'.</p>

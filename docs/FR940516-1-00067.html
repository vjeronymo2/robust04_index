			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> i.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> BLR source category. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For basic liquid resin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production, tests would be required to determine the flow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate and HAP concentration of emissions from process vents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and, where applicable, storage tank vents that are combined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with process vents. Data from three 1-hour tests would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to calculate an average HAP emission rate in pounds per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hour. Initial performance tests for uncontrolled streams or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> streams controlled by devices other than flares and certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boilers and process heaters would consist of measuring HAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration using the EPA Method 18 or Method 25A of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Method 25A may be used only if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> single HAP compound greater than 50 percent of the total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic HAP in the vent stream and that HAP compound is used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for calibration. Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of 40 CFR part 60,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appendix A is specified for measuring vent stream flowrate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To determine the production-based emission rate for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process vents, the owner or operator would calculate an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hourly rate of production based on production data for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previous year and the actual operating hours during the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual period. For each vent, the hourly emission rate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined from the average of three 1-hour tests, would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> divided by the hourly production rate (calculated as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described above) to determine the production-based emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate for the vent. The sum of production-based emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates from all process vents (and storage tank vents if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manifolded with process vents) constitutes the first term in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the equation used to determine compliance. Because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions are divided by the annual production of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previous year, testing must take place under operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions that represent the production rate for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previous year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emissions from storage tanks not manifolded with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process vents would be calculated according to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodology described in 40 CFR 63.150(f)(3). The annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions would be divided by the annual production from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previous year to determine the production-based emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate from storage tanks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emissions from wastewater would be calculated according  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the methodology described in 40 CFR 63.150(f)(5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Monthly emissions calculated using this methodology would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> divided by a monthly production rate, which would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated by dividing the annual production rate for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previous year by 12. Testing is required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR 163.150(f)(5) to determine wastewater stream  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameters such as the flow rate and HAP concentration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because emissions would be divided by a production rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated using production data for the previous year, test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions must reflect typical production for the previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> WSR source category. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If a process uses a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condenser to recover HAP, emissions would be calculated for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the purpose of determining compliance using equations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed for batch operations, in lieu of compliance tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Testing would be required to determine the emission rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from uncontrolled vents and vents controlled by devices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other than condensers. Testing requirements are the same as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the BLR source category, except that testing would take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> place over the batch cycle, rather than hourly. Likewise,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the production-based emission rates used in the equation to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine compliance would be calculated based on emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and production data obtained on a per-batch basis, not per-hour as is the case for the BLR source category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with the BLR source category, storage tank emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculations would follow the methodology described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR 63.150(f)(3). The methodology of 40 CFR 63.150(f)(5)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be used to determine emissions from wastewater.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Equipment leaks emission point. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  To determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the standard for equipment leaks, BLR and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> WSR facilities would have to demonstrate that an LDAR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program meeting the requirements of 40 CFR part 63,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart H (40 CFR 63.160&hyph;63.183) is in place. This includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance of the test methods and procedures used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verify the adequacy of monitoring equipment outlined in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR 63.180.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. New Sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> BLR source category. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Although the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for new BLR sources are essentially equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards, control efficiencies are required for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment specified in the standards. Therefore, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition to installing the equipment required by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards, new BLR facilities would be required to perform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the appropriate EPA test methods to demonstrate that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> common water scrubber required to control emissions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater is achieving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 99 percent control. The testing methodology described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR 163.150(f)(5) would be required to demonstrate that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater treatment systems are achieving 99 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> WSR source category. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The equipment standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new WSR facilities do not specify any control efficiencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that must be achieved. Therefore, facilities would only be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to demonstrate operation of a water-cooled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condenser at an outlet temperature of 25  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C, that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methanol is being produced during the manufacturing process,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that no hydrochloric acid is being used to produce WSR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Monitoring Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Monitoring is required by the proposed standards to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine whether a BLR or wet strength resin process is in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance. This monitoring is done either by:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Continuously measuring outlet mass flowrate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration, or by (2) continuously measuring a site-specific operating parameter, the value of which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established by the owner or operator during the initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance test. The operating parameter value is defined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as the minimum or maximum value established for a control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> device or process parameter that, if achieved by itself or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in combination with one or more other operating parameter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> values, determines that an owner or operator is complying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the applicable emission limitation or standards. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summary of the monitoring requirements of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards is provided in Table 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Supporters gather for Asil Nadir's third court appearance ABOUT 100 supporters of Mr Asil Nadir mustered outside Bow Street magistrates court in London yesterday when the Polly Peck chairman made his third court appearance on theft and false-accounting charges totalling Pounds 25m, Raymond Hughes writes. Sir David Hopkin, the chief metropolitan magistrate, agreed that in future Mr Nadir (pictured) need report to his local police station only once a week  -between 7pm and 9pm on Mondays - instead of daily. The requirement was one of the conditions on which Mr Nadir was granted Pounds 3.5m bail in December. Another was that he must live and sleep at his Mayfair home. That was varied yesterday to enable him to travel out of London overnight. Mr Simon Browne-Wilkinson, for the Serious Fraud Office, asked for the case to be adjourned until July 23. He said the case should be ready for transfer to a crown court within six months. Sir David decided that the next hearing would be on July 9 when, he said, Mr Nadir need not attend court.</p>

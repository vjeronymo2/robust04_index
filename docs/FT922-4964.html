			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / BAe cuts satellite capacity and jobs BRITISH AEROSPACE is to halve its satellite manufacturing capacity with the loss of up to 640 jobs. The cuts will be at the BAe Space Systems plant in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, the only builder of commercial satellites in the UK. BAe blamed the job cuts on the loss of an order last week for a Japanese satellite. That went to Hughes Aircraft of Los Angeles, the world's most successful maker of communications satellites. Mr David McLaurin, managing director of BAe's communications satellite division, said: 'We regret having to make this announcement. However, it is necessary to protect the business for the future and allow us to continue to be competitive and effective.' Staff will leave the factory between now and September 9. The company yesterday called for volunteers, but said there could be compulsory redundancies. BAe has been under pressure for many months as orders in the increasingly competitive communications satellite market have dried up. It has been in talks since last summer with Anglo-French rival Matra Marconi Space over merging the companies' satellite operations. BAe has just completed three commercial contracts and is working on a fourth. But next year contains only the probability of a contract from the Ministry of Defence. BAe is bidding to build Arabsat for the Arab League. If it wins, the number of job cuts would be reduced by about 140. The winner of that contract should be announced within three months, BAe said. The company is a victim of increasing competition in the satellite industry. The growth of the civil market has attracted new competitors from the defence sector. At the same time, the proportion of contracts open to competition has risen as international telephone traffic has increased. Mr Tim Webb, national officer of the MSF general technical union, said the announcement was another example of professionally qualified staff losing their jobs due to government indifference. 'Unlike European partners the government has given virtually no support to the UK space programme,' he said.</p>

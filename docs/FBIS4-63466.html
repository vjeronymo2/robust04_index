			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service in  Ukrainian at 1925 GMT on 21 May carries a 37-minute live  interview with Mykola Mykhalchenko, domestic policy adviser to  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, by Mykola Marynenko.  Reception is fair to unmonitorable.    Marynenko begins by commenting on the seriousness of the  situation in the Crimea and on misinformation in the mass media.  He asks Mykhalchenko to give his opinion on the situation.  Mykhalchenko replies:    Mykhalchenko replies: "I would like to say first that the  situation in the Crimea right now is, unfortunately, very, very  dangerous. One of the sides in the Crimea--that is, the  extremist forces of the Russian community--has in fact reached  an abyss. Thus, it is now evident that there could be a civil  war, and the latest events plainly show this."    Mykhalchenko says he has been in the Crimea recently and  noticed that the Crimean Tatars were ready to act very  resolutely if the policy of separating Crimea from Ukraine and  joining it to Russia did not stop, fearing another deportation  of the Crimean Tatars, this time forever. He notes that  pro-Russian separatist forces in Crimea are being destructive  while Russia is calling for mutual understanding.    Marynenko asks Mykhalchenko about the closed Ukrainian  parliament session on 20 May. Mykhalchenko replies: "The  Ukrainian president gave objective information to the deputies  of the newly elected Supreme Council about the situation in the  Crimea, showing them our possibilities for keeping the situation  under control. He said-- this is not word for word but the  general sense of it--that Ukraine has reached the final stroke,  that one cannot retreat now, and that the president is prepared  to act vigorously and firmly, and so on. He proposed a whole set  of actions for keeping the Crimea as part of Ukraine and for not  allowing [word indistinct] a civil war there. Unfortunately, I  repeat unfortunately, our parliament again adopted a half-way  decision only to suspend all of these documents, which  facilitate the operation of the documents adopted by Crimea's  parliament: One should revoke unconditionally and so on."    Mykhalchenko adds that a considerable number of the deputies  in the Ukrainian Supreme Council acted against Ukrainian  interests and that they said in parliament that events in Crimea  should be allowed to take their course. He dwells on the fact  that the Crimean Tatars did not take part in voting on the  decision in the Crimean Supreme Council, that they do not  support the separation of the Crimea from Ukraine, and that  their position is important.    Marynenko asks Mykhalchenko what President Kravchuk can do  if  the Ukrainian Supreme Council does not agree to his proposals.  Mykhalchenko replies: "The Supreme Council is the highest  legislative authority in Ukraine, but Ukraine's president is the  guarantor of statehood. Ukraine's president is the guarantor of  the Constitution, whatever kind of constitution it is, and the  president should defend the current Constitution. I think the  president will act vigorously and do everything possible to  preserve Ukraine's statehood, so that territorial issues are  resolved only in accordance with the Constitution." He adds  that the people of Ukraine will be the judges of the Ukrainian  Supreme Council.    Marynenko brings up the fact that Russia and Crimea  concluded  an agreement without going through Kiev, to which Mykhalchenko  replies that Ukraine informed the United Nations and other  international organizations that Crimea does not have the right  to sign international or political agreements on its own or even  to hold talks on these issues. He dwells on Russia's history of  dictatorship and says that Russia trains other states to view  its policy towards its neighbors as policy not based on  international law, but on force.    Marynenko questions Mykhalchenko about the recent telephone  conversation betwen Presidents Kravchuk and Yeltsin.  Mykhalchenko replies: "The point is that in this conversation,  as far as I know, Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk raised the issue of  mutual relations between Ukraine and Russia, saying that the  signing of a broad political treaty between Ukraine and Russia  should be accelerated as should the dividing up of the Black Sea  Fleet. The events in the Crimea were undoubtedly touched on.  Leonid Makarovych posited that the situation really is entering  a dead end now, that the president of Ukraine cannot expect  something because there is nothing to expect, and so on, and  that he will act firmly according to these circumstances.  Undoubtedly Yeltsin did not agree with this position, but the  president of Ukraine made no promises that he will not act  purposefully or vigorously. Leonid Makarovych said that he  would act within the framework of Ukraine's Constitution, which  gives the president many possibilities for various courses of  action. That is, Leonid Makarovych did not promise to be  passive. He made a promise to act within the bounds of Ukraine's  Constitution. This is his right."    Marynenko mentions that Yeltsin said that the Crimea is a  sovereign autonomous republic. Mykhalchenko mentions the  difference in Russia's policy toward Crimea as an autonomous  republic within Ukraine and its policy toward autonomous  republics within the Russian Federation, and says that the  Crimea cannot be both sovereign and autonomous. He says that  when he was in the United States recently none of the officials  he spoke to there had any doubt that the Crimea was autonomous  within Ukraine or that it was essentially a regional authority.    Asked about the treaty between Ukraine and Russia,  Mykhalchenko replies that President Yeltsin said he would not  sign an agreement until the Black Sea Fleet issue was resolved.  Mykhalchenko doubts that Russia will resolve the Black Sea Fleet  issue or that it would agree to the signing of a treaty. He  says that the Black Sea Fleet is used to intimidate Ukraine.  According to Mykhalchenko, although Crimean Vice Premier  Yevgeniy Saburov has Ukrainian citizenship, other members of the  Crimean Government do not, even though this is against Ukrainian  law. The interview ends with Mykhalchenko saying that Ukraine  sometimes reacts belatedly to the actions of Crimea's  extremists, mentioning the possibility of civil war, and  stressing that the Crimean Tatars will not allow another  deportation.</p>

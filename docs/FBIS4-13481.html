			<p>BFN     [Text] Presided over by esteemed acting Attorney General  Sayd Abdorrazaq Mosamem, the session of the Consultative Council  of the attorney general was held today. After a comprehensive  discussion on issues the following points were approved.    1. All jihadi organizations, political parties, political  and national leaders and personalities of the country are aware  that foreigners cannot resolve our people's and country's  problems. The oppressive and ruthless battles of armed  aggressors also cannot be a solution. Therefore, all of us will  believe in the following order of God: If you differ in  anything among yourselves, refer to God and his Apostle, and to  adhere to what are Islamic principles and laws in the eyes of  almighty God and Islamic principles are acted upon in the  country.    2. Under Article 42 of the law of courts' jurisdiction and  organization, and Articles 397 and 399 of the penal law, and  Article 433 of the law of civil litigation, the resolution of  the high council of the Supreme Court -- the highest and last  authority of the judiciary of the country -- dated 18 Hout 1372  [9 March 1994], which is in keeping with the principles of  Mohammadan shariya and the laws of the country, on the election  of the president by the representatives of the people in the  Settlement and Solution Council is enforceable, and violation  from it and its nonobservance is considered a crime, which is  punishable under Article 285 of the penal law. Public  prosecutors are obliged, in line with their duties, to deal with  the violator in accordance with the law, in case of violation  from the resolution of the judiciary, which is based on the  distinguished religion of Islam.    3. The Afghan problem is under serious consideration and  negotiations by domestic and international bodies. Those views  and resolutions will be accepted provided they entail the high  interests of our country and the will of the majority of the  citizens of the country. Otherwise they will not be acceptable.    4. Highway security posts of jihadi forces, the Ministry of  Defense, the Department of National Security, and police  officials are reminded to pay serious attention to the  prevention of trafficking of ancient and historic artifacts and  to introduce the violators to the attorney general of the  Islamic state in order that legal steps are taken for their  prosecution in line with the laws.</p>

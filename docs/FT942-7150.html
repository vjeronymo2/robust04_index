			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bumper cash call expected Strong speculation that Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel would launch its long-awaited Pounds 850m rights issue today swept through the market. Dealers suggested that the issue would be at a deep discount to the current share prices with the best estimates pointing to a three-for-five at 270p a share issue. Rumours of the rights issue came as Eurotunnel announced that it had secured additional financing from its creditor banks. The shares, which had followed the market lower, clawed back some of the earlier losses to finish 5 down at 355p on the news, on volume of 1.3m. The company's broker and merchant bank were said to have done the rounds of institutions over the last three days in a bid to ensure that the issue was underwritten. However, one market watcher said: 'They thought they could get it away with only a 20 per cent discount but no one would take it at that price. It had to be in the region of a 30 per cent discount for any chance of success.'</p>

			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDSKINS PREVAIL AS RALLY BY BUCCANEERS FALLS SHORT  </P> <P> The Washington Redskins survived a fourth-quarter passing show by Vinny  Testaverde Sunday and escaped with a 32-28 victory over the Tampa Bay  Buccaneers.  </P> <P> Testaverde threw for 197 yards and three touchdowns in the final quarter, but  couldn't overcome the Redskins' early lead.  </P> <P> The Redskins scored on all three of their third-quarter possessions to increase  a 12-7 halftime lead to 29-7, then held on for another close win. Six of  Washington's seven games have been decided by five points or less.  </P> <P> The Buccaneers had managed just two first downs on their opening drive and two  more in the last minute of the third period, and none in between.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Washington (4-3) established control with 17 points in the third  quarter.  </P> <P> But a third-quarter wrist injury to the Darrell Green, the Redskins' best  cornerback, opened the way for Tampa Bay's comeback. After Green went out,  Testaverde started throwing.  </P> <P> Tampa Bay (3-4) got two touchdowns within a 22-second span of the fourth  quarter to cut the margin to 29-21 with 14:10 left. The Redskins pushed the  lead to 32-21 when Chip Lohmilller kicked a 32-yard field goal.  </P> <P> Until they staged their fourth-quarter comeback, the Buccaneers had been  limited to 110 yards through the first three quarters.  </P></p>

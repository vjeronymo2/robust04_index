Since the  Congressional Investigating Committee that was looking into  irregular handling of the budget ended its work and the  constitutional reform became the most important congressional  activity, PT congressmen have been disputing with the PT  national board that last year forbade the PT bloc to participate  in the reform.    Deputy Paulo Delgado (MG) [Minas Gerais] said: "We represent  the party and the people. To believe that our mandate is only  granted by the party is a way of going against the will of the  voters." Some of the PT congressmen interested in participating  in the revision suspect that the national board's prohibition,  which is strongly influenced by the radical faction, disguises  interests about the October elections.    According to this suspicion, if the PT's moderate faction  did  not participate in the reform, they would lose votes among  voters who do not belong to the PT. The prohibition, however,  would not affect their rivals, who are habitually elected with  the support of the orthodox groups. A manifesto against the  board's decision was drafted by 19 of the 37 PT congressmen last  week. The rebellious congressmen evaluated the possibility of  breaking with the party leadership, but Deputy Jose Fortunatti  (RS) [Rio Grande do Sul] who leads the PT bloc prevented this  from happening.    After two weeks of negotiations, Fortunatti convinced the PT  leaders on 8 February to allow the congressmen to participate,  at least, in the session in which the Social Emergency Fund  (FSE) had to be approved. A meeting has been scheduled for 17  February. The PT moderate faction hopes that during this meeting  the bloc will be definitively authorized to participate in the  reform.    One of the objectives of the radical PT members seems to be  to isolate Dep. Delgado and three other deputies: Jose Genoino  (SP) [Sao Paulo], Eduardo Jorge (SP), and Joao Paulo (MG). These  four deputies comprise the faction that is firmly engaged in  negotiating PT alliances with several other parties for the  October elections.    The radical faction tried to prove that the moderate faction  was opposing the party's code of ethics, but they could not.  Genoino refuted: "We have given the leadership a possibility of  overcoming the situation. By preaching a thorough boycott of the  reform, the PT leadership started a war without solution."    The moderate faction congressmen believe that if they had  been allowed to participate in the reform from the beginning,  they would have been able to ensure decisive support for their  proposals in the plenary sessions. Genoino added: "We were so  late in joining the battle that we handed the Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party and the Brazilian Social Democracy  Party to the Liberal Front Party and the Progressive Renewal  Party on a platter."    Some of the issues being debated in relation to the FSE,  such  as the article that ensured allocation of funds to education,  were of interest to the PT. When the party decided to take an  active part in the session in which the FSE was voted on, there  was little to do because negotiations among parties had already  concluded. "We were losing the game 10-1 and there was no more  time to make a goal," Fortunatti said.  <H5>  The Split </H5>   The crisis between the PT and its bloc in Congress, which  resulted from the constitutional reform, divided the party into  three different groups:    Against -- Those who do not accept participating in the  constitutional reform:    Adao Pretto (RS)    Agostinho Valente (MG)    Jacques Wagner (BA) [Bahia]    Jose Cicote (SP)    Luci Choinacki (SC) [Santa Catarina]    Maria Laura (DF) [Federal District]    Sandra Starling (MG)    Tilden Santiago (MG)    Undecided -- Those who criticize the party's position, but  do  not take sides:    Alcides Modesto (BA)    Aloizio Mercadante (SP)    Carlos Santana (RJ) [Rio de Janeiro]    Florestan Fernandes (SP)    Haroldo Saboia (MA) [Maranhao]    Jose Dirceu (SP)    Paulo Rocha (PA) [Para]    Raul Pont (RS)    Valdir Ganzer (PA)    Vladimir Palmeira (RJ)    Support the Reform -- Those who criticize the authoritarian  attitude of the party's leadership:    Benedita da Silva (RJ)    Chico Vigilante (DF)    Eden Pedroso (RS)    Edesio Passos (PR) [Parana]    Eduardo Jorge (SP)    Eduardo Suplicy (SP)    Helio Bicudo (SP)    Helvecio Castelo (ES) [Espirito Santo]    Irma Passoni (SP)    Joao Paulo (MG)    Jose Fortunatti (RS)    Jose Genoino (SP)    Lourival Freitas (AP) [Amapa]    Luiz Gushiken (SP)    Nilmario Miranda (MG)    Paulo Bernardo (PR)    Paulo Delgado (MG)    Paulo Paim (RS)    Pedro Tonelli (PR)</p>

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / 'Mother of all bribes' produces first brood: Ferruzzi-Enimont affair THE 'mother of all bribes' - the L135bn (Pounds 56m) allegedly paid by Italy's Ferruzzi group to politicians during the brief life of the public-private Enimont chemicals joint venture - is spawning its first offspring. Last week, Ferruzzi's new management revealed that it had taken legal action to freeze L500bn in assets of six former managers or members of the Ferruzzi family. The new management, imposed by bank creditors earlier this year on the highly-indebted concern, warned that the net might be widened to include others allegedly involved. The temporary sequestration, to be examined by a Milan court on August 16, is the first shot in what may be a barrage of legal actions for compensation and damages regarding Enimont, which was dissolved in 1990 with debts of L8,341bn. Ferruzzi's new bosses have presented evidence to a Milan court indicating serious financial mismanagement, including allegations that huge losses were covered up. Enimont-related kickbacks are believed to lie at the heart of the action, although the case is also thought to embrace alleged attempts by former executives to cover up US commodity trading losses suffered by Ferruzzi in 1989. Enimont's origins date back to the late 1980s, when politicians and businesmen were looking to boost the chemicals industry. Although at the time Italy was one of the western world's six biggest economies and internationally competitive in cars, computers, and white goods, chemicals had always been its Achilles heel. The post-war chemicals industry was fragmented and poorly managed. In other European countries, the industry had already been rationalised to create a handful of large, broadly based multinationals with the resources and marketing clout to prosper in such a capital-intensive business. By contrast, Italy was handicapped by a multiplicity of medium-sized manufacturers making too many products in too many places. The plants they built, frequently with the help of state subsidies for the economically depressed south, were often ill-conceived, poorly located and uncompetitive. Enimont was supposed to end all that. By combining the bulk chemicals assets of the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals group with Ferruzzi's Montedison chemicals arm, Italy would create the world's tenth biggest chemicals group. With direct access to raw materials through Eni, and the economies of scale needed to make a profit in bulk petrochemicals, the new company was supposed to have all the ingredients for success. The reality was different. Rather than combining the best of the two partners, Enimont emerged as in many ways an amalgam of the worst of the two. The company, with its plethora of small, and sometimes overlapping plants, replicated the fragmentation of the sector as a whole. Control was divided evenly between Eni and Montedison and the remaining 20 per cent of the shares were floated. This ownership structure, coupled with the diametrically opposed views of the two partners, paralysed decision-making. Leaked testimony from many of those involved in the creation of Enimont suggests the company's origins were as much linked to boosting the funds of various political parties as to high industrial expectations. Montedison, which was promised huge tax breaks to take part, allegedly paid L15bn to the Christian Democrat and Socialist parties even before Enimont was set up, according to leaked testimony. By mid-1990, less than a year after its birth, it was clear Enimont could not survive in its present form. Mr Raul Gardini, head of Ferruzzi during the Enimont affair who committed suicide last month, had orchestrated a behind-the-scenes blitz to buy Enimont shares on the stock market to try to increase his voting power in the venture; Eni responded with court action to freeze the shares; decision-making at Enimont was further hampered. By September, Eni and Montedison invoked the complex procedure to dissolve the partnership. Soon after, Eni paid L2,805bn for Montedison's 40 per cent stake. Magistrates are investigating various aspects of the termination deal, notably the price, which many observers thought excessive. According to the leaked testimony, Montedison allegedly paid about L100bn in kickbacks to many of the political leaders of the time to smooth the transaction and win approval for an allegedly inflated price. The valuation was more than 25 per cent higher than the company's value at the price before shares were frozen. The leaked testimony, mainly from Mr Giuseppe Garofano, formerly Montedison's managing director, suggests the company's management continued paying bribes until the April 1992 general elections. Apparently undeterred by the fact that magistrates were already on the trail of political corruption - then limited to local politicians in Milan - the company is alleged to have paid a further L7bn to the parties in the outgoing coalition government. Milan magistrates are still piecing together the details of the bribes paid during the saga. Mr Gardini and Mr Gabriele Cagliari, Eni's chairman at the time, are out of the picture after committing suicide. However, the sequestration order obtained by Ferruzzi's new managment includes three senior executives who worked for Ferruzzi during the Enimont saga and two Ferruzzi family members who also occupied senior positions, as well as Mr Gardini's heirs. The magistrates, who have already interrogated most of those cited in the Ferruzzi action, are also questioning people from outside the company. Eight senior politicians have so far been told they are under investigation. Last week, magistrates arrested Mr Alberto Grotti, a former deputy chairman of Eni during the Enimont affair. Mr Vincenzo Palladino, the deputy chairman of Banca Commerciale Italiana, one of Italy's most prestigious banks, is also being questioned, as is Mr Sergio Cusani, a financier associated with the Socialist party, who allegedly acted as go-between in many of the bribes. In spite of their diligence, the magistrates investigating the 'mother of all bribes' may not yet have reached the roots of the family tree. Meanwhile, losses at EniChem, the successor company to Enimont, have continued to rise, reaching L1,560bn last year, The company's financial performance is set to deteriorate because of recession and continuing political obstacles to rationalising its fragmented structure.

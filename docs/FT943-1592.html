			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Brain damage breakthrough A drug that suppresses the immune system has been found to reduce brain damage associated with strokes. Researchers working at the Fujisawa Institute of Neuroscience at the University of Edinburgh found that the immunosuppressant drug FK506 substantially reduced brain damage if it was administered up to an hour after the stroke. The research, which was reported in this week's Nature, may shed light on the role in brain cells of immunophilins, substances known to bind to FK506.

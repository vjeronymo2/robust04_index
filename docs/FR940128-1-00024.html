			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the same time, the United States is the world's largest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exporter of fishery products. In 1991, the United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exported more than $3 billion worth of seafood, making a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant positive contribution to this country's balance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments as well as to the many coastal State economies in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these products are produced (Refs. 42 and 43). Our largest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market is Japan, followed by the European Community (EC) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Canada. Both Canada and the EC have implemented or are in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process of implementing mandatory HACCP-based seafood inspection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems (Refs. 32 and 44).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the significance of both international and domestic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trade, ongoing efforts to harmonize or make equivalent country  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection systems and requirements takes on great significance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current multilateral round of trade negotiations under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has resulted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further focus on this area. The draft text on sanitary and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> phytosanitary measures acknowledges the desire of the contracting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties, including the United States, to support ``the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harmonized sanitary and phytosanitary measures between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracting parties, on the basis of international standards,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidelines, and recommendations developed by the relevant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> international organizations including the Codex Alimentarious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission *&blank;*&blank;*'' (Ref. 45, p. L.35). This move toward  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harmonization, coupled with the current recommendations of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Codex Committee on Food Hygiene encouraging the international use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the HACCP system (Ref. 46), clearly argue for the adoption of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this approach in the United States for seafood. Failure by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States to adopt a mandatory, HACCP-based inspection system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may ultimately undermine its export success, with considerable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic consequences. For example, in addition to the EC,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Canada, Iceland, Australia, and many other fishing nations have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moved to a mandatory HACCP approach that could affect United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States competitiveness in the major seafood markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EC is the United States' second largest export market,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchasing $441 million worth of U.S. products in 1991. On July  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22, 1991, EC Council Directive 91/493 was issued to set out the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions for the production and placing on the EC market fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and fishery products (Ref. 44). This Directive requires, as of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 1993, that both member States and third countries: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;*&blank;* take all necessary measures so that, at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all stages of the production of fishery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products *&blank;*&blank;* persons responsible must carry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out their own checks based on the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principles:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> _Identification of critical control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> points in their establishments on the basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the manufacturing processes used;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _establishment and implementation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods for monitoring and checking such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical control points; *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _keeping a written record *&blank;*&blank;* with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a view to submitting them to the competent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority *&blank;*&blank;*. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While the directive provides some flexibility in terms of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalence, it is clear that the EC is looking for a mandatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HACCP system along the lines proposed in this regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maintaining and expanding this export market is likely to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilitated if this proposal is adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, ongoing discussions with Canada under the terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of section 708 of the U.S./Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harmonize or make equivalent the two nations' respective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection systems and standards have made it clear that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed HACCP regulation will significantly facilitate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process (Ref. 47). Canada has recently completed implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a mandatory, HACCP-based seafood inspection program. Because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Canada is the United States' third largest export market and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> largest supplier of imported seafood, adoption of an equivalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system would not only achieve the objectives of the FTA but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potentially would save resources currently devoted to monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipments between our two countries. Similar potential benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be expected under the proposed North American FTA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly at this formative stage in that process. Thus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilitation of international trade is a fourth factor supporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the appropriateness, and thus providing a rational basis, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA's proposed course of action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

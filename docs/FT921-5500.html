			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Militant to seek CPSA leadership A SUPPORTER of Militant Tendency is to seek the leadership of the CPSA, Britain's biggest Civil Service union, after Mr John Ellis, the current general secretary, yesterday secured a job with another organisation. Mr John Macreadie, the deputy general secretary and a Militant supporter, is thought to stand a chance of success. The favourite, however, will be Mr Barry Reamsbottom, a candidate for the union's moderate faction. Six years ago Mr Macreadie beat Mr Ellis in an election for the top job but lost a second contest after voting irregularities were uncovered in the first. Militant's influence in the CPSA has declined since then but Mr Macreadie, aged 45, has a high profile as deputy general secretary. If elected he would be expected to seek a more confrontational stance in the 124,000-strong union's negotiations with the Treasury. In recent years the union's moderate leadership has steered through a series of controversial changes - including acceptance of an element of performance pay - which have been opposed by Militant supporters. There has been only limited industrial action in the Civil Service in recent years compared with the early 1980s. Mr Ellis was yesterday chosen to succeed Mr Peter Jones, who is retiring in June as general secretary of the Council for Civil Service Unions, the representative body for these unions on certain common issues. Mr Ellis was chosen in preference to the only other challenger, Mr Derek Stobbs, assistant general secretary at the FDA union for top civil servants. Mr Macreadie and Mr Reamsbottom are the only declared candidates in the CPSA contest. It is possible, though unlikely, that Broad Left 84, a faction which in political terms stands between the broad left and the moderates, will put up a candidate. Mr Reamsbottom, aged 43, is a national officer and editor of the CPSA's monthly journal. On the present CPSA executive, the moderates have 22 of the 28 seats and Militant Tendency supporters three. Control of the executive has in the past been volatile, however, and at several stages in the mid to late 1980s Militant was in control.</p>

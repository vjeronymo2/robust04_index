			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Observer: Warburg's insider Once again the House of Warburg has made a novel choice to head its US investment banking business. It has hired Thomas Wyman, 62-year-old ex-boss of the CBS media giant, to be chairman of Warburg &amp; Co Inc. Warburg, like most of its American and European rivals, has in the past given its top US job either to insiders from the securities industry or big financial figures like Anthony Solomon, former chief of the New York Fed. So why Wyman? The explanation lies in Warburg's ambitions in America, where it remains (like other European houses) a small player alongside the large Wall Street investment banks. Nick Verey, an old Rowe and Pitman hand now recalled to do great things back home, is credited with building up both the number and quality of its staff, which has risen from around 200 five years ago to around 350. First Michigan's Perrin Long, an old Wall Street watcher, says the impression is that they're doing a 'pretty good job'. Critics, however, suggest Warburg still isn't aggressive enough by Wall Street standards and needs more clout inside US boardrooms. This is where Wyman comes in. He knows Warburg well, having sat on the parent board for four years besides holding directorships at American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, General Motors and ICI.</p>

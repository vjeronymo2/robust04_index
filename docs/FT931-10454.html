			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: KOP losses more than doubled KANSALLIS-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, yesterday disclosed a FM3.7bn (Dollars 651m) pre-tax loss for 1992 as credit losses tripled and interest income shrank in the face of the severe domestic recession. The loss is more than double the FM1.61bn deficit recorded in 1991. The deterioration, which is symptomatic of the wider crisis in Finnish banking, came with a warning that the bank would need to strengthen its capital base this year because of the prospect of further losses. KOP's interest income fell to FM14.7bn from FM16.2bn while profit from financial operations dropped 12.7 per cent to FM2.62bn. At the same time, credit losses tripled to FM4.27bn from FM1.34bn, mainly because of problems in the corporate sector, while non-performing loans, after write-offs, soared 41.7 per cent to FM7.1bn, or 7.7 per cent of total lending. 'Soaring interest rates, the collapse of asset values, company failures and growing unemployment caused serious problems,' said Mr Pertti Voutilainen, KOP chairman and chief executive. 'Net interest income shrank as a result of forgone interest income, and lending write-offs saw explosive growth.' Internal rationalisation, including an 8 per cent cut in staff numbers to 8,500 and a 2 per cent fall in non-interest expenses, was unable to stem the negative tide. One bright spot was an 84 per cent increase in non-interest income to FM1.98bn as a result of successful foreign exchange dealing. This helped to lift total group income to FM4.60bn from FM4.08bn. The bank's figures did not include the results of STS-Bank, with which KOP has recently merged. Non-performing loans at STS amounted to FM2.6bn, although much of that should be shouldered by the government's guarantee fund. KOP said it had started investigating ways of strengthening its capital base, either through a rights issue or through support from the government or a combination of both. The bank's international capital adequacy ratio at the year-end was 9.13 per cent, but this will fall towards 8 per cent during 1993 in the face of further losses. The bank is expected to remain in the red in both 1993 and 1994.</p>

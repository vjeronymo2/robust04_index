Clinton said in his radio address today that his budget  includes spending cuts in 300 programs, the outright elimination  of 115 programs and a reduction of more than 100,000 federal  workers.    Seven of 14 cabinet departments will get less money than in  last year's budget, the President said.    Clinton is to unveil 1.5 trillion dollars budget Monday  while  in Houston, Texas. A barrage of budget briefings by top  administration officials are also scheduled for Monday in  Washington.    Clinton used most of the radio address to talk about the  need  to continue to create jobs for U.S. workers.    Clinton said in his first State of the Union address on  January 25 that the U.S. private-sector produced 1.6 million  jobs, more than the total in the previous four years, but added  that many Americans are still looking for work while wage  stagnation exists for a lot of employees.    The U.S. Labor Department announced Friday that the January  jobless rate was 6.7 percent as against 6.4 percent in December,  1993.</p>

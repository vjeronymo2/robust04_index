			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NOT SOFT ON MARSHMALLOW TOSSERS, UNIVERSITY WARNS  </P> <P> University of Michigan officials cannot be accused of being soft on rule  enforcement, but rule violations are going soft on them.  </P> <P> The school announced plans to add marshmallows to the list of objects banned  from Michigan Stadium during Wolverine football games. Already banned are  umbrellas, coolers, chair backs, backpacks and alcoholic beverages.  </P> <P> "This sounds funny, but it's a real problem," Bruce Madej, Michigan director of  sports information, said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Fans in the student section began pitching marshmallows at each other during  the season opener against Notre Dame, and the activity has stuck.  </P> <P> During an Oct. 7 game, the attention shifted to band members and cheerleaders,  who were peppered with the candies. Thousands of marshmallows littered one end  of the stadium after it was all over.  </P> <P> Marshmallows aren't harmless, Michigan officials said. Some fans press together  several marshmallows to create a gooey ball. Mixed with water, the concoction  can become as hard as a golf ball, said Jack Weidenbach, Michigan's senior  associate athletic director.  </P> <P> "We've had a number of complaints," Weidenbach said. "One woman said she got  hit and had a red spot on her cheek that bothered her all day. There are  concerns that somebody will get hurt."  </P></p>

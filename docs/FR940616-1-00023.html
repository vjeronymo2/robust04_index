			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters recommended that a common disaster frequency be established for all aircraft. Other commenters expressed concern over the potential inability of media aircraft to communicate with emergency ground officials, suggesting that on-scene ground officials be required to possess an aircraft compatible two-way radio. Suggestions were made to require pilot monitoring of the frequency while in the disaster area. Finally, suggestions were made to incorporate this proposed rule into the Airman's Information Manual rather than add it to the FAR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA recognizes the potential merit of this proposal and acknowledges the validity of the express concerns. Since this NPRM was published, the FAA has been reviewing regulations and procedures currently utilized for temporary flight restrictions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to aircraft carrying news media encountering difficulties in determining the altitude being used by disaster relief aircraft, other TFR problems have been cited. These problems include pilots being unable to receive the location of a TFR area in a timely manner; aircraft on instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plans and military aircraft on IFR training routes intruding into the TFR; the large number of aircraft in TFR's implemented for an incident or event generating a high degree of public interest; and the untimely process used to put TFR's in place, particularly when they involve critical situations such as toxic spills. In addition, of the 13 documented incidents in TFR's, only 2 were confirmed to be aircraft carrying news media. The other incidents involved general aviation aircraft or military aircraft that inadvertently penetrated the TFR's. The reason most often given was lack of information about the existence of the TFR and the inability to positively identify the TFR location. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Reasons for Withdrawal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the comments received in response to Notice No. 94&hyph;14, and the additional data as stated above, the FAA has determined that there is inadequate justification to pursue further this regulatory action. The FAA has determined that additional study of current TFR procedures, which may include parts of Notice No. 91&hyph;14, is necessary. Therefore, it is in the best interest of all concerned to withdraw Notice No. 91&hyph;14. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Decision and Withdrawal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the FAA concludes that further rulemaking on Notice No. 91&hyph;14 should not proceed at this time. Therefore, Notice No. 91&hyph;14 is withdrawn. This action does not preclude the FAA from considering similar proposals in the future or commit it to any further or future course of action on this subject.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The authority citation for part 91 continues to read as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 49 U.S.C. 1301(7), 1303, 1344, 1348, 1352 through 1355, 1401, 1421 through 1431, 1471, 1472, 1502, 1510, 1522, and 2121 through 2125; Articles 12, 29, 31, and 31(a) of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (61 Stat. 1180); 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq: E.O. 11514; 49 U.S.C. 106(g) (Revised Pub.

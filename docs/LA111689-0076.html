			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A mistrial was declared Tuesday in the case against a 36-year-old man accused  of murdering his mother-in-law at a Clairemont doughnut shop. Jurors said they  were hopelessly deadlocked, 11 to 1 for conviction on first-degree murder after  almost two days of deliberations.  </P> <P> However, the San Diego Superior Court jury did find Randy Geering guilty of  illegally exhibiting a gun and burglary in the Jan. 29 incident that left  Audrey Erbe, 59, dead from a gunshot in the head. Erbe was manager of the  doughnut shop. Geering's estranged wife was at the store at the time.  </P> <P> Judge William Kennedy ordered Geering to appear Nov. 22 for the scheduling of a  retrial. Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregg McClain said he is prepared to retry the  case.  </P> <P> Jurors were brought into court late Monday, and one told Kennedy that a verdict  was "a possibility" if they had further discussions.  </P> <P> The judge sent them back to deliberate, but they returned five minutes later,  saying they were "hopelessly deadlocked."  </P> <P> McClain had argued for a first-degree murder verdict, while Charles Elliott,  Geering's attorney, suggested an acquittal or at most a verdict of involuntary  manslaughter.  </P> <P> Geering testified that he accidentally shot his mother-in-law after he whirled  around in response to a noise and the gun discharged, striking her. But his  estranged wife testified that she heard him angrily arguing with Erbe.  </P> <P> Geering will be sentenced Dec. 13 on the two counts on which he was convicted.  He faces a six-year sentence on the burglary count and a one-year term on the  gun count.  </P></p>

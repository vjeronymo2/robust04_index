The purpose of the training is to promote access to Initiative programs for youth with disabilities. Materials should support the training and supplement this goal where training is unfeasible. Facilitative support should foster connections between secondary school exchange organizations in the US with organizations serving persons with disabilities; also promote links with similar organizations in the following countries with organizations recruiting students for NIS&hyph;US exchange programs: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kryrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan. This grant is not intended to sponsor the actual exchange of students. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Students selected for exchanges under the NIS Secondary School Initiative are aged 14 to 17 years old. Proposals should focus on increasing access to exchange opportunities by participants within this age range. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

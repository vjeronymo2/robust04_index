			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASTAS;  </P> <P> THE 'LIGHT' FOOD MOVEMENT HAS EMBRACED A CULINARY HEAVY -- PASTA. LOW-FAT  NOODLE DISHES FROM ITALY AND FROM ASIA -- SUCH AS SHRIMP-AND-SQUID CHOW MEIN,  BELOW -- ARE AT THE HEART OF THE CHANGE.  </P> <P> Talk of pasta in Los Angeles' restaurants is lightening up at every turn. One  hears: "We suggest the angel hair pasta. It has a very light sauce . . . fresh  tomatoes, cut up and sauted lightly in their own juice with a thimbleful of  olive oil and some basil. Very light." What has caused this sudden emphasis on  lighter pasta dishes?  </P> <P> Growing concern about fat and cholesterol intake is causing many Americans to  find low-fat and low-cholesterol alternatives to foods that they love to eat.  And pasta is one of them.  </P> <P> Many Italian restaurants today are suggesting light pasta, thus redefining the  popular dish as something other than a high-calorie, heavily sauced entree.  </P> <P> "It's a big movement," said Silvio di Mori, owner of Tuttobene in Los Angeles.  His restaurant's menu states that most Tuttobene dishes can be prepared  "diet-style."  </P> <P> "Cream and butter are things of the past," di Mori said. "Today we suggest  things like angel hair with fresh tomato and basil, and seafood pasta using  natural juices, not oil or butter, to cook the sauce. We get into difficulty  when people ask for no salt, however. Pasta without salt is bland, so we  suggest arrabbiata, a pasta made with chiles, onion and olives, whose sharp  flavors make up for the lack of salt."  </P> <P> At La Famiglia in Beverly Hills, there is a separate section on the menu for  low-fat, low-salt pastas. "It all started because of my own health concerns,"  owner Joe Patti said. "Our customers have responded in an overwhelming way to  these dishes." (The restaurant's pasta de checca uses a brand of pasta from  Italy, but any pasta may be used.)  </P> <P> At Locanda Veneta in Los Angeles, owner-chef Antonio Tomassi prepares low-fat,  low-calorie, low-salt pastas on request, based on items available on the day's  menu. "If a diner is on a diet, there is always a way to make the pasta  lighter," he said. One way is to cut down on the fat content of meats as well  as on oils and butter used to cook meats and to increase use of fresh  vegetables. Tomassi sometimes uses vegetable-based pastas to enhance nutrients  and to reduce salt and calories.  </P> <P> But Italian pastas are not the only types that offer a lighter approach to  cooking. Oriental noodle dishes also are rich sources of light pasta ideas.  Stir-fried noodle dishes, for example, require little or no fat, and noodle  soups, such as ramen or udon, rarely contain much fat because the noodles are  generally cooked in a fat-free broth that is naturally low in calories. If  meats are added, they are often lean -- roast pork slices, shrimp, squid or  other seafood.  </P> <P> Southeast Asian noodles dishes also are abundant, with  </P> <P> pad Thai among the most popular Asian dishes in the United States today. Pad  Thai achieves its flavor from fish or shrimp sauce, seasonings used throughout  Southeast Asia. Japanese and Chinese lo meins and chow meins also are conducive  to low-fat treatments, if the stir-frying is done with a minimum of fat or if  the fat is replaced with the natural liquids extracted from foods during  sauteing. Using more vegetables, skinless poultry and seafood, and less fatty  meat (or by trimming fat from meat) also helps keep fat and cholesterol to a  minimum.  </P> <P> Noodles or pastas alone are relatively low in calories because, like fruits and  vegetables, they are complex carbohydrates. Carbohydrates contain four calories  per gram, compared with seven calories per gram for protein and fat's 9  calories per gram. Most pastas contain about 250 calories per cooked cup.  </P> <P> Add another 200 calories from meat, fish, poultry and/or vegetables and you  will have a 450-calorie meal, or little more than one-fourth of the total  calories of an average 1,600 calories per day diet.  </P> <P> Recipes were selected that will show how to keep calories, especially in fat,  to a minimum when cooking pasta. The pasta dishes reflect today's taste in  Southeast Asian cuisine, modern Italian and Japanese/Chinese cuisines.  </P> <P> At Horai Tei, a Japanese-Chinese stir-fry restaurant in Little Tokyo, chef  Masao Shinkai prepares a chow mein containing shrimp, thinly sliced beef and  pork, plus spinach, bean sprouts, mushroom, bamboo shoots and other vegetables.  The dish contains such a variety of ingredients (in small amounts) as to make  it highly nutritious and relatively low in calories. Vary the dish further by  mixing and matching vegetables and meat to your liking.  </P> <P> Shinkai's Yaki Soba, a traditional Japanese noodle dish based on the Chinese  stir-fry, makes use of soba noodles, which are made with buckwheat and are  highly nutritious. Red ginger and dried green seaweed serve as garnishes and  add color to a nutrient-packed, low-calorie dish.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, the menu at Giuseppe! is filled with light, airy pastas, such  as Capellini Pomodoro (angel hair pasta with Maui onions, tomatoes, basil), and  tubular pasta, called penne, teamed with fresh tomato and asparagus. "Any  seasonal vegetable can be added to this dish in lieu of asparagus," said owner  Giuseppe Bellisario.  </P> <P> "The New Pritikin Program" by Robert Pritikin (Simon and Schuster: $19.95)  provides a recipe for cannelloni that contains 185 calories per serving.  (Pritikin is the son of founder of the Pritikin Institute, the late Nathan  Pritikin, who espoused a diet very low in fat.) The marinara sauce uses  defatted chicken stock as the sauteing liquid. The whole wheat-rice flour  crepes are made with nonfat milk and egg whites.  </P> <P> Pasta With Cauliflower, provided by Biba Caggiano, owner of Biba's in  Sacramento and author of "Modern Italian Cooking (Simon and Schuster: $17.95),  shows another way to make use of fresh vegetables in a pasta dish for a light  effect.  </P> <P> From Atlas Bar &amp; Grill, a new restaurant at the Wiltern Building in Los  Angeles, comes a recipe for pad Thai, a noodle dish made with shrimp sauce  (available at many Oriental food stores).  </P> <P> Bow-tie pasta is used in an improvised Thai dish made with peanuts. A  Southwestern pasta dish teams angel hair pasta with tomatoes and cilantro  instead of the customary basil. An easy ramen dish that makes use of canned  consomme rounds out our light pastas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HORAI TEI 5 FLAVOR  </P> <P> CHOW MEIN  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons oil  </P> <P> 1/2 pound lean beef, sliced paper-thin  </P> <P> 1/2 pound lean pork, sliced paper-thin  </P> <P> 1 boneless chicken breast half, sliced  </P> <P> 6 shrimp, peeled and deveined  </P> <P> 1 squid, cleaned and sliced  </P> <P> 4 Chinese black mushrooms, sliced  </P> <P> 1 (8-ounce) can water chestnuts, drained and sliced  </P> <P> 1 bamboo shoot, sliced  </P> <P> 1/4 pound mushrooms, sliced  </P> <P> 1 cup chicken broth  </P> <P> 1/4 cup soy sauce  </P> <P> 1/4 cup sake  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> 12 ounces fresh Chinese noodles, cooked and drained  </P> <P> 1 cup spinach leaves, sliced  </P> <P> 1 cup bean sprouts  </P> <P> Heat oil in wok.

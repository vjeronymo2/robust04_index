			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Private View: Gypsy president in a pin-striped suit - Peter Mercer has an office, mobile telephone, computer and fax. And most of his travelling is by air. Such is the life of a modern-day campaigner for the rights of the nomadic community The president of the Gypsy Council was wearing a pin-striped suit. He keeps a mobile phone in the mustard-coloured trailer with the mock-Tudor windows. Behind the trailer is a shack - 'my office', he calls it - where there are neat rows of files, a fax machine and a desk-top computer. Peter Mercer's gadgets are a sign that gypsies are asserting themselves after centuries of persecution. This time, finding themselves again under attack, they are fighting back with demands for recognition as a race with its own history and culture, and the right to travel and congregate however inconvenient for the increasingly suburban societies in which they live. In the past, gypsies have been more victimised than tolerated. Today, they are winning sympathy and supporters. For, according to Dr Thomas Acton, Reader in Romani Studies at the new University of Greenwich in London, they are facing the biggest crisis for a generation caused by a 'moral panic' among governments in Europe. Acton estimates that 100,000 of them have fled from eastern to western Europe following the collapse of communist rule and the breakdown of social order. Many others have exploited the new permeability of European borders to migrate in search of work. (The German government paid Romania Dollars 21m 18 months ago to take back 40,000 deportees who had been driven from their villages.) British gypsies have a specific grievance: the criminal justice bill now going through parliament. The relevant clauses of this bill look very much like an attempt to stamp out nomadism altogether. They remove the obligation on local authorities to provide sites for travellers' caravans, while giving new powers to police, landowners and the authorities to move people on. Refusal could lead to vehicles being impounded and children taken into care. This measure, say government spokesmen, is not aimed at gypsies in particular. It is to remove the taxpayer's open-ended commitment to house people who choose to live a nomadic life and to stop them parking illegally. Nomad numbers in Britain have increased unexpectedly in the last decade: some are Irish, driven out by tougher legislation, but mostly they are the so-called new age travellers, drop-outs by accident or by design. Choose nomadism if you like, says the government, but if you do, you must find a legal place to camp. The Commission for Racial Equality says the proposed legislation discriminates against gypsies and has supported attempts to amend it. Peter Mercer has another word for it: genocidal. 'It's a strong word,' he agreed. 'But genocide is not just putting people in gas chambers like the Holocaust.' (Between 500,000 and 750,000 gypsies were killed in the German death camps during the second world war and another million may have been shot outside.) 'Genocide is when you stop people meeting, stop festivals, stop the freedom of movement, destroy one's culture, everything gypsy people do. I'm not talking about raves, which they're on about. I've never yet found out what a rave is. To me it's kids doing head-banging or summat. But if we can't go to places like Appleby (horse fair) or Stow on the Wold . . .' Mercer has a small caravan beside his trailer on a site outside Peterborough, where he is the district council's gypsy liaison officer. But most of his travelling these days is done by air. As the British member of the presidium of the International Romani Union, he has visited Warsaw, Prague, Bucharest, Gottingen, Geneva, Bordeaux. Why, then, does he live in a trailer? 'Up until I started this work I was nomadic. Then I had to have a base to work from. On the road you don't have electricity points. You don't have a microwave and your washing machine. You're cooking outside in the main - an open fire, which is a lot better than this rubbish (he indicated the smart panelled kitchenette). 'In the finish you find out you're laden down with all modern contraptions which you start becoming dependent on. Having said that, at the end of the day we like to be in a position where we can go away if we wish.' You may never move from here? 'I may never. But it is there. It is my right to the freedom of movement and the right to choose where I live. And that is so important to gypsy people. If I wanted to be gone, I could . I could get rid of all this in 10 minutes flat.' To assert their ethnic claim - now recognised by the Council of Europe, the European Union and, increasingly, the English courts - has meant accepting the word 'gypsy'. As with 'didicoy', 'pikey' or 'mumper' it has a derogatory flavour but Mercer recognises that his preferred designation of 'traveller' is no longer adequate. He can demonstrate his racial origins, he said, despite the infrequency of gypsy marriages, through family ties, baptismal certificates and the genealogical records of the Mormons. Gypsies migrated from the Rajput area of northern India about 1,000 years ago after being defeated by Moslem armies. They were warriors, armourers, swordsmiths, or musicians and traders, with their own noble families. Their language, now written down, has many dialects but is based on Sanskrit. 'It's not the nicest thing in the world to be a gypsy,' Mercer said. 'Even today. Our flag is blue for sky, green for fields with a red wheel to show suffering.' I asked him if new age travellers should have the same rights as gypsies. 'People have a right to live their way of life as they wish, so long as they don't rob and steal off people or move into their house or their garden. I don't say I like the way they live and I don't say that it is fair what they are doing. But it is their right to choose.' Are they muddying the waters for gypsies? 'Oh, most certainly. One can't get away from that. A lot of local authorities and even the government is using them as a stepping board to give us a kick.' I asked him if there was much gypsy migration into Britain from Europe. Mercer said there was a big concentration of Bosnian gypsies in London, a large number of Poles and some French. He insisted they were no threat to the native gypsies because they brought their own particular skills with them. 'This government ought to accept them. I think this is one reason why they're trying to do away with nomadism in this country - the fear that we're going to get an influx from abroad. The police now are stopping caravans and road-testing them to try and stop the migrants. It looks like some Home Office directive to make things damned awkward.' Before he became an international civil servant, Mercer did fruit-picking and scrap metal. He comes from the area around Hull and during the war, at the age of eight, was taken into care. He was brought up by Roman Catholic nuns. 'Some of them were lovable, really beautiful people,' he said. 'Other ones were, believe me . . .' He left the sentence unfinished. They told him he could go home when his mother got a proper house. She eventually did, but he was sent instead to London to work as a footman, serving at table for the residents of a block of flats. 'I was there a month at most, because I was frightened of the church and the power they might have over me.' So he joined the army, following his father who was wounded at Dunkirk and an uncle who was killed on the Burma railway. 'A lot of people think gypsy people avoid military service. Not true.' He served with the Duke of Wellington's regiment in Cyprus during the Eoka uprising where, he said, because of a dispute between superior officers he had the distinction of being made a lance-corporal twice in one day. 'You appreciate, in the army I was a bit of a wild dog. I joined to try and make a life and follow a family tradition in a way, 'cos my father was saying the army is good for you, make a man of you. I found it fairly tame.' After national service and three years of re-enlistment, Mercer quit the army and 'knocked around doing scrap and making a nuisance of myself in general like you do'. He married, but his wife refused to live in a trailer. He bought her a house but the marriage broke up and he met his present wife while picking fruit. 'She calmed me down a little bit and I got involved in civil rights.' So now you're a politician and bureaucrat? 'Well, not a bureaucrat.' He said the word with distaste. 'Nowhere near. Bureaucracy's the last thing in the world I like. I won't fill in time sheets, I won't fill in movement sheets. I don't even claim for expenses. 'The nuns taught nothing beyond decimals. Within our community I'm a scholar because I can read, write and I can do one or two things. But my education has come from life, and having to do things for meself. It's an expertise you build up over the years, isn't it?'.</p>

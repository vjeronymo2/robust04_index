			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Russian budget deficit rises RUSSIA'S budget deficit at the end of the year was officially said yesterday to be Rbs1,160bn, or 6.5 per cent of gross national product, following last-minute adjustments and extra commitments to spending by the Russian Supreme Soviet. Mr Vassily Barchuk, finance minister, warned parliament that, in approving last-minute extra spending of over Rbs200m, it was breaking the limit of 5 per cent of GDP agreed between the government and the International Monetary Fund and jeopardising further credits needed to pay foreign grain exporters, now owed Dollars 300m. However, foreign finance experts in Moscow said yesterday that the real budget deficit - about which there are many estimates - was much higher and had long since been far above IMF guidelines, though the government had reined in spending this quarter. Production is sure to continue falling and unemployment rising for two months because of the recent credit squeeze.</p>

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / (CORRECTED) Performance of Tecs shows much improvement Correction (published 31st August 1994) appended to this article. Big improvements in the performance of individual training and enterprise councils were revealed yesterday by the Department of Employment. Figures showed more unemployed people gaining qualifications, as well as more obtaining jobs. Seven performance indicators were used to assess the relative performance of the 82 employer-led Tecs in relation to their delivery of publicly funded training in England and Wales. Tecs, the oldest of which is four years old, have been put in the spotlight recently by speculation that Mr Michael Portillo, the new employment secretary, wants to slash their Pounds 1.8bn training budget. Ms Ann Clwyd, the acting shadow employment secretary, yesterday wrote to Mr Portillo calling for him to 'categorically confirm' that he was not seeking to halve Tecs' budgets. It was difficult, she said, for Tecs to operate successfully when such rumours existed. The indicators show a substantial, if uneven, reduction in the cost incurred by Tecs to get jobs and/or qualifications for those on Youth Training, which guarantees a training place for young people, and Training for Work, the programme for long-term unemployed people. TFW, which is probably the programme more vulnerable to cuts, showed a particularly strong improvement. The number of qualifications gained per hundred leavers rose nearly 50 per cent on last year's performance, with an average 40 per cent fall in the cost of points towards a qualification. The Tec National Council, which represents Tecs, said they had delivered efficiency improvements every year since taking over provision of the programmes from the government's Training Agency in 1990. While their budgets had declined, they had served the same number of clients with increased performance. Mr Chris Humphries, policy adviser to the council, said he hoped that the improved performance would be rewarded by maintenance of budgets, not cuts. Mr James Paice, the employment minister, said the indices showed the better value for money that the taxpayer was receiving. But there should be 'no let up' in the effort the government made to help Tecs improve their performance. The indices measured the cost incurred by each Tec in gaining individual qualifications, as well as the number of national vocational qualifications per 100 leavers. In the case of TFW, the number of people in jobs on a specific date was also measured. The department has not prepared a list of the best and worst Tecs. It is understood that this is because there are no consistent patterns and it would be difficult to reflect improvements in individual performances over the previous year. A crude league table places Cumbria, Barnsley/Doncaster and Hereford and Worcester Tecs at the top. The London Tecs, which are among the youngest, are among the worst performers - but some of these have made substantial improvements on last year.  ----------------------------------------------------- BEST AND WORST OF THE TECS  -----------------------------------------------------                             NVQs per     % improvement                          100 leavers      over 1992-93  ----------------------------------------------------- TOP 10 Birmingham                     71.30                94 Northamptonshire               64.07                73 C &amp; S Cambridgeshire           61.30                 5 Milton Keynes &amp; N Bucks        55.69                26 Cumbria                        52.53               160 Dudley                         51.27                38 Somerset                       51.21               184 Greater Peterborough           50.45                29 South Thames                   49.95                46 Bedfordshire                   48.94                29  ----------------------------------------------------- BOTTOM 10 S &amp; E Cheshire                 25.70                88 Central London                 23.97               148 E Lancashire                   22.36               151 S London                       21.83               -29 Suffolk                        21.79                 1 Aztec*                         21.62                -4 S Derbyshire                   20.82                66 Manchester                     20.59                -3 Isle of Wight                  19.19               -11 NW London                      13.12                24  -----------------------------------------------------                        Number in work    % improvement                        per 100 leavers    over 1992-93  ----------------------------------------------------- TOP 10 Lincolnshire                     43.35              48 S Derbyshire                     38.63             127 NE Wales                         36.82              - Central England                  36.14             111 E Lancashire                     33.67              27 S &amp; E Cheshire                   33.07              37 Teesside                         32.57             190 Coventry &amp; Warks                 31.30             103 N Nottinghamshire                30.91              11 Powys                            30.89               -  ----------------------------------------------------- BOTTOM 10 Dorset                           16.71             -30 Avon                             16.31              29 C &amp; S Cambridgeshire             16.10             -19 W London                         15.80             211 London E                         15.69              77 Kent                             14.78              36 Surrey                           14.27              32 Bedfordshire                     13.84              49 Hampshire                        13.70              24 Essex                            12.09              17  ----------------------------------------------------- *Kingston, Merton and Wandsworth  ----------------------------------------------------- CORRECTION Northumberland Training and Enterprise Council was inadvertently excluded from a league table last Friday listing the top ten Tecs, based on the number of people achieving a job after completing the Training for Work programme.</p>

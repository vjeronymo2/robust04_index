			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Europe's future in electronics IN A FREE MARKET economy, the performance of private sector companies should normally be a matter primarily for their shareholders, employees and suppliers. However, the fate of Philips of the Netherlands, which last week reported a steep fall in profits, concerns a much wider constituency, embracing governments, consumers and taxpayers. Philips is not just Europe's largest electronics manufacturer. Through energetic lobbying it has contrived to present itself as the foremost symbol of Europe's future in electronics and its main bulwark against the threat of technological domination by the US and, above all, Japan. These arguments, and the company's sheer size, have given it a power-ful influence over EC and nat-ional policies, notably on trade. Philips was closely involved in France's notorious decision in 1981 to route imports of Japanese video recorders through a remote customs point in Poitiers. Since then, the company has repeatedly persuaded the EC to impose tariffs, quotas and dumping duties on Japanese electronics products. It has also benefited handsomely from subsidies from EC technology policies, which it has helped to shape. Nowhere more so than in high definition television (HDTV) where, with Thomson, France's loss-making state-owned consumer electronics manufacturer, it is largely responsible for a grand EC strategy. Brussels is chipping in with generous funding and costly efforts to secure the acquiescence of broadcasters. Absorbing resources These measures all absorb valuable economic resources. Trade restrictions have raised substantially the prices of consumer electronics products in Europe - currently at least a third higher than in the US - while taxpayers have stumped up for Brussels' ambitious plans in information technology. Yet Philips has repeatedly failed to deliver. Though the company is fertile in invention, competitors have consistently brought new products to market faster and more profitably. Two years ago, a financial crisis prompted a top management shake-up and promises of improved performance. Since then, Mr Jan Timmer, Philips' chairman, has trimmed bureaucracy, axed loss-making activities and tried to speed decision-making. Yet the company's most important consumer electronics projects are beset by delays or serious uncertainties, and it foresees no improvement in the business for at least two years. Mr Timmer's biggest problem is a long legacy of mismanagement and a complacent corporate culture. Philips reacted only slowly to the Japanese onslaught in electronics. It ignored for years the opportunities for rationalisation and increased efficiency offered by Europe's common market. Though a vocal campaigner for the planned single market, the company seems unprepared for the keener competition it is meant to promote. Inducing complacency Europe will never have a strong electronics industry if policies remain geared to shoring up uncompetitive large producers. That not only induces complacency in the beneficiaries; more important, by distorting the market and mis-allocating resources, it discriminates against the new entrants which are often the most promising agents of innovation. In the US, which virtually abandoned consumer electronics in the 1970s, the industry is now enjoying a comeback, due largely to the success of small, entrepreneurial technology companies. Equally surprisingly, the US has also seized the lead in HDTV technology, rendering obsolete the EC's standard. Yet the European Commission wants governments this autumn to authorise further spending of Ecu850m. It says the money is needed to safeguard large investments already made and the commercial prospects of Philips and Thomson. Ministers can help put electronics policy back on track by firmly rejecting such pleas. The role of policy should be to stimulate innovation by keeping markets open, facilitating industrial adjustment and encouraging companies to take risks. Compensating large producers for their own failures is an indulgence European can no longer afford.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Rifkind seeks cash for Tories: Little-known group of industrialists rejects suggestion of subterfuge in fundraising Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, will tomorrow try to boost the Conservative party's flagging finances at a private fundraising dinner in Newcastle upon Tyne. The gathering has been organised by the Northern Industrialists Protection Association, a little-known outpost of the Tories' London-based treasurers' department. It is centred on a commit-tee of 10 prominent Tory-supporting industrialists from north-east England, linked to a network of well-heeled party sympathisers throughout the region. The association is among several organisations in Britain which raise cash for the Tories from the business world. It is thought the Conservatives need at least Pounds 35m in corporate and individual donations in the next two years to fight the next general election and reduce its Pounds 15m overdraft. The association - whose headquarters are in Front Street in the Cumbrian market town of Alston - does little to advertise itself. But it denies any subterfuge in its efforts to raise an estimated Pounds 150,000 a year on behalf of the Tories. Mr Patrick Doherty, the association's secretary, admitted that its title could cause amusement. 'People sometimes think we are something to do with the Mafia,' he said. Set up in the 1950s, the association's main objective is 'to defend free enterprise'. The word 'protection' in its title came from its founders' perception of the threat to industry from leftwing Labour policies. In spite of Labour's recent drift towards the centre no one has contemplated amending the association's name, according to Mr Doherty. Sir Paul Nicholson, chairman of the Sunderland-based Vaux brewing company, is chairman of the association. Vaux has given Pounds 79,000 to the Conservatives since 1988. Sir Paul said he was a 'substantial' personal donor. 'I believe in the Conservative cause and am happy to do what I can to help,' he said. Also on the association's committee is Sir John Hall, the developer of the Gateshead MetroCentre, Europe's biggest out-of-town shopping and leisure centre, and chairman of Newcastle United Football Club. Other prominent business leaders in the group are Mr Robert Dickinson, chairman of Northern Rock building society, Sir Tom Cowie, life president of the T Cowie car dealer, and Mr Terry Harrison, chief executive of Rolls-Royce engineering group. Rolls-Royce, one of the Tories' biggest industrial sponsors, has given the party Pounds 275,000 in the past seven years. Another corporate donor is Persimmon, the York-based builder, which has given nearly Pounds 25,000 since 1989. It is represented on the association by Mr Duncan Davidson, its chairman. Mr Davidson said: 'Most industrialists would rather operate under the Conservatives than any other party.' At tomorrow night's black-tie function, 58 businesspeople from the region will pay Pounds 50 each for smoked and marinated salmon, noisettes of lamb, asparagus with white-wine gravy, poached peaches, wines and port. Mr Rifkind is expected to talk for about 10 minutes and answer questions. While the tickets for the event do little more than cover the cost of the meal, the real business will be conducted in the next few months when Mr Doherty follows up contacts from the dinner with requests for much larger sums of cash. Mr Doherty, a long-time Tory official who has been the association's secretary for seven years, does not like the term 'arm-twisting'. He said: 'I simply say to people that there is a strong case for giving.' But Mr Doherty recently suffered a rebuff when Cookson - a leading materials group which is represented on the association by Mr Ralph Iley, an unassuming pigeon-fancier who is a former Cookson managing director - stopped donations to the Tories after handing over nearly Pounds 90,000 since 1987. Mr Robert Malpas, Cookson chairman, said: 'We've stopped giving (to the Tories). I personally don't think it's a good thing for companies to do.' The other industrialists on the association's committee are Mr Elliott Ward, chairman of the City &amp; Northern property group; Sir David Chapman, director of Wise Speke stockbrokers; and Mr David Kelly, chairman of Kelly Packaging.</p>

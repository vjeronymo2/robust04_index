			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> DRUGS PREVENT FOWL DISEASE  </P> <P> A new way to prevent the spread of coccidiosis, a parasitic disease of  chickens, has been developed by researchers at Upjohn Co. in Kalamazoo, Mich.  </P> <P> Their approach is particularly promising, said chemist Douglas Rector, because  it does not involve dosing the chickens with antibiotics or other drugs that  might be passed on to humans in chicken flesh.  </P> <P> The disease is caused by a parasite called coccidia, which is transferred from  chicken to chicken when they eat infected fecal matter in the litter that lines  their cages. The researchers have found that a family of drugs called  quinolines and quinazolines, which are harmless to humans but foul-tasting to  chickens, can be added to the litter to prevent the chickens from eating it.  Tests with chickens have shown, Rector said, that it prevents spread of the  disease in coops.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JAN. ORDERS FOR DURABLE GOODS SLUMP 3%  </P> <P> Orders to factories for "big ticket" durable goods declined 3% in January, the  first decrease in four months and the biggest drop since last July, the  government reported today.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said demand for durable goods, items expected to last  three or more years, totaled a seasonally adjusted $128.06 billion in January,  down from $132.06 billion in December.  </P> <P> Orders in virtually all major industry categories were down, particularly in  the volatile transportation and defense categories.  </P> <P> Much of last month's decline was due to a 7.2% fallback in transportation  orders, which had surged 22.1% in December due to high demand for aircraft and  autos.  </P> <P> Excluding transportation, orders in all other categories were down 1.2% last  month.  </P> <P> Overall, orders had been up a robust 7.3% in December, the biggest increase  since last June. Orders for all of 1988 had been up 10.9% from 1987, the best  showing since 1984, as manufacturers enjoyed an export-fueled rebound thanks to  the decline of the dollar against foreign currencies.  </P> <P> January's 3% decrease was the biggest decline since a 7.4% drop last July and  the first drop since a 2.8% decrease in September.  </P> <P> Orders in the erratic defense category, subject to wide swings depending on  when government contracts are signed, plunged 33.5% in January after a 24.2%  increase in December.  </P> <P> Excluding defense, all other orders were down 0.4% after rising 6.1% in  December.  </P> <P> Orders in the key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a good sign  of business intentions to modernize and expand, were up 1.5% to $39.96 billion  last month. The category had increased 9.9% in December.  </P></p>

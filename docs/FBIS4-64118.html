			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Taranov report: "Georgian Trade Mission Counts on </F> Russia"]    [Text] For the first time in history, Georgia has opened a  trade and economic mission in Russia. It is located at No. 42,  The Arbat.    Leonardo Devdariani, the 47-year old Georgian trade  representative, says that he was offered the post of head of  trade mission in any country, but he believes that "no other  state in the world can do what Russia can do for Georgia both  from the positive and the negative point of view." And Georgia  has something to offer Russia. Russia may count on the use of  maritime ports, the railroad (virtually the only one in the  entire Transcaucasus region), air transportation, and resorts.  In Georgia there is an abundance of raw materials which are  scarce in Russia -- manganese, marble, metal arsenic, and  ferroalloys. There is the output of the Rustavi metallurgical  plant, and citrus fruit and tea grow in Georgia....    A free trade regime has now been declared between the  countries -- there are virtually no customs or excise duties on  imports, with the exception of around 200 categories of  strategic and military goods from Russia. The trade mission  intends to create an international association for insuring  commercial deals and investments in Georgia. It has the right  to conclude direct contracts with Russian producers -- Georgia  cannot afford to pay huge commissions to trade agents. Branches  of the trade mission are also opening in Tyumen, Saratov, St.  Petersburg, and Kaliningrad at the same time as the main office  at No. 42, The Arbat.</p>

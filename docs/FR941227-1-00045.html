			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based upon information available from the previously approved States and in consideration of the tagging requirements stipulated by the Management Authority, the Service proposes to issue Scientific Authority advice in favor of export of alligator hides and parts legally harvested in those States during the 1995&hyph;97 harvest seasons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Management Authority Findings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Exports of Appendix II species are to be allowed under CITES only if the Scientific Authority advises that the exports will not be detrimental to the survival of the species and if the Management Authority is satisfied that the specimens were not obtained in contravention of laws enacted for their protection. The Service, therefore, must be satisfied that the American alligator hides, meat, or products being exported were not obtained in violation of State or Federal laws for their protection. For the American alligator, evidence of legal take is provided by Service-approved State export tagging and container marking programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assist these State export tagging programs, the Service annually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts for the manufacture and delivery of special CITES animal-hide tags for Service-approved, export-qualified States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice, published on April 24, 1986 (51 FR 15548), the Service announced the introduction, use, and protection of a US-CITES tag symbol. This symbol appears on every Service-approved export tag to provide legal evidence of U.S. export approval for certain species listed on Appendix II of CITES. Hides marked with tags that lack this US-CITES symbol are not legally exportable from the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guidelines developed for Management Authority findings on State-managed American alligator export programs, under provisions of CITES Article IV.2(a), are summarized as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Current State alligator trapping, hide tagging, meat and parts processing, marking, and shipping regulations must be on file with the Office of Management Authority;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Sample reporting forms, export tag, meat and parts packing seal, parts tag, and specifications of the State's standard meat and parts package/container must be on file with the Office of Management Authority;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The hide export tag must be durable and permanently locking, and must show the US-CITES logo, State of origin, year of take, species, and a unique serial number;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The export tag, meat seal, and parts tag or seal must be applied to all hides, meat, or parts within a minimum time after take or processing as specified by State law and such time should be as short as possible to minimize movement of untagged hides, meat, or parts;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) US-CITES tags must be inserted through the hide and permanently locked in place using the locking mechanism of the tag and in accordance with State requirements; other tags or seals must be permanently attached as mandated by the State;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) All American alligator harvesters and processors must be State registered;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) All American alligator hide, meat, and parts dealers must be State registered;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) All State-registered American alligator harvesters, processors, and dealers must make available their American alligator harvest and commerce data to the State on at least an annual basis, as specified by the State;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) State-registered American alligator dealers and State licensed harvesters authorized to attach export tags must account for tags received and must return unused tags to the State within a time specified by the State after the taking season closes; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) When manufactured hide products are to be exported from the United States, the CITES export tags that were removed from the hides contained in the products must be surrendered to the Service prior to export.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

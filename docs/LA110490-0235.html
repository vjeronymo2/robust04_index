			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GLENDALE DEFENSE TAKES ITS BOWS AFTER 27-0 WIN OVER HARBOR  </P> <P> On a night when tailback Bobby Webster set two school records and quarterback  Marco Arcipreste threw for nearly 200 yards, it was Glendale College's defense  that stood out in a 27-0 victory over host Harbor in a Western State Conference  football game Saturday.  </P> <P> The Vaquero defense, Glendale's Achilles' heel last season, held Harbor (4-4,  3-4) to 107 yards in offense, including six yards passing, while posting its  first shutout.  </P> <P> "The defense has improved at a great pace the last two weeks," second-year  Glendale Coach John Cicuto said. "Everyone seems to be coming together at just  the right time. . . . We're two weeks away from reaching our goal."  </P> <P> The Vaqueros (6-2, 6-1) are gunning for a WSC Northern Division title and a  bowl berth, but they will have to get past Moorpark on Saturday if they are to  meet that objective.  </P> <P> "We knew we'd have to go through Moorpark to win a division title," said  Arcipreste, who completed 15 of 26 passes for 194 yards and a touchdown. "But  we also knew there were several other teams we had to beat."  </P> <P> The win improved Glendale's divisional record to 3-0 and was the sixth in a row  for the Vaqueros. And as in the previous five victories, Webster gained at  least 100 yards and ran for at least two touchdowns.  </P> <P> The freshman from Pasadena High gained 119 yards in 16 carries and scored three  times against the Seahawks before leaving the game in the third quarter because  of leg cramps.  </P> <P> His third score -- a 50-yard run -- gave Glendale a 21-0 lead with 12 minutes  27 seconds left in the third period. It was Webster's 17th touchdown (all  rushing) of the season and broke school single-season records for touchdowns  (15) and rushing scores (14).  </P> <P> In the fourth quarter, Harbor drove as far as the Glendale 27-yard line, but  Robert Floyd intercepted Bill Inman's pass in the Vaquero end zone for a  touchback.  </P> <P> "The shutout was important to these guys," Cicuto said. "I think it'll give us  added confidence going into the Moorpark game."  </P> <P> Webster's first score, a six-yard run, capped a five-play, 41-yard drive with  1:41 left in the first quarter. His second touchdown, a four-yard burst,  climaxed an 11-play, 56-yard drive with 9:37 remaining in the second period.  </P> <P> Arcipreste, who entered the game averaging 16 pass attempts a game, completed  nine of 17 for 130 yards in the first half alone.  </P></p>

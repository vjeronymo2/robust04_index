			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Top Norwegian bank recovers Den norske Bank, Norway's biggest bank, has recorded its first profit since its formation in 1990 from the merger of Den norske Creditbank and Bergen Bank. In a sharp reversal of fortunes, DnB posted a 1993 pre-tax profit of NKr982m (Dollars 129.7m) against a loss of NKr3.06bn the previous year. The result was helped by a reduction in credit losses, a rise in net interest income, and gains in the securities and bond portfolios. In spite of the marked improvement, DnB A shares closed NKr0.50 lower at NKr21 on the Oslo bourse. 'The results for the year form a sound basis for the share capital increase which is under preparation,' said Mr Finn Hvistendahl, group managing director. DnB said earlier it was planning for a capital increase of NKr1bn through the issue of new shares. The state also has plans to dispose of some of its shares in the bank to raise another NKr1bn. Norway became DnB's biggest shareholder through cash injections made to prop it up during Norway's biggest banking crisis since the second world war. The bank had suffered successive years of high losses. Group net interest income shot up by NKr697m to NKr5.37bn as other operating income advanced NKr797m to NKr3.5bn. 'Along with a significant reduction in loan losses and a downward trend in the volume of non-performing loans, it is gratifying that the figures for net interest income and other operating income are strong,' Mr Hvistendahl said. However, losses on net loans and guarantees remained substantially high, though an improvement in the domestic economy helped cut them by NKr1.73bn to NKr3.11bn, helped by The bank said losses on loans to small- and medium-sized companies were more than halved last year. In the private customer market, they were cut by one-third. However, DnB said losses in 1993 in the corporate division were higher than in the previous year. This was blamed on increased loan-loss provisions in the first half of 1993 on specific commitments.</p>

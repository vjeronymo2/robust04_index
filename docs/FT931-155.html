			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Ciba With interests ranging across healthcare, agricultural and speciality chemicals, Ciba bears a striking resemblance to Zeneca - the bio-science arm of ICI - albeit on a grander scale. Higher profits and the optimistic note struck by the Swiss yesterday, though, should not raise expectations about what the men from Millbank can deliver. Tough conditions in pharmaceuticals are no surprise. Ciba sees CAP reform depressing demand for agrochemicals for three years at least. Although both companies are well out of petrochemicals, specialities will hardly be buoyant while the German and Japanese economies are moving down. Both companies are also in the throes of restructuring, which should yield cost benefits this year. But while Zeneca's first act as an independent company will be to make a Pounds 1.3bn rights issue, Ciba promises a one-off boost to profits from the switch to international accounting standards. Moving from current cost to historical cost valuations will reduce Ciba's stated assets, resulting in a lower depreciation charge. Reported profits should rise by up to 10 per cent as a result of this and other accounting changes. There is also the thorny issue of hidden reserves - although Ciba refuses to say how much, if anything, could be released. Book-keeping changes are no substitute for real growth. That will only flow from responsive management and productive research and development. With a research budget twice that of Zeneca, and a stream of new drugs on the way, Ciba looks well placed to pass the test.</p>

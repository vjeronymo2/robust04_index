			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Lebedinskiy: "The Governor May Be </F> Called Sasha"]    [Text] Perm--Marking the "party slates," the inhabitants of  Perm Oblast cast the majority of votes for Russia's Choice. But  after the rowdy televised political show, they suddenly went one  after the other to register as liberal democrats. Whereas in a  southern city of the oblast--Osa--for example, prior to the  elections there were just two members of the LDPR [Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia], this is now a full-fledged primary  organization that has demanded the authorities allocate premises  and has begun active propaganda in the local mass media.    But, naturally, all cities of the oblast have outdone Perm.  A  news conference of the liberal democrats announced the  appointment by the LDPR Supreme Council as "shadow governor" of  the Kama region of A. Chulkov, chairman of the party's Perm  branch, who presented a program declaration which plunged  journalists into confusion. The province of Perm will, according  to him, be restored in its prerevolution borders. The people of  Perm are called upon here to play more than last fiddle in the  liberal democratic faction of the State Duma also. He sees as  the paramount task in this organ of power the resignation of the  government. And "criminal proceedings will be instituted"  against some present ministers, what is more.    The new criminal legislation drawn up by the party expands  considerably the list of articles providing for the death  penalty. In the fight against organized crime it is planned to  impose a state of emergency with a curfew in particular regions.  Caucasians, Gypsies, and... Chinese will be deported from that  same Kama region. Not just Perm Oblast, but all of Russia will  in the future be restored in their prerevolution borders. In  addition, "an outlet to the Mediterranean will be secured by the  diplomatic path."    The members of the LDPR attending the news conference heard  the new governor and unexpected leader with certain misgivings:  garrulous, but too young.    Truly, A. Chulkov can as yet be called simply Sasha, he is  19  years old and, he says, he is a second-year student at the Perm  Medical Institute, but is already the author of monographs (!)  on surgery and medical biology. He hurled himself into politics  following the president's September edicts on the breakup of the  Supreme Soviet. But this is what he says. After the news  conference, A. Odegov, a coordinator of the LDPR in the Kama  region, contacted Moscow and ascertained that Sasha was not on  the party slate. He was not a student of the Medical Institute  either.    While the leaders of the LDPR are still confusedly  ascertaining the personality of their new leader, he has already  taken a stroll down the corridors of power and has paid an  official visit to the oblast newspaper ZVEZDA, where he  announced that his supporters would try to obtain 25-30 of the  40 seats in the oblast's legislative assembly. "And we will  surely win!" he said with great confidence here.    After this, A. Zaynullin, another coordinator of the LDPR,  urgently left for Moscow for a consultation with Vladimir  Volfovich.</p>

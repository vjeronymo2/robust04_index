			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Ramsden's helped by new outlets Mr Jack Charlton, manager of the Irish Republic's national football team, will be on hand some time before Christmas to officiate at the opening of Harry Ramsden's in Dublin. He is taking a 10 per cent stake in the 13th outlet to be opened by the West Yorkshire-based fish and chip restaurant chain. New restaurants helped boost the USM-quoted company's pre-tax profits by 16 per cent from Pounds 87,673 to Pounds 101,824 in the six months to April 3 on turnover 12 per cent ahead at Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 1.2m). Mr John Barnes, chairman, said the company would continue its push into southern England. Restaurants in Birmingham and Edinburgh were also opened during the period, bringing total outlets to 10. Since then Liverpool and Nottingham outlets have come on stream. Harry Ramsden's in Hong Kong showed continued growth. Mr Richard Taylor, finance director, said the experience gained there would be applied to openings in Singapore by the end of the year. He anticipated that the first Harry Ramsden's in Melbourne, due to open next year, would 'not be the last in Australia'. A franchise opening in Jeddah is due later in 1995. The interim dividend is unchanged at 1p on earnings of 0.8p (0.7p) per share. In May the company made a placing of 213,960 shares at 265p apiece.</p>

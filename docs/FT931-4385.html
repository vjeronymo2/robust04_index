			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Letter: UK position on quality standards is complex Sir, Your report on quality system certification is nicely provocative ('Need a quality certificate? Ask Tom, Dick or Harry', March 8). It might have added in all seriousness that the position in the UK is more complex than in some other nations and is fundamentally affected by the past decisions of the UK government that system certification should be voluntary and that there should be a competitive mechanism for bodies offering system certification. In my view Paul Hewlett is quite justified in expressing confidence in professional buyers and in their knowledge of national accreditation. The irony is the British Standards Institution's 'concern at the loophole', for it is my understanding that BSI-QA has itself issued by far the most 'unaccredited' BS5750 registrations] In the UK, everyone should look for the National Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies' 'tick and crown', but recognise that the BS5750 standards, the EN29000 series in Europe, and the ISO9000 series internationally, are the same.

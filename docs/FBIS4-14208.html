			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Foreign Minister Peres told  the Knesset plenum that when the Palestinians are granted  autonomy, it will practically be independence.    Referring to the Camp David accords, Peres said when the  Likud Prime Minister Menahem Begin offered autonomy to all the  Palestinian residents of Judaea and Samaria, the Likud should  have known that autonomy is 80 percent, if not 90 percent,  independence. Autonomy is not a reduction in their authority  but basically sovereignty minus responsibility for two things:  security and foreign relations. Peres later said we will let  the Palestinians run their lives with honor and independence,  again with the two exceptions.    The foreign minister was responding to a motion for the  agenda by Likud Knesset Member Moshe Qatzav, who accused Peres  of rushing the negotiations with the PLO at the expense of  Israeli interests.</p>

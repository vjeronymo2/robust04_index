			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Japanese banks go for lotteries Japan's financial institutions are in the grip of lottery fever. Yesterday two more banks announced the launch of deposits that give savers a chance to win cash prizes. The new accounts seem certain to intensify the competition among banks in an unfamiliar liberated environment, despite the explicit fury of their self-regulatory associations and the implicit disquiet of the Finance Ministry. Kono Shinkin Bank, a regional credit bank, said it would introduce a lottery account next week. Anyone opening a time deposit of at least Y100,000 (Pounds 650) will be entered into the annual raffle for prizes up to Y50,000. Depositors at Sabae Shinkin Bank will receive a ticket to a local authority lottery with even bigger potential returns. The moves follow the launch last month of the first lottery account by Johnan Shinkin Bank, the country's largest credit bank. The National Association of Shinkin (credit) Banks, the self-regulatory body, condemned the account for breaching voluntary rules on the type of cash bonuses its members would offer their customers. The Finance Ministry raised a regulatory eyebrow and announced an investigation into the new account, but stopped short of outlawing it. Johnan Shinkin accused the other banks and their association of operating a cartel, and of failing to pass on benefits of last month's interest rate liberalisation to customers. On Wednesday, Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, stepped into the row, saying it was important for each bank to work out original ideas on interest rates and give-aways to meet customers' needs in a deregulated financial environment. But the regulators have also acknowledged the unease felt by some in financial circles about the propriety of banks' offering straight gambling products as part of their normal banking business. However, the concern now for the authorities is that the accounts have proved extremely popular. It is probably the desire not to incur the wrath of a disgruntled public that has stayed the hand of the Finance Ministry so far. That decision not to rule against the account now seems to have been taken as a signal by other banks that they have the go-ahead to follow Johnan's course, and yesterday's imitations by Kono and Sabae are expected to be followed by many more.</p>

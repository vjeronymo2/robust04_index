			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Aitken Hume - Correction The issue of December 1 described Mr Lee Ming Tee as chairman of Allied Group. He resigned on September 30. The fact that, as the article stated, Mr Brian O'Connor, his successor, was named in a report from the Financial Secretary of Hong Kong should not be read as suggesting that he was criticised in it. We apologise for any suggestion to the contrary.</p>

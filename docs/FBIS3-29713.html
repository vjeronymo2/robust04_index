The deputy commander of the Aranyaprathet task force unit,  Col Itsara Watcharaprathip, said senior Army officers in Bangkok  showed high interest in the box suspected to contain uranium.    The rusty box, which is 28 cms long, 21 cms wide and 6 cms  deep and weighs about 4.2 kgs, bears a danger sign and a phrase  in English which reads "1974-1994 Uranum 999x Made in USA  2350827".    Col Itsara said he received an order from his superior to  closely monitor the reported smuggling dangerous goods,  suspected to be radioactive substances, and to try to prevent  them entering the country.    He said he had an intelligence report that at least 10  similar boxes weighing from one to five kgs were smuggled into  Thailand and were sold to junk dealers for 200,000 to 1,000,000  baht.</p>

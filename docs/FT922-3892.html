			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / International Company News: Hongkong Bank's O&amp;Y exposure set at Dollars 787m HONGKONG and Shanghai Bank, one of the largest single creditors of Olympia &amp; York, the troubled Canadian property developer, said yesterday its total exposure to the company was Dollars 787m. In an unusual move, Hongkong Bank issued a statement 'in view of recent press speculation' about its exposure to O&amp;Y. It rebutted suggestions it was a large lender to the Canary Wharf development in London, saying it had an exposure to that project of less than Dollars 9m. The bulk of the bank's advance to O&amp;Y had arisen from its participation in a Dollars 2.5bn syndicated loan to Olympia and York Resources Credit Corp, the bank said. The syndicate effectively has a first charge over O&amp;Y's 71 per cent stake in Gulf Canada Resources and 82 per cent interest in Abitibi-Price, a pulp and newsprint manufacturer. The current 'loan-to-market value ratio' of these two assets was around 66 per cent, the bank said. This suggests that Hongkong Bank might have to provide up to Dollars 270m if the underlying assets were sold at current values. However, the bank said it may recover the principal of the debt in the long term. Meanwhile, Hongkong Bank anticipated making a specific provision for the loan, the size of which is yet to be determined. The provision would be written off against this year's profits.</p>

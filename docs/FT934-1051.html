			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian cod fishery faces virtual shut-down Canada's once-thriving east coast cod fishery will be almost entirely shut down in 1994 as part of efforts to rebuild severely depleted stocks, fisheries minister Mr Brian Tobin said yesterday. Mr Tobin also announced that quotas for other groundfish species will be severely cut, bringing next year's total allowable catch down to 250,000 tonnes, about a quarter of its level five years ago. In addition, a two-year moratorium on northern cod catches off the coast of Newfoundland, which was due to expire next May, will continue indefinitely. The cuts are expected to cost 35,000 fishermen and processing plant workers their jobs. The government has provided substantial income support for unemployed fish workers since the Newfoundland cod moratorium took effect. But a new system, now being designed, is expected to recognise the poor long-term prospects for the fishing industry, by encouraging fish workers to find jobs in other sectors of the economy. The decline of the east coast fishery is blamed on a variety of causes, including over-fishing by foreign and Canadian vessels and changes in water temperatures and fish-migration patterns. Scientists have been especially alarmed at the falling numbers of small, young fish. Canada has urged its partners in the North Atlantic Fisheries Organisation to impose more stringent controls on catches by foreign trawlers in international waters. Mr Tobin said that domestic fishing fleets will in future have to use bigger hooks and mesh sizes to minimise harvesting of small fish. The only cod fisheries that will remain open next year will be on the western Scotian Shelf and on the Georges Bank off south-western Nova Scotia.</p>

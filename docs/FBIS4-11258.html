			<p>BFN     [Text] Sao Paulo, 22 Apr (EFE) -- Andean countries  receiving trade benefits from the EU as compensation for their  fight against the drug trade today proposed that the European  Commission [EC] extend similar benefits to Venezuela, which also  is committed to fighting drugs.    The proposal to include Venezuela among those countries  receiving compensation for their fight on drugs was made by the  foreign ministers of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and  Venezuela at a meeting they held today with Manuel Marin, a  Spaniard who serves as EC vice president and commissioner for  Latin America.    In remarks to EFE, Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin  said they had asked Marin "that the EU study the possibility of  extending those benefits to Venezuela, a country that also needs  trade compensation for allocating its resources to fighting the  drug trade."    Several export products from Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia are  entitled to tariff reductions in Europe under a special  paragraph of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), a  mechanism whereby the EU regulates its trade with Latin American  countries.    Marin, who met with the foreign ministers of Andean  countries  to listen to their proposals concerning the renewal and  expansion of the GSP, will convey these proposals to the other  EC members.    The GSP expires late this year, and the EU must decide  whether to renew the foreign trade mechanism as is, amend it, or  expand it.    The Andean countries, Sanin said, expressed their interest  in  having the GSP renewed and expanded and that the trade benefits  the EU is granting countries involved in drug enforcement  efforts be extended to Venezuela.    The meeting between Marin and the Andean foreign ministers  was held simultaneously with the fourth meeting of Rio Group and  EU ministers that began today at the Latin American Parliament  building in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo.    Marin is scheduled to meet on 23 April with the foreign  ministers of Mercosur [Common Market of the South] member  countries (which consists of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and  Uruguay) to hear their proposals regarding the GSP.    Attending the ministerial meeting are all the foreign  ministers of the Rio Group members countries: Argentina,  Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay,  Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Also attending the meeting as  observers are the ministers of Trinidad and Tobago and  Guatemala, representing the Caribbean and Central America,  respectively.    The EU is represented by the foreign ministers of Spain and  Portugal; Greek Alternate Foreign Affairs Minister Theodoros  Pangalos; and deputy ministers and vice ministers from the other  EU member countries (Germany, Belgium, Denmark, France, the  Netherlands, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom).    Since the signing of the Rome Declaration (1990) -- which  institutionalized talks between the EU and the Rio Group, the  main Latin American forum for concerted political and economic  action and for promoting integration -- the two sides have held  three meetings: the first in Luxembourg (April 1991), the second  in Santiago, Chile (May 1992), and the third in Copenhagen  (April 1993).</p>

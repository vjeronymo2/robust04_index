			<p>CSO     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 31 Jan--The government will create an  army capable of waging modern, conventional war in addition to  developing an air force and navy as good as the country's  financial resources permit.    Najib Tun Abdul Razak, the minister of defense, said that  the  government intends to undertake the balanced development of the  three services, the army, navy, and air force.    He said: "We want balanced development in all of the  services  in the Malaysian Armed Forces (ATM), in accordance with the  concept of modern, conventional warfare. This is to make sure  that the strength of the three services in the Malaysian Armed  Forces is suitable and that they can support each other. The  only problem is that our financial resources do not make it  possible to develop the three services simultaneously. We will  concentrate on the development of the Malaysian Army in the  future."    He made this statement to reporters in Kuala Lumpur after  receiving a visit from Gen Abdul Rahman Abdul Hamid, the  commander of the Malaysian Armed Forces, who will retire on 1  February.    Najib said that the development of the Royal Malaysian Air  Force (TUDM) is only the first phase in the development of the  Malaysian Armed Forces as a whole.    He said: "In the future we will concentrate on the  development of the army in accordance with the concept of  modern, conventional warfare and the combined arms approach,  which is very important for achieving a service which we can be  proud of."    According to Najib, in the initial phase of achieving this  objective the government will be forced to budget its available  resources to increase the strategic assets of the Malaysian  Armed Forces.    He said: "In the initial phase many of these strategic  assets  will involve the combat capability of the air force, because in  conventional warfare the control of the air is very important,  although it is not decisive. The function of the army is the  final step in supporting the air force. However, the state of  readiness of the army is also important. The government is aware  of this, but our financial resources do not permit us to carry  out simultaneous development. This will take time," he said.    At a preceding news conference Gen Abdul Rahman said that  the  development of the three services in the Malaysian Armed Forces  needs to be balanced to permit all of them to carry out their  respective functions effectively, if we become involved in war.    He said: "It is true that the army has been left behind,  compared to development in other elements of the Malaysian Armed  Forces, particularly during the last several years. This is  because previously we emphasized resources, and army equipment  for carrying on operations consisted of items left over from the  struggle against the communist terrorists [1948-1960]. The army  is not very well provided for in terms of its equipment.  Therefore, we need to purchase more appropriate equipment for  the army. To achieve the basic objective of national defense, we  must improve the equipment of our armed forces in all aspects,  including the army," he said.</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Technology: Dethroning King Cotton - Courtaulds hopes an unusual new fabric will take the fashion world by storm It is a widely held rule of innovation that companies should not venture into new products and new customer markets simultaneously. Yet this seems to be what Britain's second biggest chemicals company, Courtaulds, is doing with its new fibre, Tencel. The fibre has just been officially launched amid much fanfare - not surprising considering that 14 years of development absorbed Pounds 45m and the new production plant in Mobile, Alabama, cost another Pounds 55m. Technologically, Tencel is related to viscose rayon, the material on which Samuel Courtauld &amp; Co's fortunes were built in the early years of the century. Both are based on wood pulp; only the manufacturing process differs. At the Tencel plant in Alabama, wood pulp is mixed with amine oxide until it is dissolved. The solution is then filtered and extruded to form fine filaments. These are washed, dried, crimped and cut to form staple fibres for spinning. The technique is called solvent spinning. Tencel is Courtaulds' brand name for the fibre made by this process, and lyocell is a generic name fixed in 1989 for solvent-spun fibres by the Bureau International pour la Standardisation de la Rayonne et des Fibres Synthetiques. It was developed partly in anticipation of tighter pollution laws. Viscose manufacturing is notoriously dirty, with sulphurous compounds often released into the atmosphere or rivers. In solvent spinning, the solvent can be removed during the washing process then purified and concentrated before being re-used. The technology is innovative enough, but the fibres produced have some unique characteristics. Tencel garments can look as if they are made of rough denim but have a heavy, velvety feel. To the touch, they are like brushed cotton but with the floppiness of silk. On top of its luxurious feel, Courtaulds' tests show it to be twice as strong as cotton when dry and an even better performer when wet. This means dyers, finishers, weavers and knitters can make a wide range of fabrics. Selling to the luxury market is an unusual experience for Courtaulds. Not since the company commercialised rayon in 1905 has it faced the problems of making a new product and selling it to new customers. Alan Jones, Tencel's international marketing manager, acknowledges he faces a tough task. His proposed solution is simple: the technical strengths and unusual properties of the material will sell it. So far, the signs are promising. Well-known clothes designers such as the UK's Zandra Rhodes and Anne Klein of the US have begun to use the material. Their clothes have found buyers in the test market of Japan, in spite of high prices. People have been prepared to spend more than Pounds 200 for a denim-lookalike jacket or pair of jeans. To keep the product exclusive, only a small number of designers have been allocated cloth. Japan is still the only market where Tencel clothes are widely available; the US and Europe should get their first garments in this year's spring collections. In their turn, the fabric makers and clothes designers have become part of Courtaulds' sales effort. 'We wanted to get some interesting fabrics produced. They were in effect part of the development process,' says Jones. Yet Courtaulds' approach stands in contrast to the conservative way its rival, ICI Fibres, promoted a new product called Tactel. Tactel fabrics are made of very fine filaments of nylon. The surface can be treated to give it a more natural feel, which means it can be used to make clothes for markets that perceive nylon to be uncomfortable. ICI launched the product in 1983 into an area with which it was familiar, sportswear. It was not until 1989, when the technical capabilities of the product were well understood, that it relaunched Tactel for the fashion industry. Tactel has been a success for ICI, now accounting for about 35 per cent of the company's entire fibres output by value. The potential for Tencel is, if anything, higher. It is in a position to take a slice out of the market for King Cotton, which accounts for about half the world fibre consumption by weight.</p>

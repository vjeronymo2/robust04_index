			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / The Week Ahead RESULTS DUE PHOTO-ME INTERNATIONAL, the world's largest photo-booth manufacturer and operator, is expected today to report a marginal increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 8.7m to about Pounds 8.9m. Analysts will be interested in the degree of increased competition in the UK from overseas companies, and the performance of new products such as novelty booths, providing photos with celebrities such as Madonna. Tomorrow, Eurocamp, the camping holiday company floated in July 1991, is forecast to reveal pre-tax profits for the year to October of about Pounds 9.4m, up from Pounds 8.2m. Lower interest payments, increased demand and broader markets - especially Germany and the Netherlands - all lie behind the rise. Yorkshire Tyne-Tees, the merged ITV company, should announce pre-tax profits of about Pounds 17.5m for the year to September, with two months included from Tyne Tees. This would be a little below original estimates of about Pounds 19m, but still a solid base to begin tackling its new franchise. Anxiety about the preference dividend at Kunick, the fruit machines to nursing homes group, seems set to prove unfounded at the announcement of the annual results on Wednesday. The recent sale of 50 per cent of the nursing homes business, reducing debt, should allow both a preference and a nominal ordinary dividend. Forecasts are for a pre-tax loss of about Pounds 3.5m, after some Pounds 6m of exceptionals, against a profit of Pounds 12.4m. The seasonality of Park Food Group's main business (selling Christmas hampers) means it regularly reports pre-tax losses at the interim stage. A smaller first-half deficit is expected to be announced on Friday, down from Pounds 4.4m to Pounds 4m, For the full 12 months, forecasts of Pounds 9m pre-tax, compared with Pounds 6.9m last year, are being revised upwards.

Turnover improved to Pounds 16.6m (Pounds 15m) and directors of this Leicester-based concern stated that sales had improved further since the period-end. They anticipate profits for the current year to show an improvement on the Pounds 387,000 recorded in the 12 months to September 28 1991. Earnings per share emerged at 6.1p (9.5p). The interim dividend goes up to 6.5p (6.2p).</p>

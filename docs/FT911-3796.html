			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Weaker yen and bond prices prompt profit-taking THE WEAKER yen and lower bond prices brought profit-taking by investment trusts yesterday, but overall trading remained dull, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. Volume fell to 250m shares, dropping below 300m for the first time since February 4. The Nikkei average, which lost 256.93 on Friday, fell a further 304.96 to 26,237.01, the day's low in spite of sporadic buying by arbitrageurs. The index opened at the session's high of 26,492.45. Declines overwhelmed rises by 818 to 164, with 151 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 22.54 to 1,975.53, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 3.19 to 1,489.05. Traders said the only activity of note was small-lot, short-term trading. Mr Bill Wilder, director of research at Schroder Securities, said domestic institutions were uncertain of the central bank's interest rate scenario due to the weak yen. 'The market could be in the doldrums for another three weeks, since the earliest possibility of a discount rate cut will be mid-May,' he added. The smaller markets, which attracted investors looking for quick profits last week, retreated on profit-taking. The second section slipped 8.76 to 3,396.12 and the over-the-counter market fell 30.53 to 3,065.53. Interest rate-sensitive issues also declined on profit-taking, with Nippon Steel shedding Y9 to Y471. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone lost Y19,000 to Y991,000, falling below the important Y1m level for the first time since February 15. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries receded Y12 to Y771 on reports that it had decided to write off Y30bn worth of bills receivable that are due from Iraq. Chiyoda, the plant engineer, dipped Y30 to Y3,030 on profit-taking after rising for the last three days. Nihon Nohyaku, an agro-chemical manufacturer, rose Y70 to Y2,320 in heavy trading. Some investors were attracted by rumours that speculative buying has boosted the issue recently. Demand spread throughout the sector, with Kumiai Chemical adding Y40 at Y1,200 and Hokko Chemical Y50 at Y1,240. Securities houses weakened on concern that poor market conditions would affect earnings. Daiwa Securities fell Y60 to Y1,350 and Nomura Securities Y30 to Y2,140. The land transportation sector was the worst performer of the day, losing 4.03 per cent. Traders attributed the weakness to the decline of Seino Transport, which retreated Y150 to Y2,250 on selling by foreigners. Medical equipment makers improved on reports of new requirements stipulating that ambulances would have to carry electro-cardiographic equipment. Nihon Kohden gained Y10 to Y1,430. Iwasaki Electronics, a lamp maker, gained ground in the morning on reports that it has developed an ultra-violet ray lamp which decomposes harmful substances in pesticides used on golf courses, but closed unchanged at Y1,260 on profit-taking. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 342.44 to 29,557.25 on volume of 21.4m shares, down from Friday's 33.7m. Roundup A MIXED DAY for equities in the region emphasised the old saying that what goes up must come down, with Hong Kong and Manila as the illustrations. HONG KONG lost 2.3 per cent in heavy trading, but the 84.91 fall to 3,582.49 in the Hang Seng index, its lowest close in seven weeks, still left it nearly 45 points above the day's low of 3,538. Turnover rose from HKDollars 1.22bn to HKDollars 1.41bn. Dealers said London institutions were taking profits on currency, as well as on the market. The Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the ascending US dollar; but support for the Hang Seng was lost after Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, failed to secure an agreement from China on the colony's HKDollars 100bn international airport plan earlier this month. MANILA's downswing accelerated with a drop of 4.1 per cent, the composite index sliding 44.38 to 1,027.12. Some observers blamed last week's Supreme Court ruling which allowed industrialist Mr Eduardo Cojuangco, a close associate of the late Philippines president Ferdinand Marcos, to vote his sequestered shares in San Miguel, the brewer and market leader. Turnover fell from 142.9m pesos to 95.9m. San Miguel declined 5.50 pesos to 52.50. TAIWAN, in contrast, set a 10-month high in modest trading as an historic political reform package was passed. The weighted index advanced 69.91 or 1.2 per cent to 5,824.00. The index has climbed 510.69 or 9.6 per cent since last Wednesday. However, turnover continued to dwindle yesterday, falling from TDollars 76.7bn to TDollars 69.7bn. JAKARTA, which has been criticised for not doing enough to protect investors, tightened disclosure regulations for companies hoping to list on the market. The official index, meanwhile, celebrated its return from a week's holiday by rising 3.07 to 415.55 in heavy volume of 5.83m shares.</p>

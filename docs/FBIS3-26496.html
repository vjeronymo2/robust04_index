He  declined, however, to make a conjecture on the exact timing for  the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two  countries.    Public opinion has taken note of the fact that it was after  U.S. President Clinton announced the lifting of 19-year trade  embargo against Vietnam on 3 February that Le Mai made known  Vietnam's stance. It has been learned that the U.S. liaison  office in Hanoi is currently under construction.    The United States started imposing trade sanctions against  Vietnam in 1964, targeting them exclusively at North Vietnam at  that time. In 1975, the U.S. Army lost the war on the  Vietnamese battlefields and the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese  puppet regime collapsed soon after. Flying into a rage from  shame, the United States expanded the trade sanctions to all of  Vietnam.    Since it carried out reform in the mid 1980's, Vietnam has  seen an economic growth of 5.3 percent. Now, per capita annual  income has reached $217 and the inflation rate dropped from 70  to 15 percent. Over the past few years, the Vietnamese  Government has approved 560 investment projects, entailing  investment of $4.5 billion. Vietnam is now attracting foreign  capital in the following ways: On the one hand, Vietnam has  stepped up efforts to hold negotiations with the United States,  the "chief" of the Western allies, has strongly demanded that  the United States lift its trade embargo against Vietnam on the  condition that Vietnam provide help in finding U.S. servicemen  missing since the war. On the other hand, Vietnam also is  trying to do business with other Western countries through  various channels, with a view to breaking the U.S. blockade. In  recent years, many countries and regions -- including France,  Japan, Britain, Hong Kong, and Taiwan -- have made huge  investments in Vietnam. The anti-Vietnamese alliance pieced  together by the United States has collapsed. Moreover, having  long been resentful of the stubbornness of the government, U.S.  business circles have made repeated appeals for an early lifting  of trade embargo against Vietnam.    Under this pressure, the Bush administration announced in  February 1992 a partial lifting of trade sanctions against  Vietnam; meanwhile, it also lifted bans prohibiting U.S.  enterprises from establishing representative offices in Vietnam  as well as signing contracts with Vietnam. U.S. enterprise  circles immediately responded to the call. In no time, two  world-famous companies -- Whirlpool and Compaq -- had signed  contracts with Vietnam on selling computers and other products  to Vietnam. Companies like Lockheed [luo ke xi de 3157 0344  1585 1795], Goldman Sachs [ge de man sa ke si 2047 1795 2581  5646 0344 2448] and Coca-Cola also were unwilling to lag behind;  one after another they sought business opportunities in Vietnam.  However, the new Clinton administration was not eager to improve  U.S. ties with Vietnam. Clinton once indicated in clear-cut  terms that the trade embargo would not be lifted before  "substantial" headway had been made in the search for U.S.  servicemen missing in action. This position has deterred U.S.  enterprises from investing in Vietnam, and all contracts already  signed between the two sides were subject to the additional  condition that they could take effect only after the overall  lifting of trade sanctions.    In the face of increasingly intensified global economic and  trade wars, however, the United States has become more and more  reluctant to give up the huge Vietnamese market, and it began to  quicken its steps toward reconciliation with Vietnam. Last  year, some U.S. congressmen and government officials visited  Vietnam, and they reaffirmed the efforts Vietnam had made in  helping investigate the whereabouts of missing U.S. military  personnel. Since the beginning of this year, the United States  has sent to Vietnam nearly 10 delegations from Congress,  military organs, and enterprise circles. Charles Larson, chief  of the U.S. Pacific command, visited Vietnam on 16 January. He  is the highest-ranking U.S. officer ever to visit Vietnam since  the United States broke off diplomatic relations with Vietnam in  1975. Public opinion believed that the U.S. plan to lift trade  sanctions against Vietnam was in the run-up.    On 27 January, the U.S. Senate passed a bill, with 62 votes  for and 38 against, urging the government to lift the trade  embargo against Vietnam. The result of the vote meant a cardiac  stimulant to Clinton, for it enabled him to deal with the strong  resentment of U.S. veterans' groups with perfect assurance.  Conditions for the lifting of trade sanctions against Vietnam  finally became ripe.</p>

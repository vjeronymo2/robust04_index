The Surat district collector, Mr. P.V. Trivedi, issued a  special notification to the effect late last night under the  Epidemic Diseases Act, 1987, on the advice of the Surat  municipal commissioner, Mr. Balwant Singh.    Four wards of the city covering different areas namely  Rander, Sagrampura, Salabutpura, Inderpura, Navapura, Begumpura,  Zanpa Bazaar, Rustompura and Gopi Talao, have been declared  jaundice-affected.    Over 464 cases of jaundice have been detected from these  areas, according to official figures, but the unofficial figure  is feared to be around 600. About three deaths have been  reported from the city which, however, do not have any official  confirmation.    With each passing day, the number of jaundice cases have  been  increasing and the city's hospitals are flooded with jaundice  patients. On Monday alone, 13 cases were detected from Randar,  eight from Sagrampura, five from Salabatpura and two cases from  the Lambe Hanuman Road area.    A total of 118 jaundice patients are undergoing treatment at  the infectious diseases hospital in the city.    The civic authorities have swooped down on a number of  hotels, canteens and restaurants and ordered their closure  following the detection of contaminated water being supplied to  the consumers.    It was reported that highly unhygienic conditions prevailed  at the 2.5 million gallon water storage tank at Umarwada, the  principal source of water supply to the jaundice-affected areas,  with people found bathing at the tank, washing clothes and even  using the area around it as an open toilet.</p>

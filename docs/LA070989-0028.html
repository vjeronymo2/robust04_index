			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PHOTO CONTEST  </P> <P> "Classics," The Times' 16th annual photography contest (May 28), asked for  photos that captured the Southern California image. Top honors went to pictures  of a garden hose in someone's back yard, a rock enveloped in surrealistic  colors and the sun trying to peep through the smoke of a brush fire. Where do  these judges live, on the moon? Yes, we have brush fires, yes, we have garden  hoses by the mile, but surely, our image could have been better represented by  more identifiable pictures.  </P> <P> RICHARD R.

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Poor areas welcome inclusion in grants list MERSEYSIDE and the Scottish Highlands and Islands yesterday welcomed their inclusion in the proposed list of European Community regions qualifying for extra grants under the Objective 1 criteria. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, also welcomed the announcement and said he would continue to press for the inclusion of Devon and Cornwall, rural Wales and South Yorkshire. Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the development body for the region, said it could gain more than Pounds 20m a year if it secured Objective 1 status. This could open the way to projects such as a university for the Highlands and Islands, a ferry or causeway linking the islands of the Western Isles and improved roads. Mr Harry Rimmer, leader of Liverpool City Council, stressed yesterday's decision was only a first step, as the recommendation has to be approved by the Council of Ministers in June. Merseyside is relieved its case has been accepted in Brussels. Its gross domestic product a head averaged 79 per cent for 1988-90, but has fallen at a rate of 2 percentage points a year and was at 77 per cent at the start of 1991. Objective 1 funds will be increased by 56 per cent over present levels in the next seven years, while areas with Objective 2 status - as Merseyside is now - will get only 8 per cent extra.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "A Dialogue With UN Representatives"] </F>   [Text] At a meeting with UN Deputy Secretary General  Marrat Goulding on Thursday [14 April], Slovak Foreign Minister  Eduard Kukan stressed that Slovakia's integration into Europe  was the goal of Slovak foreign policy. He provided information  on bilateral Russian-Slovak relations and underlined the fact  that the Slovak Republic is interested in good political and  economic relations with Russia.    Kukan also described the current relations between Slovakia  and Hungary. He said that the level of emotions has stabilized,  and Hungary has positively accepted Signals coming from  Slovakia. Goulding was interested in whether Hungary had  territorial claims. Kukan's reply was negative. Both officials  agreed that the concept for changing borders in the Balladur  plan was erroneous. Kukan also said that both countries were  willing to sign a treaty under the European Union's auspices.  The Slovak minister appreciated the fact that the Gabcikovo  issue has been depoliticized, to a certain extent. Kukan also  discussed the visit of UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali  in Bratislava.    Kofi Annan, UN deputy secretary general for peacekeeping  operations, appreciated, during a meeting with Kukan, the Slovak  Republic's approval of the UN demand according to which  Pakistani members of the peacekeeping forces will be trained at  Slovak Republic facilities.    Eduard Kukan and Besley Maycock, Barbados's permanent  representative at the United Nations, signed a protocol  yesterday on establishing diplomatic relations. Both officials  expressed their conviction that the development of mutual  relations is in the interest of both countries.</p>

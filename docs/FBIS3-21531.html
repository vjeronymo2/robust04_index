A high ranking official of the Russian Space Agency (RSA)  told Interfax that "members of the Russian state commission  under RSA Director General Yuriy Koptev must leave for Almaty on  March 1." He emphasized that "the drafts that were submitted by  the Russian negotiators in Moscow at the end of January have  been agreed on, only minor points have to be clarified."    In his view, the Almaty meeting "is likely to finalize  documents that will be signed by the presidents of the two  countries in a near future."    Baykonur, the largest space launching station of the former  USSR and the world, became Kazakhstan's property when the  republic won independent in October 1991. All its launching  pads are still manned by the Russian Space Force which, in the  words of Koptev, "wants to continue operating Baykonur for at  least 15 to 20 years more."    Experts say that most Russian space missions cannot be  launched elsewhere. What is more, Russia has commitments to  joint programs, in particular with the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration of the U.S.A. it has signed a $400 Mn  contract on construction of an international orbital station and  commercial launches of western satellites by Russian Proton  boosters which can be launched only from Baykonur pads.</p>

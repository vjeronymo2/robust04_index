			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Management: Rambo bosses back off / Examining whether recession has put a brake on the 'empowerment' of middle managers and other staff At first sight, the proposition looks paradoxical, even dangerously absurd: that, at the very time when the survival of countless companies is threatened by the worst recession since the 1930s, top executives should be decentralising authority and 'empowering' their managers and other employees. In difficult times in the past, and especially during recessions, most executives have done precisely the opposite. They have slashed spending by reinforcing their own power and that of the centre, taking back some of the authority which in better times they had delegated down the organisation. Yet, in one form or another, 'empowerment' is what countless consultants, and almost every business academic, persist in advising companies to introduce. Some managements are understandably frightened by the idea: they think it will reduce their authority and render decision-making slow or risky. But in America, PepsiCo, Xerox, General Electric, Ford, General Mills and a myriad of other companies have embraced 'empowerment' or the very similar principles of 'high-involvement'. In Europe, new practitioners range from BhS, the British retailing group which is now very much on the mend, to Switzerland's Ciba-Geigy, which is becoming less Germanic and hierarchical by the month. A few years ago the Basle-based company began using the term 'directed autonomy', which management found less threatening. But now, though it avoids the e-word when it can, it frequently feels obliged to use it to convey what it says is a more far-reaching process and set of attitudes, in which management's role is not just to provide direction, but also autonomy and support, so that the employee feels self-empowered. Empowerment may be a ghastly word and it is certainly over-used, but the degree of interest in the concept in Europe, particularly the UK, is soaring. This is demonstrated by a recent surge in consultancy work on and around the subject. A number of strategic and especially accountancy-based consultancies have suffered sliding revenues and staff cutbacks in the past two years. But at Kinsley Lord, a specialist UK firm which sees empowerment as a centrepiece of its work on organisational change, business has boomed since the start of the recession. The firm's revenues have shot up by a third in the first nine months of the current year, and are expected to rise more sharply still in 1993. Gemini is a much larger European-American consultancy of 1,200 people which specialises in both strategic and organisational change - including the fashionable 'process re-engineering' - but to which empowerment is equally central. Its revenues also grew by a third last year, a rate which is now accelerating. 'Harnessing the drive, ingenuity and power of people is central to what we do,' says Peter Beilby, its European senior vice-president for marketing. His colleague, Professor Dean Berry, says: 'Companies may not start out with empowerment as a goal. But when they strip levels out, try to compress time-to-market, and redesign other processes, they end up with it. Even with advanced information technology, you can't really run a delayered organisation by 'command and control' methods,' he says. 'The people route is more timely, simpler, more cost effective, and less risky.' The trend towards greater decentralisation, involvement and authority in many companies - though not always to a degree which merits the grand term 'empowerment' - is confirmed by two accountancy-based consultancies. At KPMG, David Bishop, a partner, says that in the UK the recession is causing centralisation only in companies which are in extremis. 'In some organisations, it's driving them to decentralise responsibility faster as the best way to simplify business processes and get costs out the door,' he reports. This trend is not necessarily in conflict with directives from the top to cut costs, he argues. The key question is whether middle managers and other employees have any choice in the level or the method of cuts. Vic Luck, head of consulting to commerce and industry in the UK at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, agrees that some companies are pulling financial authorisation back to the centre and that a second, small group is 'taking a step backwards' by cutting total quality programmes because they are not giving immediate results. But a third group of companies is continuing with its decentralisation programmes, he says. At the same time, they are cutting expenditure, frequently by giving staff their head in cost reduction programmes. A remarkable example of this last year was within British Airways Engineering. Alongside a total quality programme introduced with the help of consultants from Kepner-Tregoe, management's targets for expenditure cuts were exceeded almost threefold when aircraft maintenance staff were let loose on the problem; they produced savings of Pounds 24m against the target of Pounds 8.5m. John Perkins, BA's chief engineer, now says: 'I don't mind admitting I was a Rambo-style manager - I have changed my own style because I have seen that it is just not the most successful way.' His approach contrasts markedly with standard airline management. Most airline campaigns to create greater 'customer care', and other such programmes designed to change staff behaviour, tend to empower employees less than they programme them to act in a particular way. Airline managers who are more conservative than Perkins would argue that this is because most tasks in their industry are done more effectively via control than through empowerment. That is certainly the approach practised by successful, but rather soulless, US airlines such as Delta and American. But it is also why passengers tend to be cynical about staff retraining programmes which provide a superficial gloss of empowerment, yet which do not allow them even to provide the occasional hungry passenger with a second bag of peanuts. This is just the very trite tip of an iceberg of confusion, anxiety and, for some people, excitement which surrounds the concept of empowerment. A second article on empowerment will appear on Monday.</p>

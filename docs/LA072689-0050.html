			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 AMBASSADORIAL NOMINATIONS SQUEAK BY IN SENATE COMMITTEE  </P> <P> Three of President Bush's ambassadorial nominees, whom Democrats said had no  qualifications except political connections, won narrow approval Tuesday from  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  </P> <P> Sen. Charles S. Robb (D-Va.) joined the Republican members as the panel first  voted, 10 to 9, to send to the Senate floor the nomination of Florida real  estate developer Joseph Zappala to be ambassador to Spain.  </P> <P> Then, in voice votes, the committee approved the equally controversial  nominations of Florida real estate developer Marvin Sembler to be ambassador to  Australia and Della Newman, a Seattle, Wash., real estate broker, to be  ambassador to New Zealand.  </P> <P> Robb said later that he was troubled over Zappala's "quite thin" qualifications  for the job but that he felt he had made an "implicit" commitment to vote for  the nominee when he interviewed him May 11 and did not clearly indicate that he  would oppose him.  </P> <P> Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), who led the opposition to the nominations, vowed  to carry the fight to the Senate floor.  </P> <P> "One looks through this resume wondering why this person has been appointed to  this position," Sarbanes said of Zappala.  </P> <P> "The answer is to be found in the appendix, which lists the campaign  contributions."  </P> <P> Zappala reported to the committee that he contributed $126,000 last year to  Republican campaigns and gave $17,900 in the previous two years. His prior  governmental experience, described on the ambassadorial evaluation form  submitted to the committee, consisted mainly of chairing campaign finance  committees for President Bush and the Republican Party.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Approvals  </P> <P> In other action, the committee routinely approved the nomination of Shirley  Temple Black to be ambassador to Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> It also approved the nominations of Thomas Melady to be ambassador to the  Vatican, William Howard Taft IV to be the permanent U.S. representative on the  Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Keith L. Brown to be  ambassador to Denmark, and Joseph Gildenhorn, a Washington lawyer and real  estate developer, to be ambassador to Switzerland.  </P></p>

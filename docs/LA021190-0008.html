			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OLD ROSES ON THE RISE;  </P> <P> THEY GROW ALONGSIDE OTHER FLOWERS IN THIS PASADENA COTTAGE GARDEN, BUT THEY ARE  DEFINITELY IN CONTROL  </P> <P> DAY-TO-DAY life is orderly; the garden shouldn't be," says Alan Mittelstaedt, a  Pasadena gardener who favors the casual, even disorderly look of a cottage  garden to more formal plans -- and who prefers the rumpled look of an old rose  to the just-pressed look of a modern hybrid tea. Mittelstaedt has filled the  yard of his 1920s cottage with more than 50 cultivars of roses, about  two-thirds of them antique varieties, some centuries old. "I love the special  fragrance of the old roses, especially the musks and rugosas," he says. And he  appreciates their informal flowers, casual arrays of petals that are far  different from modern hybrid tea roses, which he describes as "arrogant plants  with their picture-perfect flowers. Some aren't even fragrant," he says  indignantly. "How could anyone breed a rose that is not fragrant?"  </P> <P> Old roses are on the rise. Several specialty nurseries now carry them in  Southern California, and in the new Wayside Gardens Rose Catalog (Hodges, S.C.  29695-0001), old roses are listed before new roses -- hybrid teas are at the  very back of the book -- a sign of changing times for roses.  </P> <P> In front of the Mittelstaedt cottage is a classic cottage garden, which, by  definition, is a casual mix of flowers. "I've tried to make the garden look as  far from manicured as possible," says Mittelstaedt. "It should be as natural as  it can be."  </P> <P> To ensure the absence of straight lines, he laid out the large planting areas  with a garden hose, letting its curves determine the outline of the beds.  Inside the outline, he dug out the existing St. Augustine lawn and generously  amended the soil with bags of redwood compost to give the roses a good start.  Mittelstaedt soon found that even those beds were not big enough.  </P> <P> In California's mild climate, most old roses grow much larger than they do  elsewhere. "The catalogue said that 'Souv. de la Malmaison' would grow to 3 or  4 feet. But mine was soon over 8. Four-foot roses such as 'Boule de Neige' grew  to 12 feet." Mittelstaedt's remedy for exuberant growth was to train the  tallest roses like giant blackberries, on rustic but sturdy trellises made of  8-foot poles, 3 inches in diameter. More of the same poles were used to make  crosspieces, to which and the roses are tied. The roses growing on these posts  are mostly Bourbons (such as 'Souv. de la Malmaison,' developed in 1843) and  Hybrid Perpetuals (such as 'Frau Karl Druschki,' a 1901 German rose). Every few  years, he cuts off, in a casual manner, the top 2 or 3 feet. Otherwise, he does  little to the old roses. (The modern roses get a once-a-year pruning.)  </P> <P> Old roses are not pest- or disease-free, though many gardeners erroneously  reason that if the plants lasted this long, they must not be susceptible. "I  almost took out 'Deuil de Paul Fontaine' (moss rose, 1873) because it had black  spot all year long," Mittelstaedt says. "It also flowered all year long, so I  figured if he could live with it, so could I."  </P> <P> Another venerable rose myth is that they only flower once, in the spring.  That's true with a few, but in the Mittelstaedt garden most roses flower off  and on all year long. " 'Mme. Hardy' (white Damask, 1832) and 'Rosa Mundi' (a  red-striped Gallica of unknown but ancient age) are the only two that bloom but  once in spring that I know of, but then 'Boule de Neige' (a Bourbon from 1867,  pure white, strong fragrance) blooms all the time."  </P> <P> Mittelstaedt started with 20 favorite roses, and he now grows more than 40  roses in the front garden, another dozen in back. Rugosas outnumber the rest --  Peter Beales' book "Classic Roses" describes them as "able to grow almost  anywhere without mollycoddling, and (will) provide flowers throughout the  summer."  </P> <P> However, Mittelstaedt still has a long way to go to catch up with his father's  collection. "My father was a Lutheran minister, and there was a great deal of  land behind the parsonage in Tujunga where he grew three or four hundred  roses," Mittelstaedt recalls. "Most of these came from his friend, John H. van  Barneveld, who would show up in the middle of the night with a station wagon  full of roses that hadn't sold well."  </P> <P> Many of the leftovers he brought were old roses, which in the 1950s -- the  golden age of the modern hybrid tea -- were under-appreciated. Van Barneveld  was one of the first to grow old roses commercially in California, and he  listed several hundred in his 1955 California Roses catalogue under the heading  "Roses of Yesterday but of Great Value Today."  </P> <P> Growers again agree with Van Barneveld's assessment. His nursery is gone, but  gardeners intrigued by the imperfect blooms and sweet scents of old roses can  find them at places such as Sassafras in Topanga, Limberlost in Van Nuys,  Burkards in Pasadena and Country Bloomers in Orange.  </P></p>

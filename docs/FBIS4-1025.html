			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 18 SAPA -- In spite of requesting  a commission of inquiry into the violence that flared during a  Zulu march in Johannesburg on March 28, the IFP [Inkatha Freedom  Party] was unable to submit evidence to the Goldstone Commission  on Monday.    IFP legal representative Maurice Basslian told the  commission  he had been instructed by the IFP only on Wednesday last week.    Monday's proposed march by the IFP Youth Brigade, which was  postponed on Sunday, had apparently made consultations difficult.    Mr Justice Richard Goldstone said the IFP's failure to  submit  was contemptuous in the light of IFP spokesman Sue Vos' request  for an urgent hearing.    He ordered the IFP to submit reasons by 9AM on Tuesday for  their failure to make submissions.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by NOYAN-TAPAN: "Deserters Should Not Expect a </F> Peaceful Future"]    [Text] The problem of calling up reservists in Armenia for  a training session was the topic of a television interview given  by Vazgen Sarkisyan, Republic of Armenia minister of state and  chairman of the military draft commission. Noting that the  previous call-up was "a complete success," he touched on the  problem of desertion. According to him, the names of all  deserters are known, and if they have not yet been punished it  is because these are difficult times and everybody is too busy  to look for them. The time will come, however, when they all  will face the court. He said that all measures have been taken  to keep deserters from leaving the territory of the  republic--"for this contingent, the airport is closed." Interpol  is involved, and with its help those deserters that have left  Armenia may be returned. "There is no forgiveness for them; they  do not have a peaceful future--they will not be able to live,  work, or study with impunity. Moreover, they will be  `blacklisted.'" Vazgen Sarkisyan promised that chairmen of rayon  councils who will not ensure that the call-up process proceeds  smoothly will themselves be called up for service.</p>

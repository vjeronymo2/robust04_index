			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / The Business Traveller: Pack a sense of humour - Gillian Tett explains how best to survive air travel in Russia Nothing breaks the ice in a Moscow meeting quite like the word 'Aeroflot'. Of all the hazards dogging western business in Russia, flying has long been the most colourful. There is the legendary tale of the traveller who set off to fly to Volgograd  -and was deposited 3,000m away in Vladivostok instead. There are the every day epics of 12-hour delays, pet goats in the cabin and tarted-up air hostesses. And there is my own dinner party piece of the occasion I argued myself onto a flight to Baku - and found that other passengers were sitting in all the seats, luggage racks and toilets, which meant I had to squeeze in behind the pilot at the controls. Now the good news for the faint-hearted is that alternatives are available. In the last two years Aeroflot, once the monoply airline of the Soviet Union, has been broken up into 160 regional and republican carriers. Most still operate under the flag of Aeroflot, and sell tickets to foreigners through the central Aeroflot ticket agencies. The Russian transport ministry has recently urged the smallest carriers to re-unite, possibly as holding companies. However, the service of the different carriers varies significantly, not least because of the varying availability of petrol. Meanwhile, 161 entirely new airlines have been registered as well, with two now offering scheduled services competing with Aeroflot. One is the Transaero group, which offers reasonably priced flights between Moscow, Riga, Kiev, Alma Aty and other cities. The airline uses two Boeings and two Ilyushin 86's, mercifully redesigned inside. The hub is Sheremetevo 1 airport, one of the less unpleasant in Moscow. The hostesses, trained by Air France, are smart. And instead of the standard Aeroflot food - rubbery chicken squares and strange, fizzy juices - the fare on a recent Transaero flight from Alma Aty was a herb omelette, complete with button mushrooms. The second new private company is the Chance airline, which flies three times a week between Moscow and Tblisi. Chance's Dollars 150 service, like its name, is memorable. The tickets themselves are as flimsy as loo paper, but passengers are offered champagne and roses. The airline is too young to have established a meaningful safety record - but that is unlikely to deter anyone who has chosen to travel to Georgia. A third alternative is to charter your own aircraft. Private jets can be hired from most west European countries, and if there are several passengers and destinations on the trip, the cost may not be too discouraging. Aeroflot will also arrange charters and Russian army units sometimes offer their own aircraft for private flights, particularly in far-flung regions. If none of these options is feasible, then you will have to use a scheduled flight from one of the former Aeroflot carriers. Even here, however, there are tactics which can help on any flight: If you are new to Russia, travel with a local. Having someone who can argue with officials can determine whether the journey is simply novel or nasty. Many airport officials outside large cities like Moscow will not speak English, and the system for check-in can be bewildering. Equip yourself for long delays, wherever you are flying. Take some food. Loo paper and whisky are also helpful. Above all, bring something utterly absorbing to read. Travel light. Recovering lost checked-in luggage is difficult. Although there is little leg room in the cabin, you can usually store extra hand luggage at the front or rear. If your aircraft suddenly dives, do not immediately panic. Remember Aeroflot pilots are trained fighter pilots, which makes them highly skilled. Finally, hang on to your sense of humour. Most flights do arrive, eventually.</p>

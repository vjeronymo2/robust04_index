			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / International Company News: SCI bid for Great Southern doomed to failure Service Corporation International's hostile bid for funeral operator Great Southern Group is doomed to certain failure, because of restrictions in the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the UK company's large shareholder, writes Simon Davies. The restrictions mean that the US funeral giant has been forced into a tight timeframe, which could considerably weaken its negotiating position assuming that it is prepared to increase its bid for Great Southern, as expected. SCI launched its offer document last Tuesday, offering Great Southern shareholders 600p a share, 26 per cent above the pre-bid closing price. A separate offer was made to JD Field &amp; Sons, the private company controlled by the Field family, which owns 56.1 per cent of Great Southern's shares. SCI's success rested on gaining the support of five trusts which control close to 70 per of JD Field, since the company's five directors immediately rejected the bid as 'wholly unacceptable'. However, these trusts are legally prohibited from accepting the bid within the set timeframe, even if they could be swayed by SCI's cash. Under JD Field's Articles of Association, there is an extraordinarily complex procedure for any shareholders wishing to transfer shares. A firm of accountants has to give an estimate of fair value for the shares, which can take up to 21 days. The shares must then be offered to existing shareholders at the agreed price, for a minimum of 14 days. Finally, the directors have four months from the initial announcement of a shareholder's intention to sell, in which they have the right to find an alternative buyer for the shares. Under the Takeover Code, the current offer for Great Southern can last a maximum of 60 days, and if it lapses, SCI will not be able to bid for Great Southern until after a year. The restrictions on share transfer would take JD Field shareholders well beyond that time limit. JD Field's restrictions on share transfers can be removed, but this requires 75 per cent approval from shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting. Unfortunately for SCI, the directors, who have unanimously rejected the offer, own 27 per cent of JD Field's shares, making the current offer an empty gesture. Yesterday Schroders, which is advising SCI, confirmed that SCI's directors had been aware of the contents of the Memorandum and Articles of Association and, 'recognised that the only way the bid could succeed was with the agreement of JD Field, the 56 per cent shareholder.'</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 55,000 AFFECTED;  </P> <P> MAXICARE TO CLOSE HMO UNIT IN ORANGE  </P> <P> Maxicare Health Plans Inc. said Tuesday that it is closing Family Health  Services Inc., its 55,000-member health maintenance organization based in  Orange, effective at the end of the month.  </P> <P> FHS, which was acquired by Maxicare in 1986 when it bought HealthCare USA,  operates 15 medical clinics under the FHS and General Med names in Orange, Los  Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties.  </P> <P> Maxicare said it is notifying members, employers and health care providers of  the planned closing so they can make alternative arrangements.  </P> <P> Because FHS is a self-contained unit providing services directly, its members  will not automatically be covered by other Maxicare plans. Those members will  have to enroll in other medical plans offered by their employers. The number of  Orange County Maxicare members was not immediately available.  </P> <P> The greatest impact of the closing will be in Orange County, where seven  clinics operate under the General Med name. Of the 500 FHS employees to be laid  off with the closing, about 300 work in Orange County, the company said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based Maxicare, which is in the middle of a financial restructuring  that may be critical to its survival, said closing FHS is part of that broad  program. The restructuring has included selling unprofitable plans.  </P> <P> However, the company said it is dismantling FHS because it could not sell the  unit, despite 9 months of intense effort.  </P> <P> "We talked to a lot of people, but the deals were never consummated," said Tobi  Nyberg, vice president for corporate communications.  </P> <P> FHS has some assets, including buildings and medical equipment, that can be  sold, but Maxicare expects the net effect of the closure to be a loss, Nyberg  said.  </P> <P> In most cases, Maxicare does not provide medical care directly but contracts  with independent health care providers for services.  </P> <P> Maxicare said it is encouraging employers to hold special open enrollments so  FHS members will have access to alternative services immediately after March  31, when FHS clinics stop seeing patients.  </P> <P> A handful of FHS employees will remain for a few months to handle  administrative tasks, the company said.  </P> <P> "We were concerned that Family Health Services' financial condition could  affect its ability to deliver quality health care for its members," said Harley  Blankenship, Maxicare's executive vice president and chief operating officer.  </P> <P> The closure will also help Maxicare meet its goal "to cut debt and losses so we  can pay provider claims on a timely basis," he added.  </P> <P> The company, which has had huge losses in the last 2 years, has said it must  improve its payments schedule for contractors to preserve crucial  relationships.  </P> <P> In a separate announcement Tuesday, Maxicare said it changed financial advisers  for the recapitalization plan. The company said it "concluded its agreement"  with Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., the New York investment banking firm hired last  fall to help devise the plan, and instead hired Oppenheimer &amp; Co. for  advice.  </P> <P> Maxicare's board authorized New York-based Oppenheimer to "immediately review  strategic alternatives, including financing alternatives and additional asset  sales," said a Maxicare company statement.  </P> <P> Blankenship would not specify the reasons for changing advisers but said  Goldman Sachs' departure was by "mutual agreement." Goldman Sachs declined to  comment.  </P> <P> Larry Selwitz, an analyst with Cruttenden &amp; Co., a Newport Beach investment  banking firm, said the change in advisers was a surprise. "I don't consider  this kind of a deal a great sign," Selwitz said. "This is especially disturbing  when you are talking about a situation where doing something expedient is  really critical. This restructuring should have gone ahead before now."  </P> <P> Analysts expect the recapitalization to involve converting the company's debt  into equity. "The question is whether there is going to be a long haggling over  how much equity for debt," Selwitz said.  </P> <P> He said he is surprised that the company has not tried to communicate with its  senior creditors and bondholders.  </P> <P> "To get this thing off and running, the company has to take the first step and  go to the bondholders. This is a very critical step to the restructuring," he  said.  </P> <P> Company officials said in December that they expected to announce a plan in  January.  </P> <P> However, Blankenship said Tuesday that the recapitalization plan is on schedule  and that no further delays are expected as a result of changing advisers.  </P> <P> "I would not be surprised if we may be in a position to make an announcement  next week," he said, although he noted that the company has not yet approached  bondholders.  </P> <P> Maxicare needs to recapitalize because it cannot meet interest payments due its  bondholders and a group of banks holding about $150 million in debt.  </P> <P> The banks have given Maxicare some "breathing room," Blankenship said, by  agreeing to a 120-day standstill that allowed Maxicare to use funds to pay  providers. When the agreement expires April 1, he said, "we expect continuing  our obligations to the banks."  </P></p>

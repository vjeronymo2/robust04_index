Attending this forum were provincial leaders, including Ma  Guoliang and Sun Kuiwen, leaders of the province's 11 poor  counties and the cities and districts in these counties, and  responsible persons of provincial level departments concerned.    Comrade Sun Weiben pointed out: In the process of acquiring  the new market economic structure, the policies, and scope and  degree of economic benefits, such as reducing or remitting  taxes, increasing loans, and striving for parity-price means of  production, will be gradually reduced. If the ideas of helping  poor counties shake off poverty and become prosperous still  remain in the stage of asking for money, materials, and policies  from the higher authorities, it will be very difficult to carry  out the work of enabling poor counties to shake off poverty and  become prosperous. The establishment of the new market economic  structure has brought new opportunity for this work. If we  promptly adjust our ideology and shift the planned economy to a  market economy, we will be able to more rapidly attain the aim  of enabling poor counties to end poverty and become prosperous.  He said: The key to success is to do a good job in the two  aspects of decontrolling and invigorating the markets and  guiding enterprises to enter the market. To invigorate the  markets, we must eliminate the obstacles. If we decontrol the  management of thousands upon thousands of markets and enable  them to develop production and create wealth independently, we  will have no problem in helping poor counties end poverty. The  problem now is that the traditional leadership concepts and  management system have tied the hands of peasants and  enterprises. When carrying out work, peasants and enterprises  have to ask for favors from various departments, and if they  fail to do so, they will be unable to carry out their work.  There are too many official procedures and shackles. The way  to solve this is to deepen reform, change government functions,  and streamline and reorganize organs. Government departments  should not manage things that are within the framework of the  decision-making power of enterprises and laborers. Departments  which have no work to do after changing functions and delegating  powers should be merged into other organs or abolished. Those  who extort money from enterprises and peasants or create  difficulties for them should be investigated and handled upon  discovery. He said: We must pave the road and build bridges  for enterprises and peasants to enter the market. Since  peasants have engaged in the natural economy and enterprises in  the product economy for a long time, they cannot adapt  themselves to the market as soon as it is decontrolled.  Particularly, the quality of enterprises and peasants are  relatively lower in poor counties. The contradictions between  the scattered small production units and large markets are very  prominent. It does not mean that the governments have nothing  to do or that they have taken on an attitude of noninterference  after creating benefits for the markets. They should guide  thousands and thousands of peasant households and enterprises  into the market and give prominence to the intermediate service  work for peasants and enterprises. Comrade Sun Weiben noted:  To help poor counties, we should adopt permanent measures,  focus the work on supporting poor counties by carrying out  explorative work and enhancing their ability to survive and  develop under market conditions, relatively concentrate efforts  on helping poor counties carry out some explorative pillar items  in agricultural and industrial production, and enhance their  self- development function. In addition to studying and  formulating regular policies to help and support poor counties,  we should also issue some relatively supportive policies in line  with the explorative pillar industries and projects they have  carried out. In formulating policies to help and support poor  counties, the general guideline is to try to the utmost to  decontrol enterprises.    At the forum, Vice Governor Sun Kuiwen summed up the  situation of carrying out the strategy of helping poor counties  across the province shake off poverty and become prosperous and  set forth demands on future work. He said: Since the  convocation of the provincial on-the-spot meeting on helping  poor counties shake off poverty held in Lindian County last  year, the strategy of helping poor counties shake off poverty  has been carried out in an all-round manner. Last year, the  total output value of 11 poor counties increased 13.7 percent  over that of the previous year, higher than the provincial  average by 8.8 percentage point; their financial revenue  increased 13.4 percent, higher than the province's county  average level; and the average per-capita income of people in  the rural areas increased 25.5 percent, higher than the  provincial average by 17.1 percentage point. He called on poor  counties across the province to strengthen confidence in shaking  off poverty and becoming prosperous, deeply carry out the  strategy of helping them shake off poverty, fully and rationally  develop and use land resources, steadily develop large-scale  agriculture, unceasingly raise the income of peasants, actively  develop county-run industry, and continue to expand local  financial resources. He called for efforts to further enhance  consciousness and initiative in carrying out the strategy of  helping poor counties shake off poverty, continue to support  poor counties with policies, organize social efforts to jointly  carry out this strategy, and strive to fundamentally change the  outlook of poor counties after several years of efforts.</p>

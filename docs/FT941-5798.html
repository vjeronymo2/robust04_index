			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: QMH shareholder loses attempt to delay EGM The High Court yesterday turned down an attempt by a Queens Moat Houses shareholder to obtain an injunction delaying next Tuesday's extraordinary meeting. The meeting was called to confirm the hotel group's Pounds 2bn borrowing limit and was needed to rectify mistakes at previous annual meetings when one class of shareholder was not allowed to vote on some resolutions. Mr Dennis Woodhams, one of the leaders of the QMH shareholders' action group, had applied for the injunction. It would have delayed the EGM until the planned meeting when the group's refinancing proposals are put to shareholders. No date has yet been set for this meeting. The court turned down the application and ordered Mr Woodhams to pay QMH's costs. One of the resolutions put down for next week's meeting releases the present directors from any liability in respect of the failure to give votes to the class of shareholders. The mistakes date back to 1989; the current directors were all appointed in the last year. Mr John Bairstow, former chairman, yesterday said the question of releasing directors from liability should be discussed separately at the meeting. He also questioned why the release only covered present directors, which would exclude himself. QMH said it did not need to apply to former directors as the accounts were adopted in September when the new board was in place. In another move, Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank which was originally one of QMH's lenders, countered reports of a row between it and other creditors following the sale of its Pounds 25m exposure to QMH. Credit Suisse is believed to have sold the debt at 17 per cent of face value. It said it had kept other banks and the authorities informed of its decision to sell last December.</p>

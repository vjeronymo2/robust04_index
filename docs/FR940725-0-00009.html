			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA concurs partially. Since only two comments were received in response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the proposed 6-month compliance time, the FAA assumes that most operators are able  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to accommodate that proposed compliance time. In light of safety considerations, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA finds that a short initial compliance time for the inspections and functional tests is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warranted. However, upon reconsideration, the FAA considers that extending the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed compliance time by 3 additional months will not adversely affect safety, and will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow the required actions to be performed at a base during regularly scheduled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance where special equipment and trained maintenance personnel will be available,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if necessary. Paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(2), and (c) of the final rule have been revised to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specify a compliance time of 9 months for the initial inspections and functional tests of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thrust reverser control and indication systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not agree that the compliance times specified in the final rule should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be expressed in terms of maintenance check intervals. Since maintenance schedules vary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from operator to operator, there would be no assurance that the actions will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplished during those maximum intervals. The FAA has determined that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance times, as specified in the final rule, represent the maximum intervals of time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowable for the affected airplanes to continue to operate prior to accomplishing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required actions without compromising safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters request that the proposed compliance time for repetitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections and functional tests of the thrust reverser control and indication systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [specified in paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(2), and (c) of the proposal] be extended from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed 15-month intervals to accommodate current or future scheduled ``C'' check  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance intervals. Two commenters propose extension of the compliance time to 18-month intervals. One commenter indicates that Boeing Alert Service Bulletin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 747&hyph;78A2115, Revision 1, dated March 10, 1994, recommends inspection intervals of 15  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> months or 5,000 flight hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA concurs partially. As discussed previously, the FAA does not agree that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these compliance times should be expressed in terms of maintenance check intervals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the FAA does concur with the commenters' requests to extend the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance time to 18 months. Extending the compliance time by 3 additional months will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not adversely affect safety, and will allow the inspections and tests to be performed at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> base during regularly scheduled maintenance where special equipment and trained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance personnel will be available, if necessary. Paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(2), and (c) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the final rule have been revised to specify a compliance time of 18 months for repetitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections and functional tests of the thrust reverser control and indication systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters request that paragraph (d) of the proposed rule be revised to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow dispatch with a thrust reverser inoperative in accordance with the FAA-approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL) if any discrepancy is found during the required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections and tests. Several commenters point out that allowing dispatch with a thrust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reverser inoperative will provide operators time to obtain parts and perform any necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrective action. One commenter explains that, without this change, the dispatch  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability of the airplane would be downgraded for problems such as proximity sensor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustments or auto restow chafing, which are not related to the integrity of the stow lock  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feature. One commenter requests 14-day dispatch relief.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA concurs partially. The FAA agrees that an option for dispatch relief may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be allowed in accordance with an operator's FAA-approved Minimum Equipment List  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (MEL). However, the FAA does not concur with the commenter's request for 14-day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dispatch relief, since the MMEL specifies 10-day dispatch relief. The FAA has revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (d) of the final rule to provide an alternative for an airplane to be operated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with existing provisions and limitations specified in the MEL, provided that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more than one thrust reverser on the airplane is inoperative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> Three commenters request that the proposed interval of 1,000 hours time-in-service for repetitive inspections of the bullnose seal and tests of the lock mechanism and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the position switch module and cone brake be extended to coincide with operators'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheduled maintenance intervals and to reduce the economic impact of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions. One commenter suggests a repetitive interval of 1,300 hours time-in-service. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second commenter proposes that the interval be extended to 1,500 hours time-in-service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third commenter recommends that these actions be required every 15 months or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during ``C'' checks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not concur. The FAA based the repetitive inspection interval on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data obtained from a reliability analysis submitted by Boeing prior to the issuance of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule. The FAA based the proposed interval of 1,000 hours time-in-service on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that analysis and on the fact that affected operators conduct ``A'' checks at intervals of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 450 hours time-in-service. The FAA's intent was that the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections and tests be conducted during every other regularly scheduled ``A'' check,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when the airplanes would be located at a base where special equipment and trained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel would be readily available, if necessary. Further, the FAA has received no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supporting technical analysis to supplement or refute the manufacturer's original reliability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis. The FAA has determined that the compliance time, as proposed, represents the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum interval of time allowable for the affected airplanes to accomplish the required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repetitive actions without compromising safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

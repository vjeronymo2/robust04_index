The Efrain Pabon Front  of the ELN [Army of National Liberation] kidnapped 31 [number as  heard] delegates and voting officers in Carcasi, (Garcia  Rovira). Meanwhile, efficient operations by the authorities have  allowed voting to take place normally in the area.    [Begin recording] [Reporter] The delegates and officers were  traveling in five vehicles when they were intercepted by an ELN  front in Carcasi Municipality, eastern Santander Department.  The subversives are holding seven National Civil Registry  Office delegates and 25 students who were going to (Toboson) to  serve as voting officers. The guerrillas freed the driver of  one vehicle, who subsequently informed the authorities.    [Second Division Commander Manuel Bonnet; identified by  caption] We have been helping the National Civil Registry  Office and the Governor's Office since this morning. We have  the material here at the brigade and are ready to transport it  via helicopter. The troops are also ready to ensure that the  elections are held in those areas.    [Reporter] The kidnapping occurred on the afternoon of 12  March, and by that evening the National Civil Registry Office  had dispatched new delegates to see that elections would be held  in the place where the subversive incursion occurred. The  military forces said the elections are progressing normally in  that zone. [end recording]</p>

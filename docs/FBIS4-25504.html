			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 9 (CNS) -- The two-day session held  by the economic group of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC)  for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ended here  today. Leaders of the group, Mr. Gao Shangquan and Mrs. Nellie  Fong said in a press conference that today's meeting centered on  the work report for the first half of this year and had made  preparations for a concluding meeting to be held in July. The  session also discussed work set for the second half of the year.    Members of the group were convinced that the group would be  divided into six smaller teams in the second half of the year in  a bid to smooth the work. The sub-groups are the large-scale  project and contract study team, the study team for coordination  of large basic construction in Hong Kong and China, the land and  housing policy study team, the financial and economic study  team, the foreign economic relations study team, and the study  team for economic and trade relations between Hong Kong and  China after 1997.    Mr. Gao said that the latter two teams were newly created in  a bid to validate agreements and treaties signed by the  territory with foreign countries before 1997. As economic  relations increasingly grow closer and bigger between Hong Kong  and China, a clear picture should be defined for further  development of such links. Establishment of the two teams can  help achieve this end and are aimed at maintaining stability  during the transition period and for the long-term prosperity in  the territory after 1997.</p>

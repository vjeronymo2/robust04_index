			<p>BFN     [Text] La Paz, 22 Apr (EFE) -- The Bolivian Government  today approved the National Budget Law, which provides for an  8-percent salary increase for public servants. This is not  considered enough by the labor unions that have reacted with  massive hunger strikes.    The Bolivian Labor Federation (COB), the only labor union in  the country, has organized another voluntary hunger strike to  protest the aborted attempt by members of the Attorney General's  Office to dislodge three teachers who have been fasting for the  past 19 days at the COB headquarters to demand better salaries.    La Paz District Attorney Javier Dips tried to dislodge the  strikers and transfer them to medical centers because, according  to medical reports, they are about to go into comma due to lack  of food.    The aborted attempt was criticized by COB leaders and  workers, as well as by Labor Minister Reynaldo Peters who denied  any government involvement in the case, and by Interior Minister  German Quiroga who asserted that those on hunger strike at the  labor union headquarters will be respected.    COB Executive Secretary Oscar Salas, today stated that more  workers have joined the 768 people fasting throughout the  country "to make the government aware of their salary demands."    A group of 180 teachers who began a march to La Paz on 18  April from Tiquina, on Lake Titicaca, will arrive in La Paz  today and immediately join the hunger strike, according to their  leaders.    The teachers have been marching along the highway to La Paz  for the past three days. One of them said: "We want to make the  government aware that we cannot live in misery for ever. We  demand a fair salary that will be in keeping with the cost of  the family basket."    The government-COB dialogue was suspended after President  Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada at dawn today promulgated the National  Budget Law, which provides for an 8-percent salary increase.    The COB has summoned a nationwide meeting of leaders to  decide on future actions following the imminent rupture with the  government, as well as the possibility of requesting the  intervention of the church.</p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SHOUP SAYS CLU'S DECISION NOT FINAL  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran may say he is fired but, according to Coach Bob Shoup, the last  shot has not been heard.  </P> <P> "There are some processes that are appropriate to faculty, and that's where I  am right now," Shoup said Monday evening after returning from San Jose.  </P> <P> The university issued an announcement Friday saying Shoup had been released,  but he contends that the situation is still being resolved.  </P> <P> "A number of people met today on this issue, and I need to be updated," Shoup  said. "It's out of the (Board of) Regents (hands), and there is a process and  it's just starting."  </P> <P> Shoup declined to name the parties involved in what he says are ongoing  discussions, but when asked if he considered his release a finality, Shoup  said: "I'm not sure I should answer that for fear it would be looked on as a  challenge to the administration."  </P> <P> Shoup also refused to reply to published comments by University President Jerry  Miller.  </P> <P> "I know Miller took some shots, and I'm not sure exactly why," Shoup said.

			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Old Hatchets: Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher put aside old political wounds  Wednesday and went to a lunch in London honoring former Prime Minister Edward  Heath. Though he has kept up steady criticism of her policies, he warmly  welcomed her to the affair.  </P> <P> Love Letters: French papers are taking up sides over the publication of letters  from Simone de Beauvoir to Jean-Paul Sartre, which concentrate on her affair  with him and her bisexual love life. The newspaper Le Monde said Wednesday that  "anyone who loves life will find these letters delicious," while Liberation  said "this suffocating display is a crime." She said of her conquests: "When I  see all these dropouts and all these little, nice and weak people . . . it  pleases me to think how solid we are, you and I. I've found up to now that it  is a success for our morality and way of life."  </P> <P> Strange Bedfellows: Vice President Dan Quayle announced Thursday that Sen.  Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), will accompany him to the March 11 presidential  inauguration of Patricio Aylwin in Chile. Quayle, champion of the Republican  right, held a photo session with Kennedy, symbol of the Democratic left, saying  "It shows the bipartisan commitment to the advancement of democracy in Chile  and the Western Hemisphere." Aylwin replaced military dictator Augusto  Pinochet.  </P> <P> Light Debt: Seymour Durst, president of a real estate company in New York, has  a unique way of reminding people of the size of the U.S. debt. "It's a sign 10  feet by 25 feet we put up on 42nd and 6th Avenue," he explained to Mark  Patinkin of the Providence Journal in Providence. R.I. "It shows the debt, all  13 digits of it, in flashing lights." The electronic sign, which now totals up  to more than $3,000,000,000,000, continually updates itself. "The debt  increases $8,000 a second," said Durst. Compiled by YEMI TOURE  </P></p>

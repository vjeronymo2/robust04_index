			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Markets: At a Glance - Net building society funds fall again Building society accounts saw a net monthly outflow in July - the fifth outflow in the past nine months. Money continued to drain out of building society accounts last month, partly because of competition from National Savings. The net outflow was Pounds 325m, up from Pounds 314m in June - a far cry from a net inflow of Pounds 774m in May 1991. However, the figure was not as bad as the industry had feared. The societies had forecast an outflow of Pounds 450m to Pounds 500m for the month.</p>

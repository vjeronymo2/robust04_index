			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SMOG ALERT ISSUED FOR WEST HALF OF COUNTY  </P> <P> The Air Pollution Control District issued a Stage 1 smog alert Friday for the  western half of San Diego County for "unhealthful" air with ozone levels of  more than 20 parts per 100 million -- a rating of 200 on the Pollutant Standard  Index, authorities said.  </P> <P> "From 0 to 50 on the Pollutant Standard Index is good. From 50 to 100 is  moderate air. But when you go above 100 to 200 you're at unhealthful air," said  Lynn Eldred, a spokeswoman for the district.  </P> <P> The alert was declared for the coast to 30 miles inland from 3 to 5 p.m. and  open burning was prohibited. Those with allergies or asthma were warned to stay  indoors. People were encouraged not to exercise outdoors.  </P> <P> During a smog alert, Eldred said, people should rest, curtail their activity,  remain indoors, avoid heavily trafficked areas, avoid perfumes and dust, drink  clear liquids such as juice and water and avoid smoking.  </P> <P> There were four Stage 1 alerts in 1985, none in 1986, one in 1987 and two in  1988, Eldred said. Friday's was the first this year.  </P></p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / France reviews stock options The French government has set up a committee to examine reforming the rules governing stock options after recent criticism of the remuneration of senior company executives. Stock options give the recipient the right to buy shares in a company at a future date at a fixed price, usually below the market rate when they can exercise this right. They allow pay to be partly tied to performance, as measured by a company's share price, and are subject to favourable taxes in France: 19.4 per cent capital gains tax against a marginal tax rate of nearly 60 per cent for highly paid executives. Mr Jean Arthuis, a member of the French Senate, urged tougher tax rules on stock options when the latest finance bill passed through the legislative body last month. His Mr Arthuis' concern was partly triggered by a fear that the rules on options have been exploited by companies and their advisers. The rules were changed when some executives were becoming eligible to exercise previously-awarded options and did not want to have to wait before selling their shares. He said the new committee will examine issues including the disclosure of options. Mr Arthuis' proposal is to reintroduce income tax on the capital gains made when options are sold by executives, unless they have waited at least one year after the options were granted before selling them. This requirement was repealed by law last year.</p>

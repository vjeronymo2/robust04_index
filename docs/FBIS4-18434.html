			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Writing in the 20 March Athens daily I  KATHIMERINI, commentator Stamos Zoulas notes that a "deep  change" is seemingly taking shape in Greek political life,  characterized by the departure from old-style political  practices and the emergence of a new generation rejecting both  past and present and pursuing the "modernizing rebirth" of the  country's public life. The first step was taken when the  leadership of the New Democracy (ND) went from Konstandinos  Mitsotakis to new man Miltiadhis Evert. While former ND luminary  Andonis Samaras had already left the party to found his own  Political Spring, it is too early to evaluate his initiative,  which in the future may well be viewed as a "simple episode."  Similarly, the change that took place in the Coalition of the  Left for Progress with new leader N. Konstandopoulos, who claims  to be a modernizer, may not have much effect on Greek political  life given the party's small size, Zoulas contends. As a result,  change is more noticeable in the two largest parties, he  continues. In the ND, Evert initiated a new opposition policy no  longer based on strident criticism at the risk of arousing his  followers' ire, in the belief that similar tendencies are  developing within the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK). He  also thinks that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou will not be  his opponent in the next elections, whether they take place as  scheduled or in 1995 because of the Chamber of Deputies'  inability to elect a new president. Evert's evaluation of the  situation in PASOK stems from the "Simitis rebellion" and the  "Pangalos movement," both indications that the Papandreou  succession struggle is coming into the open, Zoulas writes. He  quotes Minister of Industry and Commerce Kostas Simitis as  making a "spectacular overture" for economic liberalization by  referring to "the Scylla of statism and the Charybdis of the  state's indifference." In addition, he cites Simitis as  "unequivocally" condemning party choices of officials and  hirings of public workers and indirectly blaming PASOK for the  crisis in public administration. For his part, alternate  Minister of Foreign Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos implicitly  criticized his party's economic policy and its lack of resolve  in punishing tax evaders, whom he called "criminals." In Zoulas'  view, both men have adopted a "modern political discourse devoid  of ideological sloganeering." Above all, he remarks, both reject  the strategy of "confrontation, divisions, and historical  rivalry" that PASOK and Papandreou have used thus far as a  "recipe for artificial polarization." It is obvious that Evert,  Simitis, and Pangalos believe such methods are incompatible with  the solutions to the country's problems and contrast with the  modernizing course followed by all European Union (EU) member  states, Zoulas concludes.    Highlighting the bipolarization of Greek politics, an  article  in the 11 March Athens daily TA NEA lists the differences  between the PASOK and ND internal structures. The article points  out that the PASOK executive bureau has 10 members, all coming  from the ranks of PASOK deputies, while the ND's executive  committee has 17 members, 11 of whom are deputies and six come  from the party. The PAS0K central committee has 141 members, 63  of them deputies and 78 nondeputies, while the ND central  committee numbers 75 people, 25 of whom come from the party's  parliamentary ranks and 50 from the party.</p>

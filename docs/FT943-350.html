			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Natwest in move to acquire share of Indian venture bank National Westminster Bank of the UK is planning to invest about Pounds 10m (Dollars 15.8m) in a newly-formed joint venture Indian bank. It is the latest move by an international financial services group to take advantage of India's economic liberalisation programme. NatWest is proposing to take a 20 per cent stake in HDFC Bank, which is promoted by the Housing Development Finance Corporation, India's largest housing finance company. HDFC would hold 35 per cent. The deal is expected to be signed in early October. HDFC Bank is one of 10 new privately-owned banks licensed by the Indian authorities as part of efforts by Mr PV Narasimha Rao, prime minister, to liberalise the economy. The authorities have also licensed five overseas banks - Dresdner Bank of Germany, Chase Manhattan of the US, the Bank of Mauritius, the Development Bank of Singapore and Denmark's ING Bank. Other banks, including Germany's Commerzbank, are considering applying for licences. NatWest and the other new entrants will join about 24 foreign banks already operating in India, including Standard Chartered Bank of the UK, Australian-owned ANZ Grindlays, and Citibank, American Express and Bank of America from the US. Unlike most Indian-owned banks, foreign banks escaped nationalisation in the 1970s, but suffered until recently from tight operating restrictions. The authorities might have granted new licences sooner had it not been for the 1992 Rs40bn (Dollars 1.28bn) securities market scandal in which foreign banks were accused of playing a prime role. The Indian authorities hope that the new banks will increase competition. India is dominated by 28 state-controlled banks holding 90 per cent of banking assets. The encouragement given by the finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, to foreign banks comes in the face of criticism from some politicians who have blamed all foreign banks for the alleged wrongdoings of those involved in the securities scandal, such as Standard Chartered Bank and Citibank. Mr DR Mehta, a deputy director of the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, said India very much wanted to encourage competition from foreign banks and would distinguish between scandal-affected banks and the rest. NatWest, once represented in India through one of its forerunners, the National Bank, sees the venture with HDFC as a better way of entering than establishing a wholly-owned banking operation. They also think it will be an advantage to be tied to a strong local partner when bidding for government-related business such as privatisation. The partners would offer shares to the new bank's employees, and to employees and shareholders of HDFC. The bank would be floated on the stock market early next year. NatWest is also planning to open a representative or liaison office in Bombay through which it could handle non-banking business such as capital markets activities.</p>

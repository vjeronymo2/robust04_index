			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Foot soldiers dig in for war of attrition - Alison Smith gauges the mettle of Westminster's Euro-rebels UNDETERRED by their failure to stop the bill last night, the cross-party bands of Euro-rebels will be fighting on - and fighting to win - as the legislation proceeds through Westminster. Once it became clear that Labour would try to block the bill only and specifically on the grounds of opposing the UK's opting out of the social chapter and economic and monetary union - a course which would not attract any Tory rebels - the Euro-sceptics knew they would not be able to stop it in its tracks. At last week's Tory Euro-sceptics' dinner at the Carlton Club - even before the numbers of rebels had hardened - the talk was of tactics during the bill's committee stage, when MPs as a whole will be able to discuss it in detail and propose amendments to it. The critical question for the rebels will be whether they can devise an amendment which could unite elements as disparate as the Labour frontbench and hardened Euro-sceptics such as Sir Teddy Taylor on the Tory side. In any event, there is certain to be an attempt to propose a referendum, and though this might lead the pro-European Liberal Democrats to vote with some Tory Euro-sceptics, it may be difficult for the Labour party to agree. The two options open to the rebels for handling the bill are co-operation or delay. With co-operation, perhaps four full days would be set aside for discussion of the main issues. There are votes, which they are likely to lose, but at least the arguments would have been given a hearing. But if the rebels - or even a small minority of them - decide to filibuster in a bid to delay the bill, then the government might seek to impose a timetable on discussion, perhaps by then with popular support from backbenchers on both sides of the Commons. Alternatively, it could simply threaten a later summer recess. Though either route ends in the passage of the bill, both parties have been making strenuous efforts to minimise the rebellion. Particular pressure has been applied to new MPs, with more success on the Tory side than on the opposition. Mr Llew Smith, the Labour MP for Blaenau Gwent, used his maiden speech to explain why he was going to vote against the bill instead of following the party line of abstaining. Mr Nick Harvey, the new Liberal Democrat MP for Devon North, abstained rather than following his colleagues in voting for the bill. More generally, reminders that none of the rebels seemed to have mentioned to the electorate just a few weeks ago that they were planning to vote against party policy have been coming from the two frontbenches. There have also been touching appeals to logic, party unity and detailed argument when in many cases the view held is more instinctive and high-flown. On both sides, the rebels include a few figures, such as Mr John Biffen and Mr Peter Shore, whose seniority even those wholly unsympathetic to their stance say gives the rebellion 'a bit of class'. 'I don't feel as though I'm backing a loser,' said one senior rebel, 'but I'm not sure we'll win in my lifetime.'</p>

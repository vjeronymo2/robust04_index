			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "NEGA Reports" rubric: </F> "Azerbaijan"]    [Text] The Azerbaijani Party of National Independence  [APNI] has demanded that the Azerbaijani parliament speaker  should resign. "By signing the Bishkek protocol together with  Karen Baburyan, representative of the self-proclaimed  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and thus effectively recognizing this  entity, Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Chairman Rasul Guliyev  committed an act of national treason that has drastically  aggravated the sociopolitical situation in the country," the  statement of the Republic's largest opposition movement says. It  also emphasized: "Recognizing Russia as the sole mediator in  the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict and signing  the Bishkek protocol on 8 May, the Azerbaijani authorities have  ratcheted up tensions in the Republic to a critical point. The  signing of this document together with the so-called Nagorno-  Karabakh Republic [NKR] will lead to international recognition  of the NKR, the introduction of Russian troops into the conflict  zone, and finally Azerbaijan's loss of control over part of its  territory. Given that, the APNI states that it does not  recognize the Bishkek protocol and requests that the National  Assembly make a decision on the speediest possible dismissal of  Speaker Rasul Guliyev, who has committed an unconstitutional act  and overstepped his powers, and also that the president of the  Republic express his attitude to the document.</p>

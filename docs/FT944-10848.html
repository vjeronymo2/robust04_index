			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / ITN deadline on share limits is extended The Independent Television Commission yesterday extended the deadline requiring shareholders in Independent Television News to reduce their holdings to a maximum of 20 per cent. The decision means that Carlton Communications and Granada, which each hold 36 per cent stakes because of last year's consolidation in ITV, will be able to retain their dominant position in ITN at least until the end of next year. The extension has come because the government has made clear that it wants to consider ownership of ITN in the continuing review of cross-media ownership rules. The announcement is a further indication that the government is taking very seriously the whole issue of cross-media ownership. It is also investigating whether the present restrictions in the 1990 Broadcasting Act could already be out of date. Media legislation is extremely unlikely in the coming parliamentary session. The likelihood now is that there will be formal consultation, in the form of a green or white paper next year, in advance of substantial legislation in the 1995-96 parliamentary session. Apart from cross-media ownership rules - and whether newspapers should be able to own broadcasting organisations and vice versa - legislation could address a number of issues remaining from the 1990 act. Mr Michael Green, chairman of ITN and Carlton Communications, yesterday welcomed the commission's extension on ownership. The 1990 act said that no single shareholding in ITN should exceed 20 per cent by the end of this year. At the same time the shareholdings of the regional ITV companies collectively must be less than 50 per cent. At the moment the total ITV stake in ITN amounts to 82 per cent, with Reuters at 18 per cent the only non-ITV shareholder. The commission said yesterday the deadline for compliance with those requirements would now be extended by one year to the end of 1995. Mr Green said yesterday: 'ITN has benefited from having a small number of large shareholders who are strongly committed to the long-term success of the company.' The ITN chairman said that the television news group had been transformed from a loss-making company into 'a profitable and efficient news organi-sation'. At a time when the government has given the BBC the go-ahead to compete commercially, Mr Green said: 'ITN would continue to compete strongly in home markets and expand overseas.'</p>

Katyal] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 29--Contrary to the belief here, the  U.S. Administration maintains that its policy on South Asia  remained consistent in 1993 despite the change in presidency.    According to an official year-end review of the U.S.  relations with the Indian sub-continent (details of which are  available here), most of the themes sounded by the Clinton  Administration on "South Asia--nuclear non-proliferation,  democracy-building, human rights, free trade and economic  reform--echo the policies set in place by his precedessor,  George Bush." That is because, it says, these broad goals best  define American interests in the post-cold war world and are  particularly relevant to South Asia.    Indo-Pak. tensions: The historic tensions between  the region's two strongest countries, India and Pakistan, the  review notes, have become far more troubling in recent years,  now that both are widely considered to possess a nuclear weapons  capability. Added to the volatile mix is the ongoing instability  in Afghanistan, where security risks have prevented the United  States from re-opening its embassy. The breakup of the former  Soviet Union evoked a wholesale re-evaluation in Washington of  U.S. relations with the former eastern bloc, but its effect on  U.S. South Asia policy has been subtle. In the Presidency of Mr.  Bill Clinton, the changes, it is pointed out, have come in the  degree of emphasis placed on particular issues.    It cites the views expressed by the U.S. Assistant Secretary  of State, Ms. Robin Raphel, and other officials from time to  time that the State of Jammu and Kashmir is a "disputed"  territory. Questioning the suggestions in sections of South  Asian media, "for largely parochial reasons" that the Clinton  Administration had modified the South Asia policy, it quotes the  following remarks of the State Department spokesman in November:  "As we have noted consistently since 1947, the United States  believes the entire geographic area of the former princely State  of Jammu and Kashmir is disputed territory. The United States  believes the best way to resolve the dispute over Kashmir is  through direct discussions between the Governments of India and  Pakistan as envisioned in the (1972) Shimla agreement, taking  into account the wishes of the Kashmiri people."    Delhi sees new elements: As seen in New Delhi, the  Clinton Administration introduced new elements in its South Asia  policy, with recurring references to the "wishes of the Kashmiri  people" and its willingness to help resolve (in other words,  "mediate") the problem if desired by the two sides.    The debate over the possible scrapping of the Pressler  Amendment is summed up thus: "Another U.S. policy that is likely  to provoke regional opposition but remain unchanged is the  suspension of U.S. aid to Pakistan. The 1985 Pressler Amendment  to U.S. law requires that aid to Pakistan be withheld unless the  U.S. President can certify that Islamabad does not possess  nuclear weapons capability. The Bush administration revoked  Pakistan's certification in 1990, and the aid cutoff has  remained in effect ever since. Although the Clinton White House  indicated in 1993 an interest in removing `country-specific'  language from the foreign aid law to allow presidential  discretion in such decisions, the principle that underlines the  Pressler Amendment continues to be upheld. As a result, the aid  cutoff can be expected to continue until Pakistan's nuclear  programme ceases to be of international concern."    Priority for non-proliferation: Citing Mr.  Clinton's address to the U.N. General Assembly that he had "made  non-proliferation one of our nation's highest priorities," the  review describes how that official message was brought home  during an October State Department briefing, with the statement  that the United States was "particularly concerned" about the  proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in regions such as  South Asia. "We have ongoing, senior-level discussions on this  issue with the Governments of Pakistan and India and we will  continue to urge both Governments to undertake direct,  high-level discussions on this and other issues dividing them,  including Kashmir."    Among the "good news" were the decision by India and  Pakistan  to resume official talks and the elections in the two countries,  according to the official document.    The Pakistani elections, according to the review, were  widely  hailed as having been the freest and fairest in its history with  some observers suggesting that the process may have given birth  to a genuine two-party system.    The significance of the Assembly elections in India was  spelt  out thus: "Hindu-Muslim tensions heated up with the December  1992 destruction by Hindu nationalists of the historic mosque of  Ayodhya, and riots which left hundreds dead. Tensions were  further heightened by a bomb attack in downtown Bombay and the  siege by Indian security forces of the sacred Hazratbal mosque  in Kashmir, where Muslim militants had barricaded themselves.  Those and other events led many to predict that Indian politics  would become increasingly fractious and polarised by religious  extremism. Instead, voters in India's recent elections largely  rejected the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] Hindu nationalist  party. The election results were widely interpreted as a  reaffirmation of India's status as a modern, secular State."    "In a positive move that was lauded by the United States and  international organisations, the Indian Government agreed this  year to allow human rights observers to enter Kashmir and  investigate reports of abuses committed by New Delhi's security  forces," the review said.</p>

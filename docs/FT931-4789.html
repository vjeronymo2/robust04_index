			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Traders in China bid for lion's share of profit IT'S A bit like selling the family silver, but Mr Dai of Beijing's Friendship Store is quite unrepentant about the decision to sell off the huge pair of bronze lions that adorn the entrance to this landmark on the city's main boulevard. 'Everything in our store, whether decorations or retail items, is for sale,' he said. 'We regard these lions as goods for sale.' These once-proud creatures, who have observed impassively millions of tourists and local Chinese passing through the store's portals, now carry a price tag - the tag dangles from a rusty chain around the neck of one - of Yn800,000 (Dollars 139,000) for the pair. Mr Dai, deputy manager of the store, says negotiations are under way with a wealthy overseas Chinese for the sale of the lions whose display would attest to the worldly success of their owner. Weighing eight tons, the lions are a copy of originals that guarded the entrance to Beijing's Summer Palace, and are thus known as the 'Number Two Pair Under Heaven'. The lion's sale is merely one of many changes that have overtaken the Friendship Store - the youyi shangdian - as it struggles to compete with dazzling new emporiums sprouting all over Beijing in China's new age of affluence. Recently, the management tore down the iron railing near the store's entrance which had stood for many years as a barrier to locals who came to gawk at the trickle of foreign tourists in the bleak 1970s. A store manager was quoted as saying of the railing's removal: 'It's a market economy now; we don't want to look like a big feudal government office.' Competition obliged the store last September to allow locals to shop there in local currency. Previously it was the preserve of foreigners or privileged Chinese who had access either to foreign money or to special foreign exchange certificates.</p>

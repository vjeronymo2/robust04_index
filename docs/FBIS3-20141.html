			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Views" column: "The Blue-Helmet Bull" -- all </F> punctuation as published]    [Text] The confusion was followed by some deep thinking,  and it appears that the result will come from logic. At least,  this is indicated by all signs from the government and almost  all political parties on the pseudo-dilemma: whether our  soldiers will go to Bosnia.    Let us look at the problem first. The United Nations damaged  its prestige and called on Turkey, the pseudo-ambassador of  peace--and not only "Attila" [nickname of Turkish forces in  northern Cyprus]--to protect Bosnia with its arms, so it says.  As all the countries appear unwilling to put blue helmets on  their soldiers, the willingness of Ankara comes...perfectly  dressed. Therefore, the United Nations and all who really  dictate its decisions put aside principles in its best interest,  as they interpret it.    On the contrary, Turkey is not damaging its principles.  Turkey's principles are identical to its interests. Weapons  and force are basic aspects of its principles; they are aspects  that describe its historical identity. They have always been  its tools for...imposing the peace. Consequently, Turkey is  faithful to its history.    Our country has its own principles: in some cases, it would  have been better if it had not had them. Greece's most  important principle is its commitment to peace. It is a  principle that has never been decorated with the...accessory of  arms.    Of course, our country has interests, too. However, common  sense does not find any interest that would be served by our  engagement in Bosnia. What could be the purpose of an even  peaceful Greek presence there that would also be dangerous? On  the contrary, our presence under blue helmets in Bosnia would  legalize the Turkish presence in the Balkans. Therefore, our  country does not have any conflict of interests and principles  that would tempt it to put them aside for once.... Consequently?    Consequently, there is no dilemma. There is an opportunity  to transform our diplomacy and change the international climate  that wants Greece to be Europe's black sheep.    If the international community cannot see the bull that  pounces on the Balkan glass shop, it is in need of an eye  doctor. The responsibility for what will follow will be passed  by history onto those who ignored it and opened the door to  "Attila," who this time is on a blue-helmeted bull.</p>

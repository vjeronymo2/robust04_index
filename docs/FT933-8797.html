			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Signs grow for Nato air strikes as Serbs hold firm SERB FORCES appeared yesterday to defy international demands to withdraw completely from strategic heights around Sarajevo amid signs of mounting military preparations for Nato air strikes. General Francis Briquemont, commander of UN forces in Bosnia, flew to a Nato air base in Italy to discuss the logistics of air strikes with Admiral Jeremy Boorda, Nato's commander of Allied Forces Southern Europe. Italy later announced that it was sending more troops to reinforce its border with former Yugoslavia to protect against possible reprisals in the event of Nato bombing raids. Mr Fabio Fabbri, Italian defence minister, told a radio interviewer it was necessary to 'strongly intensify' border controls to protect against possible terrorist attacks. Serb nationalists have threatened to retaliate against Italy if the Nato aircraft based there are used to attack Serb positions. In a further escalation of the tensions Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, told an Austrian newspaper that he would try to acquire nuclear weapons to carry out attacks if the West pressed ahead with military action. The comments were due to be published in Austria today. A spokesman for Mr Karadzic last night denied he made the threat. The US has warned the Serbs that if they did not leave the strategic mountains around Sarajevo that they could face air strikes, agreed at a meeting of the Nato council last Monday. President Clinton's nomination of Gen John Shalikashvili, who is known to be more favourable towards intervention in Bosnia, as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has fuelled speculation that Washington is moving towards a stronger line on the conflict. European diplomatic sources sought to play down the threat, stressing that the prime consideration continued to be the peace negotiations in Geneva. The talks, however, remained at an impasse. President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia reiterated he would not return to the talks until the Bosnian Serbs had completed their withdrawal. Bosnian Serb leaders said they would not fully withdraw from Mount Igman until the UN had given further assurances that the strategic heights would remain neutral. Although Serb troops had been reported to be leaving the area Unprofor in Sarajevo confirmed that 'thousands' of Serb forces remained on the summit of Mount Igman.</p>

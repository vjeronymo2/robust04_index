			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Development of the Nation's Legal System </F> and National Discipline"]    [Excerpt] Several legal experts gave their opinions at a  seminar on "The Prospects for the PJPT II [next 25-year  development plan]" in Jakarta last week. They concluded that  economic and political interests in Indonesia have made the  nation's legal system subordinate to these two fields. The  experts also concluded that law has never been the determining  factor in decisions. The seminar was attended by Professor Dr.  Sunaryati, a legal expert; Professor Dr. Sri Sumantri, dean of  the Law Faculty at Pajajaran University; and Dr. T. Mulya Lubis,  a legal expert.    The legal experts told the seminar that the legal system in  Indonesia has been tampered with from time to time. They said  that the government, professional institutions, businessmen, and  the people must show the political will to strengthen the  national legal system. At the seminar, the legal experts cited  several concrete examples to support their allegation that the  country's archaic legal system is no longer suitable for the  present situation. The experts agreed, however, not to point  out the unsuitable laws in the existing legal system, but  instead discussed ways to seek the best replacement for those  regarded obsolete so that future generations can observe the new  laws.    Sunaryati said that we do not have to blame the old laws  which the nation inherited from the Dutch colonial masters.  Instead, we should think of a way to establish our own national  laws that are free from political dominance and applicable to  the present situation. Mulya Lubis said the current legal  system has made the judicial institutions ineffectual purveyors  of justice. He singled out the courts' failure to uphold  justice when dealing with the nation's economic and business  laws had resulted in the non-repayment of loans. In other words,  there is no political will to settle the bad debts problem even  though there is a clause in the law that will allow the problem  to be settled comprehensively.    Actually the practice of dispensing one's own rules is not  something new in this country. Several cases of contempt for  the law have been discovered and efforts to uphold justice have  been carried out by the legislative and executive branches.  This could be seen from several documents that date back to the  formation of the Republic of Indonesia.    It is interesting, however, to note the outcome of the  seminar. This is because the topics of discussion were  highlighted at a time when the nation is at the take-off stage  for entry into the PJPT II. At this stage, the legal system is  one of the most important factors in efforts to implement the  national development targets. Definitely, every aspect of the  legal system should be guided by the national discipline which  is the driving factor behind the people's obedience and loyalty  to the laws. National discipline is a norm that exists in a  society.    To cite an example, the MPR [People's Consultative Assembly]  always places national discipline as one of the dominant factors  in the Broad Outline of State Policies [GBHN]. This means we  have to abide by the national discipline to ensure that the our  national development goals are achieved. [passage omitted</p>

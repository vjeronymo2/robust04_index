			<p>BFN     [Text] The Finance Ministry plans to lower the external  debt service to eight percent of the annual government  expenditure budget through a debt prepayment of US$210 million.    Last week, the U.S. dollar fell against the yen to less than  100 yen to US$1, giving the ministry a good opportunity to  prepay foreign debt. A source said at the end of this month,  the ministry will make a prepayment on loans extended to  national development projects many years ago. This payment  amounts to US$210 million, which carries an interest rate of  8.25 per cent. There are two portions: about US$100 million in  Japanese currency, US$50 million in US dollars and the rest in  other currencies.    The prepayment will spare Thailand from paying interest over  the next 7-8 years. The ministry will use the fiscal reserve of  about Bt[baht]200 million to make the prepayment.    The Finance Ministry has also sent a letter to the Asian  Development Bank requesting permission to make a prepayment.  Thailand currently owes ADB about US$200 million.    The source said that external debt service currently amounts  to more than 8 percent of the national expenditure budget.</p>

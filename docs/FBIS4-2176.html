			<p>BFN     [Text] Finnish Premier Esko Aho and Chinese Premier Li Peng  both say that political and economic relations between Finland  and China have developed in a favorable way. Aho started an  official visit to China today. The premiers concentrated on  economic matters at their meeting. Aho hoped that China's  willingness to curb the overheating of its economy would not  have negative consequences for Finland's traditional cooperation  projects.    China's human rights policy was also discussed. Aho  reiterated Finland's stance that human rights are universal and  everybody must respect them. According to Premier Li, China  wants to adhere to the principles accepted at the UN human  rights conference last year. China is of the opinion that these  principles give China the right to apply its own cultural  traditions in this matter.</p>

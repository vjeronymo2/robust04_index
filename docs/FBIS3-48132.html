"They agree that a major premise for making decisions  on important economy-related policies hinges on achieving  political reform," Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobuo Ishihara  told a news conference.    "They confirmed that seeing through the political reform  package is one of the best economy-spurring measures," he said.    The six cabinet ministers made their views known at a  meeting  held at Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's official residence.  They are all government members of an economic panel that  advises the seven parties in the ruling coalition.    The six are Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, Chief Cabinet  Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii,  International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai,  Economic Planning Agency Director General Manae Kubota and Home  Affairs Minister Kanju Sato.    During the meeting, the ministers agreed that the next 15  months are vital to getting the economy back on its feet in 1994  and ensuring stable growth in 1995 and beyond, Ishihara said.  The six did not discuss when additional pump-priming measures  will be worked out and the national budget for fiscal 1994,  starting April 1, will be formulated, he said.</p>

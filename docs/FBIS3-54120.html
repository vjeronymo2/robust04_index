He said in Washington  yesterday that the President in his letter had pointed out that  the situation has improved in Punjab. He said the President has  also mentioned that there were regional elections and  restoration of local governments, while the level of violence in  the state has declined.    The director general of Punjab police, Mr. K.P.S. Gill, has  said that President Clinton's remarks on Punjab were an outcome  of wrong information said by the strong anti-Sikh [as heard]  lobby in the States. He told newsmen in Bombay yesterday that  the Punjab Police have been successful in controlling the  militancy in the state.</p>

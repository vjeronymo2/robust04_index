			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Doreen Cheung] </F>   [Text] The Government scored a major victory yesterday by  securing support from legislators to pump $1.67 billion into the  Chek Lap Kok airport project despite Chinese objections.    While China yesterday reiterated its opposition to what it  called Hong Kong's unilateral move to go ahead with the airport  in the absence of approval from Beijing, at least 32 legislators  said they would grant sufficient funds to keep the airport  project going.    The Government yesterday held two separate sessions for  lawmakers and the Airport Consultative Committee (ACC) to  collect their opinions before making a final decision tomorrow.    From the $1.67 billion, $377 million will be given to the  Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) to continue operating until  March. Critical contracts -- for baggage handling, the  automated people mover, foundation work for the passenger  terminal, and some construction support facilities -- can be  awarded in the first quarter of this year to avoid delay.    The Government had earlier offered two options to  legislators  -- to grant $377 million for the PAA, or to approve $1.3 billion  for the critical work. The Government is likely to secure  support from the 15 Liberal Party legislators, 13 United  Democrat legislators, and independents Emily Lau Wai-hing,  Vincent Cheng Hoi-chuen, Eric Li Ka-cheung and Jimmy McGregor.  Only pro-China legislator Philip Wong Yu-hong indicated that he  would not support any funding proposal, while Tam Yiu-chung said  he preferred the first option.    Mr Tam said approving just enough money to extend the PAA  head office funding into 1994/95 would better facilitate the  resumption of airport talks with China. Following the  legislators' expression of support, the Government will ask the  Legislative Council's Finance Committee to approve the $1.67  billion proposal on January 21.    Liberal Party legislator Howard Young said there was no  dissenting voice among them in make a commitment that the new  airport could be completed on time without seeking further  substantial injections of cash.    The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Wu Jianmin,  yesterday  reiterated Chinese opposition to any unilateral action taken by  the British side before striking a deal on the financial  arrangements with China. "Before agreement is reached between  the two sides, unilateral actions will do no good to the  settlement of the financial arrangements," he said.    The Secretary for the Treasury, Donald Tsang Yam-kuen,  rejected the Chinese suggestion that the British side was taking  a unilateral move. Asked whether Britain would take Chinese  objections into consideration, Mr Tsang said: "We are used to  it."    During a meeting of the Legco subcommittee on the financing  of the airport core programme, legislators pressed the  Government to either give an expected date of reaching a deal  with China, or to unveil full contingency plans for the airport  projects in the absence of Chinese blessing.</p>

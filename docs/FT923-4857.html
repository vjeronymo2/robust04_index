			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / US dismisses China's protest on F-16 sales THE WHITE House yesterday rejected the strongest protest heard from China in a long time over the decision by President George Bush to permit the sale of US warplanes to Taiwan. China accused Washington of being untrustworthy and of violating the Sino-US joint communique of August 1982, expressing itself 'shocked and outraged'. China threatened to withdraw from arms control talks between the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council if the decision to supply Taiwan with 150 F-16 fighters was not reversed. However, Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, immediately dismissed the Chinese objections. 'The president made his decision based on the stability of the region,' he said. US officials noted that China had recently acquired enough modern Russian-built fighters to throw Taiwan's air defence capabilities 'out of kilter'. The Chinese protest warned of 'a major retrogression' in Sino-US relations and said this would have a negative impact on bilateral co-operation in the UN and other international organisations. Qian Qichen, the Chinese foreign minister, said 'the US government should be held accountable for any serious consequences'. At a press conference in Jakarta, where he is leading a delegation to the Non-Aligned summit, he added: 'On the one hand, the US government is arguing for arms control, but on the other hand it is selling such sophisticated fighters.' Mr J Stapleton Roy, the US ambassador to China, was summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Beijing yesterday to be told by Liu Huaqiu, vice-foreign minister, that the decision was a gross interference in China's internal affairs and 'undermines the great cause of China's peaceful reunification'. The 1982 communique, one of three agreements forming the basis of Sino-US relations, expresses US intent to 'reduce gradually sale of arms to Taiwan, leading over a period of time to a final resolution'. Mr Bush helped negotiate the understanding with China a decade ago. Proponents of the F-16 sale argue that the US has the right to provide Taiwan with the arms that it needs for its defence. The sale of US warplanes to Taiwan was blocked during the cold war. Washington needed China's help as a counterweight to the military strength of the old Soviet Union. The role of China in this formerly critical balance has vanished. China's rebuke to the US is likely to add to its unpopularity in Congress where its human rights record is under criticism and its most favoured nation trade status under debate.

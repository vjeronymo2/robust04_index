			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Heart in Europe, hopes on Asia: Warren Christopher tells Jurek Martin why priorities are changing It would be wrong to infer that Mr Warren Christopher is perturbed by suggestions that western Europe fears that the US has somehow 'gone Asian'. But the secretary of state does acknowledge the 'perception', induced by disagreements over Bosnia, that there have been transatlantic strains over the last 10 months that need to be set right. So, on Monday afternoon he invited a small group of European journalists in for consecutive chats, the first such he has given with clear intent since taking over at Foggy Bottom. Wearing his trademark dark pinstriped suit, he is, as ever, supremely courteous and if there are additional lines on his 68-year-old face there were so many to begin with that none can be said to denote particular fatigue. Sitting cross-legged on an upright chair in the Monroe Room, he fiddles a little with his black pen but only once, when asked a question about Italy, does he fleetingly refer to the briefing file on his lap. The message - that Europe 'remains at the centre of our concerns' - is hardly new, though the need to repeat it is intriguing. Succinct opening remarks point out that of the six underlying principles of US foreign policy, the first three - global growth, Russia and European security - directly involve the continent, as does the sixth, a whole host of other 'global issues'. President Bill Clinton, Mr Christopher notes, is going to Europe three times next year - for the Nato summit in Brussels and on to Moscow in January, for the 50th anniversary of the Normandy landings in June and for the Group of Seven industrial nations' summit in Naples in July. A fourth trip is also understood to be under consideration. Mr Christopher says it has been 'unfortunate that attempts to find a solution to the as yet insoluble Bosnian problem have contributed to the perception' of disagreement. But, he insists, the US 'will carry out our obligations and take into account our vital interests'. In the Balkans, these are 'containing the conflict' so it does not spread south to Kosovo and Macedonia; humanitarian relief; and, if necessary and Congress is willing, sending a large US military contingent to help enforce any 'consensually agreed' settlement. There are many in Washington, including perhaps the secretary of state himself, who believe Congress will never give such approval if asked. All he will say is 'we do not feel that we have sufficient national interest in order to put the 100,000 troops into Bosnia that we believe would be necessary to compel a settlement between the parties.' But he was unrepentant about an earlier comment that he thought Washington had been too eurocentric for too long. This was 'a recognition of the reality of the cold war period'. Equally, 'the primacy of opportunity for the US in Asia is a statement of fact.' This was of minimal concern to him since US international relations are 'not a zero sum game', in which the focus on Asia inevitably meant a 'derogation' from Europe. It was only the accident of the G7 calendar that sent Mr Clinton to a summit in Tokyo and then to South Korea and perfectly logical for him to follow this up with the Apec session in Seattle last weekend and meetings this week with President Kim Young-sam of South Korea and President Fidel Ramos of the Philippines. But there was nothing wrong now with transatlantic communications at the highest level, he said. 'If you look ahead to one month from now, as Gatt comes to the end game, or eight months from now, after the G7, you'll see there has been much communication between us.' On Nato, for which he is full of praise, he makes the diplomatic point that the US thinks it important to 'reach out' to the countries of eastern Europe and to 'incorporate them into Nato's structures in such a way that it is healthy for them and healthy for Nato itself'. Above all, Bosnia should not be construed as 'a failure of Nato'. He also brushes off questions about tension between the US and the UN leadership of its secretary general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, only acknowledging 'differences of emphasis' over Somalia in the now-abandoned pursuit of faction leader General Mohammed Farah Aideed. The UN 'faces a tremendous agenda with limited resources', and 'we remain highly supportive' of the institution. Individual European countries also get high praise, particularly Germany. Disagreement over trading with Iran should not disguise 'the overriding reality of friendship and support' between Washington and Bonn. Relations with France were 'so much broader' than disagreements over trade, though he adds bluntly: 'Blair House (the EC-US agricultural pact) will not be renegotiated.' The politics of Italy are for the Italians themselves to decide. In the aggregate a whole host of political, economic, investment and cultural connections are too deep to be dismissed. Mr Christopher crosses the Atlantic himself next week, en route to the Middle East. He will attend the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe meeting in Rome and European Union, Nato and Gatt talks in Brussels. He does not expect the sort of trouble he encountered last spring on his ill-fated Bosnian mission.</p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar generally weaker THE DOLLAR weakened, but finished above the day's lows in London after data on US wholesale inflation proved to be in line with market expectations. Producer prices rose 0.2 per cent in April, the first gain for five months, but the year-on-year rise of 3.2 per cent was generally as expected and is not expected to have any impact on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. The annual rise of 3.7 per cent in producer prices, excluding food and energy, was also much as expected, leaving the market to wait until next week's data for further guidance on the economy. There has been very little economic news this week but next Tuesday sees publication of retail inflation figures, via the consumer price index, plus retail sales and industrial production. US trade figures will be announced on Friday and by that time the market hopes to have a better idea of where Fed policy and the dollar are moving. At the London close the dollar had fallen to DM1.7255 from DM1.7430; to Y138.75 from Y139.25; to SFr1.4580 from SFr1.4725; and to FFr5.8400 from FFr5.8925. On Bank of England figures the dollar's index declined to 66.4 from 66.7. The D-Mark remained in the lower half of the European exchange rate mechanism, but has already weakened substantially in the last three months and did not show much further reaction to disappointing figures on German trade and the balances of payments. Dealers noted that the widening of Germany's April current account deficit, to DM5.3bn from DM1.5bn, was partly the result of payments towards the cost of the allied war against Iraq. There was more concern that rising imports and falling exports led to a worse than expected trade position. The April trade surplus rose to DM2.8bn from DM2.6bn, but was below forecasts of DM3.5bn. The trade balance is expected to remain in surplus this year, but a current account deficit is now regarded as a serious danger, after last years's record surplus of DM75.5bn. Sterling improved against the dollar and Japanese yen, but lost ground to the D-Mark. The pound remained the third strongest member of the ERM, below the Spanish peseta and Italian lira. There was little reaction to the Bank of England's strong warning to the London money market that interest rates are not to be cut at present. Sterling rose 1.50 cents to Dollars 1.7190 and climbed to Y238.50 from Y237.25. The pound was unchanged at FFr10.0400, but fell to DM2.9650 from DM2.9700 and to SFr2.5075 from SFr2.5100. Its index gained 0.1 to 91.6.</p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> USAIR TO RETURN A FEW OF PSA'S FAMOUS SMILES  </P> <P> USAir, which wiped the smiles off of Pacific Southwest Airlines' jetliners  after acquiring the San Diego-based airline in early 1988, is grinning once  again.  </P> <P> USAir won't be painting smiles on its own jet fleet, but the Washington-based  airline is adding smiles to the noses of nine USAir Express propjets that  provide commuter service in California, Arizona and Nevada, USAir spokesman  Larry Pickett said Thursday.  </P> <P> PSA folklore credits the first smile to a mischievous maintenance man with a  paint brush. But former PSA executives have maintained that smile evolved from  a 1969 advertising campaign that eventually included the airline's "Catch our  Smile" slogan. By the mid-1980s, only United Air Line's "Friendly Skies" slogan  commanded more recognition among West Coast travelers than the PSA slogan and  the smile.  </P> <P> USAir, however, retired the smile after "extensive marketing studies" indicated  that the smile lost its power outside of PSA's service territory. "A smiling  plane going into La Guardia might not have the same marketing impact" as a  smile-bedecked airliner landing at Los Angeles International, Pickett said.  </P> <P> USAir, which is facing increased competition in the Los Angeles-San Francisco  corridor, believes that the copyrighted smile retains enough recognition among  consumers to help boost market share for the USAir Express operation that  Phoenix-based StatesWest Airlines has operated for USAir since July.  </P> <P> "USAir has been feeling increased (pressure) as far as our regional  operations," Pickett said. "But we're still the major carrier in California  with more flights than anybody else." Pickett described the smile's return as  part of a "more energetic marketing approach" by USAir.  </P> <P> StatesWest, which has painted its aircraft to match USAir's red, white and blue  livery, is "very excited about having the smile," said StatesWest founder,  chairman and chief executive, Rudy R. Miller. "We're building on a great  recognition factor that PSA developed."  </P> <P> Miller wanted to use the smile because, like the old PSA, USAir Express is a  "fun-oriented West Coast customer service attitude." StatesWest actively sought  USAir's approval to use the PSA smile, a registered trademark that is owned by  USAir, Miller said.  </P> <P> The advertising world recalls the PSA smile "as an outstanding and fun" tool,  according to Bob Kwait, an executive with Phillips Ramsey, a San Diego-based  advertising agency. Kwait was uncertain, however, if the smile was powerful  enough to help an airline other than PSA.  </P> <P> The PSA smile's return generated smiles and a few quips from executives at  Southwest Airlines, the Texas-based airline that has for years advertised  itself as PSA's rightful heir in the California market where PSA dominated  because of its low fares, high frequencies and personalized service.  </P> <P> "We find it quite humorous that you can paint smiles on the outside," Southwest  Vice President Don Valentine said. "I always thought that smiles came from  within."  </P> <P> Valentine described PSA's smile and the corresponding "Catch Our Smile"  advertising campaign as "a classic success story." But he cautioned that USAir  Express' advertising campaign would soon fade away unless the commuter airline  offers the low fares, high frequencies and personal service that Californians  now expect.  </P> <P> And, one former PSA executive noted that the smile's marketing power might  already have faded. "Having taken it off at the acquisition, (USAir) would seem  to have lost the momentum," the executive said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier  and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met here today with a Buddhist  delegation headed by the Myanmar [Burma] minister of religious  affairs, Lieutenant-General Myo Nyunt.    The delegation arrived here on June 5 to convey Buddha's  tooth relic back to China. The sacred tooth of Buddha of China  was allowed to be taken to Myanmar (formerly Burma) from April  20 to June 5.    Qian said that the sojourn of the tooth relic in Myanmar was  an important event in Sino-Myanmar links and religious relations  between the two countries.    He expressed thanks for the careful arrangement the Myanmar  Government had made for the sojourn.    Nyunt said that to make the event, a milestone of their  bilateral relations, the Myanmar Government decided to build two  Buddha towers in Yangon [Rangoon], its capital, and Mandalay,  its second largest city, using donations of the Myanmar people.    Over 85 percent of the Myanmar population are Buddhists, and  the country's rich cultural heritage, glittering temples and  pagodas are well-known throughout the world.</p>

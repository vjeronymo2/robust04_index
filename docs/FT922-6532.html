			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Lloyds referred MR MICHAEL Heseltine has taken the right decision in referring the Lloyds Bank bid for Midland to the Monopolies Commission. Unlike the bid from Hongkong Bank, the Lloyds offer raises competition issues which need to be scrutinised. And since the Hongkong bid has already been cleared in Brussels, there are no awk-ward conflicts between rival competition authorities. The odds are tilting in Hongkong's favour, but not overwhelmingly so. Lloyds should keep its hat in the ring.</p>

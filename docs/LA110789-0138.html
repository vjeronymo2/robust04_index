			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR BODY: TOOTHBRUSH SANITIZERS TO WARD OFF FLU?  </P> <P> Rinsing a toothbrush with tap water is old-hat hygiene. Toothbrush sanitizers  are the newest way to zap germs -- and perhaps reduce the frequency of colds  and flu.  </P> <P> In one sanitizing system called Brushgard, the toothbrush is inserted into a  small plastic bottle containing hydrogen peroxide and water. "Viruses and  bacteria cannot live in the solution," claims Jeff Hutner, spokesman for  Brushgard Systems Inc. The whole system sells for $1.39, but the manufacturer  recommends that customers replace it every 10 days. Having just introduced  Brushgard in local health food stores, the Inglewood company expects to  distribute it nationwide soon.  </P> <P> Dentec 4000, a plug-in sanitizing system that "bathes your toothbrushes in  ultraviolet germicidal light" sells for $59.95 at department and specialty  stores around the country, says Joe Bello, Dentec spokesman. He claims the  ultraviolet light killed germs in independent and Dentec laboratory studies.  Since the light stays on for only two minutes per half hour, the bulb lasts up  to five years. Each system holds four brushes.  </P> <P> "Both systems have potential for reducing the number of germs on toothbrushes,"  believes Richard Glass, professor and chairman of oral pathology at the  University of Oklahoma, who tested Brushgard and Dentec 4000. "The unanswered  question is: Does either system decrease the organisms enough to have an impact  on health?"  </P> <P> But the American Dental Assn. isn't convinced the sanitizers are necessary  because, according to a spokesman, "there's no substantial scientific evidence  you can be reinfected with a cold by reusing your toothbrush."  </P> <P> What's really needed, say some dental experts, is a more efficient toothbrush  -- one with fewer nooks and crannies for germs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Soups Vary in Health Benefits, Say Experts  </P> <P> As weather cools, weight-conscious consumers turn to soup to keep warm and  trim. But all soups aren't created equal. If weight control is your primary  aim, keep in mind these soup rules:  </P> <P> If you buy canned soups, don't be fooled by names. "Cream of spinach soup isn't  as healthy as it may sound," says Gretchen Newmark, a Santa Monica dietitian,  since the cream base adds fat.  </P> <P> If you still can't resist such soups, "make them with low-fat milk," suggests  Linda Dahl, a dietitian at HCA Los Robles Regional Medical Center, Thousand  Oaks.  </P> <P> If you order soup in a restaurant, "vegetable or minestrone soups are often  good bets to avoid excess fat," advises Newmark.  </P> <P> If you have high blood pressure, opt for low-salt or reduced-salt canned soups,  Dahl suggests. "Or at least mix a can of reduced-salt or salt-free soup with a  can of salted soup."  </P></p>

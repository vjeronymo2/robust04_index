No  decision has been made, said the official, who declined to be  identified, adding it will take some time to review the  unsuccessful conclusion of bilateral framework trade talks.    The administration plans to hold an interagency meeting as  early as Monday to discuss what to do following the talks, he  said.    He was commenting on a WASHINGTON POST report Saturday. The  paper quoted U.S. officials as saying one option would be to  announce Tuesday an intention to impose penalty duties on  selected Japanese products if it is decided that a 1989  agreement to open the cellular telephone market to the U.S. firm  Motorola Inc. has been violated.</p>

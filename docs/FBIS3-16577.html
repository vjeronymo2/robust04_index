The abrogation of  Yuriy Meshkov's (eds: Meshkov is president of the Crimea) decree  of 10 March is the first step in this direction," said Ivan  Timchenko, head of the Ukrainian president's legal service,  explaining Leonid Kravchuk's decisons over national television  on Thursday.    He dwelt at length on the background of these events. The  Crimean Republic adopted its Constitution on 6 May 1992 where  Article 9 read: Relations between Ukraine and the Crimean  Republic are based on treaties and agreements.    Article 17 granted Crimean citizens the right to have dual  citizenship to be determined by treaties between the Crimea and  other states. However, the above was in contradiction with the  Ukrainian Constitution.    Therefore, the Ukrainian parliament proposed that the Crimea  bring these and other articles in line with the Ukrainian  Constitution. Such a decision was taken by the Crimean  parliament on September 25, 1992.    Article 9 now reads that relations between Ukraine and its  subjects are based on legislative acts and agreements. "The  question of dual citizenship was the competence only of the  Ukrainian parliament," Timchenko stressed.    The lawyer noted that the decree by the Crimean Republic  president says about a public poll on whether there is any need  for restoring these articles of the Constitution, although such  questions are the competence of the Crimean parliament.    The preamble of Meshkov's decree runs that the poll will be  held to study the will of Crimean citizens and to take decisions  important for the Republic.    Timchenko claims that "in actual fact, a decision was taken  to hold a consultative referendum" under the pretext of a public  opinion poll. "This was the reason for Kravchuk to repeal items  1 and 2 of the above decree's Article 2," the lawyer stressed.    The Crimean central Electoral Commission held its meeting in  Simferopol on Wednesday and discussed Meshkov's address. The  Crimean president accused the commission of "unwillingness to  organise this poll and of usurping the role of a constitutional  court." The commission responded with a protest.</p>

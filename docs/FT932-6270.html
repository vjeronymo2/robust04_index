			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / US cuts Dollars 30m in aid to Guatemala THE US cut off more than Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.40m) in assistance to Guatemala yesterday because of the suspension of democracy there, agencies report. The decision came as the military in Guatemala City sent armoured cars and troops to break up a demonstration, which reflected mounting opposition to President Jorge Serrano's seizure of near-dictatorial powers. Despite a ban on demonstrations, an estimated 1,000 protesters gathered in the city outside the Supreme Court where nine new members, hand-picked by Mr Serrano, were to be sworn in. The US State Department again appealed to Mr Serrano to reverse his actions and suspended cash transfers to the Guatemalan government and military and police training programmes. The aid cuts also apply to development assistance and food aid channeled through the government. Aid channeled through private groups, including humanitarian assistance, can continue. Yesterday's announcement did not provide a figure on the value of the suspended aid but officials said it was in excess of Dollars 30m. Dollars 45m in food aid and development assistance had been planned for Guatemala in fiscal 1993. Also planned were Dollars 2.5m in anti-narcotics aid and Dollars 400,000 for military training. On Tuesday Mr Serrano dissolved the Congress and the judiciary and said he planned to rule by decree until a new constitution was drafted. The US said the suspension of the constitution put Guatemala 'on a dangerous course'.</p>

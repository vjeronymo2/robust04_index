Cargo tanks containing flammable or toxic lading must be purged. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Any repair of a cargo tank involving welding on the shell or head must be certified by a Registered Inspector. Any repair of an ASME Code ``U'' stamped cargo tank must be in accordance with the National Board Inspection Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The suitability of any repair affecting the structural integrity of the cargo tank must be determined by testing as prescribed in &sect;180.407. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Maintenance or replacement of piping, valves, hoses or fittings. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the event of repair, maintenance or replacement, any piping, valve, or fitting must be properly installed in accordance with the provisions of the applicable specification before the cargo tank is returned to hazardous materials service. After maintenance or replacement which does not involve welding on the cargo tank wall, the repaired piping, valves or fittings, the replaced segment of the piping must be leak tested. After repair or replacement of piping, valves or fittings which involves welding on the cargo tank wall, the entire cargo tank, including the repaired or replaced piping, valve or fitting, must be pressure tested in accordance with the applicable specification. Hoses permanently attached to the cargo tank must be tested either before or after installation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Modification, stretching, or rebarrelling. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Modification, stretching or rebarrelling of a cargo tank must conform to the following provisions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Non-ASME Code stamped cargo tanks. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If the modification, stretching, or rebarrelling will result in a design type change, then it must be approved by a Design Certifying Engineer. Any work involving modification, stretching, or rebarrelling on an MC 300, MC 301, MC 302, MC 303, MC 304, MC 305, MC 306, MC 307, MC 310, MC 311, or MC 312 cargo tank that is not ASME stamped must be performed by: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) A cargo tank manufacturer holding a valid ASME Certificate of Authorization for the use of the ASME ``U'' stamp and registered with DOT; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A repair facility holding a valid National Board Certificate of Authorization for the use of the National Board ``R'' stamp and registered with DOT. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ASME Code stamped cargo tanks. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The modification, stretching, or rebarrelling on any ASME Code stamped cargo tank must be performed by a repair facility holding a valid National Board Certificate of Authorization for the use of the National Board ``R'' stamp and registered in accordance with subpart F of part 107 of subchapter B of this chapter. If the modification, stretching, or rebarrelling will result in a design type change, then it must be approved by a Design Certifying Engineer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) All new material and equipment, and equipment affected by the modification, stretching or rebarrelling must conform with requirements of the specification in effect at the time of such work. In addition, the modification, stretching or rebarrelling must be performed such that the cargo tank, as modified, stretched or rebarrelled, meets the applicable structural integrity requirements (&sect;178.337&hyph;3, &sect;178.338&hyph;3, or &sect;178.345&hyph;3 of this subchapter) of the specification in effect at the time of such work.

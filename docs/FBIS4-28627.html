			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Yi Sok-ku from Tokyo] </F>   [Text] "The use of nuclear weapons is not against  international law," according to a clause of a recent Japanese  Foreign Ministry statement to be submitted to the International  Court of Justice.    The Japanese media gave high coverage of the statement and  it  became a political issue in the Diet causing a serious  controversy. Both opposition and ruling parties of Japan  strongly opposed the Japanese Government's opinion.    Forced to retreat, the Japanese Foreign Ministry deleted the  clause from the statement without making a juridical judgment  and said: "The use of nuclear weapons may not conform with the  humanitarian spirit, which is the basis of international law,  due to the fatal destruction and massacre power."    This was the conclusion made by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  and Foreign Minister Kakizawa Koji after being denounced by the  Diet. However, the Japanese Foreign Ministry is not changing its  previous stance that it is legal according to international law.    The Japanese Foreign Ministry asserts: "As long as there is  no treaty prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons, as in the case  of biochemical weapons, the use of nuclear weapons is not  against international law."    However, this is only the pretext and the real reason is  that  "if Japan admits that the use of nuclear weapons is illegal, the  precondition of Japan's security safeguard would be destroyed  since Japan depends on the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty as far as  nuclear deterrence capability is concerned."    Taking into account the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, the  Japanese Government has in fact told the allies on various  official and unofficial occasions since the sixties that the use  of nuclear weapons is not against the law.    However, things have changed since the end of the Cold War.  Russia has withdrawn its nuclear weapons, which it had aimed at  the United States and UK, and the United States and Russia have  begun to abolish strategic nuclear arms.    The North Korean nuclear is the biggest issue now. Foreign  Minister Kakizawa is silent to the opposition party's question:  "Does it mean it is not against international law for North  Korea to use nuclear weapons?"    It is clearly anachronistic that the Japanese foreign  minister is insisting on the old assertion to justify the use of  nuclear weapons. It also shows that Japan's diplomacy has  ignored the sentiment of its people and the diplomats only count  efficiency and national interests. This makes us suspect the  Japanese Government's hidden intention. Despite the fact that  the Japanese people are allergic to nuclear weapons because  Japan is the first country in the world to be bombed by atomic  bombs, the Japanese Government is insisting on legalizing the  use of nuclear weapons instead of drawing up a treaty to  prohibit the use or overall ban on nuclear tests. It is indeed  unreasonable.    We would like to believe that the Japanese Foreign  Ministry's  assertion is to provide itself with a basis for possessing  nuclear weapons in case of an emergency.</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Japanese trading house bails out finance offshoot MITSUBISHI Corporation, the leading trading house, is reviewing its policy of zaiteku, the financial engineering popular among Japanese companies, after announcing the rescue of a subsidiary, M. C. Finance, which accumulated stock investment losses of Y28bn (Dollars 237m). During the 'bubble' years of the late 1980s, Mitsubishi and other conservative industrial companies came to regard stock investment as an important 'profit centre'. But the sometimes huge losses suffered by special investment trusts have forced a reassessment of the risks of the stock market. MC was established in 1986 to act as a banker for Mitsubishi subsidiaries and affiliates, borrowing large sums at discount rates from Japanese banks and passing on the savings to these smaller companies, which would have paid higher rates if they had negotiated their own bank loans. The company was also encouraged by Mitsubishi executives to generate income through stock investment, which seemed a safe bet in the late 1980s, when Tokyo stock prices appeared capable of defying gravity. Like many other companies, MC used tokkin, or specified money trusts, giving it control over the choice of stocks. But three years of falling stock prices have badly bruised MC and Mitsubishi, which estimates that it, too, had Y310bn in tokkin funds at the end of September, with Y80bn in unrealised losses. MC has about Y70bn in funds invested in stocks, showing a loss of Y28bn. As MC has capital of only Y2.5bn, and was unable to cope with the losses, the parent company was forced to take action before the close this month of the fiscal year. Mitsubishi said MC would 'concentrate on core activities of providing financing, accounting and related services' to subsidiaries and affiliates. The trading house plans to cover the losses at MC through sales of its own equity portfolio, which had unrealised gains on total stocks held of Y782bn at the end of March last year. After covering the losses, the trading house plans to reduce holdings of 'investment stocks', though it will maintain strategic cross-shareholdings in Mitsubishi group companies. Japanese trading houses have generally done poorly in their stock fund investments. Sumitomo reported unrealised losses of Y60bn at the end of September, Marubeni Y98bn, and Itochu Y92bn, prompting each of these companies to review their stock investment policies.</p>

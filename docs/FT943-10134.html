			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Revenue warns on mis-sales - Debbie Harrison alerts readers to the latest concerns over pensions.  And a private investor explains how hos own plan performed The Inland Revenue this week warned life offices that it will take a tough line on any cases of mis-selling executive pension plans up to the September 1 deadline when rules on contribution levels change. The Revenue fears that life offices will lock investors in to high regular premiums which, under the new rules, must be cut over a five-year period. Executive pension plan providers will charge investors a penalty for reducing premiums, even though sales staff were aware of the impending rule change at the time of the sale. Bob Lusk, controller at the Revenue's Pension Scheme Office, which approves schemes for tax purposes, said: 'Life offices must understand that the five-year transition period is not a five-year free-for-all during which time the higher contributions can be paid. In most cases, if the level of contribution is high, the life office must start to adjust it immediately after the September 1 deadline. 'Moreover, if the life office sells a product now in the full knowledge that it will penalise the investor as a result of these reductions, this implies a degree of mis-selling. We will take a very dim view of salesmen who use the new rules as a 'buy now while stocks last' sales spree.' The Revenue also signalled its intention to limit the amount that can be paid into the UK's most popular pension arrangements for small businesses - small self-administered schemes. Discussions are underway between the Revenue and the Association of Pensioner Trustees - the small schemes lobbying group. New contribution rules for small self-administered schemes are expected by the end of March next year. Under existing executive pension plan and small scheme rules, the maximum combined employee and employer annual contribution for young employees is more than 100 per cent of salary. This will be cut to about 30 per cent for executive plans sold after September 1. Existing contracts have up to five years to bring contribution levels down but, in most cases, must start the adjustments from the date of the deadline (see table above). Small scheme contributions and, until September 1, contributions to executive plans, are not calculated as a percentage of annual salary but, instead, are based on the pension payable, a maximum of two-thirds final salary (restricted for some higher earners). From the salesman's point of view, the high executive plan contributions result in correspondingly high levels of commission since providers base commission payments on premium levels and the term to maturity. Ian Hammond, managing director and actuary at James Hay Pension Trustees, was concerned about the hard-selling approach of some life offices which, inaccurately, indicate that the maximum pension level under these plans will be cut from September. 'The changes do not affect the level of executive and directors' pensions, it is merely the rate at which money is put aside to meet these pension liabilities that is affected,' he said. Stewart Ritchie, director, pensions development, at Scottish Equitable, said: 'In recent months the pensions industry has been warned that a dim view would be taken of any activity which was seen to be promoting large annual premiums up to the current maximum levels, knowing that these could be cut dramatically at the end of the transitional period.' Hammond saw a clear example of this type of mis-selling earlier this week. 'A prospective client showed me a policy that a well-known life office had just sold to him. The salesman had suggested maximum contributions of Pounds 30,000 a year which is the current level of the investor's salary.' There were two significant problems with this sale. First, the client had not noticed the details on the back page of the contract. These said that if the policy was terminated, the transfer value after one year would be Pounds 20,000. 'The other Pounds 10,000 would disappear in charges,' Hammond said. Second, under the new rules, the contribution would have to reduce from 100 per cent of salary to about 30 per cent by 1999. 'Most regular annual premium contracts would charge a stiff penalty for these reductions which the client would have no option but to pay,' said Hammond. Executive plans may not be the most appropriate pension arrangement even if you avoid the high premium trap. Most advisers say they are over-complex and expensive and that better value is offered by personal pensions and self invested plans (see below).  ----------------------------------------------            NEW MAX CONTRIBUTIONS  ----------------------------------------------                  Current      Sept 94 Age                 %            %  ---------------------------------------------- 25                105.6         25.8 30                112.0         31.3 35                120.0         39.0 40                129.8         50.7 45                147.8         70.4 50                186.9        109.7 55                310.0        227.9 59              1,285.9      1,174.1  ---------------------------------------------- The table shows the new maximum annual contributions into an executive pension plan expressed as a percentage of annual salary.

			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAWYERS URGE REPEAL OF ABA'S ABORTION STAND;  </P> <P> POLICY: VOTE CALLS ON GOVERNING BODY TO REJECT ITS BACKING OF ROE VS. WADE  RULING AND TO ADOPT A NEUTRAL POSITION. ACTION IS DUE WEDNESDAY.  </P> <P> A closely divided American Bar Assn. membership on Monday urged its governing  body to repeal a six-month old policy that endorses a woman's right to choose  to have an abortion.  </P> <P> On a vote of 885 to 837, the lawyers recommended that the nation's largest  legal group drop its support for abortion rights and adopt instead a neutral  position that is "neither pro-life nor pro-choice."  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the 461-member House of Delegates will meet to vote on the ABA's  abortion policy.  </P> <P> In February, the delegates had decided by a narrow 20-vote margin in Los  Angeles to adopt an official policy on the abortion issue. Then the delegates  voted, 238 to 106, in favor of the right to choose abortion.  </P> <P> Women's rights advocates saw the ABA stand as an important asset as lawmakers  in many states were about to reconsider restrictions on abortion. Within the  ABA, the new abortion rights policy was seen as evidence that women and younger  lawyers were playing a greater role in a group long dominated by gray-haired  men.  </P> <P> But many lawyers, women as well as men, branded the new policy as a mistake for  the organization and a moral outrage to them as individuals. For months, they  sought support to overturn the policy, and on Monday they took a major step.  </P> <P> "This vote demonstrates how divisive this issue is," said Anthony Palermo, a  Rochester, N. Y., attorney who sponsored the neutrality resolution. The 48-vote  victory in the open assembly Monday showed that most lawyers favor a neutral  stand on such a contentious and personal issue, he said, adding that he is  "very optimistic" the abortion-rights policy will be overturned.  </P> <P> During debate at the convention, supporters of the current policy said that the  ABA should not take a "vow of silence" on controversial legal questions, but  rather should stand firm in behalf of individual and civil rights.  </P> <P> "We were not 'neutral' about race discrimination. We should not be 'neutral'  now on women's rights to reproductive freedom," said Roberta Ramo, an attorney  from Albuquerque.  </P> <P> Backers of the abortion-rights policy accused their opponents of having "packed  the meeting" Monday afternoon and said that the outcome should not influence  the delegates' vote on Wednesday.  </P> <P> "This was a very close vote. It sends no real signal" about the thinking of  most ABA members on the abortion issue, said Sally Determan, a Washington  lawyer who sponsored the original abortion-rights policy. "We are still  confident the House of Delegates is with us."  </P> <P> Before Monday's vote, Determan and other supporters of the abortion policy said  that a reversal of it this week will be seen nationwide as a "repudiation" of  the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade ruling that made abortion legal.  </P> <P> If the House of Delegates fails to overturn the abortion-rights policy  Wednesday, opponents can challenge it again in another open assembly. If they  can muster a two-thirds vote against the policy then, the matter would be  decided by ballots sent to all 360,000 ABA members.  </P> <P> Earlier Monday, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh put in a plug for the proposed  "neutral" policy on abortion. He noted that an ABA committee will meet  privately and pass judgment on the qualifications of U.S. Judge David H.  Souter, President Bush's nominee to the Supreme Court. Though conceding that he  has "seen no evidence" of bias by the ABA, Thornburgh said that it "creates a  perception problem" for the organization to have an official policy in support  of abortion rights.  </P></p>

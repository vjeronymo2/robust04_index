			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Brussels by correspondent Nacho Hernandez] </F>   [Excerpt] [Hernandez] For the Spanish authorities there  must be a warning to the Serbs so that they will lift the siege  of Sarajevo. For Foreign Minister Javier Solana the solution to  the conflict in Bosnia is not military, although he has faith in  the deterrent effects of a decision within NATO.    [Begin Solana recording] So that those responsible for the  massacres of the last few days will receive an unequivocal  signal from the Atlantic alliance of its readiness to raise the  siege of Sarajevo. And I believe I can tell you that I believe  there will be a sufficient consensus today within the Atlantic  alliance and within the European Union for a clear, firm  decision to be taken with regard to Sarajevo. [end recording]    [Hernandez] A formula could be sought for Sarajevo to be  defined as a UN-protected zone. The foreign minister confirmed  that there are measures to protect the troops, relocating them  according to the proximity of the danger -- we mean the UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Forces] forces which are now carrying out  humanitarian aid work in Yugoslavia. We must cooperate, the  foreign minister said, to end the siege of Sarajevo. In his  opinion there is a sufficient consensus to make a decision and  give a forceful response. [passage omitted]</p>

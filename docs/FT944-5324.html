			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: Picture magic - The power of make-believe On Christmas day, when computer games bore, the board game ends in tears, the sweets induce nausea and grown-ups snore in front of the television, what could be more enjoyable than discovering other worlds inside a new picture book? Badger's Bring-Something Party, written by Hiawyn Oram and illustrated by Susan Varley (Andersen Press, Pounds 8.99), is a brilliant combination of pictures and words. Mole has nothing to take to badger's bring-something party - except himself. When the other animals belittle him, Mole is ridden with guilt and shame, but finally wins them over just by being himself. One is inevitably reminded of EH Shepard by Susan Varley's gentle line and wash illustrations which perfectly complement Hiawyn Oram's wonderfully subtle text. The standard of illustration in children's picture books is high, but it is almost impossible to find picture book texts that come anywhere near that standard. Too often they read like short stories, or are self-consciously poetic, excruciatingly cosy, or just bland. Of all the picture books published this year this is one of the very few in which the text is at least on a par with the pictures. And they work perfectly together. Rosalee and the Great Fire of London, written and illustrated by Catherine Brighton (Jonathan Cape, Pounds 8.99), tells the strange and exciting story of how Rosalee and her pet pig, Roger Bacon, escape the clutches of a mysterious, evil man who inadvertently starts the Great Fire. The stunning watercolour paintings are the stars of this book as we follow the heroine's flight against magnificent backdrops of 17th century London in flames. The text is perhaps a little over-written, sometimes telling us what we can see in the pictures. But what pictures . . . Doing Christmas by Sarah Garland (Bodley Head, Pounds 7.99), shows a frazzled single parent family's preparations for Christmas, and the arrival of an exuberant granny. The text is minimal, and the downbeat understated illustrations carry most of the story with sly and subtle humour. Both parents and children will see much that they can identify with in this deceptively simple book. The Shop of Ghosts adapted from an original story by GK Chesterton and illustrated by Tony Ross (Andersen Press, Pounds 8.99) is a superbly illustrated version of an unfamiliar Christmas tale. Grandad tells the story of a Christmas long ago when he was a boy and found a magical toy shop. Inside was a sad Father Christmas who told the boy that he was dying. Visitors from the past, Charles Dickens, Shakespeare, Robin Hood and King Charles II, entered the shop and all recalled that in their day he had been dying, too. Tony Ross brings this rather odd, touching story vibrantly alive with brilliant use of colour and design. The pictures achieve a sense of modernity combined with a nostalgic atmosphere that owes nothing to pastiche. The Happy Prince, from the fairy tale by Oscar Wilde and illustrated by Jane Ray (Orchard Books Pounds 8.99), is another re-telling of the well-known story of a friendship between the statue of the Happy Prince and the swallow on his way to Egypt for the winter. What makes this version special are Jane Ray's magnificently sumptuous, jewel-like paintings. I would have preferred rather more contrast between rich and poor, warm and cold (perhaps less gold ink on some spreads?) but this is quibbling: the book is a very beautiful object. The Big Big Sea written by Martin Waddell and illustrated by Jennifer Eachus (Walker Books, Pounds 7.99) is the brief glimpse of a magical moment - a mother and daughter's moonlit walk by the sea. This idea steers dangerously near the self-consciously precious but Martin Waddell clearly understands how picture books work and his simple text in combination with the delicate photographic drawings make an exquisite visual poem.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev [no dateline as received] -- Responding to a  request by a UNIAN correspondent to comment on the Ukrainian  presidential edict on urgent measures to return to Ukraine hard  currency valuables that are illegally held abroad and on the  fight against speculation, Oleksandr Suhonyako, president of the  Association of Ukrainian banks, said on 22 June: "This edict is  a great deal more significant for the president's pre-election  fight than for the economy. People who have hard currency are  not so naive as to obey the edict and return the hard currency  to Ukraine. This is an issue that confronts us all today. At  present, according to various facts, there is up to $20 billion  that belongs to Ukraine. No edict will be able to return these  funds. They will be returned on the condition that those who  own the funds receive guarantees that the capital will remain  theirs. There should be a state guarantee that nobody will take  an interest in how the owners obtained these funds. If we give  such a guarantee then the money will be made to work for us. If  we attempt to find out whether the money is dirty, gray, or  white then we will do so until the end of the world."    In an interview with a UNIAN correspondent, Vasyl Durdynets,  first deputy chairman of the Coordinating Committee for the  Fight Against Corruption and Organized Crime noted that the  aforementioned edict of the Ukrainian president "is of a  principled significance for our state." He noted the importance  of setting up concrete time-limits, both for declaring hard  currency valuables that are held abroad (10 days) and for  transferring them to Ukraine (one month). Durdynets stressed  the importance of the fact that if the regulations of the edict  in respect of businesses are carried out then sanctions will not  be applied and their directors and officials will not be brought  to book. "This edict gives law breakers the possibility to  atone for their sins and to fulfill their duties toward the  state," noted Durdynets, adding that if the regulations are  ignored other legal norms and laws would come into effect and he  gave assurances that the law enforcement bodies would then act  more decisively.    With regard to the edict of the Ukrainian president on the  fight against speculation, Durdynets gave assurances that the  coordinating committee -- of which he is chairman -- that will  supervise the implementation of this, will conduct steadfast  supervision over the implementation of all its provisions. "I  want Ukrainian citizens to understand that our actions are  directed at protecting their rights as consumers," noted  Durdynets.</p>

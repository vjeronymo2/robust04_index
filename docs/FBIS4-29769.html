			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 17 (YONHAP) -- U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher, referring to former President Jimmy  Carter's reported statement that Washington has suspended its  bid to apply sanctions against North Korea, said Friday "it is  different" from Washington's official position.    A high-ranking official at the South Korean Embassy in  Washington disclosed that Christopher conveyed the U.S.  Government's position to the South Korean Government through  Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord.    Christopher said the United States would continue  consultations on sanctions against Pyongyang at the U.N.  Security Council until it became apparent that North Korea had  frozen its nuclear development program.    Meanwhile, South Korean Ambassador to Washington Han Sung-su  met with Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci to  exchange views on American policy toward North Korea, which  seems muddled after Carter's recent statement in Pyongyang.    At the meeting, Gallucci was quoted by the high-ranking  official as stressing that "Carter's statement in Pyongyang is  not the official position of America."</p>

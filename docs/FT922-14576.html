			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Economics Notebook: Finland keeps a wary eye on the markka It will not be a normal Monday morning in Helsinki today. For when Finland's financial markets open up for trade, politicians and bankers alike will be keenly watching the currency and interest rate movements to see whether the emergency economic package announced this weekend will be sufficient to avert a forced devaluation of the Finnish markka and restore confidence in the markets and the centre-right government. Financial markets are notoriously sensitive to political and economic instability, and Finland is no exception. When Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister, said recently he thought the Bank of Finland was partly to blame for mistakes in monetary policy and for the problems which have hit the Finnish banking sector, the comments did not go down well at the central bank. Mr Rolf Kullberg, the governor, appeared on television and made it clear all decisions had taken place with the co-operation of the government. The public tiff between the central bank and the government did little to calm the financial markets, and Mr Kullberg announced late last Thursday that he would leave the bank on July 1. The move hit the foreign exchange and fixed income markets when they opened for trade on Friday. Short-term interest rates shot up, from 12.85 per cent to 16.76 per cent in the case of one-month Helibor rates. Estimates of the amount of capital which flooded out of the country on Friday ranged from FM5bn (Pounds 642m) to FM10bn. By mid-afternoon, some banks in Finland had halted foreign exchange transactions and were refusing even to change travellers' cheques following speculation that the Markka could be devalued for the second time in less than six months. There was even speculation that the government would be forced to resign. Both the Bank of Finland and the government responded swiftly - if somewhat clumsily - to the crisis. The bank, which originally said Ms Sirkka Hamalainen would take over as governor on July 1, announced at a hastily called press conference yesterday that it would be better if she took over immediately. Meanwhile, the government launched an emergency rescue package, promising government spending cuts of FM10 bn, mainly in pensions and child and sickness benefits. The decision should at least convince Finns and foreigners alike that the government is committed to cutting its heavy borrowing requirement, although it cannot solve some of the other problems facing the Finnish economy. When Mr Aho came to power last April he inherited an economy already in recession. During 1992, the recession deepened and Finland's GDP declined 6.1 per cent. About half the fall in GDP is attributed to the collapse in trade with the former Soviet Union, once an important partner for Finland. However, the economic and social problems faced by the former Soviet Union, and the ending of bilateral trade between the two countries at the end of 1990 cut Finnish-Soviet trade by about 65 per cent in value in 1991. By the end of last year, exports to the Soviet Union accounted for less than 5 per cent of Finland's total exports, compared with 26 per cent in 1985. Trade with the Soviet Union benefited large and small Finnish companies: the large capital-intensive industries, for example in ship-building, engineering and forestry, won large orders, while small and medium-sized companies benefited as subcontractors. Now, with many of the republics which once made up the Soviet Union on the verge of poverty, the prospect of a recovery in trade is unlikely. Even the 260 or so joint ventures set up by Finnish companies with Soviet partners are no substitute, according to a recent report by the Bank of Finland, since many of them are expected to take several years before they are fully operational. The problem for Finnish exporters is that other markets have not been able to take up the slack: the recession in the US and Europe - particularly in the important UK and Swedish markets - meant demand for Finnish goods from these areas remained weak. At home, high interest rates have discouraged many debt-burdened companies and households from spending. Private consumption fell 5 per cent, and investment 16 per cent last year. With weak demand at home and abroad, more than 6,000 companies went bankrupt last year, nearly double the level in 1990, and a record for Finland. The collapse of so many businesses hit the banks: they have suffered from record loan losses and have seen a sharp increase in non-performing loans. As a result, most banks reported losses in 1991 and the government was forced to announce measures earlier this year to prop up the banking sector. Public sector spending accelerated last year, boosted by a rise in unemployment to 10 per cent, while tax revenue declined, leading to a deterioration in government finances. The current account deficit reached FM23.4bn last year, boosted by interest payments on foreign debt. As Finland's economic problems worsened in 1991, the Bank of Finland came under pressure to devalue the currency to improve competitiveness. Worries about wage settlements led to a sharp outflow of currency last autumn, and eventually forced a devaluation in November, when the external value of the markka was allowed to fall by 12.3 per cent. The devaluation prompted two senior central bankers to resign and led Mr Kullberg to offer his resignation to the Finnish president, who asked him to stay on. At the time the government denied there would be a devaluation, which is why, some cynics point out, the government is struggling to convince the markets this time there is no chance of another devaluation. And that is why everyone will wait for this morning's opening.</p>

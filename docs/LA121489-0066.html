			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT ISN'T TOO LATE TO INVITE FRIENDS TO SHARE A HOLIDAY MEAL . . . IF YOU SETTLE  FOR A SIMPLE MENU.  </P> <P> At last! Everything is in place. The house is decorated to your satisfaction  with the family's favorite glitter and Christmas ornaments; it smells of pine  boughs and spicy holiday-scented potpourri and looks wonderfully warm and  welcoming. But, now that it's all ready to be admired, there's no one around to  enjoy it but you and yours.  </P> <P> Bummer!  </P> <P> So have a party. Not a big party, mind you. It's a little late to be planning a  major do-it-yourself production before the holidays. But there's plenty of time  to share some Christmas cheer and good, simple food with close friends, if you  choose a menu based on easily prepared foods.  </P> <P> With old-fashioned home cooking enjoying a resurgence in popularity, simple  meals are in fashion these days. Meat loaves, potatoes, stews and other solid,  dependable foods are definitely trendy. And most of these wonderful, old-style  foods are now as much at home on a party table as glitzy hummingbirds' tongues  used to be.  </P> <P> There are many advantages to this trend toward simpler, less complicated meals.  Most recipes for foods of this sort call for ordinary, readily available  ingredients. What makes them special depends on you. How daring are you when it  comes to varying the seasonings, and how creative are you in presenting them?  </P> <P> Consider meat loaf, for instance. It doesn't have to start with hamburger, and  it doesn't have to be baked in a loaf pan. Instead, make it with ground lamb  and season it with water chestnuts, oregano and a hint of green chile. Then  gussy up your presentation by forming the mixture into a crescent shape and  baking it with a batch of potato rounds seasoned with garlic. In just about an  hour you'll have an upscale meat and potatoes meal that should delight family  and friends alike.  </P> <P> Another meat and potatoes meal that uses familiar ingredients Grandma would  easily recognize is a ham and sweet potato combination that sports some 1989  seasonings and techniques. The ham is used in a sweet-and-sour stir-fry sauce  that is spooned over baked sweet potatoes. It's an easy, no-fuss main dish that  visually whets the appetite when you invite your guests to the table.  </P> <P> Another simple party dish that's sure to please company is our Sole and  Macadamia Roll-Ups. Ground macadamia nuts and green onions are used as a  filling for the rolled-up sole fillets and additional nuts are sprinkled on  top. The result is a wonderful quick and easy main dish that is suitable for  many an occasion.  </P> <P> With all the foregoing suggestions and most of the others given today, a salad,  some hot bread and an ice cream sundae or possibly a store-bought dessert will  round things out nicely, providing a delicious, hassle-free dinner party that  even the host can enjoy.  </P> <P> LAMB LOAF  </P> <P> 2 pounds ground lamb  </P> <P> 1 (8-ounce) can sliced water chestnuts, drained and chopped  </P> <P> 1 clove garlic, minced  </P> <P> 1/2 cup chopped onion  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon crushed oregano  </P> <P> 1/4 cup fresh bread crumbs  </P> <P> 2 eggs  </P> <P> 1 (4-ounce) can whole green chiles, drained  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> 2 to 3 unpeeled potatoes, cut into wedges  </P> <P> Garlic salt  </P> <P> Yogurt mixed with minced mint leaves, optional  </P> <P> Combine ground lamb, water chestnuts, garlic, onion, oregano, bread crumbs and  eggs in bowl.

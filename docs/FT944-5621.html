			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Royal Bank at Pounds 532m and staff gets Pounds 25m Staff of Royal Bank of Scotland are to receive an average of Pounds 1,100 from a profit-sharing scheme after the bank yesterday disclosed more than doubled pre-tax profits of Pounds 532m in the year to September 30. The bank's shares closed 20p down at 400p on concern at growth in expenses in the UK bank because of investment in technology. There were also continuing worries about slower growth at Direct Line, its insurance arm. The bank is to distribute Pounds 25m, or 8.2 per cent of basic salaries, among 23,000 eligible staff. Lord Younger, chairman, said it was 'a demonstration of gratitude to staff for a very positive year of hard work.' The proposed final dividend of 9.75p gives a 25 per cent rise in the total for the year from 11p to 13.75p. Earnings per share rose from 15.8p to 41.4p, and pre-tax return on equity rose from 17.3 per cent to 35.6 per cent. Acquisitions by US subsidiary Citizens helped to lower the overall ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets from 12.2 per cent to 10.6 per cent, while the core tier 1 capital ratio fell from 6.9 per cent to 6.4 per cent. Mr George Mathewson, chief executive, said capital ratios could be lower because improved risk management had made its loan portfolio less volatile, and it had diversified income. There was adequate capital for ongoing businesses. But Mr Mathewson indicated that the bank might raise capital from shareholders if it wanted to grow by acquisition, reiterating that the bank was interested in buying a UK building society if it was 'the right society at the right price.' He said it would not make a counter-bid for the Leeds Permanent Building Society to disrupt its proposed merger with Halifax, but there were few incentives for managers of other profitable societies to seek acquisition by a bank. Provisions for bad debts fell from Pounds 293m to Pounds 187m. Pre-tax profits included an exceptional items of Pounds 52m profit on the sale of a holding in the venture capital group 3i, and Pounds 21m paid to Mr Peter Wood, chief executive of Direct Line. Non-interest income grew by 27 per cent from Pounds 677m to Pounds 862m because of higher tariffs on current accounts, commitment and facility fees and insurance commissions. But treasury income fell because of difficulty in volatile markets. COMMENT Royal Bank's plea that its investments in infrastructure and technology will bear fruit in future income, while Direct Line can avoid the trap of cyclicality in general insurance, have fallen on deaf ears. The market has started to mark down the premium in its earnings multiple, believing that 25 per cent dividend growth cannot be sustained. The fall in shares this week has brought it back to a prospective multiple of about 8.8 times earnings per share of 45p. Income pressure make it unlikely that a higher multiple is justified.</p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Cuba to offer oil licences OIL-STARVED Cuba, which is trying to develop its domestic oil deposits, will next month offer 11 onshore and offshore blocks for exploration and development by foreign companies, Reuter reports from Havana. It will be the first international tender of its kind by Cuba, which has suffered severe oil shortages since the collapse of its preferential trade links with the former Soviet Union. The Cuban state oil company Cubapetroleo (Cupet) announced that the tender inviting bids would be officially presented in Calgary and London on February 10 and 17 respectively. On offer for production sharing contracts were seven onshore and three offshore blocks, with one block straddling land and sea. Foreign oil companies had until August 1 to present their bids. A British company, Simon Petroleum Technology, would help organise the tender. Cupet officials said the blocks were in various parts of the island, including one in the western province of Pinar del Rio and another in south-eastern Granma province. These were areas which were either unexplored or where past exploration data were now out of date, the officials said. A second tender offering more exploration blocks was planned for later. Over the past two years, Cuba has awarded contracts for seven exploration blocks.</p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Arts: Dancing into difficulties - American ballet companies are losing their way Last December The Red Shoes, a musical comedy based on the world's most famous ballet movie, opened and closed on Broadway. It says something about the current state of ballet in New York that, a few months later, both of our major ballet companies were found serving up the funeral meats cold. At American Ballet Theatre, one of the spring season's featured offerings - indeed, a trumpeted event, with five performances added ('by popular demand') before it even opened - was the silly little ballet that the modern dance choreographer Lar Lubovitch had created for that musical. Meanwhile, the star of The Red Shoes, Margaret Illmann of the National Ballet of Canada, apparently no sooner got back to Toronto and fed her cat than she got a call from New York City Ballet. Not to be outdone in the Red Shoes salvage department, NYCB invited her to dance three guest performances during the spring season. A glamorous past, an aimless present feeding off that past while trying to figure out whether there is going to be any future - that, right now, is the story of ballet in New York. In addition to The Red Shoes, ABT dredged up Antony Tudor's 1963 Echoing of Trumpets, a highly sensationalist anti-war ballet (Nazis, gang rape on point) and produced James Kudelka's Cruel World (to Tchaikovsky's 'Souvenir de Florence'), a highly sensationalist new ballet not about war but about how many slam-bang gymnastic pas de deux  - with the woman spun, swung, flung, caught at the last possible second - you can pack into one ballet. Six, as I recall. But the major event of ABT's season was a new Nutcracker, choreographed by company director Kevin McKenzie to a libretto by playwright Wendy Wasserstein (The Sisters Rosensweig). Like so many Nutcracker-revisers, Wasserstein has made the ballet more rational, more up-to-date. But above all what she has done is make it more complicated. This ballet has things no Nutcracker has ever needed before: unicorns, Jewish jokes, four ballerinas. Meanwhile, the things a Nutcracker does need  -a tree that grows, a battle that starts with the battle music, a party scene where you can tell who the mother is - it doesn't have. Nor are there any interesting dances. The big duet for Clara and her Nutcracker is an almost comically ungainly number. The night I was there, the excellent dancers Ashley Tuttle and Gil Boggs looked as though they were afraid they were going to be killed. While ABT invested most of its resources in this big, bad production, New York City Ballet put its eggs in twelve little baskets. In 1992, the company staged a festival called the Diamond Project, in which various choreographers were asked to stage new ballets on a low budget. This year, the Diamond Project was revived - the company now says it will be a biennial event - and, as before, a great range of choreographers were invited, veterans and tyros, company insiders (Damian Woetzel, Miriam Mahdaviani, Robert LaFosse, Richard Tanner, Peter Martins) and outsiders also (Kevin O'Day, Trey McIntyre, David Allan, Ulysses Dove, Lynn Taylor-Corbett, Anna Laerkesen, John Allyne). Basically, they produced two kinds of ballets. One was the complication ballet, favoured by the company insiders - a ballet in which classical steps are cut up into a thousand details, a thousand little prettinesses, in the hope, it seems, of distracting the audience from the question of what it all means. The complication ballet is descended from one aspect of George Balanchine's work, as reinterpreted by his successor as NYCB director, Peter Martins, and it was Martins's contribution to the Diamond Project, Mozart Piano Concerto, that provided the purest example. In the slow movement, the principal dancers had so many niceties to cope with - turns tilted and twisted and embellished and reversed halfway through - that they could barely dance. This was not a ballet; it was a teacup - Louis XV. More popular with the audience was the genre favoured by the outsider choreographers: the alienation ballet. This, too, I believe, is descended from Balanchine - from his stark 'leotard' ballets - but remotely. Its true father is William Forsythe, the American choreographer who has had such a success in Europe. In any case, what it looks like is a Calvin Klein advertisement. To jarring music (Bartok, electric violins) stylish-looking young people stand around in unitards looking sexy and disaffected. Occasionally, they dance with each other; often they dance alone, and then get bored and walk off stage. A few promising pieces issued from these unpromising molds - Miriam Mahdaviani's Correlazione, Richard Tanner's Episodes &amp; Sarcasms, Kevin O'Day's Viola Alone - but that is three out of 12, and all three needed more work. In a ballet world nearly void of interesting new choreography, the Diamond Project sounds like a good idea - throw everybody into the pool, see who swims - but perhaps it isn't. With so many choreographers, each is given too small an honour, too small a challenge, and this may have contributed to the extreme conventionality of their works. The company would probably be better served by operating in the usual way: commissioning two or three works and thus placing serious bets. Apart from its general mediocrity, what struck one about the new ballet choreography this spring was how very difficult it was. Dancers pirouetted with their legs crossed; they somersaulted off their partners' shoulders; they sweated and gasped. These are not the kinds of exertions that keep ballet companies in shape. Both ABT and NYCB are fielding some thrilling young dancers - notably, Ethan Stiefel and Jennifer Ringer at NYCB and Paloma Herrera and Ashley Tuttle at ABT - at the same time that general company standards are falling. In a recent performance of Balanchine's Mozartiana at NYCB, the four woman corps moved as if through custard. For this situation, various reasons have been advanced, including the death of Balanchine and other revered masters. ('All our icons in the dance have pretty much passed on,' ABT principal Cheryl Yeager said in a recent interview with Dance Magazine. 'We don't have to cut off our heads to be ballet dancers any more.') The decline will only be hastened, however, if choreographers, looking for something striking to do, create steps so difficult that they cannot shape or phrase them - in effect, cannot dance them - but only hope to get through them somehow.</p>

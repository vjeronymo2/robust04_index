			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Carmakers surprised by 20% jump in registrations Registrations of new cars in Britain jumped by 20 per centyear-on-year in January as the recovery in demand grew ahead of industry forecasts. Registrations totalled 198,525 compared with 164,939 in the samemonth a year ago, according to figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Sales last month were the highest for January since 1990 but were still below the record level of 220,000 reached in January 1989. Sales of new cars rose 11.6 per cent last year to 1.78m, ending three years of recession. Most industry forecasts suggest a further rise of between 5 per cent and 6 per cent in the whole of 1994. Demand remains weak in the commercial vehicle sector, where registrations in January rose year-on-year by only 1.3 per cent to 17,642, chiefly under the impact of depressed light-van sales. Sales of commercial vehicles fell overall last year by 2.1 per centto 197,067, the fourth successive annual decline, although a significant recovery is under way in the truck sector. In the car market, Ford and Vauxhall, the market leaders, both started the year strongly, and Citroen, Nissan and Mercedes-Benz also outperformed the market. The planned takeover of Rover by BMW will push the German carmaker into third place in the UK car market. In January the combined forces of the two groups captured 15 per cent of UK new-car sales compared with 16 per cent a year earlier. Citroen achieved its highest monthly share yet with 6.6 per cent. As a single marque it moved into fourth place in the UK market for the first time behind Ford, Vauxhall and Rover but ahead of Peugeot, traditionally the dominant make in the PSA Peugeot Citroen groupof France. The fortunes of Mercedes-Benz of Germany have been boosted bythe launch in the second half of last year of its C-class executive car. Its total sales were 48 per cent higher than in the same month a year previously. Several Japanese carmakers, notably Toyota, Mitsubishi and Mazda, lost groundheavily last month, and all suffered steep declines in sales volumes in spite of the strong growth in the overall market. Vauxhall, General Motors' UK subsidiary, is putting up most of its car and light commercial vehicle prices frommidnight tomorrow by an average of 2.3 per cent. The prices of its Cavalier and Carlton models are being held until March 6 in order 'to allow company car drivers to minimise their tax liability'.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS January 1994  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Volume      Volume   Share (%)   Share (%)                        (Units)   Change(%)      Jan 94      Jan 93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET           198,525       +20.4       100.0       100.0 UK-produced             89,980       +20.9        45.3        45.1 Imports                108,545       +19.9        54.7        54.9 Japanese makes          20,399       +10.4        10.3        11.2 MANUFACTURERS: Ford group              49,322       +35.4        24.8        22.1  -Ford                  48,520       +35.8        24.4        21.7  -Jaguar                   802       +14.9         0.4         0.4 General Motors          36,574       +27.6        18.4        17.4  -Vauxhall              35,664       +28.9        18.0        16.8  -Saab*                    910        -7.6         0.5         0.6 BMW group**             29,745       +12.3        15.0        16.0  -Rover***              24,876       +10.7        12.5        13.6  -BMW                    4,869       +20.8         2.5         2.4 Peugeot group           25,771        +7.0        13.0        14.6  -Peugeot               12,652        -6.7         6.4         8.2  -Citroen               13,119       +24.7         6.6         6.4 Renault****             10,761       +20.2         5.4         5.4 Volkswagen group        10,733       +19.5         5.4         5.5  -Volkswagen             6,989       +13.9         3.5         3.7  -Audi                   1,956        -7.0         1.0         1.3  -SEAT                     875       +52.2         0.4         0.4  -Skoda*****               913      +433.9         0.5         0.1 Nissan                   9,759       +50.3         4.9         3.9 Fiat group               3,982       +16.0         2.0         2.1  -Fiat                   3,813       +19.2         1.9         1.9  -Alfa Romeo               134       -24.3         0.1         0.1  -Lancia                    35       -38.6         0.0         0.0 Mercedes-Benz            3,797       +47.6         1.9         1.6 Toyota                   3,776        -8.5         1.9         2.5 Volvo****                3,611        -8.4         1.8         2.4 Honda**                  2,375       +10.3         1.2         1.3 Mazda                    1,480       -35.0         0.8         1.4  -----------------------------------------------------------------------     * GM holds 50% of Saab Automobile and has management control.    ** BMW is buying an 80 per cent stake in Rover vehicle operations.

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: Royal Bank of Canada profits flat ROYAL Bank of Canada, the largest of Canada's big six chartered banks, yesterday reported little-changed net profits for the first quarter. The bank, which is negotiating the acquisition of the trust operations of Royal Trustco, recorded net profit for the quarter of CDollars 254m (USDollars 211m), or 71 cents a share, in the first quarter of fiscal 1993. This compares with CDollars 256m, or 73 cents, a year earlier. There were more shares outstanding in the latest period. Lower non-interest expense and larger payments received on Brazilian loans were offset by higher domestic loan loss provisions and lower fee income. Loan loss provisions totalled CDollars 295m, increased significantly to cover problems in the corporate sector. A year earlier, the provision was CDollars 185m. The bank now estimates provisions for fiscal 1993 at CDollars 820m, up CDollars 120m on the estimate at October 31 last. Return on average assets was 0.73 per cent, against 0.76 per cent, and on equity 14.8 per cent against 14.5 per cent. Total assets at January 31 were CDollars 137bn, up 2 per cent from a year earlier. If the Royal Trustco acquisition is consummated, the deal would bring the bank's total assets to nearly CDollars 200bn. The Toronto commercial property market deteriorated further in the latest quarter, but retail banking, investment banking, treasury and investment management performed as planned. BANKS will refinance about Dollars 326m of term debt of Camdev, the former Campeau Corporation property group. The banks have agreed to roll-over existing loans to Camdev for up to four years, secured by Camdev stock in a profitable US regional grocery chain and office properties in Ottawa and London, Ontario. BANK of Nova Scotia reported first-quarter net profit of CDollars 165m, or 70 cents a share, down about 5 per cent from CDollars 174m, or 76 cents, a year earlier. Return on assets was 0.65 per cent against 0.77 per cent and on equity 14.6 per cent against 16.9 per cent. Total assets at January 31 were CDollars 98bn, up nearly 5 per cent.</p>

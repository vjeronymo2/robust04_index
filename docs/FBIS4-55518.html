			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Xh. Rexhepi: "Why Lambast Hogg?"] </F>   [Text] As we know, Douglas Hogg, secretary of state and  the British Foreign Office's number two, paid an official visit  to Kosova last week. As the public has been informed at length,  he talked here with both the Albanian and Serbian sides about  solving the problem of Kosova. Regardless of how this visit was  reported and judged, diplomatic circles appreciated it as an  important effort by British diplomacy toward solving the serious  crisis in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, testing the  pulse for possible Albanian-Serbian dialogue for the solution to  the question of Kosova, to which international bodies are  increasingly committed.    However, in spite of this and regardless of the  exceptionally  serious and complicated nature of the subject under discussion,  Serbian propaganda has not even spared this British diplomat  abuse and distortion of his statements, for the sake of Serbian  policy toward Kosova and the Albanians. This does not surprise  anybody, because this is standard practice in the controlled  Serbian media. Anti-Albanianism and hatred of Albanian culture  and history have become a proof of "professional" standards in  the hysterical anti-Albanian competition.    As always, the Serbian rulers installed in Kosova have not  lagged behind. Simovic, the "local sheriff" [nacallniku i  okrugut], warned two days ago that he would call a halt to the  activities of what he called "Rugova's party," meaning the  Kosova Democratic Alliance [LDK]. According to him, the reason  for this lies in the fact that this party is not registered in  Serbia (!). In order to back up this threat that has long been  trumpeted by assorted sections of the Serbian establishment, he  even misused the high-level British diplomat Douglas Hogg,  ascribing to him amazement over "why the LDK is not registered  in Serbia and how it can operate without this."    How far this canard will run Simovic alone knows. However,  regarding the aim of such a threat, the Albanian and  international public know very well and have heard many times  that it is the Serbian police and judicial system that are doing  most to obstruct the work of the LDK, the largest and most  influential party in Kosova, and have done since its foundation.  The fact that not a day goes by without maltreatment of this  party's activists, many of whom are being held in prison, are  detained for what are called informative discussions, and are  obstructed in their legal political work shows that the LDK is a  thorn in the flesh of Great-Serbian circles in Kosova and  Serbia. It is for this reason that both the ruling Socialists  and the ultranationalists of the Arkan and Seselj kind hold  forth against it with the same enthusiasm. Both sides  accumulate points among their own electorates with their stands  against Kosova and the Albanians and threats toward the LDK, the  president of the Republic of Kosova, and the republic's other  legitimate representatives.    Viewed from this angle, Simovic's statement contains nothing  new and would not deserve comment. However, that fact that it  was made after the discussions that Hogg held in Kosova once  again exposes the reality that the Serbian establishment does  not wish to involve the real political forces and the legitimate  authorities of the Albanian people in Kosova, led by Dr. Ibrahim  Rugova, president of the republic, in the inevitable  Albanian-Serbian talks. For this reason, it is these forces  that are most attacked and threatened both by ruling Serbian  circles and those who support and assist these circles in the  anti-Albanian hysteria.    However, despite such a savage campaign against the  legitimate representatives of the Albanians in Kosova, Serbian  circles have been informed umpteen times, not only by the LDK  and the president of Kosova, but by other Albanian political  parties in Kosova, that only Kosova's legitimate representatives  can decide Kosova's destiny. As we know, this legitimacy was  achieved by the will of the people in the first multiparty  elections in Kosova two years ago. Thus, beyond this legitimacy  and the political will of the people expressed in the referendum  of September 1991, nobody has a mandate to decide on Kosova, as  Kosova's political parties and legitimate representatives have  said many times. However, it seems that from now on this must  be said more often and with more insistence.</p>

"We can  encourage this process by lessening legislative differences," he  told journalists on Monday after a meeting with Kazakh President  Nursultan Nazarbayev in the Kremlin residence.    "We parliamentarians should prevent the legislations of our  two countries, Russia and Kazakhstan, from getting too different  from each other, so that it would be difficult to unify them  later," Rybkin pointed out. He expressed the opinion that  "political approaches to closer cooperation, to cooperation on  the basis of equal rights and mutual respect for the sovereignty  of the two countries are not far away. But, let me repeat, the  path to that lies through cooperation in the sphere of economy."  This was the main issue of the conversation with Nursultan  Nazarbayev, Rybkin said.</p>

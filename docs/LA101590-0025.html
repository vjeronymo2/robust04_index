			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'GUNPLAY': LAST DAY IN BOY'S LIFE ON HBO  </P> <P> "Gunplay: The Last Day in the Life of Brian Darling," an intense, half-hour  drama premiering tonight at 8 on HBO, tells the true story of one of the  hundreds of children who die each year in the United States due to accidental  shootings.  </P> <P> The goal is to stimulate a dialogue about gun safety between parents and  children, and the story is simply told so that children will understand.  </P> <P> But that doesn't mean it's easy to watch: Before it starts, Brian's father,  John Darling, warns that children shouldn't see it alone. He's right.  </P> <P> The film, written by Bruce Harmon and directed by Daniel Taplitz, is a series  of ordinary events -- four young boys playing, teasing, coming home late from  the park, being scolded, eating dinner, watching TV, playing video games.  </P> <P> Parents are busy, distracted and impatient, but caring. Throughout, an unspoken  point is made that it's parental supervision, not love, that comes up short.  </P> <P> One boy, low man in his social hierarchy, is nervous about a recent  neighborhood robbery and skittish about night noises. Even if the title didn't  give it away, you'd know something dreadful was in store.  </P> <P> Still, even though knowing what's going to happen prematurely infuses the  ordinary with vague menace, the inevitable violent death comes as a shock.  </P> <P> The program carefully avoids being an anti-gun polemic. Afterward, John Darling  offers gun-safety tips for adults and children and tells parents, "Don't let  your kid disappear from your life the way Brian did from ours."  </P> <P> LYNNE HEFFLEY  </P></p>

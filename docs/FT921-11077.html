			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Economics Notebook: Tug-of-war starts over European central bank The battle to provide the home of the future European central bank is hotting up. The past few weeks have seen Mr Eddie George, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, pressing London's case and Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl, no less, taking up the cudgels for Frankfurt. Considering that Britain has not fully embraced the idea of economic and monetary union, Mr George's assertion that London's strength as an international financial centre makes it the 'logical' location for future European monetary institutions appears rather cheeky. In unguarded moments, Bank officials have conceded that the headquarters of the European central bank (ECB) may slip from their grasp. But they hope that the issue is politically too finely balanced for any of the big European financial centres, such as Frankfurt or Paris, to win. Instead they have consoled themselves with a second-best option: basing the ECB in a less prominent place such as Amsterdam or Lyons with the Bank of England in London acting as its 'operating arm'. The idea has a strong superficial appeal, not least because its advocates see a working model for such a structure in the US Federal Reserve System. At the centre of the Federal Reserve System is the Federal Reserve Board. Those who see London as the operating arm of a future European system of central banks take the reserve board as the model for the ECB with the Bank of England cast in the role of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The seven-member reserve board is based in Washington, a long way (in mentality, at least) from the financial markets of New York, Chicago and the US west coast. The reserve board staff acts as a think-tank for the system and helps inform the discussions of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy. The FOMC, which incidently gathers tomorrow and on Wednesday for the first of its eight meetings this year, comprises the reserve board's seven members and the president of the New York Fed as permanent members, and the presidents of four of the other 11 regional reserve banks, who serve on the FOMC in rotation. The Federal Reserve Board does not carry out the FOMC's monetary policy decisions. Instead, they are transmitted to the New York Fed which implements them through its domestic trading desk. The New York Fed is very clearly the 'operating arm' of the US central bank system. Its activities in the US domestic financial markets subtract from or add to the reserves of the US banking system and so determine the nation's interest rate structure. Over the years, the New York Fed has acquired other responsibilities that make it uniquely influential among the regional reserve banks. It acts as the agent for the US Treasury in foreign exchange intervention. It is a major participant in the US payments and settlements system, much of which is concentrated in New York. Because of this, it gets caught up in dealing with financial crises. It was, for example, closely involved in the damage limitation exercise on financial markets that followed the demise of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the junk bond securities house. The activities of the New York Fed seem very much like those of the Bank of England in the UK. But how relevant is the US example for the future European economic and monetary union? And can the Bank of England realistically aspire to influence on a par with that enjoyed by the New York Fed in the event of the ECB headquarters being placed outside London? Much will depend on the choice of location. If the ECB were to be based in Frankfurt, for example, it would be more likely to develop powerful centralising tendencies than if it were located in Luxembourg or Lyons. But some things are running in London's favour. Thanks to careful nurturing by the UK Treasury and Bank, London has emerged as the premier market dealing in the European currency unit and Ecu instruments. It is, along with New York and Tokyo, one of the three leading foreign exchange trading centres in the world. Foreign exchange market clout might seem of little consequence as the European Community moves towards adopting the Ecu as a single currency. But if present trading patterns are any guide, London would probably be the preferred centre for a future ECB to intervene with Ecu against other currencies such as the dollar, yen - or even a future convertible rouble. As Mr George pointed out last month, London trades a smaller proportion of national European currencies than are traded in other European foreign exchange markets, and a correspondingly higher proportion of non-EC currencies. On the other hand, London is nowhere near as dominant a financial centre in Europe as New York is in the US. Frankfurt and Paris are bigger in relation to London than Chicago and San Francisco in relation to New York. Although London has been developing its settlement and clearance systems, it has a long way to go before it can provide facilities on a continental scale. National practices will also persist long after Europe moves to a single monetary policy and currency. It is barely conceivable that French or German banks would move to London from Paris or Frankfurt to be supplied with central bank funds in the same way the US money centre banks are supplied with reserves by the New York Fed. The future European central bank system will therefore be more likely to have several rather than just one operating arm. Some of Europe's former national central banks may develop special responsibilities: foreign exchange intervention could perhaps be concentrated in London. But such developments will not come without a fight. That at least is the view of officials working on the structure of the ECB and its forerunner institute, the European Monetary Institute (EMI). Several were contacted last week and none of them believed that a single EC central bank, such as the Bank of England, could be designated the 'operating arm' for the system. This adds to the importance of the decision that EC leaders must make before the end of this year over where to put the EMI. The ECB is generally expected to be based in the same location as the EMI. Once the future home of the European central bank is decided, fierce competition will break out among the central banks in the 'losing' financial centres to secure as much influence as possible.</p>

			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: UK property Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton's days as governor of the Bank of England may be drawing to a close. But, judging by his musings on the reform of commercial property leases last week, he is using them to provoke uncharacteristic controversy. By criticising 'inflationary' upwards-only rent reviews, he questioned one of the property sector's most cherished practices. He was right to do so. The UK's antiquated terms for commercial leases desperately need reforming. But it would be unwise to neglect the risks involved in over-hasty action. As property developers never tire of pointing out, investors in bricks and mortar are primarily interested in security of income. Any reforms that lessen that security will have to be paid for in higher rents. That in itself would be inflationary. But lesser security would also discourage further property development. That is hardly a problem at present, but it too would be likely to stoke inflationary fires in an economic upswing when demand outstrips supply. The market itself seems to be working towards a half-way house. Twenty-five year leases with frequent break clauses for tenants are becoming common. These allow rents to be periodically reset to prevailing market prices. Tenants have greater flexibility, landlords some certainty of long term-term income. If the market could also develop greater transparency in setting rents, this might help flatten destructive cyclical swings.</p>

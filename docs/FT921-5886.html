			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Construction Contracts: Kwiksave's expansion on Merseyside Warwick Group Construction, the main contractor, has appointed Burton-based CONDER STRUCTURES, the superstructures division of Conder Group, to design and erect the superstructure for several new Kwiksave stores, including the steel frame, cladding and roof purlins. Features on some of the buildings included lightweight simulated roof tiles and a mansard arch - a hallmark of a Kwiksave store. The four new Merseyside stores are at Litherland, New Ferry, Wallasey and Bromborough and are all currently at varying stages of construction. In Newport, south Wales, Conder Structures' Bridgend office has also been responsible for the design, fabrication and erection of structural steel and cladding of Kwiksave's 11,542 sq metre multispan distribution warehouse. Kwiksave's original warehouse had been destroyed by fire and the company required a rapid response to avoid the obvious logistical problems that might have occurred. Total value to Conder Structures of all five contracts is about Pounds 1m.</p>

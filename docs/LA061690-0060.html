			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFEATED PRO-GOVERNMENT PARTY CALLS MYANMAR ELECTIONS A FRAUD  </P> <P> Myanmar's pro-government party, humiliated by an opposition landslide in last  month's army-run elections, has protested that the National League for  Democracy won by fraud, diplomats said Friday.  </P> <P> They said the complaint, lodged by the National Unity Party (NUP) with the  Election Commission on Thursday, has added to growing doubts about whether the  military government of Myanmar, formerly Burma, would accept the ballot results  and step down.  </P> <P> "It's just not clear whether this is sour grapes or some evil dark plan," said  one diplomat contacted by telephone. "But it helps to confuse an already  confused situation."  </P> <P> The army, which has controlled the government since crushing street protests in  1988, had pledged to hand power to the election winners.  </P> <P> But since the May 27 vote, it has hinted at delays in the transfer and said  nothing about the future of detained opposition leaders.  </P> <P> NUP, the political successor to the Burma Socialist Program Party, which ruled  the country during 28 years of isolation and rigid state control, has so far  won only six seats, compared to 329 for the National League for Democracy.  </P> <P> Diplomats said it was unclear whether the NUP complaint was sanctioned by the  army. A text of the complaint, which detailed alleged election fraud in several  constituencies, has not been carried in the official media.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with FDP Bundestag Group Chairman Hermann Otto </F> Solms by F. Weckbach-Mara; place and date not given: "Coalition  -- Fight Over Taxes Aggravating!"]    [Text] [Weckbach-Mara] Will the Free Democratic Party of  Germany [FDP] make its coalition statement in favor of the  Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU]  subject to any conditions?    [Solms] Yes. We will tell the voters in good time before  the elections which liberal principles are indispensable for us.    [Weckbach-Mara] What are the most important touchstones for  the FDP?    [Solms] It starts with simple issues, such as rejection of  the speed limit and of the increase in mineral oil taxes. We  are for, not against, cars. We demand more parking space to  prevent inner cities from depopulating, as well as a rapid  construction of roads running east-west, funded by private means  and by further measures.    [Weckbach-Mara] The FDP's demand to check the solidarity  surcharge after three years is unanimously rejected by the  CDU/CSU. Are you going to stick to this position?    [Solms] By all means; this is one of the most important  touchstones of the coalition. The least that can be done is to  check the solidarity surcharge at regular intervals and to start  gradually removing it after three years. We want to lower taxes  in other fields as well to create jobs: Anyone investing in new  jobs will pay less in taxes.    [Weckbach-Mara] Everyone is talking about public austerity  measures. How do you want to put this into effect?    [Solms] It all begins within the government machinery. With  the FDP, there will be fewer ministries in the future: The  Ministries for Family and the Elderly, Women, Young People, and  Health will be combined into one again. The Ministry for  Education and Research will be turned into a Ministry for  Future-Oriented Affairs. The Ministries for Transport and  Housing Construction could be combined into an Infrastructure  Ministry, together with the Ministry for Postal and  Telecommunications Affairs. Lufthansa will be privatized. The  total number of state secretaries will be cut by one-third.    [Weckbach-Mara] The European authorities will get away  unscathed?    [Solms] These must be cut down as well. The European Union  [EU] is violating the Maastricht Treaty with its excess  bureaucracy. We have to put an end to the regulation mania. It  is nonsense to have Brussels telling us from where we may import  our bananas, or how many kilograms a German worker is allowed to  lift. At the same time, the EU fails to act when it comes to  remedying bad situations, down to the field of health affairs,  in order to prevent catastrophes like Mad Cow Disease [Bovine  Spongiform Encephalopathy -- BSE] from spreading.    [Weckbach-Mara] The CDU and CSU insist on the great bugging  campaign against suspect major criminals....    [Solms] This would not help the fight against mass crimes,  the point where we have to start. We must strengthen police and  we need more posts on the federal and laender levels, better  training and equipment, better international cooperation. We  also need a legal reform that speeds up judicial procedures and  introduces a compensation scheme for victims.</p>

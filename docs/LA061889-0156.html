			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING 'VISITOR' LEAVES HOUSE IN SHAMBLES  </P> <P> Rick Rapada and his 12-year-old daughter had an early morning visitor who  didn't bother to knock before knocking down their living room wall.  </P> <P> Rapada said the first sound he heard when he awoke Friday morning was tires  screeching. Moments later a 1973 Mercury Cougar, still running, was parked in  his living room with a television and some clothes resting on the hood.  </P> <P> The impact tore a refrigerator door off its hinges and knocked a built-in  dishwasher to the other side of the house. Neither Rapada nor his daughter,  Michelle, was injured.  </P> <P> Jennifer Suniga, 27, lost control of her car when another vehicle pulled in  front of her, police said. Suniga told police that she hit the brakes and  careened through a fence and over 20 feet of lawn before crashing into the  home.  </P> <P> Suniga, who is pregnant, was taken to a hospital for observation but was not  admitted.  </P></p>

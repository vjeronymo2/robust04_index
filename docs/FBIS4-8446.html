			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 13 (CTK) -- At its meeting today, the  Czech Government rejected the bill on the restitution of  property to Jewish individuals submitted by Deputy Viktor Dobal  from the government coalition Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA),  Premier Vaclav Klaus told journalists.    He said the government had been preparing its own bill on  extra-judicial rehabilitations which would solve the problem of  property wrongs committed against Jewish people in 1938-1945.    The government disagreed with certain passages in the  deputies' bill, Klaus said. That the government bill did not  provide for the return of other property than that in the  state's possession was one of the main differences. "It is  impossible for restitution to concern property already  privatized and property in the possession of municipalities,"  Klaus said.    He added that the government favored the idea of paying  financial compensation to Jewish people from the state budget  for the property which ought to be returned and which was not in  the state's possession.    Another difference was that the government bill considered  only initial owners of property or their legitimate heirs to be  eligible for restitution. According to the government bill,  only property which was claimed before February 25, 1948 -- the  communist takeover -- and which was not returned to its initial  owners due to political changes would be restituted, Klaus said.    He said that restitution would concern only people  persecuted  for racial reasons and not all the people whom the post-war  decrees of Czechoslovak President Edvard Benes concerned, for  example those people who suffered for political reasons in the  period from 1938 to 1945.    The government did not believe that the land law should be  amended to ensure the restitution of property to Jewish people,  as the deputies' bill defined, Klaus said. He told journalists  that the government's negative stand on the deputies' bill was  sent to Parliament today.</p>

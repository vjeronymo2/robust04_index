			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SANTA CLARITA SCHOOLS DEFER BOND MEASURE AFTER SURVEY  </P> <P> Santa Clarita Valley high school trustees, discouraged by a poll that showed  voters would support only a limited tax increase to build schools, have decided  to wait at least a year before asking the public to pass a bond measure for  badly needed new schools.  </P> <P> "It did not seem to me that it would be in our best interest to look at a bond  issue right now," Clyde Smyth, superintendent of the William S. Hart Union High  School District, said Wednesday.  </P> <P> On Tuesday night, the Hart trustees agreed with Smyth that the district should  launch a campaign to educate the public about the district's needs and the  possible fund-raising methods to pay for land and new buildings.  </P> <P> That Hart proposal will be discussed by the Santa Clarita Valley Trustees  Assn., composed of trustees from the Hart district, the valley's four  elementary school districts and one community college district.  </P> <P> The poll, released last Friday, surveyed 600 randomly selected voters in the  Santa Clarita Valley.  </P> <P> It found that $50 to $60 was the maximum amount of additional property tax that  two-thirds of the voters would be willing to pay each year to build schools.  Bond measures need the approval of two-thirds of the voters to pass.  </P> <P> But Santa Clarita Valley school officials estimated that it would cost property  owners $300 a year to finance $400 million in bonds the six districts would  need to build schools over the next 20 years.  </P> <P> "It's disappointing, but I'm not surprised," Smyth said of the poll results.  Tax measures always encounter opposition, and in Santa Clarita many residents  believe that developers should pay more to build schools, he said.  </P> <P> In November a proposed bond measure to raise $275 million for new roads in the  Santa Clarita Valley failed miserably, winning only 4,000 of 19,714 votes cast.  The bond measure would have increased annual property tax bills between $75 and  $200.  </P></p>

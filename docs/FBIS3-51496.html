			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Pact for Stability, Competitiveness, and Employement read </F> by Arsenio Farell, Mexican secretary of labor and social  welfare, following the signing of the pact at Los Pinos  Presidential Residence in Mexico City; broadcast in progress --  live]    [Text] ...competitiveness and employment. In light of the  regrettable developments in the state of Chiapas and the illegal  activities involving armed groups, the signatories of the  Stability, Competitiveness, and Employment Pact agreed on the  need to reaffirm, reinforce, and fully comply with the  commitments acquired on 3 October based on the following:    1. That unified cooperation of all segments of the  population, within a framework of respect and permanent  communication, is an indispensable condition to reach common  goals which will guide Mexico's progress, defend our  sovereignty, and strengthen our national identity.    2. That reaching a consensus within the framework of the  law,  and not through confrontation, is an efficient instrument to  coordinate society's efforts in tackling the challenges of a  just and equitable economic development within a world situation  that demands greater efficiency and competitiveness.    3. That the consensus reached and the efforts made by all  segments have brought about specific and significant results,  which we pursue. Inflation has been reduced to a single-digit  figure, and productivity shows important and sustained growth.  We have noted strict discipline in the handling of fiscal and  monetary policy. We have made progress in economic deregulation  and trade opening. We have created new means to ensure more  active participation of private and social segments in economic  activity, and we have made profound budget reforms that seek to  make quicker progress in resolving the social underdevelopment  that persists.    Therefore, the labor organizations that comprise the Labor  Congress, the peasant organizations, the business organizations  that represent a great majority of the country's productive  forces, and the federal government agreed to the following:    1. The signatories ratify the commitments in the current  consensus agreements and pledge to make greater efforts to  comply, fully and in a timely manner, with each and every one of  them within their own jurisdictions.    2. Within a context of fiscal discipline and in strict  compliance with provisions of the federation's expenditures  budget and the Revenues Law, approved by the honorable Congress  of the Union, the federal government commits to establishing a  timetable giving higher priority to the use of allocations that  correspond to public investment expenditures to promote economic  activity and those corresponding to social development  expenditures.    These allocations increased by 10 percent and 10.5 percent  in  real terms, respectively, in the budget approved for 1994.  Therefore, expenditures for social development represent 53.9  percent of programmed expenditures and 10.2 percent of the GNP.  These are the highest figures in our history.    3. The labor and managerial sectors agree to promote and  increase, via every means available to them, a direct and  permanent dialogue and an understanding among the production  sectors to prevent and to expeditiously resolve any possible  differences. They also agree to increase efforts to directly  sign productivity and quality agreements between labor  organizations and management in accordance with the guidelines  of the national agreement to increase productivity and improve  quality.    4. The labor, peasant, and managerial sectors, as well as  the  federal government, believe it is imperative to continue giving  priority attention to the agricultural sector. With this in  mind, they agree to strengthen their interrelation with the  rural sector through productive chains in an effort to support  their productivity and profitability and thereby improve the  standard of living of people living in rural areas.    5. To guarantee that the goals established in this agreement  will be met, the parties deem it necessary that, effective with  the signing of this agreement, the sessions of the Follow-up and  Assessment Commission will be held twice a week, on Tuesdays and  Thursdays, instead of once a week, as has been the case up until  now.    The social dialogue, in a climate of peace and national  unity, and with the unavoidable respect for the law, has  resulted in significant achievements.    The labor, peasant, and management sectors, as well as the  federal government, believe that society's concerted efforts  within the law are the most effective way to consolidate the  achievements made in the struggle against inflation, as well as  to consolidate the construction of a firm basis to boost growth  and employment and to advance efforts to meet the needs and  demands of our compatriots, particularly those who have less.    This pact is being signed at Los Pinos Official Residence on  12 January 1994 in the presence of the president of Mexico.</p>

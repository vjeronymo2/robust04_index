			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Part 364 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed part 364 contains general provisions that would be applicable to the SILS and CIL programs, authorized by parts B and C, respectively, of chapter 1 of title VII of the Act. In addition, some provisions in proposed part 364 also are made specifically applicable to the OIB program authorized by chapter 2 of title VII of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;364.4 lists the definitions that apply to these programs, including ``administrative support services,'' ``advocacy,'' ``attendant care,'' ``cross-disability,'' ``individual with a significant disability,'' ``minority group,'' ``nonresidential,'' ``peer relationships,'' ``peer role models,'' ``service provider,'' ``significant disability,'' ``transportation,'' and ``unserved and underserved.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``administrative support services'' is based on the State plan requirement in section 704(c) of the Act regarding the State's role if the CIL program is administered by the State pursuant to section 723 of the Act. The definition of ``cross-disability'' is based on section 725(b)(2) of the Act. The definition of an ``individual with a significant disability'' is the definition of ``individual with a severe disability'' used in section 7(15)(B) of the Act. The definition of ``service provider'' is derived from the manner in which this term is used in section 704(e) of the Act. The definition of ``significant disability'' is derived from section 7(15)(B) of the Act. The definition of ``unserved and underserved'' is derived from sections 704(l), 713(7), and 725(c)(10) and (11) of the Act and the legislative history of these statutory provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definitions of ``attendant care'' and ``transportation'' are based on the definitions of these terms found in &sect;365.1(c)(3) of the existing regulations for the SILS. The definition of ``advocacy'' is the same definition used in the Client Assistance Program (CAP) authorized under section 112 of the Act. The definition of ``minority group'' is based on the general definition of this term used by the U.S. Department of Education (ED). Finally, the definitions of ``nonresidential,'' ``peer relationships,'' and ``peer role models'' are derived from the generally accepted understanding of these terms in the IL community. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;364.5 would not allow the use of expenditures made with non-Federal funds in a particular fiscal year as an allowable cost to offset any costs disallowed in a notice of disallowance decision or preliminary departmental decision unless the expenditures were reported as costs charged to the program on the final financial status reports for that program prior to the commencement of the audit or compliance review that formed the basis for the disallowance. This provision is designed to lessen the confusion surrounding the use of unreported costs as an offset against disallowed costs and to lessen the litigation costs associated with this practice. This provision also incorporates the Department's current practice with respect to programs under the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

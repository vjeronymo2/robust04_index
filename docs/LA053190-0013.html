			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> IT'S JERRY SEINFELD'S SHOW -- AND IT'S A WINNER  </P> <P> NBC's new comedy "Seinfeld" blows up a gale of wit and freshness.  </P> <P> The first of its four episodes airs at 9:30 tonight on Channels 4, 36 and 39,  and here's hoping this very funny series does well enough in the ratings to  earn a pickup somewhere down the line.  </P> <P> Creatively, it's already made it.  </P> <P> Although the concept is not unlike the late, great "It's Garry Shandling's  Show" on Showtime and Fox, "Seinfeld" has a distinct charm of its own,  centering on the musings and missteps of stand-up comic Jerry Seinfeld, with  his private life being threaded by related bits from his club act.  </P> <P> Seinfeld, who co-created the series and wrote some of the episodes with Larry  David, plays himself here with appealing naturalness, supported by Jason  Alexander as his best friend, Julia Louis-Dreyfus as his ex-girlfriend Elaine  and Michael Richards as his goofy neighbor.  </P> <P> This is just the kind of amusingly off-center comedy now missing from NBC's  lineup, one of those rare, delightful meshings of concept, cast and execution,  with producer Tom Cherones providing inspired direction. Nothing is forced.  </P> <P> This is a very creative approach to universal humor. In one episode, for  example, Seinfeld tackles the problem of ending his friendship with a bore  without hurting the man's feelings ("Listen, Joe, I don't think we should see  each other anymore").  </P> <P> Tonight's premiere finds Seinfeld attempting to pursue a woman he meets at a  party without disturbing his platonic relationship with Elaine. He contrives a  meeting outside the woman's law office: "So . . . uh, do you date immature  men?" And so on and so on. Great stuff. HOWARD ROSENBERG  </P></p>

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Pre-tax petrol price 'low in real terms' THE PRICE of petrol last year in real terms and net of taxes was the lowest since 1969, and the second-lowest ever, according to a report on the vehicle fuels market by the Gilbert Jenkins research consultancy. The tax-free petrol price in real terms was less than a third of its level in 1912, the first year of records, although the tax element has trebled in the same period, the report says. The net price has been similar in 10 other years, but only in 1969 was it marginally lower. In terms of consumer price, while competition and varying exchange rates mean the situation can change rapidly, the report finds that in February this year the UK had the second-lowest petrol prices in Europe after Switzerland. The report also finds that sales of unleaded petrol have grown rapidly since its introduction in the UK in 1987. From a 1 per cent market share in that year, it grew to account for about a third of all petrol sold in 1990. A new super unleaded grade introduced in 1990 took 4 per cent of the market. Sales were helped by a tax advantage of more than 3p a litre. The report points to an increasing trend towards petrol marketing at retail sites, with chains such as Tesco and J. Sainsbury often running petrol stations. The share of petrol sold through motorway and big-store sites increased from 0.9 per cent in 1977 to 12 per cent in 1991, and is forecast to reach 20 per cent by 1995. Motor Fuels Business.

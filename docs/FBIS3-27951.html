Can the economy smoothly enter  the road to recovery and, is it possible to transfer our  economic track to one that will provide for sustained economic  growth equal to Japanese latent growth potential, which is said  to be in the middle 3 percent range? It is Economic Planning  Agency [EPA] that is responsible for analyzing the situation and  performing general coordination of Japan's economic policy.    Last year, EPA accomplished the big job of formulating the  "Lifestyle Superpower Five-Year Plan," which was a much-touted  policy matter for the Miyazawa cabinet. Beyond that, they put  together an emergency economic measure in March 1992 to  stimulate the still slumping economy and a comprehensive  economic measure for August. The activities of the EPA have been  noticeable this year as well as they have done things such as  put together a new comprehensive economic measure in April, as  soon as the main budget was adopted.    However, their reputation in this regard is not universally  positive. With regard to their analysis of the business  conditions, there are such criticisms as "they misjudged the  period of the recession," and "their decision on business  conditions was late." Regarding their establishment of economic  policy, criticism is heard here and there as to whether they  "are adequately fulfilling their role as the government's  economic coordination body?" There have even been comments by a  weekly magazine saying that "the EPA is a big white elephant."    The EPA neither has the power to determine the budget, as  the Ministry of Finance [MOF] does, nor the ability to influence  business, as the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] does. It has little direct, concrete authority. It is a  government agency whose main mission includes research and  coordination, and prepare economic plans. It is deplorable  that the EPA's ability to carry out research and coordination  should become the butt of criticism.    Since the end of the Cold War, the global economy has been  gripped by various difficult problems, such as the dull economic  performance among the developed countries, the conversion of the  former Soviet Union and Eastern European states to market  economies, and environmental problems on a global scale. What  path should Japanese economic development take in the course of  all of this? With regard to international problems, how should  true international policy cooperation be implemented?  Domestically, what policy should be adopted to convert Japan  from a society which places importance on producers to one that  prioritizes consumers, and will bring about comfortable  national life? The EPA confronts a wide spectrum of problems,  and the role that they must fill in order to solve these  problems is immense.    Just how will the EPA respond the criticism coming in from  various quarters? How will the EPA respond to demands from the  public? The EPA's stance on these issues in the future is an  item that will be watched with interest.    Looking back on the history of the EPA, it cannot be denied  that once it was considered a MITI "branch office," but later it  took on the appearance of being a MITI/MOF "joint venture." Many  personnel from the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce (the  present-day MITI) were dispatched to the EPA's antecedent  organizations; like the Office of Planning which, under the  National Mobilization Law, promoted Japan's economy before the  war, and the Economic Stabilization Headquarters, which put its  efforts into the distribution of foodstuffs and commodities in  order to promote Japanese economic reconstruction after the war.  Even after it changed its name to the Economic Review Agency  in 1952 and to the EPA in 1955, MITI continued to support the  system by dispatching personnel to take the post of  administrative vice minister.    The MOF joined hands with the proper [a career employee or  staff member] group and, in 1969, was successful in getting  "proper treatment" for its Yoshio Kano (a graduate of Tokyo  University, entered MOF in 1946) and getting him assigned as  administrative vice minister, breaking MITI's monopoly on this  post. From that time on, there has been a triangular struggle  among the MOF, MITI, and the agency for control of the  top-level posts in the EPA. MOF secures the head of the  Director General's Secretariat and one bureau chief position,  MITI gets the position of member of the policy board of the Bank  of Japan and one bureau chief position, and those ministries and  the agency proper fight over the posts of administrative vice  minister.    There is a reason for the burning attachment that MITI and  MOF, the two most powerful ministries in Kasumigaseki place on  the fight for the top-level positions in the EPA." That is  because they want to strongly reflect their respective  ministries view in economic policy measures such as the  comprehensive economic measures put togetherby by the EPA. The  ministries will find it easier to implement policies in future  if their point of view is closely reflected not only in  emergency economic stimulus measures which were implemented  three times during current economic recession, but in such  policy measures as "government economic forecast," which EPA  prepares for each fiscal year.    The conflict between these ministries becomes especially  vivid revolving around drafting the government economic  forecast and the midterm economic plans. MITI would push for a  higher rate of economic growth, while the MOF usually advocates  a cautious number. For example, in the "Lifestyle Superpower  Five-Year Plan" that was adopted in 1992, the projected average  annual rate of net economic growth rate presented was 3.5  percent. It is said that while MITI argued for a higher rate,  MOF pushed a lower conservative figure.    In the government economic forecast for FY 1993, the  situation was different as both MITI and MOF pushed for a  projected net growth rate of 3.5 percent and EPA argued for a  rate in the low 3 percent range. In the end, a figure of 3.3  percent was adopted. As usual, MITI pushed for a higher  economic growth rate in order to stimulate the desire of  industrial sector, which (it believes) is under its protection,  to invest in plant and equipment.    Usually, the MOF advocates low growth rate lest it will be  pressured for a higher government expenditures because higher  growth rate will necessitate a higher estimate of tax revenue  growth. Last year, however, because of the serious business  recession, MOF projected a higher growth rate so that it can  draft an economic stimulas-type of budget, avoiding issuance of  deficit-covering bonds.    It is the job of the EPA to coordinate the figures asserted  by the two ministries and, while considering the economic  situation at hand, take a final position, which is usually  somewhere right in the middle. However, last year the number  adopted was close to the low number suggested by the EPA, a  result which shows that the EPA is coming out from under the  influence of MITI and MOF.    In fact, following the administrative vice ministerial  position held by MOF from June 1986 through June 1987, the  agency group took over the seat for three consecutive terms.  Following that, although an official from the MOF was again  named as administrative vice minister, the seat again reverted  to the agency proper. This is because the EPA, which is made up  of "a scratch team," is beginning to turn out capable men to  take over the position. In the future, the vice ministerial  position will probably be filled by EPA careerists, and the  position would be given to MII and the MOF only from time to  time. However, the scope of administrative ability of the  agency careerists will probably be scrutinized carefully. To be  able to bandy with other agencies and ministries, including MOF  and MITI, on an equal footing, it would be necessary for the  EPA to put forth unceasing efforts to strengthen itself and  adjust its posture, in order to avoid becoming the object of  sarcasm, such as "the EPA has neither money nor power," or "the  EPA is just the government economists group," at the hands of  other government ministries and agencies.    Furthermore, looking at the personnel who have been selected  to fill the role of director general of the EPA, although caught  between MOF and MITI, when powerful ministers were in place, the  EPA joined the ranks of leading agencies and ministries.  Several influential leaders greatly enhanced the EPA's  existence by serving as director generals, such as former Prime  Minister Takeo Fukuda, who served as deputy prime minister and  EPA director general concurrently in the Miki cabinet; former  Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, who served three terms as EPA  director general in the second Ikeda, first Sato, and Fukuda  cabinets; and former MITI Minister Toshio Komoto, who had the  credentials of being deputy prime minister in the Suzuki and  second Nakasone cabinets. However, since Komoto, no one in the  faction leader class has been tasked to serve as EPA director  general, and that is unfortunate.    However, as a result of the splitting up of the LDP and the  last general election, a coalition government has become  unavoidable. The political system finds itself in a situation  where it must change to place importance on the standard of  living of the people. Under these circumstances, the type of  individual utilized for the role of director general of EPA  would also become diverse.    Meanwhile, as might be expected of an agency that is being  called the "government economists group," EPA puts out a lot of  economists. It provides human resources not only to the  government, but also to academia and private think tanks, and is  forming a unique human network known as "EPA line of economists."  <H3>  Adminstrative Vice Minister, Councilor, and Member of the  Policy Board of the Bank of Japan </H3>   The top administrative official of EPA is Administrative  Vice Minister Tsutomu Tanaka (entered the agency in 1959;  graduated from Tokyo Metropolitan University, Law and Economics  Departments). He assumed the seat of vice minister just as  predicted by the newspaper forecasts published before the June  personnel moves. Tanaka's installation as administrative vice  minister returns the post to the agency proper, following three  terms by agency propers, Takao Akabane, Shinyasu Hoshino, and  Yasuo Katsumura, followed by Shunji Fukinbara from the MOF,  and is a continuation of the recent trend to give priority to  EPA propers for this post.    Tanaka sports a splendid mustache, and he is known in the  EPA  as "the mustached Tanaka."    He has made the rounds of the EPA Research, Planning, and  Coordination Bureaus, and he is in the international group of  the EPA as he has served a total of eight years, two terms, in  the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  (OECD). He has had experience as director of the Coordination  Bureau's Industrial Economic Affairs Division, chief of the  International Affairs Division in the Director Gerneral's  Secretariat of the Environment Agency, director of the EPA's  First International Economic Affairs Division, director of the  Coordination Division in the same Bureau, deputy director  general of the Economic Research Institute, councilor to the  Coordination Bureau, and councilor to the Planning Bureau  before being named as director general of the Research Bureau.  Following that, he was named as director general of the Price  Bureau and councilor for Economic Planning before receiving his  current post. He is from Tokyo Prefecture.    In his first instructions after assuming current post,  Tanaka stated that there were difficult aspects in the creation  of a new global economic order following the end of the Cold  War, emphasizing the importance of Japan's role in this  process. He called for a vitalization of the EPA, because, in  order for the EPA to grapple with this kind of problem, it will  require "a high level of analytic ability," "bold planning  power," and "daring coordinating power."    The number-two administrative official is EPA Councilor  Shosuke Tanaka (joined the agency in 1962; graduated in  humanities and sciences from Saitama University). This post's  full title is vice minister for International Economic Affairs.  This is the same level vice ministerial post as the offices of  deputy vice minister for Financial Affairs in the MOF and  deputy vice minister in MITI. He attends international vice  ministerial conferences as EPA representative. To distinguish  his position from bureau level Councilors, this position is  known as "EPA councilor" or "agency councilor."    He had experience as head of the National Expenditure  Division in the Department of National Income at the Economic  Research Institute, director of the Overseas Research Division  in the Research Bureau, director of the Department of National  Income at the Economic Research Institute, and deputy director  general of the Price Bureau before becoming director general of  the Research Bureau. Following that, he served as director  general of the Planning and Coordination Bureau of the National  Land Agency and director general of the Planning Bureau before  assuming his current post. He is from Tokyo Prefecture.    Kuninari Morisei (joined MITI in 1965; a graduate of Tokyo  University, Law Department) is EPA's member of the policy board  of the Bank of Japan. An official dispatched from MITI is  always assigned to this post. Although this official is said to  be EPA representative, he is, in fact, representing MITI, and he  often states MITI's and industry's position at the Bank of Japan  policy committee meetings, which is held twice weekly on  Tuesday and Friday. He agrees to reductions of the official  interest rate, and opposes rate increases.    He had experience as head of the Reserves Division of the  Petroleum Department of MITI's Agency of Natural Resources and  Energy [ANRE], Director General's Secretariat Welfare  administrator, an industrial researcher at the London Center of  the Japan External Trade Organization [JETRO], head of the  Export Insurance Division of MITI's International Trade  Administration Bureau, head of the Trade Insurance Division of  the same Bureau, and director of the Industrial Finance Division  of MITI's Industrial Policy Bureau, before becoming head of the  Director General's Secretariat Planning Office, director of the  Commerce and Industry Division for Osaka Prefecture, and deputy  director general of MITI's International Trade Policy Bureau, on  his way to his current post. He is from Okayama Prefecture.    The EPA is headed up by the director general of Economic  Planning and the administrative vice minister. Under them comes  the Director General's Secretariat, five bureaus--Coordination,  Social Policy, Price, Planning, and Research--and one affiliated  organization, the Economic Research Institute.    Regarding the responsibilities of the various bureaus, it is  the responsibility of the Coordination Bureau to prepare the  annual government economic forecast. Furthermore, it has  responsibility for putting together the emergency and  comprehensive economic measures that cover all of the various  agencies and ministries. This bureau literally symbolizes the  EPA as the government coordination agency.    The Economic Welfare Bureau is responsible for consumer  affairs. It assumes the administrative role in Economic Welfare  Council, a Prime Minister's advisory organ, which is now  studying the implementation of product liability [PL]. In 1973  the Price Bureau split away from the Economic Welfare Bureau  and the independent Price Bureau received the job of being the  watchman over prices. Every year, it publishes the price report,  which analyzes the actual situation with regard to prices, and  it also watches things such as the situation of the  distribution of marginal profits caused by the high yen.    The Planning Bureau is responsible for preparation of  "economic plans," such as the the "Lifestyle Superpower  Five-Year Plan." Each year, the Research Bureau publishes the  "Economic White Paper," and also prepares the "Monthly Economic  Report." It is responsible for researching and analyzing the  internal and external economic environment.    The Economic Research Institute prepares annual and  quarterly statistics on GNP and also performs the basic  economic analysis.  <H5>  Director General's Secretariat </H5>   The Director General's Secretariat is responsible, like the  Secretariats in other ministries and agencies, for coordinating  activities with various bureaus, watching over such areas as  personnel affairs, accounting, and public relations. It is the  coordinator of the EPA, the government coordinating body.    The person who manages this Secretariat is Yoji Wakui  (entered the MOF in 1946; a graduate of Tokyo University, Law  Department). This position is held successively by an official  dispatched from the MOF. This is the bridgehead of the MOF's  "control of Kasumigaseki." Therefore, it is normal for the MOF  to dispatch someone of superior talents, a person who has  experience as first deputy director general of the Budget Bureau  and who is a likely candidate as vice minister of the MOF, to  take this position.    Wakui had experience as director of the Investigation  Department of the Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau, a budgetary  planner in the Budget Bureau, a budget officer in the same  bureau (responsible for construction and public works), director  of the General Affairs Division of the same bureau, secretary  to the Prime Minister, and as deputy director general of the  Budget Bureau before he assumed his current post. He is from  Chiba Prefecture. He was once temporarily assigned to the EPA,  and therefore it is of interest to see just how he uses his  experience to take the helm at the EPA.    The head of the Secretarial Division, which is responsible  for personnel affairs, is Yuzo Kobayashi (joined the EPA in  1969; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics Department).  Within the EPA, he is known by the nickname "Kobayu [KOBAyashi  YUzo]." He is showing a great desire toward the vitalization of  the EPA. He served in positions such as secretary to the  director general, director of the Second Economic Cooperation  Division in the Coordination Bureau, director of the Price  Coordination Division in the Price Bureau, and director of  planning in the Planning and Coordination Bureau in the National  Land Agency before assuming his current post.    The director of the Accounts and Budget Division, which is  responsible for Agency administratie matters, including  budgeting and accounting, and employee benefits, is Hiroshi  Yoshida (joined the agency in 1969; a graduate of Kyoto  University, Economics Department). He had experience as director  of the Second Research Division of the Research and Development  Department in the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF),  director of the Second Consumer Affairs Division in the EPA's  Social Policy Bureau, director of the Remote Islands  Development Division of the National Land Agency's Regional  Promotion Bureau, and director of the Business Statistics  Research Division of the EPA's Research Bureau before assuming  his current position.    Eiji Sakuda (entered MITI in 1969; a graduate of Keio  University, Economics Department) is the director of the Policy  Division, which is responsible for things such as general  coordination within the EPA, Diet policy, and public relations.  He has had experience as director of the South Asia and Eastern  Europe Division in MITI's International Trade Policy Bureau,  head of the Electric Power Development Division of ANRE's Public  Utilities Department, director of the Basic Chemicals Division  of the Basic Industries Bureau, and head of the Planning  Division of ANRE's Petroleum Department before taking up his  current post. The Public Relations Office is in the Planning  Division. The current head of the Public Relations Office is  Izumi Nakafuji (joined the EPA in 1976; a graduate of  Hitotsubashi University, Economics Department). He has been  senior exchange researcher at the Economic Research Institute,  assistant director of General Affairs Division of the Planning  and Coordination Bureau in the National Land Agency, and a  resercher in the Price Bureau before assuming his current post.    Yoshinori Terui (joined EPA in 1971; a graduate of Tohoku  University, Economics Department) is the director of the  Electronic Data Processing Division, which is responsible for  maintaining and operating the agency's computerized information  systems. He has served as a researcher in the Research Bureau, a  researcher in the Planning and Coordination Division of the  Environment Agency's Planning and Coordination Bureau, a  grievance officer regarding the market opening problem in the  Coordination Division of the EPA's Coordination Bureau, and as a  planner in the Planning and Coordination Bureau in the National  Land Agency before assuming his current position.  <H5>  Coordination Bureau </H5>   The director general of the Coordination Bureau, the bureau  at the heart of the EPA, is Makoto Kobayashi (joined MITI in  1961; a graduate of Tokyo University, Law Department). This  position had been held by officials from the EPA careerist  group, including Masaru Yoshitomi--Japan's preeminent  economist--and subsequently by former Director General Yoseki  Nagase. However, this time around, an official dispatched from  MITI, with a long record of experience at EPA, has been named  director general. With regard to the problem of distributing  marginal profits resulting from the high yen, when he held his  former job as director general of the Price Bureau, it is said  that he argued with MITI and ANRE, who were resisting by saying  "there aren't any marginal profits," and had a survey of the  impact of marginal profits in utility bills approved by the  conference of governmental price officials. Just how he will use  his decisionmaking and work together with two powerful partners,  MITI and MOF, in the preparation of the government economic  forecast is a matter of considerable interest.    After holding the posts of director of the Price Policy  Division in MITI's Industrial Policy Bureau, Secretariat  counselor in ANRE, chief of Personnel Division in the General  Affairs Division of the Agency of Industrial Science and  Technology [AIST], and after serving as head of the Planning  Section in the Petroleum Department, he has been going back and  forth between MITI and the EPA. He has held the positions of  chief of the Planning Division in the EPA's Director General's  Secretariat, director of the Planning Division in the Small and  Medium Enterprise Agency, councilor to the EPA's Price Bureau,  director of MITI's Tokyo Bureau of International Trade and  Industry, and director of MITI's Kanto Bureau of International  Trade and Industy. After that, he was moved to EPA, where he  served as a member of the policy board of the Bank of Japan,  director general of the Research Bureau, and director general of  the Price Bureau before he assumed his current position. He is  from Tokyo Prefecture.    MITI, which used to control the EPA, has had no vice  ministerial appointee since 1986. However, Kobayashi is seen as  the strongest candidate to fill this position next. We wonder  whether next year will see the naming of an EPA administrative  vice minister from MITI.    The deputy director general of this bureau, Yoichi Okita  (joined EPA in 1966; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics  Department) is the eldest son of the late Saburo Okita, a  former foreign minister. He had experience as director of the  Price Research Division in the Price Bureau, director of the  Overseas Research Division in the Research Bureau, and director  of Research and Planning at the National Institute for Research  Advancement (NIRA) before becoming director of the First  Domestic Research Division in the Research Bureau. In both 1990  and 1991, he wrote the "Economic White Paper." His father wrote  the white paper four times, starting in 1948; therefore, this is  the second generation on this line, Saburo and Yoichi, who have  penned the "Economic White Paper." As expected, he has the  reputation of having precise analytic ability. It will be  interesting to see just how this will be used in the  Coordination Bureau. After he served as head of the First  Domestic Research Bureau, he was a councilor to the Director  General's Secretariat in the National Land Agency and deputy  director general of the Economic Research Institute before  assuming his current position.    The other councilor to the Coordination Bureau is Takafumi  Kaneko (joined the EPA in 1968; a graduate of Yokohama National  University Economics Department). He had experience in posts  such as senior researcher in the Economic Research Institute,  counselor at the Japanese Embassy in the United States, director  of the First International Economic Affairs Division in the  Coordination Bureau, and director of the Accounts and Budget  Division in the Director General's Secretariat of EPA before  assuming his current post. It is said that, when he was head of  the Accounts and Budget Division, he had several fierce clashes  with MOF officials during negotiations on the budget. He will be  the person in charge of grievances regarding the market-opening  problem, which affects all of the ministries and agencies, so  there are high hopes being pinned on his ability to succeed in  this position.    The director of the Coordination Division, the first  division  listed on the organizational table of the Coordination Bureau,  is Makoto Nomura (joined EPA in 1970; a graduate of  Hitotsubashi University, Economics Department). He has had  experience as a grievance officer on the market-opening problem  in the Coordination Division of EPA's Coordination Bureau, head  of the Price Control Office of the Price Bureau, director of  planning in the National Land Agency's Planning and Coordination  Bureau, director of the Coordination Bureau's Second  International Economics Affairs Division, director of the  Research Planning Division at the NIRA, and director of the  International Business Affairs Division of MITI's Industrial  Policy Bureau before assuming his current position.    General coordination of industrial policy is handled by the  Industrial Affairs Division, which is headed by Yoshiaki  Umemura (joined MITI in 1973; a graduate of Tokyo University,  Law Department). He has served in positions such as the head of  Energy Policy Planning Division in the Director General's  Secretariat of ANRE before assuming his current position.  Despite the fact that his successor in this position was from  the EPA proper, it is customary for this post to be filled by  someone from MITI. The irector of the First International  Economic Affairs Division, which handles issues such as trade,  the international balance of payments, and foreign exchange, is  Yoichi Nakamura (joined EPA in 1973; a graduate of Tokyo  Institute of Technology, Engineering Department). He has had  experience as a senior researcher at NIRA, head of the National  Expenditure Division of the National Income Department at the  Economic Research Institute, and director of the Research  Exchange Department at the Economic Research Institute before  assuming his current position. The director of the Second  International Economic Affairs Division is Haruhito Arai (joined  EPA in 1975; a graduate of Tokyo University, Graduate School of  Sciences). He has had experience in jobs such as deputy director  of the Coordination Division of the Coordination Bureau, deputy  director of the Economic Welfare Policy Division in the Economic  Welfare Bureau, secretary to the minister, and researcher in the  First Domestic Research Division in the Research Bureau before  assuming his current position.    The director of the Finance Division, which is responsible  for general coordination of finance policy, is Hiroshi Tsukada  (joined MOF in 1972; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics  Department). This post is successively manned by a person  dispatched from MOF. He has served in posts such as cabinet  counselor and director of the Research Division of the MOF's  Institute of Fiscal and Monetary Policy before assuming his  current position. The First Economic Cooperation Division is  headed by Akira Sadahiro (joined EPA in 1971; a graduate of  Waseda University, Political Economics Department and Osaka  University, School of Economics). He has had experience in  positions such as senior researcher at the Economic Research  Institute, director of the Second Coordination Division at the  OECF, director of the Research Exchange Division at the Economic  Research Institute, and director of the Overseas Research  Division in the Research Bureau before assuming his current  position. The chief of Second Economic Cooperation Division is  Susumu Sanbonmatsu (entered MITI in 1975; a graduate of Tokyo  University, Economics Department). He has had experience as the  chief of the General Affairs Division of the General Planning  Department of MITI's Kyushu Bureau of International Trade and  Industry, head of the Planning Division of the Planning  Department of JETRO, and head of the Data Processing  Administration Division of MITI's Director General's Secretariat  before assuming his current post.  <H5>  Economic Welfare Bureau </H5>   The Economic Welfare Bureau, which is responsible for  development of consumer affairs, is a very young bureau as it  was founded in 1972. This bureau was established under the Ikeda  administration, and its development was accelerated under the  Sato administration. Its purpose was to correct the negative  effects that the high rate of economic growth was having on  people's lives. From the working out of a plan to change  Japanese society from one that placed high importance on the  producers of goods to one that emphasized, through the formation  last year of the "Lifestyle Superpower Five-Year Plan," more  importance has been placed on activities in this regard.  Currently, it is studying product liability, the so-called  powerful relief policy for consumers suffering from damage,  legislate into law and therefore a decision on the product  liability problem should be made by this fall.    The director general of this bureau is Masashi Kato (joined  EPA in 1962; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics  Department). He is entering his fourth year as director general  of this bureau. He was left in office because the product  liability problem is coming to a climax. He has taken an elite  course on his road to his current job, serving as director of  the Overseas Research Division in the Research Bureau, director  of the First Domestic Research Division in the same bureau,  director of the Secretarial Division in the Director General's  Secretariat, and councilor to the Research Bureau. He wrote the  "Economic White Paper" three times during the last period  (1985-1987) when there was a strong yen. His reputation as an  economist is high, and just how he will coordinate and get  consensus on the PL problem, on which there has not been a  consensus within the government on how to introduce the measure,  will continue to hold center stage for a while. He hails from  Tokyo Prefecture.    The councilor to this bureau is Takafusa Shioya (joined EPA  in 1966; a graduate of Tokyo University, Law Department). He  excels in his balanced view, based on his past experience. He  was dispatched to both the Environment Agency (1971) and the  National Land Agency (1974) when they were formed, and he has  also served in the JETRO New York office and at MITI. He has  served as councilor in the Director General's Secretariat,  director of the Price Coordination Division of the Price Bureau,  director of the Commerce Policy Division of MITI's Industrial  Policy Bureau, director of the Coordination Division of EPA's  Coordination Bureau, director of the Secretarial Division in the  Director General's Secretariat, and councilor to the Research  Bureau before assuming his current post. It is said that his  ability to coordinate was manifested when, as director of the  Coordination Division, he coordinated the tug of war between  MITI and MOF regarding the formulation of the government  economic forecast. It is hoped that this ability will again  manifest itself as he coordinates the activities of the  ministries in connection to the PL problem.    The director of the Economic Welfare Bureau, the first  division in the Economic Welfare Bureau's table of  organization, is Masataka Hirano (joined EPA in 1969; a graduate  of Tokyo Teachers College (now the University of Tsukuba)  Graduate School of Sciences). He has had experience in positions  such as councilor to the Director General's Secretariat,  director of the Second Domestic Research Division in the  Research Bureau, and director of the First Consumer Affairs  Division in the Economic Welfare Bureau before attaining his  current position. His previous position was director of the  First Consumer Affairs Division, a post which was responsible  for the PL problem. Having been in that position, to bring  together the entire bureau, he is expected to play an active  role in the resolution of this problem.    The director of the First Consumer Affairs Division, which  is  responsible for consumer protection and directly responsible for  the PL problem, is Yuko Ishida (joined EPA in 1970; a graduate  of Tokyo University, Economics Department). He has held  positions such as chief of the Research Division of the  Economic Department of the Fair Trade Commission's  Administrative Bureau, senior planning officer (responsible for  prices) in the Planning Bureau, and director of the Planning and  Coordination Division of the Environment Agency's Nature  Conservation Bureau before assuming his current post. Yoshiaki  Taguchi (joined the agency in 1974; a graduate of Tokyo  University, Law Department) is director of the Second Consumer  Affairs Division, which is responsible for things such as  consumer groups. Leading up to his current position, he has held  jobs such as researcher in the Coordination Bureau, and director  of the Public Relations Office in the Director General's  Secretariat's Planning Division.    The director of the Economic Welfare Research Division,  which  is responsible for the "Economic Welfare White Paper," is Makoto  Kondo (jointed EPA in 1972; a graduate of Kyoto University,  Economics Department). He has held positions such as planner  (responsible for weights and measures) in the Planning Bureau  before assuming his current position. This fall, he will be  challenged with the preparation of his first white paper, and  now that hopes are being placed on change in society placing  greater importance on the standard of living, we would like to  see him lay out clearly the path that will be taken to build a  "lifestyle superpower."  <H5>  Price Bureau </H5>   This is the youngest bureau. It split away from the Economic  Welfare Bureau, becoming independent in June 1973. Price  stability is its greatest responsibility. Since the beginning of  this year, the strengthening of the yen has continued, and there  are growing demands from the public for a distribution of the  marginal profits resulting from the high yen and for further  rectification of the differences in prices at home and abroad.  Opposition has been expressed by industries connected to the  lowering of public utility prices, such as electricity fees,  that would be brought about by the distribution of marginal  profits from the high yen. MITI is also aware of this fact;  therefore, in the future, this bureau's true worth as price  watchmen will probably be called into question.    The director general of the Price Bureau is Michisato  Sakamoto (joined MOF in 1964; a graduate of Tokyo University,  Law Department). After the last administrative vice minister,  Shunji Fukinbara, left office, he was the only bureau director  general from the MOF left at EPA. He joined EPA as councilor to  the Planning Bureau. Just what kind of activity can we expect  from him, being a future MOF candidate for the office of vice  minister? The Price Bureau will be the starting point for the  honing of his skills.    He has had experience in positions such as director of the  Mutual Assistance Insurance Division of MOF's Budget Bureau,  director of the General Affairs Division in the Economy Bureau,  Customs director at Yokohama, director of the Customs Division  at the National Tax Administration Agency, director of Direct  Taxe Department at the National Tax Administration Agency, and  director of the Taxation Department at the National Tax  Administration Agency before assuming his current position. He  is from Tokyo Prefecture.    This bureau has three councilors, of which one, Yoichi  Takemoto, is also serving as councilor to the Planning Bureau.  Therefore, we will introduce only two other councilors here.    Councilor Masaru Yanagizawa (joined the EPA in 1967; a  graduate of Tokyo University, Economics Department) went from  being director of the First International Economic Affairs  Division in the Coordination Bureau to an elite temporary  assignment as director of the Planning Division in the National  Land Agency's Planning and Coordination Bureau. After that he  served as councilor to the Coordination Bureau before assuming  his current position. As councilor to the Coordination Bureau,  he was responsible for preparation of the new midterm goal for  official development assistance (ODA) and grievance policy for  the market-opening problem, which affects plus and minuses for  the various ministries and agencies.    Of the other councilors, Tsugio Ide (joined MITI in 1967; a  graduate of Tokyo University, Economics Department), has been  dispatched from MITI. There are few people who can correctly  read the Chinese characters that make up his name. They are read  "Tsugio." He has held posts such as first secretary in the  Japanese Mission (Paris) to the OECD, director of the Research  Division of the Industrial Policy Bureau, director of the  General Affairs Division of the Basic Industries Bureau, and  director of the Small Enterprise Department in the Small and  Medium Enterprise Agency before assuming his current post. In  the EPA, he has served as director of the Policy Division in the  Director General's Secretariat. He is the second son of the  former chief of the Director General's Secretariat, Ichitaro Ide.    The director of the Price Policy Division, the first  organizational division in the bureau which is responsible for  general coordination of price policy, is Hideaki Yamakawa  (joined the agency in 1969; a graduate of Tokyo University,  Economics Department). He has served in positions such as senior  planning officer (responsible for prices) in the Planning  Bureau, director of the Price Research Division in the Price  Bureau, and director of the Director General's Secretariat  Information Systems Division before assuming his current post.    This position has historically been held by a person  dispatched from MOF, but starting with Yamakawa's predecessor,  this position has been given to someone from the agency proper.  It is said that people from the agency proper are getting first  crack at being named as division directors because the agency  has developed as an organization.    The very busy director of the Price Coordination Division,  which is responsible for reform of the public utility charges  for things such as gas, electricity, and telephone, is Jun  Hamano (joined the agency in 1974; a graduate of Tokyo  University, Economics Department). He has served in positions  such as head of the Economic Structural Coordination Promotion  Office in the Planning Bureau and counselor to the Director  General's Secretariat before assuming his current post. His  activities in his current post, which is the position most  focused on the problem of the distribution of the public  utilities marginal profits derived from the high yen, are  greatly anticipated. The director of the Price Research  Division, which is responsible for performing research on  prices, is Nobuhiko Kosuge (joined EPA in 1970; a graduate of  Tokyo University, Engineering Department). He has served in  positions such as senior researcher at the Economic Research  Institute and eputy senior researcher at the Middle East  Economic Research Institute before assuming his current position.  <H5>  Planning Bureau </H5>   While the Coordination Bureau is responsible for short-term  economic measures, the Planning Bureau is responsible for  midterm economic plans. Because they just completed the  "Lifestyle Superpower Five-Year Plan" in June 1992, which was  the government's new midterm economic plan, they have no major  projects in the offing; however, they are forming study  committees to look at the theme of follow-up to the "Lifestyle  Superpower Five-Year Plan." Along with carrying out the  execution of this effort, they are also recharging their  batteries in preparation for their next major effort.    The director general of this bureau is Atsushi Yoshikawa  (joined the agency in 1962; a graduate of Osaka University,  Economics Depertment). He has held positions such as director of  the International Division of the Environment Agency's Director  General's Secretariat, director of the First International  Economic Affairs Division in EPA's Coordination Bureau, director  of the Coordination Division in the same bureau, councilor to  the Coordination Bureau, and director of the Economic Research  Institute before assuming his current position. In 1978, as an  assistant to Nobuhiko Ushiba, the minister responsible for  foreign economic affairs, he had to grapple with formulation of  the market-opening policy and brought together several policy  measures during the period of high yen following the 1985 Plaza  Accord. He is from Nara Prefecture.    The councilor to this bureau is Koichi Tani (joined EPA in  1965; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics Department). On  the way to his current position, he has held posts such as  director of the First International Economics Affairs Division  in the Coordination Bureau, director of the Coordination  Division in the same bureau, director general of the MOF's  Hokuriku Financial Affairs Bureau, councilor to the Coordination  Bureau, and councilor to the Price Bureau. His trademark is his  splendid beard.    The other councilor is Yoichi Takemoto (joined the Ministry  of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF] in 1966; a  graduate of Kagoshima University, Agriculture Department). He  has been dispatched to the EPA from the MAFF. He has held posts  such as counselor in the Director General's Secretariat,  director of the Groceries, Oils, and Fats Division of the Foods  and Marketing Bureau, and director of the Director General's  Secretariat Research Division before assuming his current  position.    The only director of the first organizational division in  this bureau, Shoji Takahashi (joined the MOF in 1970; a graduate  of Hitotsubashi University, Economics Department). He has  served in positions such as director of the Secretariat Planning  Division in the Fair Trade Commission's Administration Bureau,  director of the National Treasury Division of the Finance  Bureau, and director of the Special Investigation Division of  the Administration Bureau of the Security Exchange Oversight  Committee before assuming his current post. The post of director  of the Planning Division is always given to someone dispatched  from the MOF, and this post has become the beachhead for the  MOF to have its views reflected in the formulation of the  government midterm economic plans.    The Planning Division is the only organization in the bureau  with the title of division, but the bureau also includes 10  divisional director-level senior planning officers, who are  responsible for, international economic affairs; general  industry; agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; labor and human  resources; finance; social infrastructure;, national life;  regional economics; prices; and weights and measures; and one  senior officer for Electric Power Development Planning. Each of  these officers has considerable staff under them.  <H5>  Research Bureau </H5>   The Research Bureau is responsible for carrying out various  research projects, including the "Economic White Paper," which  is published once each year, the "Monthly Economic Report,"  which is published monthly and contains the government's views  on business conditions, and the "International Economic White  Paper," which is published annually. This is the bureau in the  EPA which is most well known outside of the agency, and it is  also the bureau which is the EPA's billboard.    The bureau's director general, Seiichi Toshida (joined the  agency in 1964; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics  Department), is a government economist in the international  school, who has written and translated works such as  Reaganomics, and The President's  Economics. He has gone through an elite course of  positions, including minister's secretary, counselor at the  embassy in Washington, director of the First International  Economic Affairs Division in the Coordination Bureau, director  of the First Domestic Research Division in the Research Bureau,  director of the Secretarial Division in the Director General's  Secretariat, and councilor to the Coordination Bureau. He was  the first in the 1964 group to achieve the rank of bureau  director general. The fact that, as the director of the First  Domestic Research Division, he twice penned the "Economic White  Paper" testifies that he is a strong economist with regard to  the domestic economy as well. He has also showed his ability as  an administrator, and it is said that he is a future candidate  for the position of vice minister. He is from Kanagawa  Prefecture.    The councilor is Yasuko Niimura (joined EPA in 1967; a  graduate of International Christian University, Liberal Arts  Department). Following an official of EPA Eiko Kawana,  currently the senior researcher at the Tokyu General Research  Institute, who once served as councilor to the Economic Research  Institute, Niimura is the second female councilor to hold a  position in the EPA. She has held positions such as senior  researcher at the Economic Research Institute, director of the  Second Domestic Research Division in the Research Bureau,  director of the Social Policy Research Division in the Social  Policy Bureau, and director of the Social Policy Division of the  same bureau before assuming her current post. As director of the  Social Policy Research Division, she wrote the "social policy  white paper" three times. She incorporated a unique point of  view into the question of "social policy," and her papers  stimulated discussions on various matters. Her activities as  councilor to the Research Bureau are eagerly anticipated.    The director of the Research Bureau's first organizational  division, the First Domestic Research Division, which is  responsible for the "economic white paper," is Takao Komine  (joined the agency in 1969;a graduate of Tokyo University,  Economics Department). He has held posts such as head of the  Research Division of the Economic Department of the Fair Trade  Commission's Administrative Bureau, director of the First  International Economic Affairs Division of the Coordination  Bureau, and cabinet counselor before assuming his current  position. He has a good reputation as an economist with many  books to his credit, including Change in the Structure of  the Japanese Economy, the English translation of which was  published in an authoritative U.S. academic magazine. He is  endeavoring to make the wording of the "Monthly Economic  Report," which is said to be difficult to comprehend, more easy  to understand. If one reads this year's "white paper" it can be  understood that he makes the point of his argument very clear.    The First Domestic Research Division (formerly called the  Domestic Research Division, and the Research Division) is called  "the government economist's jewel" and it has turned out a large  number of talented personnel. These include the late Former  Foreign Minister Saburo Okita and the late Yonosuke Goto, who is  the all time record holder having penned six "white papers,"  including the 1956 edition which is known by the name, "It's No  Longer the Post-War Era." The list goes on and on, including  Hisao Kanamori, chairman of the Japan Economic Research Center,  Isamu Miyazaki, director of Daiwa Research, the late Takao  Sasaki, the former director of the Joint Research Institute for  Life Development, Takeo Takahashi, director of the same, Takao  Akabane, Keio University professor, and Yasuo Katsumura, the  former vice minister.    The director of the Second Domestic Research Division, which  is responsible for analyzing trends by region and by industrial  sector, is Kaoru Yoshikawa (entered the agency in 1972; a  graduate of Kyoto University, Economics Department). He has held  positions such as researcher in the Research Bureau, head of the  National Economic Calculation Research Office in the National  Income Department in the Economic Research Institute, and senior  researcher at the Joint Research Institute for Life Development  before assuming his current position.    The director of the Overseas Economic Research Division,  which is responsible for researching and analyzing the trends in  overseas economics and for the "International Economic White  Paper," is Minoru Ikeda (joined the agency in 1971; a graduate  of Tokyo University, Law Department). He has held positions such  as secretary to the director general, senior researcher in the  Economic Research Institute, director of the Second Consumer  Affairs Division in the Social Policy Bureau, and director of  the First International Economic Affairs Division in the  Coordination Bureau before attaining his current post.    The director of the Business Statistics Research Division,  which is responsible for researching and analyzing business  statistic trends, such as the business condition trend index  number (DI [diffusion index]), is Yoshiro Tokunaga (joined EPA  in 1969; a graduate of Osaka University, Economics Department).  He has served in positions such as director of the Price  Research Division in the Price Bureau, director of the Overseas  Research Division in the Research Bureau, and senior researcher  in the Economic Research Institute before assuming his current  job.  <H5>  Economic Research Institute </H5>   The Economic Research Institute performs basic, general  research into areas such as basic economic structure and cycle,  national income and national wealth, and other aspects of the  economy.. It is divided into the Researcher Office and the  Department of National Accounts, and the Research Exchange  Office, which was newly established in 1990.    In the Research Office, there are three supervisory  researchers, eight or fewer senior researchers, and a few guest  researchers. Famous University professors are invited to become  guest researchers, and in this way, effort is put into exchanges  with the academic sector.    Just recently, the major economics-related ministries and  agency have founded associated research institutes, namely the  MOF's Institute of Fiscal and Monetary Policy, MITI's Research  Institute of International and Trade, and the Ministry of Posts  and Telecommunications [MPT] Research Institute of Posts and  Telecommunications, to build up the arsenals of theory needed  for the execution of policy. However, the EPA's Economic  Research Institute was a pioneer for all of these institutes.    The director general of the Institute is Isoroku Sawada  (joined EPA in 1965; a graduate of Tokyo University, Mathematics  and Physics Department). He has served as director of the  Electronic Data Processing Division in the Director General's  Secretariat, supervisory researcher in the Economic Research  Institute, councilor to the Research Bureau, and councilor to  the Coordination Bureau before assuming his current position. He  hails from Kochi Prefecture.    The deputy director general is Yoichi Kojima (joined the  agency in 1967; a graduate of Tokyo University, Education  Department). He has served in positions such as director of the  Overseas Research Division of the Research Bureau, director of  the First Economic Cooperation Division in the Coordination  Bureau, and supervisory researcher in the Economic Research  Institute before assuming his current post. When he was serving  as the supervisory researcher, as part of government's technical  cooperation with Romania, where he was dispatched for three  months, he gave advice regarding the conversion of the Romanian  system to a market-based economy. In recognition for this  service, he was given a plate of thanks from the Romanian  Government.    The director of the Administrative Division, Hiroshi  Nakatsugawa (joined the MPT in 1956; a graduate of Ryokoku High  School), has served in positions such as Director General's  Secretariat Diet Communications Coordination officer, and as  head of the EPA's branch of the National Diet Library on his way  to assuming his current post.    Supervisory Researcher Masahiro Ikegami (joined EPA in 1968;  a graduate of Waseda University, Business Department) served in  positions such as head of the Price Control Office in the Price  Bureau and as senior planning officer in the Metropolitan  Infrastructure Bureau of the National Land Agency before  assuming his current position. Supervisory Researcher Masaru  Eto (joined EPA in 1971; a graduate of Kyushu University, Law  Department) has served in roles such as senior lanning officer  (responsible for prices) in the Planning Bureau before assuming  his current post.    The director of the Research Exchange Division, an  organization responsible for things such as the exchange of  researchers with foreign research organizations, is Nobuki  Sugita (joined EPA in 1977; a graduate of Tokyo University,  Mathematics and Physics Department). He has held positions such  as deputy director of the General Affairs Division of the  National Land Agency's Regional Promotion Bureau and as a  senior exchange researcher at the Economic Research Institute  before assuming his current position.    The director of the Department of National Accounts, which  is  responsible for calculating the GNP, is Yoshikuni Kobayashi  (joined EPA in 1968; a graduate of Tokyo University, Engineering  Department). He has served as a senior planning officer in the  Planning and Coordination Bureau of the National Land Agency,  chief researcher at the Japan General Research Institute, and  director of the Electronic Data Processing Division in the  Director General's Secretariat before assuming his current  post. Genjiro Watanabe (joined the MAFF in 1964; Chuo  University, Law Department), director of the National  Expenditure Division served in positions such as head of the  Production Division of the Economic Research Institute's  Department of National Accounts before assuming his current  position.    Besides the above-listed persons serving in positions within  the EPA, there are also EPA personnel serving in other  ministries and agencies. First, there is Shinpei Nukaya (joined  the agency in 1963; a graduate of Tokyo University, Liberal Arts  Department), who is serving as director general of the National  Land Agency's Planning and Coordination Bureau. The Planning and  Coordination Bureau used to be the EPA's General Development  Bureau, but it was incorporated into the National Land Agency  in a reorganization. Therefore, the director general of this  bureau is always someone dispatched from EPA. Nukaya has served  in jobs such as director of the Price Coordination Division in  the Price Bureau, director of the Planning Division in the  National Land Agency's Planning and Coordination Bureau,  director of the Coordination Division of the EPA's Coordination  Bureau, director of the EPA's Secretarial Division, and  councilor to the Planning Bureau before assuming his current  post. His activities once he returns to the EPA are greatly  anticipated.    Eiji Kawade (joined EPA in 1976; a graduate of Kyoto  University, Economics Department), is currently serving as  councilor to the National Land Agency's Regional Promotion  Bureau. He has previously served as director of the EPA's  Secretarial Division before assuming his current post. There are  other officials from the EPA who are serving in other  ministries and agency who are said to be superb personnel,  including Ichiro Shirakawa (joined EPA in 1968; a graduate of  Keio University, Graduate School of Economics), who is serving  as director of the Administrative Division in MITI's Small and  Medium Enterprises Agency; Shunichiro Ushijima (joined EPA in  1971; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics Department), who  is serving as director of the Planning Division of the National  Land Agency's Planning and Coordination Bureau; Satoshi Kawamoto  (joined the agency in 1971; a graduate of Tokyo University,  Engineering Department), who is serving as director of the  Planning Division of the National Land Agency's Metropolitan  Areas Development Bureau, and Takashige Komoda (joined EPA in  1972; a graduate of Tokyo Institute of Technology, Economics  Department), who is serving as a cabinet councilor in the  cabinet's Foreign Policy Councilors Office.    The EPA, in which the influence of MOF and MITI had been  strong, has begun to become a powerful organization and is  becoming more independent. This trend can be seen in the area of  personnel assignments as well. In these times, when the  one-party rule of the LDP has been broken and the various  parties, including the Japan New Party, are raising the banner  of the importance of standard of living, the role of the EPA,  which coordinates the government's economic policy, has become  even more important. What is required of them is to respond  adequately to the changing political situation and to develop  policies aimed at the realization of an abundant standard of  living for the people of Japan.    Although the EPA will probably be buffeted by the raging  waves of the power politics of Kasumigaseki, we would like to  hope that it will show its power as the government's  coordinating agency, standing firmly above the popular  criticisms.</p>

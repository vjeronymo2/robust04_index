			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIRGIN RESPONSE  </P> <P> I am a nurse in Sweden and since suffering a back injury in 1972 I have been  through surgery twice and have had to spend a lot of time in bed with severe  pain. The only things I can spend much time with are reading and listening to  music. Roy Orbison's music has been such a consolation to me.  </P> <P> In December, my son told me that Roy Orbison had died. I felt I had lost a dear  friend.  </P> <P> Later, I made a tape recording, in English. I spoke from my heart, about my  feelings toward Roy Orbison, and I sent the tape with a letter to Virgin  Records.  </P> <P> In May I received a wonderful letter from Paule Micallef (international manager  of Virgin Records) thanking me and promising that Roy's widow, Barbara, would  get my tape and letter. She also enclosed a CD of "Mystery Girl" in a beautiful  package with Roy's photo and some lovely words about him as an artist and as a  man. I was very moved, and I cried.  </P> <P> Virgin proved that a big company can keep in touch with the small people "out  there." Thank you, Virgin. I will never forget.  </P> <P> GUNILLA HALLIN  </P> <P> Akervagen, Sweden  </P></p>

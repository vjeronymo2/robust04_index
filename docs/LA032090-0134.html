			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> DANA POINT;  </P> <P> WHEELCHAIR TENNIS IS ON A ROLL  </P> <P> His 9-year-old brow furrowed in concentration, Nick Boehm waved his racquet as  the green tennis ball floated past him.  </P> <P> Crouched in his wheelchair, Nick missed three more times before connecting  solidly, buzzing the ball past his instructor's ear.  </P> <P> "I used to feel bad that I couldn't do a sport," he said with a smile, "but now  I can and it makes me feel good."  </P> <P> In three Orange County cities, wheelchair-bound youths are learning to play  tennis under a $50,000 grant from the Amateur Athletic Foundation, a sports  organization that was endowed with surplus Los Angeles Olympics funds.  </P> <P> "It's the first year-round wheelchair tennis program that we know of," said  Elaine Beachey of the Los Angeles-based AAF. "This program is giving the  opportunity to play tennis to kids who never had the chance before."  </P> <P> The clinics are offered in several locations in Southern California by the  National Foundation of Wheelchair Tennis, a nonprofit San Clemente group.  </P> <P> In Orange County, about 35 youngsters, from elementary school children to  teen-agers, take advantage of weekly free lessons in Santa Ana, Orange and Dana  Point.  </P> <P> But even more valuable than the opportunity to learn tennis, said instructor  Brian Geier, is the contact between youths with similar disabilities.  </P> <P> "It's a great chance for them to socialize with other kids," said Geier, who  also uses a wheelchair, "and that is very important."  </P> <P> At the Dana Hills Tennis Club, Cheryl Werth watched her 10-year-old son,  Brandon, practice his volleys under Geier's watchful eye.  </P> <P> "I'm really glad they started a weekly clinic," she said. "Brandon is improving  fast."  </P> <P> Werth grinned as Brandon stroked a solid shot into the opposite court.  </P> <P> "It sure beats having him play Nintendo all the time," she said.  </P> <P> For details, call the National Foundation of Wheelchair Tennis at (714)  361-6811.FRANK MESSINA  </P></p>

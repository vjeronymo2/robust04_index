			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report and commentary by KOMMERSANT-DAILY political </F> department: "Nonpayments Crisis; National Security Still Secure"]    [Text] The hearings that were held yesterday in the  Federation Council on the subject of the "Nonpayments Crisis in  the Country's Economy," organized by the budget committee of the  Federation Council with the participation of the Economic Reform  Committee and representatives of the government, were the  authorities' first official reaction to the president's  statement that the "nonpayments crisis is assuming a political  character and becoming a threat to the country's national  security." Nevertheless, the general tone of a majority of the  speeches was not equal to the dramatic nature of the president's  message.    Opening the hearings, Nikolay Gonchar, chairman of the  budget  committee, noted that despite repeated attempts to resolve the  nonpayments problem, the situation remains critical. It is  already a question of an insolvency crisis as a whole.    On 1 January 1994, overdue accounts payable amounted to  more than 16 trillion rubles [R] (7.1 percent of GDP). Overdue  accounts receivable reached R18 trillion. State indebtedness for  military deliveries totaled R876.4 billion, and for grain  purchases--R620 billion.    Andrey Kazmin, deputy minister of finance, noted that the  nonpayments situation (although, according to his words, their  absolute magnitude has decreased in comparison with January of  last year) was negatively affected by nonfulfillment of the  budget for 1993. Nevertheless, he expressed the firm conviction  that in the first quarter the Ministry of Finance will gradually  pay off indebtedness to the branches for the past year, thanks  to centralized credit granted by the Central Bank to cover the  budget deficit. Among other measures in the struggle with  nonpayments he mentioned the extension of credit to the end user  within the framework of one branch and "intensifying control  over pumping money into hard currency and deposit accounts."    In contrast to the speech by Kazmin (whom more restrained  members of parliament called "a little boy"), the speech of  Mariya Paramonova, deputy chairman of the Central Bank of  Russia, was greeted more favorably. After noting that the  problem of nonpayments is a problem essentially of state  enterprises (the net surpluses in the accounts of commercial  enterprises total R22 trillion), Madame Paramonova declared that  the task of the financial organs is to stimulate the use of free  resources. In her opinion, the problem of nonpayments has a  structural character, and it is impossible to resolve it only by  an interbranch offset. The recommendations of the Central Bank  looked somewhat old fashioned to a majority of the deputies:  strengthen financial control over the activity of enterprises,  enter a line in balance sheets "sold for cash," clarify which  kind of enterprises are profitable and which are not, lower the  tax rate on profits to 20 percent for enterprises that are  experiencing a shortage of circulating funds, with an assignment  of part of the income from this tax for their replenishment,  reorganize RKTs [cash account centers] into clearing centers,  and also restore the priority schedule of payments. All of this,  it is true, will require changing at minimum 20 legislative acts.    Sergey Ignatyev, deputy minister of the economy, had his own  approach to the problem. After self-critically admitting that  the government's debts constitute 50 percent of the volume of  nonpayments, he declared: As long as the government takes  unfulfilled obligations upon itself, inflation and nonpayments  will continue. To fight nonpayments, Ignatyev proposed the  following scheme: An additional account is opened for each  enterprise where it has a settlement account to which resources  of the centralized credit of the Central Bank are deposited to  pay off indebtedness. After the conduct of settlements, surplus  resources are transferred to the main account. Only in this  case, in the opinion of the Ministry of Economics, will the long  process of paying off indebtedness not cause long-term  inflationary consequences.    Yesterday's hearing, in fact, was limited to a demonstration  of the various approaches of various structures of the executive  authority to the problem of nonpayments. It is apparent that  neither the executive nor the legislative authority are yet  ready to resolve the problem of nonpayments in a radical  way--through bankruptcy of insolvent enterprises. They are  continuing to search for "milder" ways. The hearings will  continue next week, and it can be expected that the positions of  their participants will become more radical over time.  <H5>  Commentary </H5>   The first stage of the hearings "Crisis of Nonpayments in  the  Country's Economy," which took place in the Federation Council  at the initiative of its participants, graphically demonstrated  not only a lack in the government of any kind of integral  concept for solving the nonpayments situation that has  developed, but also the fact that it does not intend to allow  legislators to get near a resolution of this question. As early  as in the morning, learning of this measure in the Federation  Council, First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets announced at  his news conference that nonpayments are a matter for the  government and not the parliament. Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin (who, like Soskovets, also received an invitation  to these hearings) also did not consider it necessary to attend  them. Attendees at the hearings came to the conclusion on this  basis that the executive authority simply had nothing to say.    Meanwhile, it can be stated that the first stage of the  hearings aroused great interest among high-ranking  representatives of the industrial managerial elite. Present in  the chamber were Minister of Fuel and Energy Yuriy Shafranik,  the heads of administration of many Russian regions, deputies of  both chambers, and plant directors--in other words, all those  who felt that they were suffering most from nonpayments in the  current situation. Taking this into account, the conclusion can  be drawn that the initiator of the holding of the hearings--the  budget and finance committee headed by Nikolay Gonchar--in fact  brought additional political attention to the upper chamber of  the Federal Assembly by demonstrating that he is capable of  asking sharp questions independently, without asking for the  preliminary approval of the executive branch. Grounds for  assuming the opposite were provided as far back as the election  of the speaker of the Federation Council, when the executive  branch succeeded in ensuring the victory of Vladimir Shumeyko.  The Federation Council also undoubtedly acquired some moral  capital, by showing that it is far more concerned about the  situation that has developed in the economy of the country than  the government.    However, Nikolay Gonchar did not begin to place the  committee  in opposition to the government. Having reproached the Council  of Ministers for not yet developing a concept for combating  nonpayments, Nikolay Gonchar declared that this problem will be  resolved successfully only in the event that the efforts of the  "profile" departments, the legislative, and the executive  authorities are united. It is obvious that this is also a bow in  the direction of regional leaders who still see in government  authority the only method of solving their material problems.  The capabilities and opportunities of the Federation Council,  judging by everything, remain unclear for them.</p>

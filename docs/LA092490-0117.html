			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 900 AMERICANS TRAPPED BY IRAQ, U.S. SAYS  </P> <P> At least 900 American men, women and children are trapped in Iraq and Kuwait,  the State Department said today as it again accused Saddam Hussein's government  of barbarism.  </P> <P> At least 93 of these U.S. hostages, including many with serious medical  problems, have been detained by the Iraqi government. Nine were seized over the  weekend, one as he tried to board what could be the last evacuation flight  sanctioned by Baghdad.  </P> <P> Most of the adult male Americans in Iraq and Kuwait are in hiding, said  Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman. For the sake of their  safety she declined to provide exact figures.  </P> <P> More than 1,900 American citizens and their foreign-born family members have  been evacuated from the two Persian Gulf countries since Iraq seized Kuwait  Aug. 2.  </P> <P> Remaining behind, Tutwiler said, are 600 to 700 American citizens in Kuwait and  300 to 350 in Iraq.  </P> <P> "We find it particularly deplorable that the Iraqis have not only ignored our  request to evacuate Americans with serious medical problems, but are now  beginning to detain them," the U.S. official said.  </P> <P> She called the detention of sick people, some of them with terminal illnesses,  "barbaric."  </P> <P> Iraq has said it was using American men as human shields to deter a U.S. attack  on oil refineries and other strategic installations.  </P> <P> President Bush and senior U.S. officials have not ruled out force as a means of  compelling Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait. Basically, however, the  Administration is hoping an embargo on Iraqi commerce authorized by the U.N.  Security Council on Aug. 6 will prompt him to relent.  </P> <P> On Sunday, the Iraqi leader threatened to attack Saudi Arabia, other Arab  countries and Israel if Iraq was "strangled" by the economic sanctions.  </P> <P> Tutwiler called it "another outlandish, outrageous statement."  </P> <P> And yet, she said, "we have not seen any responsible statement toward doing  what the world is saying he must do, which is withdraw from Kuwait and let the  restoration of the legitimate government in Kuwait go back."  </P></p>

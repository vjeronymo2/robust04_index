			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Interior Minister Nahit Mentese has announced that  anybody who shows disrespect to Ataturk or deviates from  Ataturk's principles and innovations will be subject to legal  procedures without fail. Mentese stated that nobody should give  the impression that winning certain mayoral posts in the local  elections will bring a new order; that a new order is in office;  or that the applications, institutions, or regulations of  democracy will change. Mentese's statement to the Turkish Radio  and Television regarding the issue is as follows:    [Begin Mentese recording] Local administration elections  were held under the supervision and inspection of legislative  bodies according to Article 79 of the Constitution. The  elections were held in peace and security. Participation was  high. The elections were observed by the foreign and local  press, the media, and the world. Our judges and prosecutors are  assessing the allegations of fraud.    Those who won the elections should not overreact and those  that lost the elections should respect the results. Nobody  should give the impression that by winning certain mayoral posts  in the local elections they will bring a new order, a new order  will come to office, or that democracy's applications,  institutions, or regulations will change. Those who won the  mayoral posts in certain areas have only the right to serve and  take care of regional and local needs as stipulated by law.  The winning of the mayoral elections in certain areas does not  give them the right to have their say, to rule, or to govern  provinces, districts, or for that reason the country.    In order to govern the country it is necessary to gain  control of the legislative authority, the right to make laws,  and also to capture the power named the executive power. In  order to govern the country, it is necessary to be a government.  It is out of the question that this power and authority can be  acquired by winning certain mayoral posts and local council  memberships.    Furthermore, according to the Constitution, local  administrations are under the jurisdiction and control of the  general administration. They are obliged to operate according  to the existing laws and cannot overstep their authorities,  transgress the laws, or conduct arbitrary procedures.    All of us in this country will live according to the  principles of Ataturk, the Constitution, and democracy with its  institutions and regulations. Our citizens should respect each  other whatever their way of life or views and should approach  each other with love. Nobody should think that he can impose  his political tendencies, believes, or ways of life upon others  and nobody should behave in that direction.    Anybody who opposes the laws, trespasses his authority in  the  line of duty, or deviates from great Ataturk's path by  dissociating from his principles and innovations, will be sent  to the concerned independent judicial authorities for the  implementation of necessary legal procedures and punishment.

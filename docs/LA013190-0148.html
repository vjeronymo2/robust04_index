			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GORBACHEV'S ONE GERMANY STAND HAILED;  </P> <P> EAST BLOC: APPARENT ACCEPTANCE OF REUNIFICATION IS VIEWED AS BOOST TO REFORMS  IN COUNTRY REELING FROM MISMANAGEMENT.  </P> <P> West German leaders today praised Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's  apparent acceptance of reunification as a signal that may instill hope in East  Germans fearful of the uncertainties of reform.  </P> <P> Chancellor Helmut Kohl called the Kremlin chief's latest comments on German  unity "encouraging," and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said Gorbachev  had "correctly analyzed" the volatile situation in East Germany.  </P> <P> East Germany's official news agency ADN said that by making clear his change of  mind on the German question, Gorbachev "once more confirmed for all the world  his reputation as a politician of realism."  </P> <P> Support for union with prosperous West Germany has surged among East Germans in  recent weeks as the depths of their political and economic crises have become  clear.  </P> <P> East German Premier Hans Modrow acknowledged in a speech to Parliament this  week that the nation was on the verge of economic collapse and said mounting  tensions forced him to move up free elections to March 18.  </P> <P> As many as 2,500 East Germans have been leaving each day, convinced that they  stand a better chance starting over in the West than trying to rebuild their  nation, driven to the brink of destruction by 40 years of Communist  mismanagement.  </P> <P> Anti-Communist sentiment has swelled among the population of 16 million,  sparking mass demonstrations and labor strikes to protest the distrusted  party's continued hold on the reins of power.  </P> <P> A Lutheran pastor gave refuge to former leader Erich Honecker after he was  released from prison Tuesday, and church officials reported today that their  humanitarian action prompted insulting phone calls and threats by parishioners  to leave the church.  </P> <P> Honecker, who ruled for 18 years before being forced out of office in October  by the peaceful pro-democracy uprising, faces trial in March on a treason  charge.  </P> <P> Modrow, a reformer who is more trusted than most of his fellow Communists, was  forced by the growing hostility toward his still-dominant party to bring nine  opposition representatives into his Cabinet.  </P> <P> The pro-democracy forces joining Modrow were to submit their proposed ministers  by today, and three of the parties publicly announced the names of the  representatives they put forward.  </P> <P> The Social Democrats, who were hesitant to enter into a coalition with the  political parties blamed for East Germany's current crises, nominated Walter  Romberg, who has not played a prominent role in the party to date.  </P></p>

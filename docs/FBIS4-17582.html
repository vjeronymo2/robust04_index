			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Volkov report: "Security Council Takes a Closer </F> Look at Information"]    [Text] In its meeting yesterday the Russian Federation  Security Council's Interdepartmental Commission on Information  Security considered the fundamentals of a concept of the same  name. Its authors expect that the information security concept  will be finalized by November, but even at this stage they  kindly suggested that the press familiarize themselves with its  basic provisions.    According to Vladimir Rubanov, deputy secretary of the  Security Council, without an "adequate solution" to information  problems "it is hard to talk about national security." Among  such problems Mr. Rubanov mentioned the exercise of the  citizens' right to information. "This problem should be  resolved for political reasons" at least because these rights of  citizens have been set forth in the Constitution, "but the  existing structures cannot ensure them."    Mr. Rubanov said also that for the purpose of protecting  Russia's intellectual potential a possibility should finally be  given "to registering information as a commodity." Among other  things, the draft concept calls for the recognition of  information as an object of ownership and its introduction in  "economic circulation."    In addition, Mr. Rubanov called for a conception of  "protectionism" in the area of production and distribution of  information, warning that far from all distributors of  information, including a number of firms specializing in data  bases, act "in conformity with Russia's vital interests." In  other words, the state is seriously concerned by the leakage of  formerly secret materials of scientific-technical or economic  nature to its "partners," former opponents of the USSR. The  Security Council will apparently urge the introduction of  licenses and certificates for the distributors of information,  particularly exporters.    It seems encouraging that the Security Council, at least the  part of its staff that deals with working out the information  security concept, thinks it necessary publicly to declare that  if citizens are to exercise their constitutional right to  information, it requires appropriate legislation, including  direct-action laws. Just as important, information has been  introduced "in economic circulation" as "a crucial national  resource comparable with energy resources" (in Mr. Rubanov's  words). Maybe this will correct to some extent the usage of the  term "commodity producer," which is currently applied to those  who produce "material values," not to designate those who  actually manufacture marketable products.    Naturally, the preliminary presentation of the concept has  also left numerous questions unanswered. According to Mr.  Rubanov, power structures will have an "auxiliary role" to play  when the concept and enforceable enactments on its basis are  worked out. If this is really so, so modest a role for the  special services will be a first, of sorts. Of course, one will  be able to find out how "auxiliary" it is only when private and  commercial producers and buyers of information face the  consequences of this idea in practice.    For the time being, however, materials presented showed the  desire to pass "between the Scylla of secrecy and the Charybdis  of misappropriating information resources with no holds barred."  Since the drafters of the concept concede that it would be more  advantageous for the state to establish "a high level of  secrecy," the other components of society should evidently  champion the "no- holds-barred" approach, so as not to veer off  toward Scylla.</p>

The meters, which show how much electricity domestic appliances consume and give an instant electricity bill, are being tested and promoted by Offer, the electricity industry watchdog.

Professor Stephen Littlechild, Offer's director-general, said sophisticated meters would be essential in 1998, when the electricity market would be fully deregulated.</p>

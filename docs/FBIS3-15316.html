This Is How the Results of the Parliamentary  Elections Can Be Interpreted"]    [Text] Chisinau -- The initial results of the elections in  Moldova provide a basis for forecasting the upcoming 6 March  national poll on unification with Romania. The defeat for the  People's Front clearly reflects the population's failure to  countenance the slogan of unification with Romania. Even at  this stage, it can be said that victory has been won by  supporters of the republic's independence.    Some 42 percent of the votes went to the Agrarian-Democratic  Party, while the left-wing bloc embracing the socialists and the  "Unity" movement received 25 percent, with just 6 percent of  voters favoring the People's Front alliance. Petru Lucinschi,  chairman of the old parliament who ran for the agrarians,  expressed the conviction that the Agrarian-Democratic Party will  win the right to form a new government. The majority of seats  in the new parliament will go to the agrarians and left-wing  parties. The People's Front, together with the "Peasants and  Intelligentsia" bloc which is standing on its platform, can  expect one-fifth of the deputies' mandates at best.    If victory for the agrarians was wholly predictable, the  information received from the southern regions, which declared  their intention to vote just two weeks before the elections,  came as a shock. Having boycotted Moldovan political life for  over three years, this region, which is densely populated by  Gagauz and Bulgars, demonstrated by far the greatest  zealousness. Around 90 percent of voters went to the polls. By  expressing confidence in the republic's new parliament in  advance, the Gagauz are hoping, having obtained President  Snegur's word, to draw attention to the fate of their region in  the opening days of session. If the status of the south is  again evaded by the deputies, the Gagauz will return to their  original demand for an autonomous republic.    However, the majority won by the agrarians and socialists in  the new parliament in practice nullifies this outcome. A real  basis for resolving the problem of the Dniester region will  emerge.    The agrarian region's population expressed a preference not  for the party of the same name but for the socialists. The  left-wing bloc represents the ethnic minorities most broadly.  Given that, in terms of candidate profiles the other parties  are in fact mono-ethnic, then it is not surprising that the  Gagauz, the Bulgars, and the Russian-speaking population from  the central part of Moldova cast their votes in favor of this  bloc. Nevertheless, owing to the Dniester region's  nonparticipation in the elections, the ethnic profile of the  republic (35 percent of whose inhabitants are not Moldovan) will  not be reflected in the new legislative organ.    Simultaneously with the poll on the status of Moldova, there  will be a referendum in the south inviting the population to  decide whether it agrees that the southern regions should  develop as an autonomous national-territorial formation within  Moldova. An affirmative response depends directly upon the  final disposition of forces in the new parliament.</p>

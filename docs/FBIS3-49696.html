The  operation will not continue any longer, Ruzena Misonova, a  member of the working group, told CTK today.    Misonova said that the operation, which had been first  initiated by the Czechoslovak Government and later continued by  the Czech one, enabled 1,812 Volhynian Czechs to move to the  Czech Republic, of whom 889 were repatriated in 1991, 505 in  1992, and 418 in 1993.    Three hundred applications for repatriation remain to be  settled. As no law exists on conditions of repatriation of  ethnic Czechs living abroad, these and other possible applicants  will be treated in the same way as any foreigners who ask for  permission to stay permanently in the Czech Republic and for  Czech citizenship, Misonova explained.    The Association of Volhynian Czechs and Their Friends  insists  that at least one official from the Interior Ministry should be  charged to settle the problems of Czechs from Volhynia. Vaclav  Landa, the association's representative in charge of the  repatriation, told CTK that the association was likely to ask  the Economics Ministry to solve the present situation.    Volhynia is a historical region situated in Ukraine where  many Czechs moved in the course of the 19th century, creating a  significant, economically, and culturally active ethnic  minority. Their total before World War Two was about 40,000.    In 1946-47, a large number of Volhynian Czechs were  repatriated under an inter-governmental agreement.</p>

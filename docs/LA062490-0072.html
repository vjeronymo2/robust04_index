			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE MONORAIL IS NO PIPE DREAM  </P> <P> On May 29, the Irvine City Council finally approved the half-mile monorail  project for McDonnell Douglas Realty Co.  </P> <P> On June 9, the headline on a Los Angeles Times story read: "County Says Airport  Monorail Ad Is Premature."  </P> <P> And on June 17, the public received additional wisdom from a Times editorial:  "Dreams of a Monorail and Reality: Irvine's Plan for a Half-Mile Link to  Airport Deserves Study, but Details Are Needed."  </P> <P> Apparently some in the community expect immediate results. Once we received  approval, they expected to be riding on the monorail almost overnight, like one  of those homes that's built in 24 hours.  </P> <P> Well, I am sorry to say it just doesn't work that way.  </P> <P> Also, I wasn't aware that we should continue studying the monorail. Instead, we  went immediately into design drawings and, frankly, we are ready to pour  concrete right now.  </P> <P> But our recent ad in The Times did one wonderful thing: It got our message and  an illustration of our beautiful monorail and twin 23-story office towers (the  tallest ever built in Orange County) to the public.  </P> <P> And boy, did they respond. Of more than 500 responses we received, only one was  skeptical.  </P> <P> We never anticipated the outpouring of sentiment and enthusiasm that we got  from a tiny coupon in the ad.  </P> <P> Our monorail constructor, the Transportation Group Inc., has the design of the  cars and the equipment well under way. Just last week, I inspected some of  their beautiful new cars at Walt Disney World. These cars handle almost 200,000  people a day, more than Bay Area Rapid Transit in San Francisco.  </P> <P> So you see, fortunately, we are dealing in reality, in concrete and steel and  electrical equipment that has already been tried and proven and that will soon  be in operation. And, by the way, George Rebella and the airport staff couldn't  be more cooperative. They're on the monorail train saying "full speed ahead."  </P> <P> I just read where we are close to getting a $1-million federal grant for a  five-city monorail study. And, of course, the passage of Proposition 116  providing $125 million for the city of Irvine is a giant step forward.  </P> <P> But I know what you are all saying: "I will believe it when I see it."  </P> <P> I urge The Times to keep a sharp eye on the foundations and guideway at the  airport.  </P> <P> Close your eyes tightly and dream of a world without smog and gridlock, but  instead filled with silver, silent, gliding vehicles transporting the rich and  the poor in air-conditioned comfort.  </P> <P> A mirage may appear in the form of an actual car on top of the guideway. This  beautiful vision will become reality later this year with the installation of  the initial guideway.  </P> <P> BOB YOUNG  </P> <P> President, McDonnell Douglas Realty Co.  </P></p>

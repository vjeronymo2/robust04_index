			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VERBAL CLASH SYMBOLIZES DIVISIONS IN AIDS STRUGGLE  </P> <P> AIDS patient advocates and traditional medical representatives clashed here  Friday over results of controversial new treatments, with the leader of an  underground drug-testing program announcing "powerful" new findings and the  editor of a prestigious medical journal denouncing him for practicing "black  magic."  </P> <P> The confrontation came at a panel discussion on the third day of the  International Conference on AIDS after Martin Delaney, head of unsanctioned  experiments organized by his San Francisco-based Project Inform, released  sketchy data purporting to show improvements in some AIDS patients who received  the drug, Compound Q.  </P> <P> Dr. Arnold Relman, editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, a symbol of  the medical establishment to many AIDS activists, chastised Delaney's findings  and, more generally, took issue with patients' efforts to disseminate  information on potential treatments such as Compound Q.  </P> <P> "If (inaccurate information) gets out without being reviewed by unbiased  experts and gets acted upon, it leads to a lot of bad possibilities," Relman  said. "Money is wasted, time is wasted. . . . There is great initial  enthusiasm, and then despondency, pessimism and despair."  </P> <P> The clash provided a graphic metaphor for a contentious and crucial debate  between the two main camps in the struggle to contain -- and, it is hoped,  eventually conquer -- the AIDS virus: patient advocates who seek rapid answers  and progress through experimental treatments, and established medical  researchers who are wedded to painstaking scientific methods.  </P> <P> Increasingly, AIDS patients and activists are growing impatient with the  deliberate pace of medical research into the disease and are demanding  widespread use of experimental drugs they believe could hold the key to  overcoming AIDS.  </P> <P> As Delaney noted Friday, debates about clinical trials are "more than academic  discussions. For many members of my community, they are life and death  questions."  </P> <P> The debate inside Moscone Center was a more restrained version of the raucous  confrontations outside where activists from the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power  (ACT UP) have been demanding new, quicker research methods in an attempt to  speed life-saving drugs to patients.  </P> <P> ACT UP/New York, for example, issued a treatment research agenda this week  listing 60 antiviral drugs, nine immune-system enhancers, 20 anti-infectives  and 12 other AIDS drugs that the group said should enter clinical trials in  1990 or 1991 based on favorable test-tube data.  </P> <P> ACT UP also called for the immediate release of seven drugs that have been  tested extensively and urged that another dozen be considered for release on  the "parallel track." The parallel track, pioneered last year with the  antiviral DDI, allows patients access to a drug while it is being studied for  efficacy.  </P> <P> Inside the meeting hall, Relman admonished Delaney, saying "there is no way on  earth for anyone to interpret" the sketchy information Delaney presented.  "Report your data fully to a responsible scientific body or medical journal,"  he advised. "Let's proceed in an orderly, rational, scientific way."  </P> <P> At a press conference outside the center later, AIDS sufferer Joel Thomas  offered a counterpoint to Relman's argument. He said his failing health had  been turned around by six infusions of Compound Q, a Chinese drug purified from  the root tubers of a cucumber-like plant known as Trichosanthes kirilowii.  </P> <P> Thomas asked Relman if he would try Compound Q should he be diagnosed with AIDS  and failing on standard therapies.  </P> <P> "I would probably do the same thing," Relman conceded.  </P> <P> In releasing his finding on Compound Q, Delaney said his optimism was based  upon improvements in the mean counts of Helper T cells, key sentinels of the  immune system, the destruction of which is a hallmark of AIDS, in 46 patients  after they were infused with drug.  </P> <P> He acknowledged that "this is a very dangerous drug" and added that it is too  early for patients to make a treatment decision based upon available data. At  least one patient died during the underground trial.  </P> <P> Underscoring the risk of Compound Q was another study authored by Dr. Larry  Waites and co-authored by Delaney. The study, which will be presented at the  conference today reported that 6 of 16 patients developed dementia between 36  and 60 hours after infusion, and two progressed to comas. The neurological  problems were reversed with the administration of the drug decadron.  </P> <P> The Chinese drug Compound Q -- and its American counterpart, GLQ223, made by a  Redwood City, Calif.-based company called Genelabs -- have been mired in  controversy since Dr. Michael McGrath published a paper in April, 1989,  reporting that GLQ223 killed certain cells infected with the human  immunodeficiency virus in test-tube experiments.  </P> <P> However, at least five other laboratories, using various viral strains and  different culturing and assaying techniques, have been unable to demonstrate  antiviral activity. McGrath, a UC San Francisco researcher said in a  presentation here that he believes he succeeded where others failed because he  performed his experiment in Teflon vessels rather than the plastic dishes  typically used by researchers. McGrath said the Teflon test-tubes best  approximate conditions in the human body, though other researchers remain  skeptical.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of different assay systems and it is an awfully complex  situation," said Jeffrey Lifson, Genelabs vice president for research. "The  ultimately bio-assay is going to be the patients."  </P> <P> Researchers from UC San Francisco today will report the first patient data from  their Phase 1 safety trial of GLQ223. Their preliminary findings showed no  significant change of HIV infection but that the drug warranted further study.  </P> <P> Some of the 18 patients, especially those receiving higher doses, had flu-like  side effects.  </P></p>

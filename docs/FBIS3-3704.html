We should  strive to push the region's economic growth onto a new stage and  try to have the region's gross national product quadrupled three  years ahead of schedule or even earlier.    Chairman Cheng Kejie expressed the hope that propaganda and  ideological work in the region's economic domain will focus on  the following aspects at present:    1. Correctly guiding public opinion and making it contribute  more to reform, opening up, and modernization drive;    2. Publishing comprehensive, objective, and accurate reports  to reflect facts and true situations;    3. Adhering to a fine style of seeking truth from facts and  speaking the truths to boost morale and achieve tangible work  results;    4. Conscientiously studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as  party and state policies and principles, actively carrying out  explorations, and continually raising work standards.    On the afternoon of 5 March, comrades attending the regional  propaganda and ideological work conference unfolded panel  discussions at which persons in charge of Liuzhou City, Yulin  Prefecture, Baise Prefecture, and various regional departments  and bureaus exchanged views on the region's propaganda and  ideological work.

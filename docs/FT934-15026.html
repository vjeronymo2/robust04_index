			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Radio station chairman produces pirate decoders THE CHAIRMAN of a Birmingham commercial radio station has built up a multi-million pound business making and supplying pirate decoder cards for a wide range of subscription satellite channels in Europe. Mr Chris Cary, a former pirate radio broadcaster on Radio Caroline, runs an electronics company in Camberley, Surrey, which is offering unauthorised decoders for channels using the EuroCrypt security system. The channels include Scandinavian channels TV 1000 and the three channels of TV3 plus Filmnet, the English-language film subscription broadcast to the Low Countries, and Filmmax, another film subscription channel. Hard core pornography is available late at night on some of the Scandinavian channels. Supplying decoder cards for TV 1000 and the TV3 channels, based in the UK, is almost certainly a criminal offence in the UK. Mr Cary said yesterday he was selling Buzz FM, his Birmingham-based radio station, in a Pounds 500,000 deal. Hi-tech piracy, Page 8</p>

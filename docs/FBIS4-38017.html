			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, June 26 (AFP) -- Saudi  Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal met a senior Omani  official here Sunday [26 June] to discuss the conflict in  neighbouring Yemen, where northern forces launched a new  intensive bombardment of the southern stronghold of Aden.    Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Yusuf Bin-'Alawi  'Abdallah paid a brief visit to Jeddah and held talks with  Prince Sa'ud, Arab diplomats said, only a day after a senior  northern Yemeni envoy had visited Oman.    Meanwhile fighting raged in the suburbs of Aden, following  the collapse of the fifth ceasefire to be announced in the  two-month-old civil war.    Oman and Saudi Arabia played a key role in securing the  adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 924 of June 1, which  called for an immediate ceasefire. Oman currently chairs the  Security Council.    On Saturday 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, a member of the  northern Yemeni presidential council, handed a message to Sultan  Qabus of Oman from Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih.    The northern Yemeni authorities blamed the south for  violating the latest ceasefire, declared by Sanaa late Saturday.  It was set for midnight (2100 GMT).    "The (southern) rebel outlaws violated the ceasefire and  continued their aggression against our armed forces in the Aden  and Hadhramawt provinces," a northern spokesman said.    The northern Yemeni cabinet held a special meeting Sunday to  discuss the ceasefire, Sanaa radio said, but ministers learned  of the renewed fighting during the meeting. [passage omitted]</p>

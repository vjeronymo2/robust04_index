			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Russians step up pressure on rebels in Chechnya Fighting intensified yesterday around the Chechen capital of Grozny, and there seemed little doubt that Russia has committed its troops to a final battle with Chechen forces. Russian soldiers were still holding back from an assault on Grozny itself, but the conflict, which threatens the stability of the Russian government, was entering a new phase in the rebel Caucasian republic. Early yesterday, Russian jets tried to knock out the TV tower in Grozny. They also failed in an attempt to bomb Chechen president Dzhokar Dudayev's residence, Chechen officials said. Further raids took place during the evening and Chechen television briefly went off the air. Support for a decisive military campaign came from a meeting of Russian ministers and senior parliamentarians in Moscow. Interfax news agency reported that the meeting had decided to 'eliminate' illegal groups, and that the flight of much of the civilian population from Grozny and surrounding areas had helped 'the actions of the Russian armed forces'. The meeting blamed General Dudayev for refusing to negotiate, although Mr Leonid Smiryagin, an adviser to Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, said talks were still possible. However, he said that the Chechen leader would have to come to Mozdok, the Russian base near the Chechen border. Last night Gen Dudayev again asked for talks but it was not clear if he was ready to meet Russian conditions for starting them. Mr Smiryagin hinted at the justification for an advance on Grozny: 'So far, there is hope that Dudayev maintains some kind of order in the city. If it fades, reports will start to come about looting of the population and anarchy, and the federal authorities will have no way out other than to storm the city.' Yesterday's fighting was concentrated around the settlements of Dolinskoye, 20 miles from the capital, and Petropavlovsk, six miles north-east of Grozny. Reporters said many houses in the Dolinskoye area were destroyed or in flames. Opposition in Russia to the war remains strong, even among senior military officials, and the divisions are echoed by the Russian leadership. Lieutenant General Valery Vostrokin, a deputy minister for emergency situations, said in neighbouring Ingushetia yesterday that the army should not be used to establish order on Russian territory. Interviews with officers and soldiers have also revealed a widespread dislike of the duty in Chechnya. When the centre does not hold, Page 14</p>

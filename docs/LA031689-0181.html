			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> MCorp Estimates Big Loss: MCorp, the second-largest bank company in Texas and  the latest to receive a federal bailout, estimated that it lost $903 million  last year. The Dallas-based firm, which operates 26 banks throughout Texas,  lost $213 million in the fourth quarter -- more than its $174-million loss for  all of 1987, according to quarterly documents filed with the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corp. But MCorp has been fighting to resurrect itself. In October,  its management asked FDIC for $1 billion to supplement $400 million in private  capital it lined up for a restructuring. The company has also raised $630  million by shedding assets.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- Slow progress in the  "framework" trade talks between Japan and the United States will  have little impact on the planned meeting of the two nations'  leaders, a ranking official at Japan's trade ministry said  Friday.    "It was agreed when we resumed the talks that no deadline  should be set for the negotiations," said the International  Trade and Industry Ministry official.    The two countries are at the negotiation table to establish  a  new "framework" for bilateral trade, with the priority on three  areas -- automobile and auto parts, government procurement of  telecommunications equipment and medical equipment, and  insurance.    The talks, which started last summer, ran into a deadlock in  February but resumed in May.    The MITI official said Sozaburo Okamatsu, trade vice  minister  for international affairs, will have talks with Jeffrey Garten,  U.S. undersecretary of commerce, for a few days from next Monday.    They are expected to discuss whether the discussions will  remain incomplete at the time of the Japan-U.S. summit meeting,  the official said.    Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. President Bill  Clinton are scheduled to hold talks in Naples prior to the July  8-10 annual summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized  nations.    Negotiators in the framework talks have reached partial  agreement on the automotive area, such as on a proposal to set  up a third-party organization to evaluate the effects of Japan's  market-opening measures.    But the two sides are still far apart on the so-called  "objective criteria" by which to gauge foreign access to the  Japanese market.    The MITI official said neither side is striving for a  "partial agreement" in order merely to show progress before the  Japan-U.S. summit.    The official said the issue of government procurement, on  which working-level talks are scheduled for next week, is  supposedly the area in which negotiations are showing the most  progress.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Sedgwick Sedgwick still looks like a company living beyond its means. The halved dividend is covered less than 1.5 times and expenses grew faster than revenue last year. At least the lower payout should stem the cash outflow of the last four years. The company might also argue that expenses can only be cut so far before business volume starts to suffer. But without a sharp upturn in revenue growth, Sedgwick will have little room for manoeuvre. New business initiatives and the drive for consulting income may help, but the big gains will only come from a turn in US underwriting. That looks as distant as ever.</p>

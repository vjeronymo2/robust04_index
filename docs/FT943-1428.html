			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Congress near agreement on lobbyist curbs The US Congress moved closer yesterday to passing legislation severely limiting the favours its members may receive from lobbyists. But with only two weeks remaining before recess, Republicans threatened to block action on other substantive legislation, including a watered-down healthcare reform bill, proposals to change the financing of election campaigns and a measure protecting Californian desert lands from development. The lobbying breakthrough came with the agreement of a joint House-Senate conference committee on a unified bill to be presented to the Senate early next week and the House shortly after. Both passed different bills earlier in the year. The bill would prohibit members of Congress and their staffs from accepting meals, entertainment, travel, legal defence fund contributions and all but the most inexpensive gifts from lobbyists. Campaign contributions would not be covered. The estimated 13,000 paid lobbyists in Washington would be obliged to register with the government (only about 4,000 now do). They would also be required to disclose their financing and expenditures, whom they lobby and on what issues. The issue has populist appeal in advance of the November mid-term elections in which the anti-Washington mood of the nation is already evident. The defeat on Tuesday of Congressman Mike Synar of Oklahoma in a Democratic primary and the re-election problems of Mr Tom Foley, Speaker of the House (19 points down in his Washington state district, according to a poll out yesterday), were tart reminders of this political reality. But the Republicans showed themselves disinclined to hand the Democratic leadership and President Bill Clinton anything that could be portrayed as victories during the November polls. A mainstream group of senators, including some moderate Republicans, continued to press for modest healthcare reform improving coverage for pregnant women, children and the aged. Most on Capitol Hill now consider the cause of healthcare lost for this session, though Senator George Mitchell, majority leader, refuses to concede defeat. Senate Republicans also threatened to use an obscure parliamentary device - known as the post-cloture filibuster - to prevent action on campaign finance reform, an issue high on President Clinton's agenda. This bill would place financial ceilings on the amount that could be spent in any race and would provide for partial government financing.</p>

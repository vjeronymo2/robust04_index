			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As described above, notwithstanding the chance of actual emissions increases, EIP's may authorize trading from an allowables baseline when the EIP is submitted in conjunction with, or following, the submission of the applicable progress plans, and the allowables baseline is consistent with those plans. Under these circumstances, trading on the basis of allowables would not jeopardize the progress requirements. In some cases, the EPA will permit trading to occur on the basis of allowables prior to submission of the attainment demonstration SIP. However, once the State has submitted any applicable progress plans due at the time of EIP submission, the State has made significant progress towards attainment. This significant progress, coupled with the sanctions provisions that provide strong safeguards that the State will develop a SIP requiring any subsequent progress plans and an attainment demonstration, provide, in the EPA's judgment, sufficient evidence that an EIP authorizing an allowables baseline submitted in conjunction with an applicable progress plan will not jeopardize continued progress or attainment. In addition, States and sources should be aware that any emission limit relaxations approved through an EIP may be subject to ongoing scrutiny, and further tightening, if it is unexpectedly necessary to do so as part of an attainment demonstration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, as described above, the EPA will permit EIP's that authorize trading from an allowables baseline in the case of source categories, or portions of source categories, that are newly subjected to the RACT requirement under the RACT ``catch-up'' provisions of section 182(b)(2). Under these circumstances, the imposition of RACT-level controls meets the RACT requirement, as described above, and is expected to result in emissions reductions with respect to the affected source categories or sources taken as a whole, even if some of the affected sources conduct emissions trades based on allowables. The fact that overall emissions from these source categories or sources will be reduced indicates that with respect to these source categories, progress is being made towards attainment. This progress provides adequate assurance that any such trades on an allowables basis will not jeopardize progress or attainment requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a SIP does not include a required RACT emission limit for a source, that source may not participate in an EIP until an appropriate RACT limit is determined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions described above apply as well in the case of a statutory EIP. That is, under the circumstances described above, a statutory EIP may incorporate a flexible baseline as long as the EIP as a whole provides the required reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A State may define a program baseline to address a variety of equity considerations, such as differing degrees of emission control among affected sources prior to the start of the EIP. While emissions reductions creditable towards a specific required demonstration will be calculated according to the requirements for that demonstration, the EIP may use a different baseline. For example, a declining value marketable permits program, submitted in conjunction with an areawide RFP or attainment plan, could initially allocate mass emissions caps on the basis of allowable emissions. However, to the extent that such a program baseline exceeds the aggregate actual emissions for the sources covered by the program, the EIP baseline allocation would be required to decline at a rate consistent with achieving the areawide RFP milestone as measured against the RFP baseline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EIP must clearly specify whether the program baseline applies to aggregate emissions from all affected sources (similar to the RFP baseline) or to individual sources (similar to source-specific LAER requirements, for example). If historic emissions are relevant in setting the program baseline, the time period must be specified in the program. Provisions must be made for determining baselines for sources not active during the specified baseline time period. Also, the averaging time associated with a program baseline for emissions must be specified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Quantification Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An EIP must describe how emissions and changes in emissions will be quantified for SIP credit. If other measurable factors are essential to an EIP, the quantification procedures for those must be specified in the program. For instance, if emissions reductions are generated by reducing total usage of a type of solvent, procedures for measuring solvent usage are critical. The program must specify the minimum required credible, workable, replicable procedures for quantifying emissions, which could include emission factor calculations, direct emission monitoring, calculation procedures which are a function of process parameters, production practices or volume, or inventory usage, or other procedures, as appropriate. Criteria for selecting quantification methods and time-averaging considerations are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States must carefully consider matching their environmental goals with various aspects of the program when determining adequate quantification procedures. For example, a procedure wholly adequate for determining compliance with long-term mass emissions caps may be clearly inadequate for a program aimed at limiting peak daily emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-DEA AGENT: IS FUGITIVE TEMPTING FATE IN L.A.?  </P> <P> He is a man on the run -- a black belt karate champion described as "a man who  could throw his gun away and rip your head off."  </P> <P> But four months into an international manhunt -- with initial reports that he  might have been headed for Spain or Mexico -- former federal drug agent Darnell  Garcia has apparently chosen to run only as far as North Hollywood.  </P> <P> On Friday both police and Garcia's former colleagues were asking why?  </P> <P> The questions came as the manhunt -- at least for the moment -- shifted away  from Europe and Latin America to a shabby neighborhood surrounding the  intersection of Lankershim and Victory boulevards in North Hollywood.  </P> <P> The investigation's focus returned to Los Angeles when a Los Angeles Police  Department officer said he recognized Garcia pretending to be on a stakeout  Jan. 6 at the intersection.  </P> <P> Garcia, sitting in a late model blue Ford LTD, reportedly flashed the officer a  hand sign indicating he was a law enforcement officer and also showed a badge  that looked like he was with either the DEA or the U.S. Customs Service.  </P> <P> Police officials were baffled Friday at why he would appear to be tempting fate  so blatantly.  </P> <P> Garcia's friends and some of his former colleagues in the DEA were even more  amazed. And some were openly skeptical that the man they knew as a street-wise  and tough narcotics agent would ever make himself so vulnerable to capture.  </P> <P> "I can't believe it," said Donald Hugh, one former DEA agent who worked with  Garcia for years and supported him during a lengthy racial discrimination fight  that preceded the current criminal case against Garcia and two other ex-agents.  </P> <P> "Obviously, Darnell is not a stupid person," Hugh added. "I frankly can't guess  where he is. But if he is still in town, he'd be like a U-Boat -- so far  submerged he'd be off sonar. I can't believe he'd be driving around in cars and  waving at policemen."  </P> <P> Garcia, 42, was charged Nov. 22 along with two other former DEA agents -- John  Jackson and Wayne Countryman -- with an alleged money-laundrying scheme. He  eluded surveillance agents just eight hours before his pending arrest and has  been a fugitive ever since.  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors say that additional charges involving large-scale cocaine  dealing will also be filed in the case.  </P> <P> The federal prosecutors who charged Garcia declared him a menace to potential  witnesses in the case long ago, describing him as a world-class karate champion  with deadly connections among drug dealers in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> They were blocked by a federal judge's gag order from any comment Friday on why  Garcia, who had resigned from the DEA in August, 1987, may have chosen to  remain in Los Angeles and what possibly could have lured him to North  Hollywood.  </P> <P> But there was no restraining order on Los Angeles attorney Mark Borenstein, who  successfully represented Garcia for years in a discrimination case against the  DEA and who has argued that federal prosecutors have deliberately exaggerated  Garcia's potential for violence.  </P> <P> "I have thought that Darnell was here since the case started," Borenstein said.  "He has his wife and his son here. . . . I just hope that he will come forward.  This is kind of the last fight for him in a lot of fights against the DEA, and  I think he can win it."  </P> <P> Borenstein said he was not surprised by reports that Garcia had been spotted in  Los Angeles, and he predicted that as soon as Garcia "believes he can get a  fair bail hearing," he will surrender to authorities.  </P> <P> The lawyer, now representing Garcia's wife in an effort to prevent the Internal  Revenue Service from seizing their $581,000 home in Rancho Palos Verdes, added  that he thinks one reason his former client remains a fugitive is the  government's effort to seize all his assets as the illegal profit of alleged  drug trafficking.  </P> <P> While Borenstein expressed concern about Garcia's ability to raise bail, others  spoke of the increasing danger he faces from Los Angeles law enforcement  agencies because of the latest reports that he has been seen armed, possibly in  search of witnesses who could testify against him.  </P> <P> "It sounds to me like they are setting the guy up for problems," said former  agent Hugh.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Appeals for His Surrender  </P> <P> Agreeing that Garcia faces increasing risks if he truly is running around Los  Angeles passing himself off as an active DEA agent, former drug agent Tom  Martin, who once supervised Garcia in Los Angeles, appealed to his ex-colleague  to surrender.  </P> <P> "I think the thing for Darnell to do is give serious consideration to getting  with his attorney and turning himself in," said Martin, now a private  investigator in Orange County.  </P> <P> "I'm not smart enough to know what Darnell is thinking," said Martin. "My  feeling is he probably is in fear of his life."  </P> <P> Amid the speculation Friday, the intensity of local law enforcement's interest  in capturing Garcia was revealed with dramatic force near the same intersection  where Garcia was reportedly seen Jan. 6.  </P> <P> At a bus stop near Lankershim and Victory, Hollywood resident Hugo Monzon  Gonzales, approached by a Times reporter, identified a color photo of Garcia  and said he was at that moment inside a nearby dance club called La Zona Rosa.  </P> <P> Within minutes of the report, a dozen LAPD officers were on the scene and two  police helicopters were hovering overhead. There was no Garcia to be found,  however.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Chameleon-Like Nature  </P> <P> While still an area of interest to the agents hunting for him, Garcia's plush  neighborhood in Rancho Palos Verdes was considerably more quiet, a reminder of  the former DEA agent's chameleon-like nature.  </P> <P> Garcia, his wife and his son lived in high-style in one of the semi-custom  houses that adorn the Island View subdivision, high on a bluff overlooking the  Pacific Ocean.  </P> <P> Borenstein said Garcia's wife, Adaline, continues to live in the house with  their son. He said they are rarely seen because they spend much of their time  with her mother nearby.  </P> <P> Interviews with his neighbors Friday revealed a man occasionally outgoing and  sometimes secretive. During conversations with neighbors, Garcia would  sometimes tell them that he worked as a jeweler. Sometimes he wouldn't say  anything at all.  </P> <P> "He was always very nice to me," said neighbor Karol Plocky.  </P> <P> About the only thing that stood out about Garcia, besides what neighbors called  his "menacing" appearance, was that he seemed to have a tremendous amount of  free time. A few neighbors noted that he spent a great deal of time in his  house and wondered how he could afford to live in the neighborhood without  working. Several said they were stunned when they found out he had been a DEA  agent.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping by Rolf </F> Kleine; place and date not given: "Scharping: Unification  Surcharge Until All Debts Are Settled"]    [Text] [Kleine] In the event of an election victory of  the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], the party wants to  increase the unification surcharge for "high-income earners" to  10 percent. Do you want to enter the election campaign as the  party that advocates tax increases?    [Scharping] We are paying too many taxes and fees. For this  reason, I want to reduce the burden for 80 percent of taxpayers.  Thus, Kohl wants to raise taxes for everybody, but I only for  the top earners.    [Kleine] You want to introduce a 10-percent unification  surcharge for single people who earn 60,000 German marks [DM] or  more per year and for married couples who earn DM120,000 or more  per year. Over what period of time are you thinking?    [Scharping] Until all the inherited burdens from the shadow  budgets of the current Federal Government are removed.    [Kleine] Your traffic expert Christoph Zoepel has suggested  increasing the gasoline price by 20 pfennigs per liter...    [Scharping] The SPD election program will not include an  increase in the gasoline tax. Waigel wants to do that. His  financial planning for 1996 provides for this measure.    The politicians in Bonn are preparing for the next tax lie.  The SPD wants jobs and justice. The whole debate must be seen  in this context.    [Kleine] You are commuting between Mainz and Bonn every day,  and you work late into the night. Is the stress ruining you?    [Scharping] My normal working week has 100 hours, sometimes  more. There are many things that I have to settle personally.  I do not and will not have an automatic signing machine. One  can only do this job if one enjoys doing it and does not see it  as a burden.    [Kleine] The young socialists in southern Hesse want to  poison a small dog in protest against the deportation of Kurds...    [Scharping] This is the absolute ultimate in tastelessness.</p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Recruitment: Cop-out or blow-up, the saga ends - Compared with the strides made by medicine, training and selection methods have scarcely stirred Week by week the mystery mounted as the hooded killer struck again and again. Most mystified of all were the masked murderer's two prime targets in the old Eagle comic's serial story, though they were finally saved when he accidentally topped himself instead. The saga closed as the heroes unmasked him, revealing a face they had never seen before. 'But who is he, why did he want to kill us?' gasped one. To which the other replied: 'We shall never know.' Of thecountless ways there are to end a story, that example always struck me as the worst possible cop-out . . . Until now, when the task of winding up my 21 years of writing Jobs columns has made me see that the Eagle's ending is the best in the book. For I fear that my only alternative to copping out in the words that follow, is going to be to blow up. The reason is that I cannot look back on much progress towards solving the problem which has been this column's central concern. It is how to ensure that society's most important jobs are filled with the people best able to do them. That is not to say there has been any lack of supposed solutions. On the contrary, they have come winging in thick and fast. The trouble is that, to judge by their effect on the British economy at any rate, they don't work. Indeed, compared with the strides made by medicinein even my adult lifetime, our skills at equipping and selecting people for theworkplace have hardly stirred. But that hasn't prodded either governments or managements to seek different techniques, as opposed to importing essentially similar but more elaborate methods in the hope of patching over the glaring deficiencies of those already in use. The daftest case of such symptom-treating that I've seen happen in Britain is to my mind the one that will prove most damaging as well. It began with the big expansion of higher education in the 1960s, which has been made to look small by the further expansions of recent years. Even at the outset, however, nobody bothered to work out how the increase wasto be paid for. The expansionists just assumed that, besides making the countrymore civilised culturally, the injection of more graduates into the workforce would somehow generate greater national prosperity to boot. So political panjandrums and other establishment spokesmen called on employers to restrict their recruiting for the better-paid career opportunities to young people with degrees. The employers, after first responding slowly, have done so with growing bureaucratic vigour ever since. Although thousands of graduates have been left unemployed by the latest recession, it has nevertheless boosted their average chances of finding worthwhile work in preference to young people without degrees. The only real change is that, instead of just screening out any applicants lacking graduate status, employers now further screen out many who possess it by the use of psychometric-type tests. Meanwhile, of course, the long promisedboosts in productivity and civilisation remain most noticeable by their absence. Moreover - as I reported three weeks ago - a researcher called Dr Derek North, who works for Britain's official employment service, has come up with evidence not merely that academic qualifications such as degrees are poor predictors ofjob-performance, but also that using them to screen out applicants may be illegal under the race-equality act. Yet a further irony lies in other research by Dr Mark Cook of University College, Swansea, which indicates that the psychometric testing imported to patch over the deficiencies of academic credentials is likewise prone to the same two faults. The reason, which I also reported three weeks back, lies in the criteria by which such recruitment tests are 'validated' or, in lay terms, judged to be reliable predictors of success in the type of job for which the recruiting is being done. And since the issue is at least asimportant as any other I've seen arise these past two decades, I'm going to saymore about it albeit at the expense of adding more to some readers' no doubt already heavy feeling of deja vu. If a test is to be reliably predictive, by the principles of Britain's equality laws at least, the criteria by which it assesses candidates need to be clearly linked with objective measures of good performance in the work concerned. Examples include value of orders in selling, andvolume of output in certain production jobs. The snag is that, in most other types of work, comparably objective measures of achievement rarely if ever exist. So the bulk of selection tests are validated on more subjective criteria,the most popular being ratings of employees' performance by their bosses. Dr Cook puts the number of tests dependent on such criteria at between 60 and 80 per cent of the total in use. But his research has further weakened the case for many of them by showing that bosses' ratings of their staff, in particular, are typically influenced by personal prejudices and political expedients which have no bearing on the abilities actually needed to do productive work. In which case, it must be doubtful that such tests would stand challenge under the equality law. So what - apart from prematurely joining me in depressed impending retirement - can the hard-pressed recruiters best do? Well, for one thing, they might look around for psychometric measures which, even though bereftof links with objective performance criteria, at least avoid the pitfall of being validated on bosses' ratings of their staff. One of the happier innovations of recent years is the notion of 'internal customers': the people within the same outfit who really know the difference between good and bad service from a particular employee. An example is newspaper sub-editors who have to wrestle with the outpourings of writers like me. While I'm told that there are at most a very small handful of tests validated on internal customers' ratings availableas yet, it would surely be worthwhile to encourage development of more. And since many of you readers seem to be admirably placed to do the necessary encouraging, I beg you to do your best to advance the cause. Unfortunately, the more deeply entrenched stumbling block of over-expanded academic education will take much greater effort to cut down to size. One sign of hope, for Britain anyway, is the government's decision that intakes of new degree students must be cut by 3.5 per cent for 1994-95. But since some of the necessary measures are radical - including a shift of emphasis back to apprenticeship-type training from classroom teaching - I doubt that they will readily be taken by politicians who go around mouthing slogans about 'back to basics' in the existing schools. Even so, my final wish as the FT's jobs columnist is that at least some of you will help to goad mere sloganisers to think a bit instead. One way is by taking up the cudgels whenever you hear anyone implying nonsenses such as that an adequate stock of appropriate work-skills can be achieved by having more youngsters pass academic exams. Which said, although it may be judged more cop-out than blow-up, like the old Eagle's pair of heroes, I shall mercifully neverknow. Either way, as long as I live I'll be grateful to you for reading me, as well as for your many letters wishing me godspeed. Farewell.</p>

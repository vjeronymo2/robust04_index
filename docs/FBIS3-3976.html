			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 24 (CNS) -- The improvement and  further development of relations between China and the United  States lay in joint efforts by the two sides based on the  principles of the three Sino-American Joint Communiques, a  spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said this  afternoon. The achievements reached by the two sides during a  visit by U.S. Secretary of State Mr. Warren Christopher showed  such effort being made by the Chinese side.    The spokesman, Wu Jianmin, stressed that China did only what  it was allowed to do by law. He added that the key to good or  bad relations between two countries did not lie in the same  ideology or social system but rather in how many mutual  interests they shared. He noted that following the visit by Mr.  Christopher both China and the United States knew that the  interests of the two powers were vast and they shared mutual  interests in many fields even though they had deep differences  in some matters. Because of this the future relationship  between China and the United States in no way merited pessimism.    In other developments, Portuguese Prime Minister Mr. Anibal  Cavaco Silva will pay an official visit to China between April  10 to 16 at the invitation of Chinese Premier Mr. Li Peng.    The 50th annual convention of the United Nations Economic  and  Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific will be held in New  Delhi, India, between April 5 and 13. Vice Minister of Foreign  Affairs Mr. Liu Huaqiu will head the Chinese delegation to  attend the meeting.</p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV/VIDEO  </P> <P> The Federal Communications Commission has turned down a petition from the  National Hispanic Media Coalition to deny the license renewal for KCET Channel  28, it was learned Monday. The coalition had sought the denial, charging that  the public broadcasting station discriminated against Latinos in employment and  did not have an adequate plan to hire minorities in upper-level positions. The  FCC, in a letter to the coalition, stated that it believes KCET has generally  complied with the commission's rules in minority hiring. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

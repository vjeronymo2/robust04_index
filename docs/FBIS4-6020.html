			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 15 (KCNA) -- A congratulatory  message came to the great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song today  from the Central Standing Committee of the General Association  of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) on his birthday.    The message says the over 80-year-long glorious history of  the respected leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song is the noblest  history of the people's leader who has performed great feats  that will be recorded for ever in golden letters in the history  of the homeland and in the human history of the struggle for the  cause of independence.    It notes that after embarking on the road of revolution, he  founded the immortal chuche idea and has victoriously led the 20  years of the anti-Japanese revolution and the 50 years of  creation and construction and built a powerful socialist state  independent, self-sustaining and self-reliant in national  defence, in the country.    It stresses that he has successfully solved the question of  succeeding to the cause of socialism and carrying it to  completion.    "The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il with brilliant  intelligence, extraordinary leadership ability and deep love for  the people has ushered in a great heyday of the cause of chuche,  developing the chuche idea founded by the respected leader to be  the guiding idea of the era of independence," it notes.    The message says Koreans in Japan, with the honor and pride  of being overseas citizens of chuche Korea, will make a greater  contribution to implementing "10-point programme of the great  unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the country"  put forward by the great leader and achieving the reunification  in the '90s.    It wishes Generalissimo Kim Il-song good health and long  life.</p>

Police, gendarmes and troops launched a joint security sweep  using helicopters to search the mountainous area near Tazoult,  400 kilometres (240 miles) southeast of the capital, following  Thursday's mass breakout.    Their search is being hampered by the difficult terrain  which  nationalist fighters used to hole up during the 1954-62 war of  independence from France.    The Algerian authorities has so far refused to officially  confirm the escape, the most spectacular since the start of  fundamentalist violence in Algeria two years ago.    The Algerian authorities have rounded up thousands in a  crackdown on Islamic fundamentalists who launched a bloody  guerrilla war against the secular administration following the  January 1992 cancellation of a general election the now outlawed  Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win.    According to the sources around 150 Islamic guerrillas  attacked the prison around 7:00 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Thursday  during the Ramadan meal break when security was lax, killing  four prison warders, the sources added.    It was not clear whether the operation had been launched by  the Islamic Group (GIA) or its rival Armed Islamic Movement  (MIA), the sources said.    Some 400 fundamentalists serving life sentences also escaped  in the jail break, as well as 200 criminals with common law  convictions.    Tazoult prison accommodates 3,000 detainees, many of them  considered particularly dangerous. [passage omitted]</p>

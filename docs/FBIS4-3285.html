			<p>BFN     [Text] Tashkent, 19 Apr (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese  Premier Li Peng delivered a speech this afternoon at the  Uzbekistan Parliament to hundreds of parliament members,  government officials, and notable figures from various circles.  In the speech, he dwelled on Sino-Uzbekistan relations, China's  basic policy for developing ties with Central Asia, its position  on establishing a new world political and economic order, and  other major issues. He also gave a brief account of China's  domestic situation and foreign policy.    President Karimov of Uzbekistan was present.    Li Peng said: President Karimov and leaders of other Central  Asian nations have visited China in the past two years or so. I  have now embarked on a tour of our good neighbors Uzbekistan,  Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan at the invitation of  the leaders of these Central Asian nations, bringing with me the  friendship of the Chinese people. Such frequent exchanges of  visits between the leaders of China and the Central Asian  nations is unprecedented in history and signifies that relations  between China and the Central Asian nations have entered a new  era.    China and Uzbekistan are good neighbors. The two countries  shared many similarities in the past and do so today. The  ancient silk road once linked the two nations closely together.  Today, both of our nations are concentrating on building their  own countries; they both want a long-term stable international  environment; and they both want to develop equal and mutually  beneficial cooperation and establish long-term, stable  good-neighborly relations. I believe that through this visit,  the two nations will certainly enhance mutual understanding and  step up cooperation. This will undoubtedly further boost the  ongoing friendship between the two nations.    Li Peng said: The friendship between the Chinese people and  their counterparts in Central Asia dates back to ancient times.  Today, with increasing contact with the rest of the world, the  Central Asian nations are writing new chapters in promoting  common development and friendly exchanges between Asia and  Europe. China attaches great importance to its relations with  the Central Asian countries and with them, we are willing to  work to build a new silk-road, with a perspective toward the  future and the next century. China's basic policy on developing  relations with the Central Asian nations can be summarized in  the following four points:    First, maintaining good-neighborly relations and peaceful  coexistence. China and the Central Asian nations are close  neighbors, some sharing common borders. It is the shared desire  of the Chinese and Central Asian peoples to be friendly  neighbors, for it serves our fundamental interests. As the  Chinese people are concentrating on building their own country,  they need a long-term stable and peaceful international  environment, a good surrounding environment in particular. We  have always cherished good will toward the Central Asian  peoples, and will remain your good friends and neighbors  forever. China seeks no self-interest or sphere of influence in  the world, including this region. Even when China becomes more  developed or prosperous in the future, it will never seek  hegemonism or power politics. Instead, China will always  maintain equal and friendly relations with its neighbors. You  can be fully confident that no matter what happens in the world,  China will not change this policy. We keep our word.    Second, promoting equality and mutually beneficial  cooperation and seeking common prosperity. Economic cooperation  and trade are an important aspect of our bilateral relations. A  good beginning has already been made in this regard, but there  is still a lot that can and should be done. In developing  economic cooperation with the Central Asian nations, China  strictly abides by the principle of equality and mutual benefit,  and attaches no political conditions. We would like to work with  all the Central Asian countries to constantly improve the  environment, expand the scope and enhance the quality and level  of cooperation, and with mutual benefit, march along the path of  common development.    Third, respecting the independent choice of the Central  Asian  peoples and never interfering in their internal affairs. As the  world is diversified, the national conditions of the Central  Asian nations differ from each other. There has never been and  can never be a unified mode of development that suits the  realities of all countries. We believe that the Central Asian  nations, just like China and other countries in the world, are  entitled to independently choose the social system, concept of  values, and path of development compatible with their national  conditions. It is our conviction that the Central Asian nations  are fully capable of and have the wisdom to handle their own  matters well.    Fourth, respecting other countries' independence and  sovereignty, and contributing to regional stability. China  sincerely hopes to see the maintenance of long-term peace and  stability in central Asia. We appreciate and support all  efforts made by central Asian countries to safeguard their  independence and sovereignty, promote regional peace and  stability, and enhance friendship and cooperation among nations.  The development of our relations with any Central Asian nation  is not directed against any third country, and we are willing to  see the Central Asian countries living in harmony with each  other. China is also ready to develop friendly relations with  all countries in the world, particularly neighboring nations,  including Russia and other CIS countries. The development of  Central Asian nations depends on world peace and stability,  while the world needs a stable and prosperous Central Asia.    Speaking of the world situation today, Li Peng said: On the  whole, the world is still locked in complicated and profound  changes. Therefore, the establishment of a new international  political and economic order represents the urgent desire of all  the peoples in the world. The new international political and  economic order we advocate is different in essence from the old  order which was marked by hegemonism and power politics. We  believe such a new order includes many contents, but its core is  as follows:    -- In handling international relations, the principles of  mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual  non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal  affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence  should be strictly followed.    -- The right of different nations to choose the social  system  and mode of development compatible with their national  conditions should be respected.    -- All nations, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor,  are entitled to participate in international affairs, which  should not be determined by one or several big countries.    -- Disputes between nations should be settled in a fair and  reasonable way through peaceful negotiations, in the spirit of  equal consultation, mutual understanding, and mutual  accommodation. When conditions are not ripe, disputes can be  shelved temporarily, in an effort to seek common ground while  reserving differences. Disputes over some issues should not  hamper the development of normal nation-to-nation relations.    -- Trade and economic cooperation should be conducted in  line  with the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and exchange of  equal values. Developed nations face unshirkable  responsibilities for gradually reducing the gap between the  North and South.    Li pointed out: The establishment of a new political and  economic order of the world is a long-term and arduous task. We  are ready to work unremittingly toward that, along with all  countries in the world.    In his speech, Li Peng also gave a brief account of China's  domestic situation. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's -- the chief architect of China's reform and opening  up -- theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics,  China has made remarkable progress in reform, opening up, and  the modernization drive since the late seventies. From 1979 to  1993, China's economy grew at an average annual rate of 9  percent or more. As living standards improved in both urban and  rural areas, our cause has gained the general and whole-hearted  support of the people. China is now enjoying economic growth,  political stability, national unity, and social progress. Under  the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang  Zemin at its core, the whole nation, full of confidence, is  marching continuously along the path of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics.    In conclusion, Li Peng said: China's development requires a  lasting stable domestic environment and an international  environment of long-term peace and stability, especially a good  environment in its neighborhood. Today, mankind is marching  toward a new century. For the bright future of China and the  world at large, China will make every effort to manage its own  affairs well; unswervingly pursue an independent foreign policy  of peace; develop friendly relations and cooperation with all  countries, especially neighboring nations, on the basis of the  five principles of peaceful coexistence; and make a new  contribution to peace, stability, and development in Asia and  the world as a whole.</p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICHARD ALATORRE  </P> <P> Your reading audience includes many Hispanics like myself, who are in need of a  fair, impartial and accurate newspaper, who for years have turned to the Los  Angeles Times. However, the time has come to look elsewhere, because your  articles depict us negatively, focus on our infirmities and neglect our  redeeming values.  </P> <P> Bill Boyarsky's "Crossover Dreams" (Oct. 22) is a case in point. It spends the  first four paragraphs debasing Councilman Richard Alatorre as a collection  agent, jabs with negative facts that he has twice divorced and is a drunk, and  follows up with remarks to the effect that only the Hispanics could like such a  man. You may counter that the writer verified those facts and is entitled to  his opinion. Perhaps, but this is a matter of emphasis.  </P> <P> For a moment, think of yourself as a Hispanic and review that article; for an  instant, permit yourself to read the story with an understanding of its effect  on our youth. Will you not observe the parts of the story as insensitive?  </P> <P> ALFREDO MAGALLANES  </P> <P> La Mirada  </P></p>

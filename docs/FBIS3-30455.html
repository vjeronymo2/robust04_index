The fire which was extinguished at 0900 did not result in  any  leakage of radioactive substances and no one was injured,  Brandejs reported.    The fault, which caused reactor output to sink to 30  percent,  did not affect the nuclear safety of the bloc, Brandejs said.  The fault has been provisionally rated as zero on the INES  scale.</p>

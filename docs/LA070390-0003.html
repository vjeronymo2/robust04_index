			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> MEDIA GUIDE TILTS TOWARD THE RIGHT;  </P> <P> REPAP 1990 MEDIA GUIDE: A CRITICAL REVIEW OF THE MEDIA'S RECENT COVERAGE OF THE  WORLD POLITICAL ECONOMY EDITED BY JUDE WANNISKI POLYCONOMICS/REPAP ENTERPRISES  $19.95, PAPERBACK; 540 PAGES  </P> <P> The "Repap Media Guide," now in its fifth edition, is not a guide to all the  media. It deals overwhelmingly with print media. Only 10 of its 540 pages deal  with broadcast media.  </P> <P> Nor is Repap a guide to all the print media. It deals only with American print  media. The Canadian press is covered in eight pages. The British Press per se  is not covered at all, although the Financial Times and The Economist are  included.  </P> <P> Nor is it a guide to all the American print media. Newspapers are covered much  more heavily than magazines, and the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal  and the Washington Post more heavily than other newspapers. On Repap's list of  90 "Highest Rated Journalists of 1989," 45 come from those three newspapers.  </P> <P> Nor is it a guide even to all that those three newspapers do. The limitation  concealed by its title is revealed by its subtitle: "A Critical Review of the  Media's Recent Coverage of the World Political Economy."  </P> <P> Have you won a Pulitzer Prize for drama criticism? Don't expect to find your  name in Repap. The arts have no place here. Neither does cultural coverage in  the broader sense. And neither, to name a more surprising omission in a guide  with money and power on its mind, does science. The guide has something of the  same labeling problem as one of Jude Wanniski's books does. Titled "The Way the  World Works," that book turns out to be a primer in supply-side economics.  </P> <P> For one-third of its length, Repap is an "Overview of the Print Media" with  separate entries on individual newspapers and magazines. As a brief statement  of the state of each publication, the guide is clear, concise and informative.  Any working journalist who had received a job offer from one of the listed  publications could read the relevant entry and show up for an interview  basically in the know.  </P> <P> For two-thirds of its length, however, Repap descends to personalities with a  vengeance. It offers free-wheeling, tendentious capsule evaluations of the work  of individual reporters and editors in the areas it cares most about; namely,  "Commentators, Financial Reporters and Columnists, National Security/Diplomatic  Correspondents and Social/Political Reporters." Like restaurants, journalists  in these categories are awarded one, two, three or four stars.  </P> <P> The markedly conservative slant of the editors means that reporters critical of  the Bush Administration tend to be taxed as tendentious or -- a favorite tag --  "fashionable." Writing of Joseph Lelyveld, whom it names as the likely next  editor of the New York Times, Repap opines: "Lelyveld's journalistic weakness,  we suspect, is a personal commitment to 'human rights,' as he understands the  term, in a way that may engage him emotionally." Distressing indeed.  </P> <P> Reporters supportive of the Administration, by contrast, tend to be praised as  objective and independent. Conservative journalists are, in general, watched a  bit more closely than liberal ones are. Last year, observing that Michael Novak  hadn't written much lately, Repap ventured to hope that he might pick up the  pace a bit in the coming year.  </P> <P> The most outspoken liberal journalists, however, never go unnoticed. Alexander  Cockburn of The Nation receives three stars and an entry in which he is coyly  praised for "the street fighter's tendency to go for the most vulnerable spot  of an opponent other than the jugular." Hit 'em high, hit 'em low, hit 'em  where. . . .  </P> <P> Not all entries are animated by the editors' conservative bias, but, in a way,  most of the best entries are. The way to lose the Repap editors may not be to  hold liberal views but, whatever your journalistic ability, to forgo  immediately identifiable political plumage. Politics arouses Repap as nothing  else.  </P> <P> It was Mike Wallace, if I recall correctly, who remarked after years of  interviewing that interesting people talk about three things: politics, sex and  religion. Repap, omitting the latter two, is energetic but narrow in the way  that people who care only about money and power often are. Still, no one in or  near the print media will fail to find something of interest in this volume,  and people who find Capitol Hill and Wall Street the only really interesting  parts of the country may find it the last media guide they'll ever need.  </P> <P> I do not suggest any increase in Repap's coverage of culture and the arts,  since I doubt that the Polyconomics/Repap team could really do the job even if  it tried. I do suggest, however, that even on its own terms, the guide could do  a better job with science and technology.  </P> <P> It claims that the major stories of 1989 were "Communism's Crackup and  Crackdown," "Drugs and Crime" and "Planet of the Year," meaning  environmentalism and, in particular, the Greenhouse Effect, on which, "taken as  a whole, the news media did its worst work this year." But if a science story  can be judged one of the three stories of the year, why do science journalists  not rate a category of their own in Repap?  </P> <P> The world political economy of Repap's subtitle will change profoundly if the  environment, the carrier of life, becomes the bringer of death. Next year, will  Repap mock Earth Day as the non-story of the year, and will it again ignore  science journalists as a group? One fears it will, but given the fact that this  guide has, for the moment, no serious competition, one can only hope it won't.  </P> <P> Next: Jonathan Kirsch reviews "Lawyers and Thieves" by Roy Grutman and Bill  Thomas.  </P> <P> </P></p>

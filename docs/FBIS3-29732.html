Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa, answering a question put  by  Former Foreign Minister Michio Feb. 18, said "in case economic  sanctions are adopted by the UN Security Council with a final  breakdown of agreement between North Korea and the IAEA, the  Japanese Government would show a responsible response." This  cannot be construed otherwise than a deliberate act to block a  solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and bring  the situation back to the extreme phase.    Such act of the Japanese authorities blatantly getting on  the  nerve of the DPRK well shows that although they "appreciated"  in word the result of the negotiation between the DPRK and the  IAEA in Vienna Feb. 15, unable to ignore the unbiased public  opinion, it was a reluctant talk and they still pursue, in  actuality, the policy of isolating and stifling the DPRK through  "economic sanctions."    They have long since threatened "economic sanctions in the  form of ban on imports and exports, ban on remittance, ban on  the entry of ships into ports and freezing of North Korea's  assets." This is a criminal act which may cause an  unpredictable, dangerous result.    Even at this time when the DPRK and the IAEA have reached an  agreement on the inspection for the continuity of safeguards,  the Japanese authorities are talking about "full-scale routine  and ad hoc inspections" and "responsible response." It is not  hard to guess that their ulterior intention is to frustrate the  DPRK-U.S. talks at any cost, obstruct a fundamental solution to  the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and step up in real  earnest their ambitious plan to convert Japan into a nuclear  power on the pretext of the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the  DPRK.    Their vicious scheme to put "economic sanctions" on the  peaceloving DPRK by branding it as a "nuclear culprit" while  keeping mum about their criminal attempt to build a nuclear  power deserves criticism from unbiased public opinion.    The Japanese reactionaries' outcry for "special inspection"  and "economic sanctions" in duet with right-wing conservatives  of the United States is as good as trying to push the DPRK out  of the Nonproliferation Treaty. It is self-evident that such  developments would bring irrevocable, grave consequences to  Japan, too.    The Japanese reactionaries must clearly see the staunch will  of the Korean people who always maintain independence and are  fully prepared for any contingency.    They must look straight at the trend of the times, act with  discretion and immediately stop the criminal campaign for  "economic sanctions" against the DPRK.</p>

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / All-items retail prices index rise surprises City The cost of household goods and clothing rose last month, as retailers tried to push prices back up again after heavy discounting earlier in the year. Food costs also rose slightly, partly due to higher milk prices stemming from reform of the Milk Marketing Board. However, motoring costs continued to fall, largely as a result of cheaper petrol prices. Overall, the Central Statistical Office yesterday said that the all-items retail prices index rose to 145.3 in November from 145.2 in October, with 1987 taken as the base year of 100. This was 0.1 per cent higher than in the previous month, and 2.6 per cent higher than last November. Measured without mortgage interest payments, the 'underlying' index - the Treasury's preferred measurement of inflation - rose 2.3 per cent in the year to November, compared with rises of 2 per cent in September and October. The increase surprised the City, which had been expecting that the underlying index would barely rise as retailers sought to boost sales by more price cutting. Analysts had predicted that the all-items index would fall by 0.1 per cent in November, compared with October. However, economists yesterday pointed out that though the data suggested that the inflation trend was now turning upwards, the size of last month's rise appeared to have been slightly exaggerated by some special factors. The start of the supermarket price wars last November, for example, meant that the annual inflation in food prices this November looked particularly high. Food costs rose 0.3 per cent between October and November, and by 2.1 per cent in the year to November. This accounted for 0.14 percentage points of the 0.2 percentage annual rise in the all-items index. A 3.6 per cent monthly rise in milk prices due to the reforms of the Milk Marketing Board accounted for 0.04 percentage points of this overall increase. Non-seasonal food prices also rose, although there was heavy discounting on soft drinks and turkeys. Clothing and footwear prices rose by 0.5 per cent in the month, after recording a surprise fall in October. However, heavy discounting throughout the year meant that prices remained 0.1 per cent lower than last November. Prices for furnishings, electrical appliances and other household goods also rose sharply, after a bout of mid-season sales in the autumn. Household goods were 1 per cent higher in November than October - the sharpest monthly increase for at least 20 years.</p>

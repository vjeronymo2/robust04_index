			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Raso lark ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Alauda razae <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )._1991 petition, ICBP endangered,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed U.S. endangered; a songbird of the family Alauidae, closely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related to the common Old World skylark; known only from Raso, one of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the islands in the nation of Cape Verde off the west coast of Africa.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This species was once common and widespread on Raso, but declined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drastically because of a severe drought in the 1960s (E). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population may have fallen to only about 20 individuals in 1981.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Numbers subsequently increased to at least 150, but the species is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potentially threatened by climatic fluctuations (E), human settlement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A), and predation by introduced rats (C).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ibadan malimbe ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Malimbus ibadanensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )._1991 petition, ICBP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endangered, proposed U.S. endangered; another small weaver of the family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ploceidae, about the size of a house sparrow and with red markings;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> known only from southwestern Nigeria. The restricted range of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species is subject to intensive forest clearing (A). Although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered common when it was first discovered in 1951, it subsequently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> became very rare and prospects for survival are not favorable. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ibadan malimbe does seem to have a limited tolerance to habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification, and the Service would be interested in obtaining more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information about its potential to sustain itself.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Algerian nuthatch ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sitta ledanti <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )._1980 petition, ICBP rare,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed U.S. endangered; a member of the family Sittidae, about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> size of a house sparrow but with a compact build, a long beak, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grayish coloration; known only from Mount Babor in northern Algeria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Discovered in 1975, this small arboreal species is dependent on forest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat, including standing dead wood for nesting. Such habitat is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being reduced by lumbering, fire, grazing of domestic livestock, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removal of dead wood for forestry management (A). About 80 pairs were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated to survive in 1982.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Canarian black oystercatcher ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Haematopus meadewaldoi <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )._1980  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petition, ICBP extinct, proposed U.S. endangered; a shore bird of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> family Haematopodidae, somewhat like a rail but with much stouter bill  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and legs, generally black plumage; known with certainty only from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eastern Canary Islands, a Spanish possession off northwestern Africa.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This species seems always to have been uncommon and there have been no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definite records since about 1913. It may have disappeared because of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> human disruption of its limited habitat and harvesting of the mollusks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on which it fed (A), and because of predation by introduced cats and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rats (C). Four apparently genuine reports of black oystercatchers_two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on Tenerife in the Canaries and two on the coast of Senegal in West  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Africa_were made from 1968 to 1981, and give hope that the species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> still exists. The species is being included in this proposal based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the recent reports and on the reasonable prospect of rediscovery. Rare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and elusive species are routinely found alive after years, decades, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> even centuries of presumed extinction. Indeed, rediscovery of two of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the other birds covered by this proposal_the Madagascar serpent eagle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the Madagascar pochard_was announced while the proposal was being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drafted. The October 1993 issue of the journal  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Oryx <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  contains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> announcements that three species_a bird, a mammal, and a reptile_none  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of which had been seen for at least 30 years, had all been found alive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife already includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many such rediscovered species. Examples are the parma wallaby  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Macropus parma <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), which was thought extinct for 33 years; the dibbler  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Antechinus apicalis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), which was thought extinct for 83 years; and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mountain pygmy possum ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Burramys parvus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), which was thought to have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disappeared many thousands of years ago in the Ice Age. The Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> makes a special request for new information that might help assess the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> status of the Canarian black oystercatcher and for informed opinions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from authorities as to its appropriate treatment. Such comments, or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lack thereof, will be considered in the development of any final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and could lead to a decision not to proceed with the listing of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Seychelles lesser vasa parrot ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Coracopsis nigra barklyi <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )._1980  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petition, ICBP endangered, proposed U.S. endangered; a member of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> family Psittacidae, generally dark brown in color and about 10 inches  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (25 centimeters) long; known only from Praslin, one of the islands in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Seychelles, a nation off the east coast of Africa. Originally common on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the island, this species declined rapidly in the mid-20th century as its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> palm forest habitat was destroyed by human cutting and burning (A). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one remaining population was estimated to number about 30 to 50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals in 1965, though it subsequently may have increased to about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 100 after efforts were made to protect it and its remaining habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (King 1981, Silva 1989).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / N-reactors in east 'need more funds' WESTERN countries must make more money available to help meet the estimated DM12bn (Pounds 4.1bn) cost of making nuclear power stations in Russia and the rest of eastern Europe safe, according to Mr Adolf Huttl, head of the KWU energy division of Germany's Siemens industrial group. He said the foreign exchange portion of this, to finance imports into the affected countries of vital equipment such as new control instruments, could be kept to about DM4bn. Western industry also had to work closely with the countries to build up the volume of local supplies and contracts in such work. This would account for the other DM8bn. Mr Huttl said the figures applied only to the 63 pressurised water reactors  -just over half of which are in Russia - built with Soviet technology. He added the funds so far made available by the EC only covered studies and planning work.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Gavrilenko article: "Neighboring Foreign </F> Countries Were, Are, and Remain a Zone of Russia's Vital  Interests"]    [Text] Our Russian passion for proverbs and sayings is  universally known. You will recall that even U.S. President  Reagan was fond of impressing us by using old Russian folk  sayings. God himself ordained that we should "stigmatize" our  own deeds with a scathing phrase. Which is what we do. Recall  this one: "The Russian peasant is wise after the event." First  he does something, then he scratches his head and says: "Well,  why did I do that...." Is he annoyed with himself? That is  hard to say.... But is the Russian not offended when, in the  fourth year of his state's existence, he hears the foreign  minister saying clearly, firmly, but too late: "The CIS and  Baltic countries are the region where Russia's paramount vital  interests are concentrated. It is from there that the main  threats to those interests stem." Thank you, Andrey  Vladimirovich, for this unambiguous and definitive comment at  the recently concluded Foreign Ministry conference on questions  of Russia's foreign policy in neighboring foreign countries.    To be fair, this idea began to be expressed, albeit timidly,  back in 1992. But nevertheless it was not unjustifiably timid  in Russian terms. It was drowned out then by the thunder of the  collapse of the Soviet empire, the euphoria caused by the  acquisition of sovereignty, and the unfeigned and sincere joy of  the fledgling Russian democracy at the appearance of a number of  sovereign states nearby. Yes, yes, joy, because it had helped  in the struggle of those selfsame Baltic republics against the  Union center. This support may only have been moral but it was  support nonetheless. But the naive expectation of requited love  from the newly independent Balts gave way to disappointment --  the Soviet "occupation forces" became Russian. Forces of  occupation, as we know, have to leave. Then people remembered  that in this regard the Gorbachev center was not all that bad:  It tried to set a five-year term for the "divorce" of the young  sovereign states from their hated "master."    Everyone, both those who had fled from the Union and  Russia's  democrats, saw this as merely an attempt to preserve the empire.  However, there was another aspect too -- the geopolitical and  military-strategic. You only had to look back and closely  examine the history of Russia, which has reached the Baltic  after several centuries by blood and sweat, and then raise your  hand to your eyes and look beyond the horizon of our  disorganized life today to realize that the forced march from  the Baltic must not be so rashly and humiliatingly fast. But  what has happened has happened. We now have the added factor of  the destabilization of the domestic political situation and  tremendous tension within the army milieu. You may say what you  like but it is the military man on active service or the retired  military man who has suffered most of all -- the former is  facing unprecedented deprivations as he settles down in Russia  while the latter has been turned into a second-class citizen in  the Baltic states.    But while punning on the subject of the times, it is  comforting to think that they can still change. The feeling  that Russia has no specific interests in neighboring foreign  countries is being agonizingly replaced by the realization that  it has a special role to play in the post-Soviet area.    In this regard 1992 was a crucial year. The many armed  conflicts along Russia's borders, the infringement of Russia's  state interests in strategically important neighboring regions,  and finally the shameless and at times humiliating pressure on  our fellow countrymen in neighboring foreign countries has led  to the realization that we cannot close our eyes and ears and  withdraw into our own Russian backyard. This is an act of  criminal disrespect if you think of the many centuries of  Russia's arduous history, it is a facile way to treat the  country's future, and it is immoral toward those 25 million of  our fellow countrymen who now find themselves separated from the  motherland.    So, thank God, it seems that Russia's difficult, months-long  progress toward an understanding of its own role in neighboring  foreign countries is nearing the desired end. Undoubtedly there  is still much work to be done to make the process of Russia's  adaptation in the post-Soviet area civilized, successful, and  worthy of a great country. But the finishing touches have been  added, it seems, and Russia's foreign policy priorities in  neighboring foreign countries have been listed. When speaking  about them the Russian foreign minister remarked that "Russia  must preserve its military presence in regions which have been  spheres of its military interest for centuries." He added:  "The withdrawal of all military presence from those regions is  the same extreme approach as imperial suppression using tanks."  In the event of withdrawal, Andrey Kozyrev is convinced, the  "security vacuum" thus created will not always necessarily be  filled by friendly forces. Another vital priority is the  protection of the Russian-speaking population, our fellow  countrymen. "To help create conditions in which Russians feel  that they are equal citizens" -- that is how the foreign  minister put it.    I think that these comments by Andrey Kozyrev will be  understood precisely as they stand. Because attempts by anyone  anywhere to assume the role of interpreter and organizer of  Russian affairs in neighboring foreign countries will now be  viewed as unfriendly acts. Russia is ceasing to do that which  historically was inappropriate to it -- backpedalling. Russia  is making it plain that everyone who wants to live with it in  love and fond accord should take account of its geopolitical  interests. Just as it is prepared to do unto others. With  determination, dignity, and honor.</p>

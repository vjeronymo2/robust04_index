			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Zimbabwe to slash budget deficit ZIMBABWE'S finance minister, Mr Bernard Chidzero, yesterday presented a deficit-cutting budget designed to satisfy the country's World Bank and IMF creditors. By containing spending increases to under 10 per cent while projecting a 23.5 per cent rise in revenue, Mr Chidzero was able to promise that the deficit will be halved in the current year to June 1994 to 5.4 per cent of GDP from 11 per cent in 1992-93. Substantial savings were possible with the reduction in drought relief expenditure and the cut in subsidies from more than ZDollars 920m (Pounds 93.9m) last year to ZDollars 272m in 1993-94. Drought relief assistance is down to only ZDollars 50m from ZDollars 300m last year. Despite a 14 per cent rise in defence spending and increases of 12.6 per cent in education and 9 per cent in health, the budget deficit is projected to fall from ZDollars 3.4bn last year to ZDollars 2.1bn in 1993-94. This assumes a rather stronger recovery from drought and recession than generally forecast in the private sector. Mr Chidzero is predicting 4 per cent growth in GDP this year, which private sector economists regard as hugely optimistic, especially in the wake of the publication this week of official figures showing that industrial production fell by more than 22 per cent in the first five months of the year while mining output was down 2 per cent in the first quarter. Surprisingly, too, in a budget which provides very little new information on the state of the economy, Mr Chidzero makes no mention of the deepening crisis in the tobacco and beef industries. Government spending is forecast to fall to 38 per cent of GDP from 44.6 per cent last year, while revenue will be little changed at around 33 per cent of GDP. As expected, Mr Chidzero reduced the top rate of personal income tax to 45 per cent from 50 per cent, applicable to people earning over ZDollars 48,000 a year while the corporate tax rate is cut to 40 per cent from 42.5 per cent. The main tax increase is the expected 28 per cent rise in petrol duty, though the actual price increase is likely to be somewhat greater, because distributors have also been promised an increased operating margin. Duties on beer and cigarettes have been raised while, to protect the domestic industry, duty increases have been imposed on imported wines and spirits. The budget has been welcomed by the business community, but economists have been quick to point out that it rests on two very fragile assumptions - that the recovery from drought and recession will be much stronger than widely forecast and that the government, in the run-up to elections due in 18 months, can impose a 10 per cent cut in real public spending.</p>

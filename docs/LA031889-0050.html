			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAR BOMB EXPLODES NEAR BEIRUT BAKERY; 12 SHOPPERS DIE, 75 HURT  </P> <P> Glass and shrapnel from an exploding car bomb Friday raked a crowded bakery in  suburban Beirut. Lebanese police reported 12 shoppers were killed and at least  75 wounded.  </P> <P> The toll was the highest this year for a Beirut car bomb. Thirteen people have  been killed in four previous explosions.  </P> <P> None of Lebanon's militant factions claimed responsibility for the bombing,  which occurred during the morning rush hour in Jal el Deeb, a suburb of  Christian-controlled East Beirut.  </P> <P> The blast shattered the relative calm of a 10-hour-old truce in the running  artillery duels between Muslim and Christian gunners. It destroyed the bakery,  damaged adjoining shops and set 20 cars afire in the street. Windows in the  consulate building of the British Embassy, just 50 yards distant, were broken  by the force of the bomb, which police estimated at more than 100 pounds of  explosives.  </P> <P> Many of the casualties, some grotesquely maimed, were children who had joined  their parents to line up for bread during the break in the artillery shelling,  according to reports from Beirut.  </P> <P> Salim Hoss, head of the Muslim caretaker government in West Beirut, called the  bombing a mass murder. "Civilians whether in the East or West are being  victimized," he said.  </P> <P> Gen. Michel Aoun, head of the rival Christian government in East Beirut, blamed  the bombing on the Syrians, who support the Hoss regime and maintain security  in the western half of the divided capital. An Aoun communique accused the  Syrians of trying to provoke a renewal of the artillery war between his mainly  Christian Lebanese Army troops and the Syrian-backed forces of Druze leader  Walid Jumblatt.  </P> <P> The two sides have been exchanging fire for the past nine days, triggered by  Aoun's blockade of ports controlled by Muslim militia south of Beirut. The  so-called War of the Ports -- harbors are prime revenue producers for both  government and militia forces -- has taken 49 lives, and is considered the  worst outbreak of Christian-Muslim fighting in four years.  </P> <P> Another Christian force, the rightist Falangist Party, implied in a Voice of  Lebanon radio broadcast that the car bomb was related to the controversy over  Salman Rushdie's novel "The Satanic Verses." The author went into hiding in  Britain late last month when the Iranian leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah  Khomeini, demanded his assassination for writing what Khomeini called  blasphemies against the Muslim religion.  </P> <P> "The British Embassy has received death threats," Falangist radio said, noting  the proximity of the bombing to the embassy.  </P> <P> According to press dispatches from Beirut, Lebanese guards at the embassy fired  into the air to keep reporters from approaching the grounds. No casualties were  reported at the embassy.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: EXPOSE "WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW." ARISTA * 1/2;  </P> <P> POP STARS ***** GREAT BALLS OF FIRE **** KNOCKIN' ON HEAVEN'S DOOR *** GOOD  VIBRATIONS ** MAYBE BABY * AIN'T THAT A SHAME  </P> <P> Want to empty a dance floor fast? Play some of the lame, low-energy dance  tracks from this album. The vocal trio's hit debut album, "Exposure," included  'Come Go With Me," one of the best dance tracks of the last few years, and it  established Lewis A. Martinee as a premier dance-music producer. But on the new  album there's nothing even remotely close to that gem. It's hard to tell which  is worse, Martinee's production or his arrangements.  </P> <P> Expose has veered strongly in a pop direction. Pop ballads get a heavier  emphasis this time -- possibly because the ballad "Season's Change" from the  last album was a smash hit. Actually, Expose's singers -- Ann Curless, Gioia  and Jeanette Jurado -- are very capable, and their vocal quality continually  shines through, even on some of the awful tunes. The album does feature one  top-notch song -- a ballad, "Your Baby Never Looked Good in Blue," which has  mournful, country-style lyrics. DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

The prime minister told Labor's  caucus that it is Israel's aim to bring about gradual calm  because in the final analysis the solution to the problem is  political. We will, however, continue to act against  Palestinian terrorism and Jewish extremists. The prime minister  stressed that Israel is determined to uphold the agreements with  the PLO and to continue the negotiations.    Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres sharply attacked right-wing extremists at the  caucus meeting. Peres expressed shock not only at the appalling  massacre, but also the rejoicing and gloating by the extreme  right. What is most frightening is that Qiryat Arba' is a  hotbed for the murder; we have no dialogue with those people,  Peres said. They can cause a terrible catastrophe to the Jewish  people, they are the enemies of the people, and they have to be  treated like enemies. The man who perpetrated the massacre in  the Cave of the Patriarchs has been damned to hell. His  cohorts, who are now strutting like peacocks, have to have their  weapons confiscated, and a series of measures have to be taken  against them in order to prevent them from causing more damage  and we must not hesitate.</p>

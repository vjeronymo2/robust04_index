			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Pakistan-China Nuclear Scandal"] </F>   [Text] Dr. Sher Afghan, federal minister for social welfare  and special education, has expressed concern about the nuclear  power plant being built with the Chinese assistance at Chashma,  including the fact that the new system of safety precautions  that China is using here has never been tested before.  Therefore, it is necessary to be extremely careful. He mentioned  a nuclear accident in Russia. He revealed that the electricity  produced at the power plant China will help built cost three  rupees per unit. The prices of another power plant is lower and  it can be built in shorter period. It will produce more  electricity and will cost only 50 paise per unit.    What the honored minister has said appears to be  unbelievable  since electricity produced in nuclear plants is considered to be  the cheapest in the world. At present the electricity provided  for domestic use in Pakistan costs less than one rupee per unit.  In the light of this information, how can we believe that the  nuclear power plant that our government is purchasing from the  Chinese government will produce electricity at three rupees per  unit. Who will buy electricity at this rate since there is a lot  of anger in the country over the present electricity rates. How  will the people react when there will be a 400 percent increase?  Who will be able to tolerate the change from 100 rupees to 400  rupees in the electricity bill?    The federal social welfare minister said that the  electricity  plant being built at Hab will produce electricity at 50 paise  per unit. If it is true then the question is why should not we  built similar electricity generating plants. Why should we buy a  power plant which will produce electricity at three rupees per  unit and whose safety is also suspect?    Dr. Sher Afghan grants that Madam Benazir Bhutto had made  the  deal for the Chashma nuclear power plant during her previous  administration. He also claims that during Mian Nawaz Sharif's  government the original deal was changed in such a way that it  is a losing deal for Pakistan now. He admits that this amended  agreement was approved by a group of Pakistani officials which  included some nuclear experts. This strange circumstance shows  that China did not warn Pakistan about the harmful aspects of  the amended agreement, although China is a kind of friend who  would never advise us to go into a losing deal.    It appears that Dr. Sher Afghan is trying to create bad  feeling about Pakistan's great friend China while Prime Minister  Benazir Bhutto is there on her visit. Which power is it that our  minister is trying to please and does she not want our trusted  friendship with China to prosper?    Dr. Sher Afghan is the first minister from whom the law  portfolio was taken a few days ago and then the present position  was given to him. It appears that his political mind does not  agree with the PPP government. Suspicions are being expressed  that he receives instructions from a specific place, which is  especially dear to him. Anyway, the facts that he has revealed  about the Chinese nuclear power plant in his interview have  created a nuclear scandal. Now the people want to know all the  facts. If the Chinese nuclear electricity plant is unsafe and  the electricity produced here is going to be very expensive, the  prime minister should review this nuclear project during her  visit to China. On her return she should explain the details to  the nation so that the people know how much truth there is in  what one of her ministers has said.</p>

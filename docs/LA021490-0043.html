			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VITAMIN INTAKE  </P> <P> Question: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that some vitamins are what is  called water-soluble.  </P> <P> I also believe that if these vitamins are taken in large doses, they will  simply be flushed out of the body. As I think you once said, this may result in  expensive urine, but what harm has been done? Would there be any possible harm  in taking vitamins as long as they're water soluble?  </P> <P> Answer: Taking large amounts of some water-soluble vitamins can be toxic. If  you feel the need for a supplement, first consult your physician.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Camaguey, Cuba, 15 Jun (PL) -- This province's first  joint tourist enterprise was formed this week with the signing  of an agreement between the Gaviota Tourist Group and the  Spanish P and I hotel chain.    The signing of the document enables Gaviota to start  operations in Camaguey, the largest Cuban province where 30  percent of the country's beaches are located. As for the P and  I company, it has become the first foreign business to embark on  a joint venture with the Cuban tourist group. The goal of the  new venture is to tap Guajaba Key, which has a 94-square-km area  and 12 km of beautiful beaches in the northern region of this  eastern Cuban province.    The construction of a small Caribbean-style town will begin  immediately here (between Sabinal Key and Romano Key). The town  will initially have 80 units, though the number will increase  according to demand, and will cater to high-income tourists.  The plans, drafted by Camaguey architect Leonel Carralero,  include the construction of comfortable bungalows located around  a central square, where the service facilities will be located.  Guajaba Key, which is currently reached by sea, will soon have,  among other facilities, a landing strip, golf courses, and a  marina.    With this new investment, by late 1995 Gaviota will double  its number of units, currently amounting to 1,170 rooms in  Havana, Varadero, and Holguin.</p>

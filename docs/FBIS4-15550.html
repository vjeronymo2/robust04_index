			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 11 TASS -- The main command of the  Russian Navy resolutely protested against the seizure by  Ukrainian commandos of a unit of the Black Sea Fleet stationed  near Odessa.    "Such actions can be interpreted only as political  irresponsibility and deliberate ignoring of the  Russian-Ukrainian agreements reached in Yalta and Massandra",  the press service of the Navy told TASS on Monday qualifying the  events as "provocative".    "The actions of the Ukrainian side are provocative in  essence  and form, are a flagrant violation of the reached agreements and  create an explosive situation on the Black Sea Fleet", the press  service said.    120 Ukrainian commandos from a special task force seized  late  on Sunday a division of the Black Sea Fleet, including its coast  facilities, the communication centre, the premises containing  secret documents and weapons. Commander of the unit Captain  First Rank Oleg Feoktistov and Commander of the coast units  Captain Second Rank Dmitriy Starikov were arrested, handcuffed  and taken to the military commandant's office. Chief of staff  Captain Second Rank Aleksandr Zelenko was also arrested.  Navymen and members of their families were beaten during the  attack.    "Who could have ordered such actions against a military unit  making part of the Black Sea Fleet which is subordinated to the  presidents of Russia and Ukraine?", the press service asked and  added that most indignation is caused by brutalities of  Ukrainian commandos towards family members of navymen.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 8 TASS -- Less than a month after the  parliamentary elections in Russia, centrists led by Vladimir  Voronin have begun tossing up the question of early presidential  elections this coming summer.    Commenting on their calls, Georgiy Satarov, an adviser to  President Boris Yeltsin, said in an interview with ITAR-TASS on  Saturday [8 January] that under the new Russian Constitution  "the president of the Russian Federation... As of the day this  constitution enters into force shall execute his powers  established thereof until the expiration of his term of office  for which he has been elected."    This provision can be changed by two thirds of the state  Duma, two thirds of the Federation Council and as many of the  subjects of the federation. Additionally, attempts to question  the will of the voters by any party would mean disrespect for  their opinion, Satarov said.    At the same time, Satarov, who also heads the Russian Social  and Political Centre which groups over 20 parties, believes that  the "state, if it is interested in normal communication with  society, should provide material support to all political  parties irrespective of their political orientation because it  is the parties that perform the function of such communication."  If the state intends to maintain the dialogue with society, it  should find out, with the help of parties, and take into account  public interests in its policy, Satarov added.    He noted that as far as multi-party system is concerned, "we  are still living by the old Soviet legislation which does not  differentiate between the types of public organisations."  According to Satarov they are divided into three groups.  Political parties are one of them. "Because they (political  parties) participate in the formation of such important  substance as power, political parties should be absolutely  `transparent' for society and the state," he said. In other  words, citizens have the right to know what goals are pursued by  such parties, who finances them and how they spend their money.  Under the current legislation, this cannot be found out because  it is impossible to differentiate between political parties and  non-political organisations.    Apart from political parties, there are also non-political  organisations in Russia, including human rights, youth, children  organisations and others. "The state can and should effectively  use such organisations to pursue its policy, for example provide  support for the family, victims of repressions and so on."  Satarov believes that these organisations would carry out their  functions and use state funds more effectively than the  structures within the presidential administration.    "In all civilised countries the state tries to hand over  such  functions to public organisations," Satarov noted, stressing  that the state should retain the right to control their  expenditures.    Additionally, there are sort of interest clubs which unite  philatelists, dog owners, plant growers and others. They act  independently from the state and solve their problems on their  own.    Satarov emphasised that "there should be three different  legislations for different public organisations." But in Russia  which has no normal civil society, its formation cannot be left  without the participation of the state. The Russian Social and  Political Centre has been established as a means of the state's  participation in this process. As a state structure, the centre  provides information and analytical materials to all branches of  power. Recently, Satarov appealed to President Boris Yeltsin,  urging him to work out a new legislation applicable to different  types of parties and public organisations and taking into  account the new realities of Russian life.</p>

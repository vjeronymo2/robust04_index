			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> FREEWAY CALL BOXES: HELP IN A VARIETY OF LANGUAGES  </P> <P> Orange County's year-old system of freeway telephones has a problem -- the  dispatchers at California Highway Patrol headquarters in Santa Ana can't  understand many of the callers.  </P> <P> The 1,134 call boxes spaced every quarter of a mile along all the county's  freeways were used a record 13,500 times last month. About 10% of the callers,  as many as 100 on some days, spoke only foreign languages, mostly Spanish or  Vietnamese.  </P> <P> The dispatchers, however, speak only English.  </P> <P> "From the start, the number of people calling in foreign languages has  surprised us," said Todd Murphy, chairman of California SAFE (Service Authority  for Freeway Emergencies), which handles wireless call boxes in California.  </P> <P> Murphy said that when the call box service was launched last September,  officials expected to receive some calls in Spanish but never anticipated the  volume and diversity of foreign language calls.  </P> <P> An interpreter center was retained to deal with non-English-speaking callers.  When foreign language calls come into Santa Ana, the caller is patched into the  interpretation facility -- Communications and Language Line, based in Monterey,  Calif. -- and a three-way conversation takes place.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Flood of Calls  </P> <P> Company officials say they receive more demands for interpretation from Orange  County than anywhere else freeway phones are used.  </P> <P> "From the very start we found that Orange County runs 30 to 40 different  languages every month, about the same as in New York City," said Mike McFerrin,  information manager for Communications and Language Line, which can interpret  in 143 languages. "We get more calls from call boxes in Orange County than we  do from anywhere in the country."  </P> <P> Although the center has had to deal with Orange County callers who speak only  such languages as Romanian and Farsi, about half the foreign language calls are  in Spanish. Although they can hook up by telephone with the interpretation  service, Highway Patrol officials say they need Spanish speakers on staff to  handle the heavy volume.  </P> <P> "The translation service is great, but it's costly and slower than having  somebody on hand," said Lt. Rick Criner, manager of the Santa Ana  communications center. "We need somebody on staff.  </P> <P> "It's much better to have bilingual people on hand rather than to try and sort  things out over three telephone lines. They are faster and they can save lives  if they know CHP policies and procedures."  </P> <P> Criner said the telephone center has had difficulty attracting Spanish-speaking  applicants and that CHP regulations have hampered the hiring of Spanish  speakers. Under department rules, bilingual dispatchers can be paid more after  they are hired but can be given preference in hiring only if they are among the  top three candidates, he said.  </P> <P> Last January, the CHP allocated extra money to be paid to two Spanish-speaking  dispatchers in the Santa Ana office, but so far none has been hired. In June,  the department held its first bilingual test for dispatchers. Of 20 applicants,  four qualified and have been listed for hire, said CHP spokesman Keith  Thornhill.  </P> <P> Orange County began to install the call box system in 1987 after the area's 26  municipalities approved a $1 surcharge on motor vehicle registrations to pay  for it.  </P></p>

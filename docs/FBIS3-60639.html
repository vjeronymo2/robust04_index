Nikolai Solovyev, visiting head of the Asia-Pacific  Department at the Russian Foreign Ministry, told YONHAP that he  tabled a "new proposal" in his meeting with South Korea's  Assistant Minister Sin Ki-pok on Seoul's compensation for the  legation site nationalized back in 1970.    The Russian official said that in his opinion, North Korea  was "far" from developing nuclear weapons and that Moscow  supports Washington-Pyongyang dialogue.    Russia is ready to join the trilateral negotiations among  South Korea, Japan and the United States on North Korea's  nuclear issue and also ready to join China-U.S. negotiations on  the matter. [passage omitted]    On North Korea's nuclear issue, the Foreign Ministry  official  said Russia did "cooperate with (North Korea's) nuclear reactor  on grounds that it can be used for peaceful way."    Asked how far Moscow believes North Korea is in its nuclear  program, Solovyov said in his personal opinion, the communist  state is "very far from having nuclear weapons."    There are questions about how much plutonium North Korea  has,  he said.    "We are giving our best efforts for reentering North Korea  to  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, to keep North Korea as a member  of the Treaty," said Solovyov.    Russia "is ready to join consultations among South Korea,  Japan, United States...ready to participate in U.S.-China  consultations," he said.</p>

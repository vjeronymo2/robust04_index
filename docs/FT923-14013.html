			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Lawyer set to oversee Poland's uneasy coalition: A look at a government led by two parties that have differed on almost everything POLAND'S long political crisis should end today after expected parliamentary approval for a new coalition government - the fourth since the collapse of communism three years ago - headed by Ms Hanna Suchocka. Ms Suchocka, a no-nonsense 46-year-old lawyer, has made few enemies during her parliamentary career in the pro-market Democratic Union (UD) party but has impressed many by her quiet competence. As a Catholic with strong anti-abortionist views, she should be able to maintain the peace between the two main parties in her cabinet. These are the UD, the largest party to emerge from the general election last October, and the right-wing nationalist Catholic party (ZChN). The alliance between them made the formation of the government possible but, if handled badly, could lead to its eventual downfall. Until now the two groups have appeared to differ on almost everything - from their approach to the role of the Catholic Church to economic policy. The UD, for example, has demanded strict controls on money supply while the ZChN has called for monetary expansion to lift the economy out of recession. The experience of Poland's previous non-communist governments indicates that the economic agenda is set more by the International Monetary Fund and the now-ratified Association Agreement with the European Community than what politicians say in public. The ZChN, for example, defended the 5 per cent of GDP budget deficit ceiling demanded by the IMF once they were part of the previous government headed by Mr Jan Olszewski. This helped to ensure that the economy has strengthened despite nearly nine months of political uncertainty. A strong team at the finance ministry, led by Mr Andrzej Olechowski, the outgoing minister of finance who has been appointed an adviser to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, managed to control spending, while the central bank kept a close watch on the money supply. As a result inflation should be halved to around 40 per cent this year while industrial production is starting to recover. GDP is now expected to stabilise at last year's level after a three-year decline. This is thanks partly to devaluation of the zloty which has boosted exports and slowed imports. Poland registered a Dollars 765m trade surplus in the first five months of this year, helping to strengthen reserves. Mr Henryk Goryszewski, from the ZChN, is expected to become the deputy premier responsible for the economy. He will have to work with men such as Mr Janusz Lewandowski, from the Liberal Democratic Congress, who is returning to head the privatisation ministry. The self-assured Mr Goryszewski has enjoyed a meteoric rise from legal adviser in the transport ministry to chairing the Sejm's budget committee and has often criticised Mr Lewandowski's privatisation policies. The finance ministry is to be headed by Mr Jerzy Osiatynski from the UD who served as central planning minister in the first Solidarity government. The new government also has its big spenders. Mr Jacek Kuron, one of Poland's most popular politicians is to return to the labour ministry, where he is remembered for granting a generous deal for pensioners and the unemployed in 1990. President Lech Walesa has grudgingly accepted the proposed cabinet after giving every indication that he would have preferred a government led by Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the 32-year-old farmers' party leader. Mr Pawlak, who has resigned after his abortive attempt to put together a working majority, offered the president a greater chance of dominating the executive without having to take direct responsibility for its actions. The division of powers between the president and the government has plagued each successive administration and the new one should prove no exception. But for the moment Ms Suchocka has secured that flank by acknowledging that the key ministries of defence, the interior and foreign affairs remain within the president's domain. Mr Olszewski and his followers are now in opposition and will continue to demand the removal of former secret police collaborators from public service, an issue which helped push them into the wilderness but will have to be faced by Ms Suchocka's administration.</p>

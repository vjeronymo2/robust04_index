			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> FBI TRIED TO 'PRESSURE' BLOCH THROUGH FAMILY, DAUGHTER SAYS  </P> <P> FBI agents intent on arresting suspected Soviet spy Felix Bloch attempted to  turn his family against him, his daughter says.  </P> <P> "They wanted my mother as the star witness. They were grasping at straws; they  were desperate," Andrea Bloch, 26, said in today's New York Post. The agents  threatened to charge her mother, Lucille Bloch, as a co-conspirator, Andrea  Bloch charged.  </P> <P> "They were trying to pressure my father into breaking by using us," she said.  "They wanted to make us so miserable that it would make him miserable."  </P> <P> The FBI's plan "totally backfired," she said, despite the strains it put on the  family.  </P> <P> Bloch, once the No. 2 man in the U.S. Embassy in Vienna, was followed by FBI  agents for months after he was videotaped purportedly passing a briefcase to a  Soviet official in Vienna.  </P> <P> The surveillance has been scaled back recently, and Bloch has not been charged  with any crime.  </P></p>

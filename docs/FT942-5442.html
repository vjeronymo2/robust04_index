			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / International Company News: Fiat package backs Polish car plant Fiat Auto Poland yesterday signed loan and equity agreements worth DM288.5m (Dollars 168m) to help finance the expansion and modernisation of its car factory in Bielsko Biala, in Poland. Fiat took over the debt-laden plant two years ago and sales last year reached DM1.67bn, including exports of 150,000 Cinquecento cars to western Europe. Now the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has agreed to take a DM66m stake in the plant along with Simest, an Italian state-funded corporation which is to invest DM16.5m. This leaves Fiat with about 83 per cent of the equity. At the same time, the EBRD is to provide 65 per cent of a DM140m loan syndicated to a group of western European banks of which the majority, such as ING of the Netherlands and Creditanstalt of Austria, have branches in Warsaw. The package was completed with another DM66.0m loan syndicated by the state-owned Polish Development Bank in the largest commercial syndication organised in the country to date. The European Investment Bank (EIB) provided DM17.5m of the Polish Development Bank's syndication. This represents the first tranche of DM67m-worth of financing the EIB has committed to Fiat Auto Poland. Fiat is planning to develop a new small car for production at Bielsko over the next four years under a DM1bn business plan due to run to the end of the century. Fiat's investment to date in its Polish subsidiary amounts to DM437m.</p>

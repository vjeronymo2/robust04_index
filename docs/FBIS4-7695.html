			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fahrudin Behic from Gorazde] </F>   [Text] [words indistinct] and the other medical staff in  the Gorazde war hospital cannot manage to give aid to all the  casualties. There are lines of wounded in front of the  operating theater and the improvised medical facilities are  full, while the chetnik rampage continues.    Since this morning over a thousand shells have landed on  (Batici) alone. The attacks are intensifying from several  directions, and the aggressor is again trying to break through  with tanks from Ustipraca and (Nezici). The chetniks are firing  howitzers, multiple rocket launchers, and mortars of all  calibers from (Kotovo), Djakovici, Kozara, (Paljika),  (Preljuca), Carevo Guvno, from every hill they control. On the  right bank of the Drina their infantry attacks intensified  before dawn. At 1025 a major tank and infantry attack was  launched north from (Kopaci). The battles are [word indistinct]  and the strength of the artillery support from the chetnik  forces is unprecedented here.    The situation is by far the worst on the free Rogatica  territory. Hundreds of tonnes of steel have landed here over the  last 10 hours. Despite their losses, the chetniks are  intensifying their attacks by introducing fresh forces. All 50  tanks are in full use, as are armored transporters, combat  helicopters, and some 10,000 murderers of all kinds from the  four chetnik corps. Their intention is obvious: They want the  Herzegovina Corps, the Sarajevo-Romanija Corps, the Drina Corps,  and the Uzice Corps to link up in Gorazde. They are not much  concerned that Gorazde has been made a UN Protected Area with  Resolution 824. True, during this morning's flights by two NATO  planes over the area, the intensity of their attacks did let up,  only to be resumed with even greater ferocity after the aircraft  had gone.    This is Fahrudin Becic reporting from the Information  Service  of the Eastern Bosnian Operative Group.</p>

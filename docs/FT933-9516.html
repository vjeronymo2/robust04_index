			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Serbs inject fresh doubts into Nato: The veneer of agreement over air strikes in Bosnia NATO OFFICIALS were yesterday engaged in a feverish round of behind-the-scenes negotiations as ambassadors for the 16 alliance members met in Brussels to discuss the logistics of air strikes against Serbs in Bosnia. But with the situation in Sarajevo confused following the partial withdrawal of Serb forces from Mount Bjelasnica, one of the strategic heights around the city, the Canadian, British and French delegations reiterated concern that air strikes could endanger troops on the ground. Another complicating factor emerged when it was revealed French troops had been deployed on Mt Ignam, parts of which are still occupied by Serb forces. After a week of anxious diplomatic discussions, Nato officials yesterday said the alliance had broad agreement on the military structure for the threatened air strikes. This is expected to place operations under the control of the UN, with authorisation coming from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general. The outline agreement represents an American concession to European concerns; Washington had earlier demanded that Nato be able to initiate air strikes. Mr Jacques Blot, French ambassador to Nato, said yesterday that any action had to be in accordance with the UN resolutions and 'that the first air strike must be authorised by the secretary-general'. Nevertheless, it emerged last night that another Nato meeting and further talks with the UN would probably be required before any strikes could be authorised. Officials admit that divisions remain between Europe the US about when strikes might be needed. 'Everyone says that air strikes should be used as a last resort. The problem lies in agreeing the last resort,' said one Nato official. Another official added: 'What the US wants now is not entirely clear to us. There have been different signals from Washington recently. But we will not go ahead with anything that endangers our troops.' With French troops forming the bulk of the UN force in Sarajevo, the French delegation in Brussels stressed it would only agree to air strikes if they had the full support of UN commanders on the ground. 'We are not making war in Bosnia. 'This must be a clear signal for the Moslems. We are there for the humanitarian process,' Mr Blot stressed. Quentin Peel adds from Bonn: In a statement which suggested more German caution about western military intervention than has been apparent in recent government pronouncements, Chancellor Helmut Kohl last night warned that any air strikes must take into account consequences for the civilian population. He said any attempt to end the fighting in former Yugoslavia with military means would unleash a war with catastrophic consequences. Mr Kohl gave his support, however, to President Bill Clinton's proposal for limited air strikes against specific military targets - provided they were backed by a decision of the UN Security Council.</p>

			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATISTICS  </P> <P> The statistically accurate and factually descriptive report by David G. Savage  in "1 in 4 Young Blacks in Jail or in Court, Study Says" (Part A, Feb. 27),  nevertheless needs careful interpretation and a closer analysis.  </P> <P> Otherwise unhealthy social stereotypes and prejudices will receive additional  credence in our population.  </P> <P> It is absolutely essential when comparing samples from different racial and  ethnic groups that the samples are of similar groups, in addition to the bare  fact of color or ethnic background.  </P> <P> In studies of crime, it is important that socioeconomic factors are similar in  the samples used in the study. For example, I believe it would be essential to  compare crime rates for samples on the basis of several levels of income, or  lack of it. In that way we could have a better look at the causes of crime, and  aim for partial solutions.  </P> <P> May I give an example of the need for interpretation: I believe we cannot  compare teen-age pregnancies between black and white youngsters, unless the two  groups compared are equivalent samples with regard to socioeconomic  circumstances.  </P> <P> Statistics in themselves may be accurate but misleading!  </P> <P> H.

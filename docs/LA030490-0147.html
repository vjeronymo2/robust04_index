			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BABY'S BIRTH IN GLENDORA WAS AN EARTH-MOVING EXPERIENCE  </P> <P> While many San Gabriel Valley residents were scrambling for desks and doorways  during Wednesday's earthquake, Tami Harshberger was on the delivery table at  Foothill Presbyterian Hospital.  </P> <P> At 3:53 p.m. Wednesday, 10 minutes after the quake rolled through the Los  Angeles area and 6 1/2 hours after her mother went into labor, Stephanie Nicole  Harshberger, an eight-pound, blue-eyed blonde, was born.  </P> <P> Harshberger, 28, of Covina, was in the middle of a contraction when the  first-floor delivery room at the hospital in Glendora started swaying.  </P> <P> The delivery room nurse dove for a nearby doorway, but quickly returned to the  table.  </P> <P> Harshberger stopped pushing. "I thought for sure the ceiling was going to start  caving in," she said. Her obstetrician, Steve S. Ho, told her to calm down and  continue breathing.  </P> <P> Minutes later, Stephanie was born.  </P> <P> It was Ho's first quake baby delivery, but not the last.  </P> <P> Several hours later, when an aftershock hit at 7:24 p.m., Ho was with another  expectant mother, this time at Inter-Community Medical Center in Covina.  </P> <P> The delivery room nurse, Cheryl Meyer, was in the same hospital on Oct. 1,  1987, the date of the Whittier Narrows temblor. Meyer had been assisting a  Caesarean section birth when the ground started shaking.  </P> <P> "I'm not superstitious in this regard," Ho said Thursday. "It must be some  unforeseen force that causes more babies to be delivered during an earthquake.  It's just like gravity and a full moon."  </P> <P> The Harshbergers, however, said the timing of the birth of their second  daughter may have been a good omen.  </P> <P> "It's got to mean something," father Kevin Harshberger, 32, who had been in the  delivery room, said Thursday. "She was born the day the earth moved. . . .  Maybe we should've played Lotto last night."  </P></p>

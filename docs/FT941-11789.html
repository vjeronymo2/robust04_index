			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Volatile comeback for Banesto - The bank's return to the bourse may be premature The resumption of share trading in Banesto, the troubled Spanish bank, on Madrid's Bolsa yesterday was as volatile as its rescue plan is controversial. Despite a warning by Mr Alfredo Saenz, Banesto's provisional chairman, that the true worth of the bank's share was its adjusted par value of Pta400, down from Pta700, they opened at Pta800 amid heavy volume. 'It's an absolute punt, a casino bet,' said Madrid broker MrRobert Maxwell whose firm, Maxwell and Espinosa, had been actively trading Banesto paper in the off-the-floor 'grey' market before the stock was re-listed. Banesto's existing shareholders, which include US institutions, the US investment bank J. P. Morgan and former members of Banesto's board, were, meanwhile, angered by the prospect that they would be barred from exercising pre-emptiverights in the capital increase that forms part of the bank's rescue plan. The Corsair Fund, a portfolio managed by J. P. Morgan, invested Dollars 175m in a Banesto rights issue last year, paying Pta1,900 a share, to acquire some 8 per centof the bank's equity. The rescue plan's re-capitalisation threatens to dilute the Corsair funds stake in Banesto to around 2 per cent. 'At this point in time I have no idea who has got what rights,' said a lawyer representing large Banesto shareholders. 'I can't understand how the shares are being quoted again when nobody knows the full details of a rescue plan which has still to be approved by Banesto's annual general meeting.' The trading volatility reflected the absence of any detailed statement about Banesto's past problems, and about its future prospects. The bank's former board, which was accused of gross mismanagement, was sacked by the Bank of Spain on December 28. The new team appointed to run Banesto has established that the bank has gross financing requirements of Pta605bn (Dollars 4.2bn). It also mirrored intense speculation that Banestowill, as a result of the rescue plan, end up as a subsidiary unit of one the large domestic banking groups. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, which has seconded senior executives, including Mr Saenz, to provisionally run Banesto, is one candidate to control the bank. Banco Santander, the strategic leader of Spanish banks, is another. The rescue plan, agreed between Mr Saenz, the Bank of Spain and the domestic banks, has Banesto itself providing a total of Pta320bn towards restoring its balance sheet. This will be done by allocating all its Pta244bn reserves to provisions, reducing the par value of its individual shares and writing down further provisions over time. The Bank of Spain and the private banks will contribute to the rescue by acquiring, on an equal basis, non-performing debtsthat Banesto is unable to cover, to a value of Pta285bn. The domestic banks will also finance a Pta180bn capital increase for Banesto, which will be underwritten on their behalf by the Deposit Guarantee Fund, FGD. Under the terms ofthe rescue plan, the FGD will publicly auction its Banesto equity within a year. During the auction, which could take place as early as this summer, the FGD will reserve a controlling tranche of Banesto shares for sale to a domestic strategic buyer, either to a bank or to a pool of banks. A senior official saidthat only the FGD would underwrite the Pta180bn capital increase, paying the par value of Pta400, because the private banks were taking on a considerable portion of Banesto's bad debts. However, he said existing shareholders could exercisetheir rights when the the FGD auctioned its Banesto equity later this year. As well as contesting the FGD's monopoly to re-capitalise Banesto, the bank's largest existing shareholders are questioning the valuation of the bank's assets, which the new management says have to be written down.</p>

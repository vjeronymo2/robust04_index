			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 17 Feb (XINHUA) -- According to JIEFANJUN  BAO [LIBERATION ARMY DAILY], in line with a Central Military  Commission [CMC] directive, the General Staff Headquarters and  General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army  [PLA] issued a joint circular the other day instructing units to  formulate overall plans for building up the ranks of minority  cadres. It calls for stepping up recruiting and training to  build a well-structured contingent of minority cadres who are  politically qualified, competent, and meet the needs of  modernization of the armed forces.    The circular notes that in units stationed in areas where  people of minority nationalities live in compact communities,  leading bodies at the regiment level or higher should include a  minority cadre. Army organs at all levels and people's armed  force departments at the county and city level should have a  certain number of minority cadres. To raise the quality of  minority cadres, designated academies or colleges should --  where the number of minority soldiers undertaking courses  justifies doing so -- set up a special class to improve their  literacy levels. Training courses for Tibetan youngsters should  be instituted on a experimental basis at relevant academies and  schools to recruit Tibetan primary school and middle school  students. After undergoing systematic training, they should be  assigned as cadres to army units. Meanwhile, efforts should be  made to recruit more minority graduates of regular institutes of  higher learning and secondary vocational schools who are good in  both conduct and learning, to replenish the ranks of army  cadres. The circular also calls for implementing a preferential  policy for minority cadres regarding retirement and job  placement after demobilization.    It has been learned that the CMC attaches great importance  to  the development of the ranks of minority cadres in the military.  The CMC has emphasized again and again that this work should be  carried out as part and parcel of the development of the ranks  of army cadres as a whole. As things stand now, over 80 percent  of minority cadres in the military have undergone training in  academies and colleges. In light of the characteristics of the  growth of minority cadres, special consideration has been given  to job assignments and promotions of minority cadres so that  they can give the best account of their talents. Tens of  thousands of fine minority cadres in leadership posts at all  levels throughout the army -- who make up an important force in  the construction of our military -- are putting their talents to  good use. According to statistics, among the cadres of  Mongolia, Hui, Tibetan, Uygur, Zhuang, Korean, Man, Dong, Bai,  Tujia, and Ewenki nationalities on active duty in the service,  over 40 have been appointed the rank of major general or higher.  The development of the contingent of minority cadres has served  as a powerful boost for the modernization of armed forces, and  for the enhancement of the army-civilian and national unity.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Ilnur Cevik: "Demirel, the One Who Suffers </F> Mishaps"]    [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has been elevated to his  current post after travelling a long and winding road. He has  suffered two coups and has bounced back.    The military has intervened twice to oust Demirel from  office, once in 1971 and the second time in 1980. Those of us  who still want to be kind to him call the coups "mishaps," while  his critics, who are now growing in number, say in both cases  Demirel failed to run the country properly and it was his  incompetence that led to the military takeovers.    After the 1980 coup, Demirel became a banned leader. The  press, with the exception of the TURKISH DAILY NEWS, which  defied all anti-democratic measures, could not mention his name,  and many writers started calling him "bir bilen," which means  "the one who knows."    Demirel was under house arrest for a short period and his  movements were restricted by the military. The years went by  and true democrats, including some in the TURKISH DAILY NEWS,  rallied behind him as he launched his successful campaign to get  the bans lifted. The bans were eventually lifted in a  referendum, and Demirel started climbing the ladder back to  power.    In 1991 he became prime minister, and then in 1993 he was  elected president by the Parliament after the sad demise of  Turgut Ozal.    Demirel is a politician of vast experience. But, despite all  his qualities, either he could not see the 1971 and 1980 coups  coming or he could not do anything to avoid them.    Now he has started to speak of his "deep concerns" about the  current state of affairs. He has recently said he is concerned  with the spate of terrorist bomb attacks in major cities. On  Monday he told a meeting of geology experts: "If the country  loses its democratic calm, the people will seek calm through the  fist." Which means if you cannot secure calm and tranquility in  the country through a democratic environment, then the only way  will be for the military to do it with an iron fist after a coup.    We have given several warnings in the past few years that we  could end up in the current situation. It is sad that people in  responsible positions just turned a deaf ear to our warnings and  are now paying the price.    It is also sad that once again people have started  pronouncing the words "military takeover." It is especially sad  that such talk has been resurrected when Demirel is the head of  state and is once again in a responsible position in Turkey.    Let us hope Demirel does not go into history books not only  as the "one who knows," but also as "the one who suffered three  mishaps." Let us also hope no one turns round and says: "If  some one suffers so many mishaps then there must be something  wrong with him."</p>

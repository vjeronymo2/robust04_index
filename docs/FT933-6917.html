			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / TGWU defends farm pay body ABOLITION of the Agricultural Wages Board, which sets minimum pay for 238,000 farmworkers, could breach the European Community's Treaty of Rome, the Transport and General Workers' Union said yesterday. Launching a campaign with the Labour party to save the board, the union pointed out that Article 39 (1b) of the treaty states that the common agricultural policy should ensure a fair standard of living for the farming community, in particular by increasing individual earnings. 'Abolition would be a clear challenge to the European Commission,' said Mr Barry Leathwood, national secretary of the union's rural, agricultural and allied workers group. Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, last week extended the deadline for consultation on the board's future until November, after pressure from farmers and farm workers. The board is the last statutory body fixing minimum wages for low-paid workers, after legislation to scrap wages councils which Mrs Shephard guided through parliament as employment secretary. The union fears any government decision to end minimum pay would mean pay cuts, less investment in training and threats to safety and hygiene. Most farmers want rates to continue being fixed centrally to avoid potentially difficult negotiations with employees. Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary, predicted industrial conflict if the board went. 'If we're driven to negotiate farm by farm, that's precisely what will happen,' he said. 'Farmworkers must become either slave labour or industrial fighters.' The board controls minimum pay, holidays and sick leave for full-time, part-time and casual farmworkers. Average earnings are estimated at 76 per cent of the average industrial wage. The TGWU calculates that 43 per cent of full-time male farmworkers and 68 per cent of their female equivalents earn less than the low pay threshold. Mr Gavin Strang, shadow agriculture minister, said: 'With so much taxpayers' money going into farming, it would be outrageous if action was taken to further erode the low wages of farmworkers.'</p>

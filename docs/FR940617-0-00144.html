			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This is especially true given the location-specific nature of in-use regulations. In-use regulations, such as time of use or place of use restrictions ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  high occupancy vehicle lanes) are typically very site specific. An in-use regulation suitable for California, or in part of California, may have little or no relevance or practicality to the type of in-use regulation suitable for another area. Such regulations which primarily effect local users are more appropriately controlled and implemented by local and state governments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, section 209(d) of the Act clearly limits the preemption of state regulation in use. It states that ``nothing in this part shall preclude or deny to any other State or political subdivision thereof the right otherwise to control, regulate, or restrict the use, operation or movement of registered or licensed motor vehicles.'' As was stated above, section 209 as a whole applies equally to nonroad engines. Thus, section 209(d) should be interpreted to mean that, unless state regulation of use of nonroad engines is specifically preempted, section 209 should not be interpreted to grant any implicit preemption, except within the framework of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Allway Taxi. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the language of section 209 and the lack of any express preemption, the legislative history of these provisions, and the general presumption against providing broad preemption where such preemption is not made explicit, EPA believes that it is clear that section 209(e)(2) does not apply to in use regulation of nonroad engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While EPA recognizes the important principle of narrowly construing the preemptive effect of the Act as explained in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Allway Taxi, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA also notes that certain state regulations that may be characterized as ``in-use'' regulations may be preempted because they are effectively regulations on the design of new engines rather than on the use of ``in-use'' engines. Industry has expressed concern that states might impose retrofit requirements on nonroad engines and vehicles as soon as they are introduced into commerce, or when such engines are being rebuilt, or at a date after which nonroad engines are typically rebuilt. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 31 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA recognizes that CARB does not envision a retrofit requirement and that, because of the nature of the nonroad market, it is unlikely that other states would adopt such a requirement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 32 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  However, given EPA's definition of new and the scope of the definition within this rulemaking, this issue could arise when other states plan their in-use emission strategy. In such a case, EPA believes that a retrofit requirement mandating a retrofit of a nonroad engine immediately after the engine is no longer new is adverse to the Congressional intent of section 209(e) and the principles laid out in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Allway Taxi. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Therefore, in this scenario, such a retrofit requirement would be deemed an in-use emission standard relating back to the original design of the new engine by the original engine manufacturer (OEM) and would be subject to the waiver criteria of section 209(e)(2). Within this same scenario, only California could adopt such a requirement and other states could only adopt California's requirement if California subsequently was granted a waiver. However, after a reasonable amount of time has passed and the engine is no longer new (most likely when an engine is being rebuilt), modest retrofit requirements would most likely not be deemed to significantly affect the OEM and thus such requirements would not be subject to subsection 209(e)(2). In this second scenario, the modest retrofit requirements would still be subject to challenge in court under the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Allway Taxi <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  criteria. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 33 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 31 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Oral Statement of the Engine Manufacturers Association, Docket entry IV-F&hyph;7, which states ``The ultimate purchaser must have the assurance that the engine *&blank;*&blank;* she might purchase, and which properly meets EPA requirements *&blank;*&blank;* is 'good' until that engine is ready to be rebuilt. No state should be allowed to impose retrofit standards on engines which otherwise conform to EPA requirements.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 32 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Letter from Mr. Cackette, CARB to Mr. Mandel, EMA, dated July 20, 1993, Docket entry IV&hyph;I&hyph;55.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 33 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's definition of ``new'' does not present a problem for engines or equipment that do not sell relatively quickly ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , within a year of being made) in California. If California's regulation set standards applicable to ``new'' engines,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> i.e, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  as of the date title passed, regardless of when the engine was produced, then an engine manufactured in 1990 but not sold until 1994 would be subject to 1994 emission standards. This problem is avoided since California's Utility Engine Rule ties the date of manufacture to the standard, therefore a 1990 engine would be subject to a 1990 standard and a 1994 engine subject to a 1994 standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Therefore, the Agency has determined that nonroad engines and nonroad vehicles will be ``new'' for purposes of the Act until the equitable or legal title passes to the ultimate purchaser, or if title passage does not occur, then the engine or vehicle will be new until placed into service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Definition of Locomotive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The September 6, 1991 NPRM to the California nonroad preemption regulation defined locomotive as a self-propelled piece of on-track equipment (other than equipment designed for operation both on highways and rails, specialized maintenance equipment, and other similar equipment) designed for moving other equipment or carrying freight or passenger traffic or both. As with the definition of ``new,'' EPA did not propose a definition of locomotive in its May 17th NPRM, but is finalizing a definition is this rulemaking, relying in part on the definition proposed in the September 6, 1991 NPRM and the comments received in response to that NPRM. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments discussed below are contained in Docket  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A&hyph;91&hyph;18.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

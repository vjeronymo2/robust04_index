			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Energy stocks weaker as Dow declines Wall Street US stocks suffered their third setback in a row yesterday in spite of a firming trend in bonds, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 12.38 lower at 3,762.35, but the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off a mere 0.58 at 460.00, having clawed its way back from a big loss in the morning. Even so, declining issues overwhelmed rises by 1,552 to 647 after volume of 287m shares. In the secondary markets the damage was more severe. The American SE composite dropped 6.22, or 1.3 per cent, to 462.21. Profit-taking in technology stocks, which have outperformed other sectors in recent weeks, sent the Nasdaq composite down 10.95, or 1.4 per cent, to 772.50. Even though Dow industrials had suffered a cumulative loss of 95 points last Thursday and Friday, profit-takers were thin on the ground at yesterday's opening. Stocks showed little reaction to Opec's failure at the weekend to agree cuts in its current production ceiling. The cartel's inaction raised the likelihood of further declines in the price of crude oil, and a subsequent easing of inflationary pressures in the economy. Equity investors were also unimpressed by a modest rally in bonds, which had pulled stocks sharply lower at the close of last week. In early trading yesterday, the yield bid on the benchmark 30-year government issue again slipped below 7.00 per cent, a level breached on Friday for the first time in 10 months. Yesterday the blue chips were stubbornly anchored in negative ground. The Dow industrials were down as much as 35 points at one stage, but managed to retrace some of their losses before the session's conclusion. Cyclical issues again dragged the Dow lower. Caterpillar was off Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 114 and Allied Signal down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 37. Energy stocks were generally weaker, reflecting the prospect of a further slide in crude prices. Arco retreated Dollars 3 to Dollars 98, Mobil Dollars 1 to Dollars 77 1/2 and Texaco Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 64 3/4 . Both large and small-capitalisation technology issues were hammered. On the NYSE, Micron Technology fell Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 82 5/8 and Computer Associates International Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 32 7/8 . On the Nasdaq, America On-Line plunged Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 81 1/2 on reports that Mr Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft who holds about 18 per cent of AOL's stock, was considering the sale of his stake. Canada Toronto oils took a different line from their European counterparts on Opec's failure to agree immediate oil production cuts, and the sector index ended 162.79, or 3.4 per cent, down at 4,593.66 as the TSE 300 composite lost 40.32, or 0.9 per cent, at 4,487.97. Golds eased about 1 per cent in sympathy with oils. Brazil Equities in Sao Paulo retreated from the day's highs to end only 0.7 per cent up after market participants turned bearish on news that Brazil's Supreme Court backed a legislative workers' motion against President Itamar Franco's injunction blocking an 11 per cent salary increase 12 days ago. The Bovespa index ended at 14,693, up 102 points. Turnover was Cr218.8bn (Dollars 248.7m).</p>

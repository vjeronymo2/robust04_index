			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / White House staff cut by 25%: Clinton carries out pledge to ensure government makes do with less PRESIDENT Bill Clinton fulfilled a campaign promise yesterday by announcing a 25 per cent reduction in the White House staff, proclaiming that 'government must do more and make do with less'. The cuts, to take effect by October 1, the start of the next fiscal year, will reduce the number of those in the office of the president to 1,044 from the 1,394 on the payroll at the end of the Bush administration. Estimated savings, including salary cuts of 6-10 per cent and the elimination of other perks such as unlimited newspaper subscriptions, are put at about Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.6m) a year. Other departments and agencies are expected to announce cost savings as part of Mr Clinton's broader goal of eliminating 100,000 federal jobs out of about 3m. Announcing the cuts, Mr Clinton said: 'This is one of the few times in history that any president has actually shrunk the size of the White House staff'. It would lead to 'leaner, more effective government'. Mr Mack McLarty, the White House chief of staff, said the president would make do with 10 per cent fewer senior aides. He added that the reductions were designed to send 'a strong message' to other departments and to Congress that sacrifices would have to be made in the interests of cutting the federal deficit. Exempt from the cuts announced yesterday are staff at the Office of Management and Budget and the trade representative, who together employ about 800 people. Though traditionally part of the White House structure, the heads of both enjoy cabinet rank and will, therefore, have to come up with economies similar to other departments. Actual redundancies will be minimised. Nearly 300 of the existing White House staff are career civil servants on secondment from other agencies and will return to their departments. Hardest hit is the drug policy office, mostly filled with political appointees, which will come down in size to 25 people against 146 under President Bush. However its chief, when appointed, will be elevated to cabinet rank, Mr McLarty said. Among other symbolic changes, henceforth only three senior aides - the chief of staff and the national security adviser and his deputy - will be automatically entitled to use White House chauffeured limousines.</p>

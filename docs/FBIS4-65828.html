			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Press Release No. PRES/94/97: "Ministerial Meeting and </F> Fifth GCC-EU Joint Council"]    [Text] Riyadh, 8 May -- The fifth session of the Joint  Council established in accordance with the cooperation agreement  between the EU [European Union] on the one hand, and the  countries parties to the charter of the Cooperation Council for  the Arab States of the Gulf (UAE, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman,  Qatar and Kuwait) [GCC] on the other hand, was held in Riyadh,  Saudi Arabia on 8 May 1994.    Both sides discussed a number of regional and international  questions of common interest in an open and constructive way,  with a view to fostering cooperation between their two regions.    The Joint Council reviewed developments in commercial and  economic cooperation between the two sides. Ministers noted the  continuing importance of bilateral trade relations. They  welcomed the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the  signature of the final act in Marrakesh on 12-15 April 1994  which would provide a major boost to the improving prospects for  the world economy. GCC ministers informed EU ministers of the  recent actions of GCC countries to become full members of the  GATT or to make applications for membership. EU ministers  welcomed these developments as positive steps which would  contribute to the strengthening of the international trading  system. Ministers welcomed prospects of EU and GCC countries  being members of the new world trade organization.    The Joint Council received a report from the Joint  Cooperation Committee on implementation of the cooperation  agreement.    The Joint Council took note of the report of the ad hoc  group  on the interrelated issues of energy and environment which had  been set up in accordance with the Joint Council's decision to  continue the EU-GCC dialogue on these issues. Ministers agreed  that the report was an excellent, comprehensive study which  constituted a useful basis for clarifying the relevant issues  and providing guidance for future cooperation between the two  parties.    The Joint Council agreed that cooperation in the field of  energy and the environment should be based on the principles and  objectives of the EU-GCC cooperation agreement and should also  be guided by the principles of GATT and moves towards a more  balanced world economy and more liberalised world trade regime.    Ministers recognised the interrelationships between energy  and economic growth policies on the one hand, and environment  policies on the other hand. They took note of forecasts in the  report of continuing world economic growth and growth in world  demand for energy as well as prospects for increasing EU-GCC  energy interdependence. They noted the complementary aspects of  the environment/energy/economic growth relationship and the need  for appropriate policies to deal with these issues without  arresting economic growth or harming the international flow of  trade.    Ministers noted the importance of stability and transparency  in world energy markets and that balanced supply and demand  would be in the best interests of both suppliers and consumers  of energy and would also facilitate energy investment.    Regarding global environment concerns, ministers recognised  that the Framework Convention on Climate Change seeks to find  reasonable, balanced and comprehensive approaches to the issue  of climate change consistent with sustainable development.    Ministers agreed to continue the dialogue on the important  energy/environment interrelationship and reaffirmed their  commitment to strengthen economic and trade relations in  accordance with the principles and objectives of the cooperation  agreement.    The Joint Council approved the recommendations and proposals  for cooperation on other subjects contained in the report of the  Joint Cooperation Committee.    Ministers welcomed the proposals for a three-year programme  of cooperation agreed between the standardisation and metrology  organization of the GCC countries and the European Commission  and European standards organizations. They supported the  proposal of the Joint Cooperation Committee to examine the  possibility of increasing EU investment and joint venture  creation in the GCC region and in this connection drew attention  to the important contribution which would be made by the third  EU-GCC industrial conference to be held in Muscat in 1995. The  Joint Council expressed satisfaction with the extensive two-year  programme of training GCC customs officials prepared by the  official consortium of EU customs services and urged the joint  cooperation committee to intensify human resources development  cooperation. The Joint Council approved the decisions of the  Joint Cooperation Committee to convene meetings of the  Industrial Cooperation Working Group, the Energy Group and the  Environment Group to draw up new proposals for cooperation in  the respective sectors.    Both sides reiterated their determination to speedily  conclude the ongoing free trade negotiations.    The ministers of the EU and the GCC countries had a full  exchange of views on developments in their two regions.    The ministers reviewed a series of international and  regional political issues of mutual interest in an open and  cordial manner. In this respect, they were guided by their  continued commitment to the principles enshrined in the UN  charter and the principles of international law applicable to  the development of cordial relations among nations. The GCC  ministers, while noting the diversity of systems of values,  which should be taken fully into consideration, joined the EU  ministers in reiterating their continuing commitment to the  promotion of human rights. They reaffirmed their commitment to  respect for the sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial  integrity of all states and held these principles to be  universal in character and therefore applicable equally.    The ministers noted with the utmost concern the continued  Iraqi defiance of UN Security Council resolutions. They  reiterated their view that prompt and full Iraqi implementation  of all relevant Security Council resolutions remained a  prerequisite for the establishment of peace and stability in the  Gulf region. In this context, the ministers condemned the Iraqi  regime for its failure to implement Security Council resolutions  in full and its policy of selectivity in implementing such  resolutions. In particular, the ministers underlined the  importance they attached to Iraq's full and unconditional  compliance with Resolution 687 concerning the immediate release  of all Kuwaiti and other POWs and detainees held by Iraq, Iraq's  weapons of mass destruction, and Iraq's payment of full  compensation for the losses and damages caused by her aggression  against the State of Kuwait. The ministers reiterated their  support for Security Council Resolution 833 which reaffirms the  inviolability of the international borders of the State of  Kuwait and endorses the final report of the special UN committee  entrusted with the demarcation of the Iraqi/Kuwaiti  international borders.    Reaffirming their governments' continued commitment to the  unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Iraq, the  ministers expressed alarm and dismay at the continued repression  and sufferings of the entire Iraqi population, for which the  Iraqi regime bears sole responsibility. The ministers stressed  the need for Iraq's unconditional compliance with and effective  implementation of Security Council Resolutions 688, 706 and 712.    The ministers emphasised the need for cooperation and  peaceful coexistence among all states in the Gulf region based  on respect for recognized norms and principles of international  law. They acknowledged the right of countries to acquire the  means to defend themselves, but expressed concern over arms  acquisition policies which were not justified by the  requirements of legitimate defence. They expressed their strong  belief that individual countries' arms procurement should not  pose a threat to regional stability. The ministers reaffirmed  their strong opposition to all forms of terrorism, whatever  their origin, cause and motive, as well as subversive activities  in other countries. Basing themselves on the principles of  non-interference in the internal affairs of other states and  respect for national laws, the ministers expressed their strong  belief that no state was entitled to apply its laws outside its  boundaries or to assume the jurisdiction of another sovereign  state.    In this respect the ministers noted with concern the lack of  progress in the dialogue between the United Arab Emirates and  the Islamic Republic of Iran over the question of the three  islands. In this context, the foreign minister of the United  Arab Emirates briefed the ministers on the initiative of His  Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, president of the  United Arab Emirates, calling for a resolution to the question  through negotiations in accordance with international law and  peaceful co-existence among states. The ministers called on the  Islamic Republic of Iran to respond positively to this  initiative.    The ministers reaffirmed their commitment to the non-  proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. They reiterated  their commitment to promoting the establishment of a zone free  from all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East and  called upon all countries not yet parties to non proliferation  treaties [NPT] to become signatories to them as soon as  possible. They noted with satisfaction that the Convention on  Non-Proliferation of Chemical Weapons which constitutes an  essential contribution to the establishment of zones free from  all weapons of mass destruction has been signed by a large  number of countries both in Europe and in the Middle East and  urged all countries in both regions to do so.    In this context the ministers expressed their hope for a  successful conclusion of the NPT at the 1995 conference.    The ministers reviewed developments in the Middle East peace  process. They paid tribute to the vision and courage of the  Palestinian and Israeli leaders who signed the historic  Declaration of Principles in Washington on 13 September 1993,  which represented a breakthrough in the peace process.    The ministers reiterated their governments' support for UN  Security Council Resolution 904/94, which called for the  establishment of a temporary international presence in the  occupied territories and was adopted following the massacre at  Hebron. The ministers expressed their abhorrence for and  condemnation of all acts of violence against innocent civilians  and their sorrow at the resulting loss of life. The ministers  agreed that such tragic events highlighted the importance of the  peace process under way, which should not be interrupted.    The ministers appealed for the question of the safety of  Palestinians to be addressed urgently in accordance with the  Fourth Geneva Convention. They reiterated their view that the  Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, including east  Jerusalem, are illegal under international law and constitute an  obstacle to peace. In the EU's view, the lifting of the Arab  boycott would also contribute to furthering the cause of the  peace process.    The ministers welcomed the agreement on Gaza/Jericho signed  in Cairo on 4 may and expressed their complete support for its  full and early implementation. They urged all sides to  cooperate in ensuring the successful implementation of the  agreement. They highlighted the importance they attach to the  achievement of early and substantial progress in the other  bilateral negotiations, particularly the Syrian track, with a  view to ensuring a just, comprehensive and durable peace in the  Middle East.    The ministers expressed the determination of the EU and the  GCC to continue to play an active and constructive role in the  multilateral negotiations, which complement but are not a  substitute for the bilateral tracks. The ministers reiterated  their view that substantial progress in the bilaterals would  greatly contribute to the success of the multilaterals. Both  sides reiterated the importance of all forms of assistance,  including economic assistance, to the occupied territories.    Both sides reaffirmed their support for the Ta'if Accord as  the best basis for enabling the state of Lebanon to extend its  authority over the totality of the Lebanese territories and for  preserving Lebanon's independence, sovereignty, unity and  territorial integrity. The ministers expressed their  satisfaction with the progress achieved in the context of this  accord. They remain committed to participation in Lebanon's  reconstruction.    EU ministers briefed GCC ministers on progress made in the  development of its relations with the Maghreb; and on their  efforts to secure the implementation by Libya and others of  Security Council Resolutions 731, 748 and 883.    The ministers were deeply concerned by the eruption of the  hostilities in Yemen. They called on all the parties concerned  to exercise self-restraint, cease hostilities, listen to the  dictates of reason and dialogue and place the interests of the  people of Yemen above all other considerations.    The ministers welcomed the agreement on a constitution for a  Muslim-Croat Federation and the cease fire in central Bosnia.  They condemned the attack against Gorazde. They called for  full respect for all safe areas and for the strengthening of  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces in Yugoslavia] with a view to  ensuring that the ceasefire is maintained, the safety of these  areas is ensured and normal life can be restored.    The ministers expressed full support for the efforts of the  international community to reach an early negotiated settlement  of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina acceptable to all parties.  In this context they underscored that the parameters of the EU  action plan, which have been approved by all the parties in  Geneva, remain a solid basis for reaching a comprehensive  agreement, not only for Bosnia-Herzegovina, but in the former  Yugoslavia as a whole.    The GCC ministers expressed the view that the arms embargo  be  lifted so as to allow Bosnia-Herzegovina the right of  self-defence in accordance with article 51 of the UN charter.    The ministers reiterated that those responsible for brutal  violations of human rights in the former Yugoslavia must be held  personally accountable and urged all countries to actively  cooperate with the international war crimes tribunal.    The ministers underlined that their countries must stand  prepared to contribute to the future process of implementing a  peace settlement as well as political and economic  reconstruction in the former Yugoslavia.    Both sides agreed that the sixth meeting of the Joint  Council  will be held in the European Union in the first half of 1995.

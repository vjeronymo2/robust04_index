			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "French-Bulgarian Observatory"] </F>   [Text] An environmental observatory has been set up in the  Musala mountains in Bulgaria. This joint French and Bulgarian  project was an initiative of J. Stamenov, director of the Sofia  Nuclear Research Institute, and J.-P. Carbonnel, head of  research at the CNRS [French National Center for Scientific  Research] responsible for this project on behalf of the French  Environment Ministry. The implementation of this project is the  concrete result of the French Embassy's wish to come to the  assistance of Bulgarian science. From 19 to 25 September, a  summer university made it possible for research workers from the  two countries to discuss the results of an initial field  campaign to monitor the ecology of the Musala mountain range and  consider future cooperation. For example, Meteo-France [French  Meteorological Office] will supply two high- mountain  meteorological stations, and the University of Franche- Comte  will supply a complete set of equipment for continuously  measuring radon in water. Moreover, the various Bulgarian  laboratories involved will be linked up by a computer network,  thanks to funding from the French Foreign Ministry. In order to  optimize coordination of the cooperative efforts, a scientific  interest grouping (GIS) will be set up this month in Paris.</p>

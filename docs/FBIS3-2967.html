Export reliance measures the percentage of Taiwan's total  export value that goes to a country.    Hsiao revealed the figures while delivering a speech on  cross- Strait relations and future economic development  sponsored by the National Unification Council Thursday [10  March].    Citing Hong Kong customs tallies, Hsiao said that  cross-Strait trade increased from US$2.7 billion in 1988 to  US$8.69 billion in 1993.    In 1988, Taiwan's exports to Mainland China via Hong Kong  totaled US$2.24 billion, accounting for 3.7 percent of Taiwan's  total exports. The figure jumped to US$7.59 billion in 1993.    [Word indistinct] said that most of Taiwan investment on the  mainland would now be considered long-term, and that investors  are now targeting inland regions and moving away from coastal  areas.    Investors are also putting their money into  technology-intensive enterprises rather than labor-intensive  ones, and into medium- and large-sized ventures rather than  small ones.</p>

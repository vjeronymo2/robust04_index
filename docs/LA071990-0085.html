			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> SETTLEMENT REACHED IN DIVER'S DEATH  </P> <P> The family of a Westlake Village man who drowned in a 1986 diving accident has  reached an out-of-court settlement with the Thousand Oaks business that  provided his scuba lessons.  </P> <P> Far West Sports has agreed to pay $450,000 to the family of Thomas Guerin, 49,  who drowned in about 15 feet of water off Anacapa Island the same day that he  and two of his children completed a scuba course, said Donald Aldrich,  president of the company and one of the instructors.  </P> <P> The settlement, to be paid by the company's insurer, is not an admission of  liability by the company or instructors Aldrich and David Haines, Aldrich said.  </P> <P> Ventura County Superior Court Judge Allan L. Steele approved the settlement  Monday.  </P> <P> Another lawsuit filed by the family against Learning Tree University, which has  campuses in Thousand Oaks and Chatsworth and offered the diving course, is  still pending, Aldrich said.  </P> <P> Guerin, his daughter Kimberly and his son Christopher had been certified as  divers and were on their first solo dive when the accident occurred, Aldrich  said.  </P> <P> "They were properly trained," Aldrich said.  </P> <P> "But Guerin panicked or else he had a heart attack. There was some evidence  that he died of natural causes."  </P> <P> Members of the Guerin family could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Although Aldrich denied fault in the accident, he said his insurance company  agreed to the settlement to avoid the possibility of a jury awarding higher  damages.

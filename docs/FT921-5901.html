			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Bosnia claims independence poll victory THE leaders of Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday claimed victory in an independence poll at the weekend, prompting fears that violence could erupt soon between the three main national groups in the republic. Initial results showed more than half the 3.2m electorate had cast their votes, despite a boycott proclaimed by local leaders of the Serb minority, which accounts for 31 per cent of the population. Croats, who make up 17 per cent of Bosnia's 4.3m population, appeared to side with Slavic Moslems, the republic's biggest national group, in voting for independence. Mr Haris Silajdzic, the foreign minister of Bosnia, yesterday said: 'If the European Community is concerned with stability Bosnia should be recognised at once . . . We expect automatic recognition because the referendum was the only condition set by the EC.' EC foreign ministers will discuss Yugoslavia when they hold their regular monthly meeting today. Any clear vote for independence emerging out of yesterday's referendum is expected to increase pressure for EC diplomatic recognition of that republic. A 'yes' vote in the referendum would deal a mortal blow to Serbia's plans to keep Bosnia within a Yugoslav federation. Serbs in northern Bosnia on Saturday reaffirmed their pledge to form a Serbian republic of Bosnia and secede, if Bosnia's independence from Yugoslavia is recognised. Diplomats fear that a recent spate of explosions and road blocks, reminiscent of events in Croatia leading up to the outbreak of war in June, could presage the violent division of Bosnia. Three people were killed on Saturday in a gun battle in central Bosnia, when masked gunmen set up road blocks in retaliation against Croats, who were blockading a munitions factory supplying the federal army. The presence of the Serb-dominated army is a major hurdle to Bosnia's quest for independence. Mr Silajdzic said: 'The Yugoslav army is one of the inherited problems, but we will negotiate and hold talks. Now everyone knows what war is like.' Meanwhile voters in a referendum in the small republic of Montenegro, a close ally of Serbia, yesterday were expected to vote in favour of remaining in Yugoslavia, now consisting of only two republics. The European Community will reconvene its Yugoslav peace conference in Brussels on March 9, despite the fact the EC's continuing internal differences over policy towards certain republics make it harder for the Community to play neutral peace-broker, David Buchan writes from Brussels.</p>

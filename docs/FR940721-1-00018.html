			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 5, 1992 (57 FR 52950), the USEPA published a final rule (I/M Rule) establishing I/M requirements pursuant to section 182. On June 28, 1994 the USEPA published a proposal to amend requirements pertaining to SIP submissions for areas required to implement a basic I/M program that submit, and otherwise qualify for approval of, a redesignation request (``Proposed I/M Redesignation Rule''). The authority for that amendment is discussed in that proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The I/M Redesignation Rule proposes to allow areas that have requested redesignation to attainment, and are otherwise eligible to obtain approval of the request, to defer adoption and implementation of otherwise applicable requirements established in the originally promulgated I/M rule. For such areas, the USEPA does not believe it is necessary to revise or adopt new regulations which are not essential for clean air, and which would not be implemented after redesignation occurred because they are not necessary for maintenance. The proposed rule applies only to areas that by virtue of their air quality classification are required to implement a basic I/M program and that submit and obtain approval of a redesignation request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For such areas, the I/M Redesignation Rule proposes that the I/M component of the I/M SIP contain the following four criteria:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Legislative authority for basic I/M meeting all the requirements of subpart S such that implementing regulations can be adopted without any further legislative action,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A provision in the SIP providing that basic I/M be placed in the contingency measures portion of the maintenance plan upon redesignation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) a contingency measure consisting of a commitment by the Governor or his/her designee to adopt regulations to implement the I/M program in response to a specified triggering event, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) a commitment that includes an enforceable schedule for the adoption and implementation of a basic I/M program including appropriate milestones in the event the contingency measure is triggered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this rulemaking, the USEPA is considering Michigan's I/M submittal based on the proposed I/M requirements for areas otherwise eligible for redesignation. If the State's redesignation request is not otherwise eligible for approval at the time the USEPA takes final action on it, or if the proposed I/M requirements for redesignation are not codified, Michigan's submittal will be judged by the current I/M approvability criteria as detailed in the USEPA's final I/M rule promulgated on November 5, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in the Proposed I/M Redesignation Rule, while the USEPA considers the redesignation request, the State continues to be required to meet all the current SIP submission requirements including fully adopted rules and specific implementation deadlines as required under 40 CFR &sect;51.372 of the I/M Rule. If the State does not comply with these requirements, it could be subject to sanctions pursuant to section 179. If the redesignation request is approved, any sanctions already imposed or any sanctions clock already triggered would be terminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> II. Finding of USEPA Review <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 15, 1993 the State submitted a redesignation request including I/M as a contingency measure for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area to the USEPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

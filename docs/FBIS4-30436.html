			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Kwon Sang-un] </F>   [Text] On 26 June, the Office of National Railroads [ONR]  disclosed its plan to mete out strong disciplinary measures--  including the deprivation of their status or dismissal from  their posts--on the members of the National Council of  Locomotive Engineers [NCLE] who have not yet reported to their  work after the deadline set for their return has passed, by  classifying them into several categories, depending on the  degree of their active participation in the strike. The ONR has  also decided to dismiss some 500 employees, including about 210  who have not yet returned to work after they were released by  the police with a warning, and the executives of the NCLE  headquarters and its 20 nation-wide branch offices.</p>

			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCKTON TEACHERS REJECT DISTRICT'S CONTRACT OFFER; SUBSTITUTES BEING HIRED  </P> <P> Teachers here ended Christmas vacation Tuesday by manning picket lines.  </P> <P> The Stockton Unified School District's latest offer was rejected by 89% of the  Stockton Teachers Assn. members during a special meeting on New Year's night,  said Milly Bettinger of the California Teachers Assn.  </P> <P> The 1,410-teacher district was hiring substitutes to replace striking teachers,  spokesman John Klose said. The exact numbers of strikers and substitutes hired  was unavailable, but Klose estimated that there was one teacher for every 100  students in the 31,700-student district. Normally, the ratio is one to 30.  </P> <P> The district has offered raises of 4.5% this year and 5% next fall on a salary  range that starts at $22,700 annually and goes to $39,560 for the most  experienced, best educated teachers. The teachers are seeking raises of 8% now  and 9% next year, Bettinger said.  </P></p>

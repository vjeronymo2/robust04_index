			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MIDWIFE SENTENCED IN 3 INFANT DEATHS  </P> <P> An unlicensed midwife accused of murder in the deaths of three infants she  helped deliver pleaded guilty Tuesday to involuntary manslaughter and received  probation, but not before she was ordered by a judge to "stay as far away from  pregnant women as you possibly can."  </P> <P> Delores Doyle, 36, of Montclair, received a suspended eight-year prison  sentence and was released on five years' probation. Los Angeles Superior Court  Judge Judith C. Chirlin told Doyle not to provide any type of health care or  work for anyone who does.  </P> <P> "I want you nowhere near anybody or anything that anybody could interpret as  your practicing medicine," Chirlin said.  </P> <P> Doyle entered the plea during the first month of her trial with co-defendant  Dr. Milos Klvana, 48, a Valencia obstetrician, who faces nine murder charges.  The prosecution contends that Klvana and Doyle did not recommend hospital  treatment in cases where deliveries involved high-risk complications.  </P></p>

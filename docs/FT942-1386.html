			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Energy traders get integrated Oil and gas traders, who have had to work with a proliferation of on-line information sources, can now combine them all in a single PC-based workstation. Saladin, a UK-based energy information company, this week launched Crusader, a software product designed to integrate real-time market sources and prices with historical data on one terminal. Integration in this way offers two main advantages. First, the trader's office becomes physically less cluttered. And second, the combined terminal can carry out data analysis, including forecasts of future price movements, which would be much more difficult with individual sources. Similar software exists to integrate the mainstream financial information sources, but Saladin says that energy trading stands out for the sheer number of different sources available. Crusader will cost about Pounds 2,000 a month for a five-user system. Saladin: UK, 0932 243233.</p>

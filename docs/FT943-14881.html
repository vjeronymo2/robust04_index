			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (6): Global purchasing takes off - Kevin Done discusses Ford's drive to reform relations with suppliers The bold move by Ford of the US, the world's second largest vehicle maker, to merge its North American and European automotive operations into a single operating unit, Ford Automotive Operations, will give fresh impetus to its drive to reform relations with its components suppliers. Ford has embarked on the most drastic restructuring of its organisation in its 91-year history in a radical attempt to break down the traditional national and regional barriers inside the group in order to regain a competitive edge over its closest rivals. From January 1 next year it is setting up five so-called vehicle centres, one in Europe and four in the US. Each centre will have worldwide responsibility for the design, development and engineering of particular vehicle ranges - in the case of Europe for small and medium-sized cars. This radical shake-up of the Ford organisation will have a crucial impact on the purchasing of components and systems from outside suppliers, which typically in the world auto industry account for more than half of a car's ex-factory value. Ford maintains that the development of a global components supply activity will provide 'economies of scale, world-class supplier productivity and cost levels, improved quality, faster time to market, better product innovation and enhanced supplier design involvement and support'. It will also mean that it will be able to choose the best products to be offered worldwide in any particular category. Under the new structure purchasing will be one of the functions subordinated to each vehicle centre, and it will operate globally. Crucially it has been the CDW-27 project, Ford's first successful so-called world car programme, that has broken much new ground in preparing the way for the global reorganisation, and which in the process has brought Ford for the first time fully into the era of global purchasing of components and systems. The Dollars 6bn project spawned first the Ford Mondeo large family car in Europe in spring last year, while its sister cars, the Ford Contour and the Mercury Mystique, will go on sale in Ford's showrooms across North America in the autumn. Assembly will take place at Ford plants at Genk, Belgium, at Kansas City in the US and at Cuautitlan, Mexico. After a global search, common component producers have been chosen in many cases to supply the European and the US and Mexican assembly plants. Albert Caspers, the new chairman of Ford of Europe, says that the share taken by north American suppliers of the European-built Mondeo has jumped to 15 per cent from only 1 per cent to 2 per cent in Ford of Europe's traditional programmes. 'We have also brought many European suppliers to North America and some have made joint ventures in the US,' he says. 'The philosophy was to develop a part only once from one supplier for the world. This is the first project where we have done this.' As a result of the effort to develop an integrated, global supply base there has been a drastic reduction in the total number of suppliers. The soon-to-be-replaced US-built Ford Tempo/Mercury Topaz range has more than 700 suppliers - all in North America - whereas the successor Ford Contour/Mercury Mystique models will have only 227 suppliers, drawn from around the world. According to Kerry Caliman, the CDW-27 project manager for purchasing for Ford's North American automotive operations, 'the more business you can source globally, using the same supplier for the same part for both North America and Europe, the more you'll benefit from economies of scale and focused quality control efforts.' Ford is planning sales volumes for the CDW-27 product range of around 300,000 a year in North America, 400,000 a year in Europe and a total of around 800,000 a year worldwide. Mr Caliman says that another cost advantage lies in placing long-term contracts with suppliers and in single sourcing. 'That gives us the opportunity for quality advantages and productivity cost reductions from these suppliers - and that has bottom-line impact.' Around 65 per cent of the total CDW-27 vehicle costs are covered by parts that are either: Single-sourced from one supplier shipping from one location in the world to all three assembly plants; Single-sourced from a single company, but the company has manufacturing or shipping locations in both North America and Europe; or are Dual-sourced, so that Europe and North America each has its supplier, but the part can be common and there are two sets of tools. As part of the reforms Eckhard Jokisch, vice-president of supply at Ford of Europe, says that Ford 'must sweep away the old adversarial relationships between supplier and manufacturer replacing them with one based on trust and equal partnership.' He claims that Ford 'is now working with rather than against suppliers,' which have proved 'a very useful weapon in our fight against unnecessary waste'. During the past 18 months Ford of Europe and its suppliers have set up more than 200 teams, made up equally of Ford and supplier personnel, aimed at cutting costs and waste at Ford itself and at the suppliers. The teams select components for analysis and are empowered to take cost reduction actions bypassing Ford's 'traditionally slow systems,' says Mr Jokisch. The teams analyse the complete supply chain from design and development through testing and manufacture right up to assembly into the finished vehicle. 'We believe that if we apply this analysis to all commodities, we can cut material costs by 25 per cent,' says Mr Jokisch. The cost savings can be achieved not by cutting supplier profit margins, he insists, but 'by eliminating the waste that exists in the supply chain'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 26 April, Ernesto Melendez, Cuban minister of  Foreign Investment and Economic Cooperation, condemned the U.S.  blockade at the 25th meeting of the Economic Commission for  Latin America and the Caribbean being held in Cartagena,  Colombia.    Melendez also condemned U.S. pressure on countries in the  region to prevent Cuba from joining regional integration  organizations in specific sectors such as tourism. In his  address, Melendez stressed the deplorable health indexes of the  continent, which have been aggravated by the imposed economic  models. Regarding these models of commercial opening, complete  privatization, and unregulated foreign investment, Melendez  pointed out that 270 million people living in poverty is too  high a figure for a population of 450 million people, in  addition to distressing indexes of unemployment, infant  mortality, and education, which brings to mind an endemic  adjustment rather than a true recovery.</p>

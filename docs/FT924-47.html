			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Food manufacturing Europe's consumers are not alone in suffering from the absurd distortions created by the Common Agricultural Policy. Many of Europe's big food manufacturers must reckon they have lost out too. The theory is that artificially high commodity prices have shielded small producers from their bigger rivals. An inefficient market for many processed foods has resulted. Imperfect though the comparison may be, it is interesting to contrast the share price performance of the food manufacturing sectors on either side of the Atlantic. In the UK, the sector has been flat when set against the main market over the past decade. In the US, it has outperformed by a factor approaching three. The differing structure of the industries and the relative power of retailers have clearly played their part. But a freer market for agricultural commodities in the US may also have helped the industry's profitability. With CAP reform and finalisation of the Gatt talks in prospect, European investors must be wondering whether to stock up on food company shares to benefit from the industry's seemingly imminent rationalisation. But they can, perhaps, afford to wait a while. There is not going to be a sudden revolution. Apart from commodity items, raw material prices now constitute a small proportion of a product's total cost. Marketing and packaging expenses are often far more significant for those manufacturers higher up the added value chain. Nevertheless, food price reform should hasten the long-term trends shaping the industry. For vulnerable food companies, there are already enough threats to make their executives wake up screaming in the small hours. The accelerating concentration of the industry in response to the single European market has resulted in the emergence of powerful pan-European operators such as Nestle, BSN and Unilever. The growing strength of retail buying groups - as well as cross-border retailers - will also add to the rationalisation squeeze. Local companies serving local needs may yet evade such pressures. To be small may still be beautiful; to be middling will be ugly.</p>

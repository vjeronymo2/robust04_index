			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 21 (AFP)--China said Thursday [21  April] it would "draw a lesson" from the murder of 24 Taiwanese  visitors during a pleasure boat trip last month, pledging to  take steps to ensure the safety of foreign tourists.    The foreign ministry spokeswoman nevertheless defended the  Chinese authorities' handling of the incident on Qiandao lake in  the eastern city of Hangzhou, amid accusations from Taiwan of an  official coverup. "Chinese government always attaches great  importance to the personal and property safety of overseas  tourists. The Qiandao lake incident was an unexpected one," a  foreign ministry spokeswoman said.    Relevant officials, including "leaders of the State  Council,"  took the matter seriously and "dealt with the aftermath in a  swift and proper manner and concentrated their efforts to find  out what really happened in the incident within quite a short  period," she said.    The burned bodies of 30 people -- including six Chinese  cabin  crew and the two mainland guides of the Taiwanese tourists --  were found in a small cabin on the bottom deck of a pleasure  boat on March 31. China initially maintained it was an  accident, but said later it was a case of "robbery, murder and  arson" and arrested three civilians.    "Our judicial organs will severely punish the criminals  concerned according to law through judicial procedure," the  spokeswoman said, adding that steps would be taken to prevent a  recurrence. "The departments concerned and the local  governments of China will draw a lesson from the incident and  further improve their work so as to guarantee better protection  of the safety of overseas tourists," she said.    China's semi-official body for dealing with Taiwan on  Wednesday invited its counterpart from the Nationalist island to  Hangzhou to discuss the incident, which has caused a major  setback in the gradual thaw in ties between the longtime rivals  in Beijing and Taipei. Taiwan has launched a series of  boycotts, including suspending cultural and educational  exchanges, halting sightseeing trips in China and reviewing  economic policies to press Beijing to reveal the truth.</p>

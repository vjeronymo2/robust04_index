			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Treatt 8% higher at Pounds 1.27m PRE-TAX profits of Treatt, the USM-quoted supplier, blender and distiller of essential oils and aromatic chemicals, showed an 8 per cent advance, from Pounds 1.18m to Pounds 1.27m, in the year to end-September. The outcome was achieved on turnover up Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 15.1m. Earnings per share rose to 9.37p (8.53p) and an improved final dividend of 2.6p is proposed, making 3.6p (3.4p).

			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> OBJECT IN ROADWAY CAUSES FATAL FREEWAY COLLISION  </P> <P> Two people were killed and two others were critically injured when a car  collided with a truck on the Golden State Freeway after both tried to avoid  hitting a huge metal object early Wednesday, authorities said.  </P> <P> Maria Rodriguez Sierra, 39, and her husband, Guillermo Cardenas Sierra, 28, of  Los Angeles were pronounced dead at the scene, said Pat Marek, spokesman for  the Los Angeles Fire Department.  </P> <P> The crash occurred just before 5 a.m. in the northbound lanes of the freeway,  south of the Glendale Freeway.  </P> <P> California Highway Patrol officers said the accident was caused by a  2,000-pound ramp -- used to load heavy equipment onto trucks -- that apparently  had fallen onto the road from another vehicle. The driver of that vehicle was  being sought.  </P> <P> The car carrying the victims struck the ramp and began to spin clockwise and to  the right, said Officer Vince Zambrana. The truck was traveling behind the car  and also hit the ramp.  </P> <P> The truck veered to the right, then broadsided the car, pushing it 400 to 500  feet north, Zambrana said.  </P> <P> The impact of the collision left the car jammed underneath the truck, Marek  said. Firefighters worked for 45 minutes to free two surviving passengers from  the wreckage using the "Jaws of Life."  </P> <P> Douglas McNeal, 50, and Elia Acosta, 30, were listed in critical condition at  County-USC Medical Center, a hospital spokesman said.  </P> <P> The driver of the truck was unharmed and there were no other injuries.  </P> <P> The accident left traffic backed up for miles during the morning commute, a CHP  officer said. Three lanes of the northbound Golden State Freeway were blocked  off and a SigAlert remained in affect until noon.  </P></p>

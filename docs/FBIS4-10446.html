			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] There is still no reaction from the Chamber of  Deputies more than 24 hours after the vote on application of  Article 149 of the Constitution by the Senate office led by  Senator Bernard Sansaricq. Some deputies have begun to react to  this proposal by the Senate. Edner Jean, after questioning some  Haitian deputies on 11 April, filed this report:    [Begin Jean recording] First of all, the president of the  Chamber of Deputies was in a stew on 11 April because the office  of Bernard Sansaricq not only disregarded his warnings, but  forced the parliamentary gates in order to hold their  exceptional session on 10 April. In fact, it was by breaking  into the parliament, blowing up the institution's lockers, that  the 18 January elected senators were able to enter the  Legislative Palace. After the session, in the euphoria of the  moment and the satisfaction of an accomplished feat, they did  not even take the time to close the doors behind them, leaving  the parliament's premises open to the night. In response to  this, President Monde was so angry that he could not stay in his  office on 11 April.    We were able to make contact with the few deputies present  in  the Legislative Palace, and please understand that the  legislators of the lower chamber have not budged one inch from  their official position, meaning they simply reject any solution  that does not take into account the interests of the various  parties involved in the crisis.    National Front for Change and Democracy, FNCD, Deputy Serge  Jean-Louis did not hesitate to say that the men Senator Bernard  Sansaricq is leading are irresponsible men. [passage omitted] We  learned from reliable sources that the BP-FNCD will, within the  next few hours, publicly issue its common position on this  decision. The same is true for the socialists, who have been in  consultation since 11 April. Everything leads us to believe that  those political blocs are simply going to renew their support  for the parliamentary plan, as pointed out by Deputy Milou  Laguerre, a veteran among the deputies, who confessed to Radio  Metropole that he does not know much. [passage omitted]    The decision, unanimously reached by the office of Bernard  Sansaricq, could, however, receive the support of some deputies.  But there again, nothing is really relinquished to Bernard  Sansaricq because those deputies seem to want to impose their  own conditions. [passage omitted]    All things considered, the deputies might need to take a  stand during their Tuesday session on this resolution proposed  by the branch of the Senate led by Sen. Bernard Sansaricq. [end  recording]</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SENATE VOTES TO TIE BASE CLOSINGS TO AUDIT  </P> <P> Opponents of the government's plan to close some military bases got a mild  victory Tuesday as a Senate subcommittee voted to tie the future of the  domestic bases to a congressional audit.  </P> <P> The $288.2-billion military spending bill approved by the Appropriations  defense subcommittee contains a provision that would prevent closure unless an  audit determines the savings to the Pentagon over six years exceeds the cost of  locking the gates.  </P> <P> A similar effort died in the House in July, but the Senate measure is  considered attractive because the General Accounting Office audit would include  all 86 bases targeted by a government commission. The House amendment affected  only 15 bases.  </P> <P> Critics have accused the Commission on Base Closure and Realignment of using  faulty data in the cases of some of the bases ordered to close by Sept. 30,  1995. They also question whether the commission considered the cost of  environmental cleanup at the sites.  </P> <P> The commission said the government would save $5.6 billion over 20 years if the  bases are closed.  </P></p>

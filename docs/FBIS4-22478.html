			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with M.Sh. Shaymiyev, president of the Republic </F> of Tatarstan, by Aleksandr Sabov, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA special  correspondent, Kazan-Moscow; date not given: "Did the Treaty  Reconcile the Two Constitutions?]    [Text]    [Begin boxed item] We will remind the reader of the stages  of  the three-year discussion between Russia and Tatarstan.    1990, August. Declaration of the Supreme Soviet of Tatarstan  on the state sovereignty of the republic was enunciated. It was  Tatarstan that opened the "parade of sovereignties" in Russia.    1992, March. Referendum: Mass support of the sovereignty of  the republic; moreover, not only by the Tatar but also by the  Russian-speaking population.    1992, November. On the basis of the results of the  referendum, a new constitution of the republic was adopted  proclaiming it a "sovereign state and a subject of international  law associated with the Russian Federation."    1993, December. As a result of the massive failure of voters  to participate, the elections in Tatarstan to the Federal  Assembly of Russia, in essence, were not held. The position of  the republic: New elections will be conducted only after the  signing of a special treaty between the Republic of Tatarstan  and the Russian Federation.    1994, 15 February. The leaders of the Russian Federation and  the Republic of Tatarstan signed the treaty "On the Demarcation  of Powers and Subjects of Jurisdiction between the Organs of  State Authority of the Russian Federation and the Republic of  Tatarstan."    1994, 13 March. Repeat elections were held with a rather  high  activeness of the population. Tatarstan took two seats on the  Federation Council and all five seats in the State Duma of  Russia.    [end boxed item]    [Sabov] In my opinion, here, in Tatarstan, after three years  of peripeteia, which Russia followed with anxiety, a certain  very important precedent was set for regulating relations  between the Federation and its components. In the treaty between  the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan, unlike  your constitution, the words on Tatarstan as "a sovereign state"  and "a subject of international law" are excluded, and the  concept of a Tatarstan that is "associated" is replaced by the  concept of a Tatarstan that is "united" with Russia. Tell me,  Mintimer Sharipovich, what do you see as the advantage of  joining the Federation in this way. Why did you not agree, like  Bashkortostan or Yakutia (Sakha), to sign the Federative Treaty  with the special supplements to it?    [Shaymiyev] Well, first, you are right in saying that our  relations with Russia remained uncertain for a long time, more  than three years. Not only were those who watched from the side  anxious, but there was also anxiety here among the residents of  the republic. It was intensified by the feeling of general  instability in Russia which, after the collapse of the Union, is  itself experiencing a time of troubles in its own history. We  were accused of separatism and violation of the integrity of  Russia. The so-called "central" mass media printed many articles  that were not objective, frequently confusing the demands of the  radical nationalistic movements of Tatarstan with the positions  of the official leadership of the republic. But, after all, they  never coincided. For example, as president, despite all the  pressure brought to bear on me, not once in any form did I  demand "independence" for Tatarstan. Overall, I always remained  calm, knowing that sooner or later Russia would understand and  appreciate our position.    It was three years ago, while adopting the Declaration on  the  Sovereignty of Tatarstan--imagine, this was in the time of the  Union, when hopes still existed for the success of the  Novo-Ogarevo process!--that we declared that as soon as we build  a rule-of-law society, relations between the republic and the  Federation should be built on a treaty basis and mutual  delegation of powers. At the time of the conduct of the  referendum on the official status of the republic, our Supreme  Soviet once again made a distinct clarification: Tatarstan is  not for violation of the integrity of the Russian Federation,  but is seeking a path of reasonable coordination of its  interests with all-Russian interests.    After the signing of the treaty on 15 February, I tirelessly  emphasized the principles of our joining the Federation in my  preelection campaign: a treaty basis, demarcation and delegation  of powers, and no violation of Russia's integrity. Our position  was consistent, because we defended the mutual conditionality of  these three principles from the very beginning.    [Sabov] Nevertheless, in the final stage, the matter ended  in  a compromise for you as well? After all, a number of provisions  of your constitution do not coincide with the provisions of the  treaty.    [Shaymiyev] Well, what can be done without a compromise? As  president, I cannot violate the Constitution of Tatarstan, under  which we are now living for the second year. Yes. The  constitution and the treaty differ in many articles. But we came  to an agreement in principle with B.N. Yeltsin--and this is  reflected in the treaty itself--that it, the treaty, prevails  over both constitutions--of the Republic of Tatarstan and of the  Russian Federation. If you wish, this is a document of the  coordination of two constitutions: Where they do not coincide,  both sides are guided by the provisions of the treaty. So, this  is a mutual compromise. Therefore, Russia itself does not raise  the fact that Tatarstan, say, must amend its Basic Law, just as  we in turn proceed from the fact that within the scope of  delegated powers Tatarstan can get along with the Russian  Constitution. But if we took the path or were forced to take the  path of revising the provisions of our constitution, then we  simply could not arrive at an agreement.    I must say frankly: The new Russian Constitution is  basically  decorative-federative. Even a majority of Russian political  scientists talk about this openly, and those who do not say it,  confirm it with their silence. In fact, this is the constitution  of a unitary state and, therefore, we did not agree to recognize  its action on our territory. But it has been adopted and has  become a reality. So the signing of the treaty, which has been  ascribed predominant meaning, is a fact of enormous political  significance for Russia as well: After this it in fact stops  being a unitary state.    [Sabov] But, after all, according to your logic, this is no  more than an exception: Tatarstan is only one of the 21  republics in the system of the Russian Federation...    [Shaymiyev] In this case, it is the first step toward the  renewal of the democratic Federation of Russia. By the fact of  signing the treaty, it stopped being a unitary state not only  with respect to Tatarstan but, no less important, also with  respect to itself.    [Sabov] But with respect to other regions?    [Shaymiyev] It is still unitary. But so that an empire of  lesser dimensions did not arise in place of the USSR, a  precedent was important for this: to disrupt the unitary  thinking that was already elevated to the constitutional level.  Incidentally, a long ago time we proposed at the Council of  Heads of Republics: Let us voluntarily unite and create a strong  federation. This would remove the tension and suspicion in the  relations of Russia with its previous autonomies that took on  the status of republics. But the fear intruded: What if after  the collapse of the Union the very same fate befell Russia as  well... As soon as we did not succeed in starting the collective  treaty process, we had no choice left: We came to an agreement  with Russia by ourselves.    [Sabov] Well, fine, the treaty prevails over the two  constitutions... But out of 21 republics, it seems, seven have  declared the supremacy of their own laws over all-Russian laws.  Is this really not a path toward disintegration?    [Shaymiyev] Yes. But this danger can be avoided, if the  republics conclude treaties with the Federation. For example, in  our case the concept of the supremacy of laws was transformed  entirely. In those powers that we delegated to the exclusive or  joint jurisdiction of the Federation, the supremacy of the  Russian Constitution is unconditionally recognized. But where  the treaty grants exclusive powers to Tatarstan, the principle  of the supremacy of its Basic Law is just as firm.    If the Federative Treaty became a part of the federal  constitution, which the regions tried to achieve at one time,  then possibly the powers could be more or less accurately  demarcated and delegated--from the localities to the center, and  vice versa. Incidentally, the first draft of the constitution  was drawn up in precisely this spirit. But then it was thrown  out! But the Federative Treaty simply was not included in the  new, final text of the constitution, which made it a document of  an unclear juridical nature. Its weakness is that it does not  provide a mechanism for the implementation of powers. In  contrast to our treaty, which we accompanied with 12  agreements--on questions of defense, ecology, higher education,  etc. We now know precisely which questions are "ours" and which  are "not ours."    [Sabov] To end the subject of the Federation: How do you see  the problem of krays and oblasts in Russia joining it?    [Shaymiyev] I think that the signing of the Federative  Treaty  with krays and oblasts was a mistake in principle. Russia itself  should have come out as one state, as a component of the  Federation that united all of its administrative entities. The  priority then is something else entirely: the economic equality  of the republics, on the one hand, and of the krays and oblasts  on the other.    [Sabov] It is written in your treaty with Russia: Tatarstan  is sovereign on the question of establishing its own state  institutions and structures of authority. But, in contrast to a  majority of the regions of Russia, you have not yet removed the  so-called soviet authority.    [Shaymiyev] The entire path we have traveled in three years:  the Declaration on State Sovereignty, the constitution, and the  program of economic reform in the republic--all this was done  with the very close participation of the Supreme Soviet, which  was elected at the time under a one-party system. As the head of  the executive authority, I can say that we did not have any  confrontation with the legislative authority, and there is none.  Of course, problems arose, but they were resolved with the  assistance of conciliatory commissions, or the deputies  themselves demanded the intervention of the president.    [Sabov] But, after all, life has changed! New parties have  emerged, and they are demanding their own place in political  life...    [Shaymiyev] True. However, should this be done by means of  the dispersal of the old organs of representative authority, and  is it not better to prepare a planned and painless transition to  a multiparty political system? We are preparing for such  elections. For this, it is necessary first of all to adopt a new  election law. Three variants of it have already been proposed,  but not one has passed yet. All that remains is to come to an  agreement on the principles of this reform.    [Sabov] And when does the term of power of the Supreme  Soviet  expire?    [Shaymiyev] In March next year. Thus, we still have almost a  year to go. We will hold new elections at the end of 1994 or  beginning of 1995. On a multiparty basis, of course.    [Sabov] In this connection, Mintimer Sharipovich, a question  about the opposition: Alas, it is reprints from its articles in  the Russian press that have so damaged Tatarstan's reputation in  public opinion. What today is the real weight of the  national-radical opposition in the republic, and will it in the  future be able to become a destabilizing factor in relations  between Tatarstan and Russia?    [Shaymiyev] We have more than one opposition. There are two:  the Tatar national-radicals, and, as they call themselves, the  "Russian Federalists." Both of them stand on extreme positions.  From the very beginning, the Federalists were up in arms against  our sovereignty: We do not need any kind of "Tatarstan state,"  and it is not necessary to renew the Federation. That is, in  fact, they are for a unitary Russia. The national-radicals are  at the other extreme: the complete independence of Tatarstan, no  kind of federation with Russia, Russia is simply "a neighboring  state." They met the fact of the signing of the treaty with  hostility: They declared a boycott of the elections, they began  to collect signatures for the recall of the president as a  "traitor of Tatarstan," etc. But here is what is indicative:  Today, at the expiration of three years of political  transformations in Tatarstan, there is less public support for  them than there was at the beginning! Their extremist slogans  lost their attraction. Pardon me if I refer to myself without  false modesty: On 13 March in the elections to the Federation  Council of Russia I received 204,000 more votes than I did three  years ago, when I was elected president of Tatarstan.    The centrist niche is occupied--it is occupied by the policy  of the president and other official organs of the republic. This  makes it that much more difficult for extremists from one or  another kray to position themselves. Shaymiyev or no Shaymiyev,  it is not a matter of personalities: Only a person with firm  centrist positions can be the president of Tatarstan.    [Sabov] By virtue of the multiethnic composition of the  population?    [Shaymiyev] Unquestionably. After all, our Tatar and Russian  population is practically half-and-half, and each third family  is mixed.    [Sabov] Nevertheless, the opposition is raising the question  of the establishment of a monoethnic Tatarstan?    [Shaymiyev] It used to. But it has already dropped this  slogan. Tatarstan's self-isolation, against the background of  difficulties, most of all in the economy, would add new  incredible difficulties for us. Why complicate people's life?  For the sake of someone's political ambitions? Permit me to  express in confidence: The example of the treaty that was  concluded by Tatarstan and Russia will also find an echo beyond  the borders of our Federation. You will recall that Gamsakhurdia  came to power after receiving almost 99 percent of the votes. It  seemed: How easy it is to resolve questions in a mononational  state! However, it is easy to get ill with nationalism, but it  is far more difficult to recover from it, as we see from the  example of Georgia and Moldova. To work in a multinational  environment is more difficult, but during the years of my  presidency I have understood that multinationalism is a great  blessing. And you begin to especially appreciate this blessing  in such difficult times as ours, when the very social  foundations are changing. It is not accidental that the concept  of the "people of Tatarstan" is present in our constitution, and  not the "nation of Tatarstan." And two state languages. After  all, why did such discord occur in Moldova? Because of the  temptation to impose one state language on a multinational  population.    [Sabov] Is the Russian-speaking population of Tatarstan  excepted from the difficulties it is experiencing in the former  republics of Central Asia, the Caucasus, and the aforementioned  Moldova?    [Shaymiyev] A question for your question: Have you seen  refugees from Tatarstan anywhere in Russia or in the CIS  countries? On the other hand, more and more are coming to us. Of  course, 75 percent of them are Tatars who have left their place  of residence, but the rest are basically Russian. Nevertheless,  even here a certain tension has been felt in the relations of  the two communities. This came both from the intrigues of  radicals and from the continuous displays on television of the  hot spots in the CIS... Therefore, even on the purely human  plane, the fact of the signing of the treaty with Russia is very  important: It finally dispelled the anxiety of Russians over  their position in Tatarstan.    [Sabov] My fellow-traveler on a train, a young doctor, a  Tatar, admitted: "The establishment of the Tatar language as the  only official language would be a tragedy for me." Here is an  absolutely unexpected aspect of the problem: Tatar youth and a  Tatar intelligentsia who are not fluent in their own language!    [Shaymiyev] Yes, two languages are recognized here as  official, but the Tatar language now needs help. After all,  office work and training are conducted in Russian, not to  mention the fact that everyone speaks Russian. It was a pleasant  surprise for me to learn that many Russian families sent their  children to groups we opened up for the study of the Tatar  language.    [Sabov] Is it true, as was written by Russian newspapers,  that demands were heard at the World Congress of Tatars for the  creation of a national parliament (a little majlis) as a kind of  parallel government of a "Great Tatarstan?"    [Shaymiyev] This did not happen! We viewed the World  Congress  of Tatars from the very beginning as a measure that was not  political but strictly cultural. There are about 7 million  Tatars in the CIS countries, and less than 2 million in  Tatarstan. There are large Tatar communities in the United  States, Australia, Finland... Like every dispersed people, we  are also endeavoring to "find" each other, so that we may  preserve our culture, language, and ethnos together. Even the  opposition in the course of this congress did not dare to put  forth the idea of a "World Government of Tatars." I especially  thanked the Russian population, the Russian part of our people,  for the fact that I did not see even a shadow of dissatisfaction  on their faces when we conducted this congress here in  Tatarstan. After all, there could have been a different  reaction: They assembled Tatars, it is said, from the whole  world, expect oppression... But when the authorities do not play  to the gallery and do not tell lies, then the people understand  everything. Of course, here in Kazan the opposition created its  own little majlis. But this is an illegitimate organ, not  elected by anyone, and according to its own official  registration it is an ordinary public organization. Moreover,  believe me, with insignificant influence.    [Sabov] But what as a result does the treaty promise in  Tatarstan's economic plan which, incidentally, is constantly  called a debtor of the central budget? Have you rejected your  tax obligations to the Federation?    [Shaymiyev] Well, no, everything is being done in a  different  way. Henceforth, we will collect republic taxes ourselves, and  we will submit that share to the federal budget that is  necessary for the implementation of powers transferred there. Or  for the conduct of joint federal programs; for example, the  building of a bridge across the Kama. After all, the  transportation of all Russia will move across this bridge, not  only ours.    You asked about our new economic advantages. Here is an  example. Russia is now tormented with nonpayments. Everyone  says: It is necessary to establish a system of bill of exchange  settlements immediately. They say this, but do not do it! As a  result, thousands of enterprises in Russia have stopped work. Of  course, nonpayments are hitting the economy of Tatarstan hard  also, when it is a matter of foreign accounts. But we have  resolved this problem inside the republic: We have a bill of  exchange in circulation whose guarantor is the government. Here  is a specific advantage of the economic independence of the  republic.    Another example: specifically directed social protection of  the poor. A summary is laid on my desk every day on the  correlation of minimum expenditures and incomes of the  population. For example, according to the status on 1 February,  the subsistence minimum in Tatarstan was 29,000 rubles [R]. But  the minimum level of wages for Russia was R14,700. As a result,  almost a third of the population of the country ended up below  the poverty line. But is this really fair--to pay people half of  the subsistence minimum? The Supreme Soviet of Tatarstan  increased the minimum income per person to R30,000, which is the  law for our commodity producers. As a result, I make so bold as  to hope that not one person in Tatarstan is living below the  poverty line.    Go into a store: Products are cheaper here than in Russia.  We  have not dissolved our kolkhozes, as an edict of the Russian  president at one time demanded of us. We did not cut the number  of cattle. For the second year we have an increase in the  production of agricultural products. We stopped, as before,  saluting the federal authorities. We resolve questions that,  according to the treaty, remained in our jurisdiction in a way  that we find reasonable under our conditions. This does not  mean, for example, that we are for the perpetuation of  kolkhozes. We prefer another policy: That is, kolkhozes should  help put farmers on their feet.    Or the question of the fight against crime. It has taken on  such scope everywhere that it is no longer possible to fight it  without emergency measures. And we have undertaken such  measures. We passed a resolution to detain suspects not for  three days, as is allowed by federal legislation, but for 30  days. The solving of crimes has increased sharply. I can tell  you that they are now coming here from Moscow "to study the  experiment" in keeping crime in check...[end Shaymiyev]    While bidding farewell, M.Sh, Shaymiyev said:    "But you know, I have a guest tomorrow: President of Crimea  Yuriy Meshkov is flying in."    The purpose of the visit, it seems, is clear. Is there not a  need there also, in Ukraine, for a breach in the wall that  divides the "center" and the "outlying districts?"</p>

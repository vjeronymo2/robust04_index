			<p>BFN     [Text] Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Hasan Hasanov has  described Azerbaijan's recent entry into NATO's Partnership for  Peace scheme as "extremely important."    In an interview with INTERFAX, he said the scheme, as well  as  the fundamental documents of the North Atlantic alliance,  stressed the need to maintain the territorial integrity and  security of its member states.    A senior source in the Azerbaijani president's staff told  INTERFAX the country's participation in the Partnership for  Peace does not mean that the Commonwealth of Independent States  (CIS) has exhausted its potential for resolving the  Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict. He said Azerbaijan's commitments  under the NATO scheme do not contradict its commitments under  the CIS Collective Security Treaty.    The source said Azerbaijan is ready to take part in  international collective security systems that can preserve its  territorial integrity and independence and ensure its security.  Another top member of the presidential staff, Eldar Namazov,  said Azerbaijan's membership in the Partnership for Peace would  get NATO involved in efforts to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh  conflict.    "In effect this means more opportunities for a political  settlement of the conflict," he said.</p>

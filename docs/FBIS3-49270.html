			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Andrzej Jagodzinski and Edward Krzemien: </F> "Visegrad in Vain?"]    [Text] It is already known that President Bill Clinton's  Prague meeting with the heads of state of Poland, Hungary, the  Czech Republic, and Slovakia is not going to be a Visegrad  summit. It is mainly the Czechs who did not want the meeting to  be granted such a status. The Poles and Hungarians are losing  hope.    President Clinton will arrive for the Prague meeting  straight  from the NATO summit in Brussels. The only event to underline  the regional nature of this meeting will be a two-hour working  lunch on 12 January, attended by the five presidents.    "It was clear form the very outset that there would be four  meetings with the U.S. President, independent of each other,"  said Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, who announced that the  Czechs are accepting the U.S. "Partnership for Peace" proposal.  He expressed surprise about speculation that the Czech Republic  was opposing joint talks by the Visegrad heads of state with  Clinton.    A high-ranking Foreign Ministry official even told me that  the era of joint Visegrad action was over. The "Partnership for  Peace" proposal calls for independent action, and that is why  Prague finds it attractive.    Yesterday, Vaclav Klaus said that during Clinton's visit  there would be bilateral talks by the Visegrad prime ministers,  and after the U.S. guest's departure each of the three hosts  would treat his opposite numbers to supper. The presidents will  eat at the Hradschin, the prime ministers at the Liechtenstein  Palace (seat of the government), and the foreign ministers at  the Czernin Palace (seat of the Foreign Ministry). Care has been  taken to exclude the risk of any joint stance being formulated.    The reaction from Warsaw has been unexpectedly calm. "We  will not force our will on the rest," a senior Polish official  told me. "Perhaps the Visegrad Group is not in Poland's  interests." Only President Walesa's spokesman, Andrzej  Drzycimski, has made any attempt to assuage anxieties, saying  that consultations were being held both with the United States  and the Czech Republic. In his opinion, the Belvedere is still  doing all it can to prevent more than one speech on behalf of  the Visegrad Group at the joint Prague lunch, instead of four  separate speeches. Slovak President Michal Kovac said yesterday  that on Tuesday, President Walesa had suggested to him and the  other Visegrad presidents the submission to President Clinton of  a joint proposal for Visegrad integration with NATO. Kovac  agreed. The Hungarians as well. But the Czechs did not.    Yesterday, Vice Foreign Minister Andrzej Ananicz created the  impression that he had no faith in a Visegrad-Clinton meeting.  "One cannot imagine what a joint talk between five presidents  would look like. As it is, each of them will have one hour in  which to talk to the Americans," he said.    One of our interlocutors, talking about the three lunches to  be held following Clinton's departure, said: "These might be  the farewell lunches of Visegrad."</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: Anheuser-Busch climbs as sales break record ANHEUSER-Busch, the largest brewer in the US, yesterday unveiled an increase in third-quarter profits, while sales to the wholesalers for the period rose to a record 23.23m barrels from 23.12m barrels sold during the same year-ago period, Reuter reports from St Louis. The group reported third-quarter earnings of Dollars 318.0m, or Dollars 1.12 a share, up from Dollars 293m, or Dollars 1.01 a share, in 1991. Gross sales rose to Dollars 3.54bn from Dollars 3.39bn. The company attributed the improved results primarily to the higher profitability of its beer, beer-related and entertainment segments and to lower financing costs. Anheuser-Busch said its volume gain of 1.3 per cent for the first nine months favourably contrasted with a three-tenths of 1 per cent gain for the brewing industry.</p>

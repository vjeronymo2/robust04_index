			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Letter: In praise of the 'New Look Employment' scheme Sir, I refer to your article 'Flexibility is all in a Year's Work: A look at one company's experience of introducing an annualised hours system' by Catherine Milton (September 7). The article, I felt, did less than justice to the 'New Look Employment' scheme operated at the Van den Berghs factory in Purfleet, Essex. British industry has been plagued for years with the uncompetitive practices of low productivity, high overtime and trade demarcations. The annual hours 'New Look Employment' contract that was introduced ln January 1990, with a majority Yes vote from the membership of each of the unions concerned, has proved to be a very successful means of wiping away, at a stroke, these costly industrial practices. In recognition of this, our employees now enjoy a guaranteed annual salary, work substantially fewer hours than previously, and are much more involved in the day-to-day problem solving in their work areas. Productivity increased significantly and the foundation was laid for a better working climate for everyone ln the factory. We are very proud of the factory, our achievements and also of the annual hours agreement. From being one of the most expensive Unilever margarine factories in Europe in the 1980s, we are now the cheapest. That turnround has been achieved with the excellent co-operation of our employees, and was considerably helped by the benefits we have all obtained from the 'New Look Employment' package.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by I. Davydov: "Situation is Complex But Under </F> Control: From A Ministry of Railways Selector Conference"]    [Text] In opening yesterday's selector conference, Minister  of Railways G.M. Fadeyev noted that, notwithstanding the  increase in economic difficulties, the railroad workers of  Russia are steadfastly carrying out the transporting of freight  and passengers. This has been promoted to a large extent by the  decisions adopted during the December and March expanded boards,  the meeting of railroad chiefs with V.S. Chernomyrdin and also  by the results of the regular assembly of railroad chiefs in  Yekaterinburg, where basically new approaches were developed for  solving a number of questions.    Certainly, the continuing decline in shipments and the  inoperative payment mechanism are aggravating the status of the  railroad workers. The minister stated that the situation is  complicated and not under control and he appealed to all worker  collectives to calmly and confidently implement the program as  developed. The reference point is the same for everyone -- a  wage agreement which must serve as a guide. In accordance with  this agreement, the average branch wage in March will amount to  approximately 291,000 rubles, that is, indexed by a factor of  1.43 (according to the wage agreement -- 1.40).    Today's most urgent task -- to reduce expenses and increase  income. The decisions handed down by the March board and the  conclusions drawn by the assembly of railroad chiefs furnish  specific recommendations in this regard. However, not all of the  transport subunit commanders are coordinating their actions with  these recommendations. It is sufficient to state that nine  billion more rubles were paid out during the first quarter owing  to the fact that some railroads had indexed their wages higher  than the wage agreement. This applies first of all to the Far  Eastern, West-Siberian, Kemerovo, Kuybyshev and Southeastern  main lines.    Nor is full responsibility being displayed in all areas with  regard to the implementation of another strategically important  decision -- ensuring that the contingent of service personnel is  in conformity with the true work volume. Compared to March of  last year, the volume of shipments declined by 30 percent, while  the work force increased by 16,000 individuals. This factor  alone caused a loss of 22 billion rubles. In order to correct  the situation, the number of people engaged in carrying out  shipments must be increased by 14,000 by the end of the first  quarter and by 45,000 before the end of the year.    The minister suggested that this could be achieved by  utilizing the experience of the Moscow Railroad, where skilful  use was made of the mechanism of a natural run-off of people.    The situation with regard to the payment of wages on the  Trans-Baykal and BAM [Baykal-Amur Main Line] railroads, where  they are only beginning to cope with the indebtedness for  February, has been evaluated as completely intolerable. Blame  has been directed at the Sverdlovsk, Kemerovo and other freight  railroads, which are handling their accounts with transit main  lines in a very poor manner. The railroads owe approximately 16  billion rubles to the collectives of our plants, as a result of  which wages have not yet been issued even for December!    The first ruble earned must be used for wages, emphasized  the  minister and only later -- for remaining payments.  Unfortunately, however, only 600 billion rubles of the 1.2  trillion rubles' worth of March earnings were credited to income  accounts. The remainder -- mutual credits and the output of  enterprises.    In touching upon wage policy, the minister once again noted  that the railroad workers are being forced to index wages, since  the prices for the material resources, fuel and electric power  being consumed by transport are increasing at excessive rates.  The last indexing of passenger rates and the impending freight  rates will in all probability make it possible to compensate for  the first quarter losses, which reached 200 billion rubles. But  the minister appealed for greater flexibility in this matter in  the various areas.    It bears mentioning that the attraction of freight has been  and remains the chief task confronting the railroad and branch  leaders. In March, 14,000 more tonnes were loaded on the whole  throughout the network than during February. But this, it goes  without saying, was of little consolation. Approximately five  million tonnes were declined and this was equivalent to a loss  of 80 billion rubles!    During the selector conference, serious claims were  addressed  against the head of the Far Eastern Railroad for arbitrariness  displayed in the handling of export freight. Because of him,  high quality coal that had been paid for with currency, was  burned in the boiler rooms of Valdivostock and Khabarovsk.    The losses caused by unprotected shipments continue to  remain  quite high and just as in the past the fines for delays in  freight deliveries are considerable.    In summing up the discussion, the minister appealed to the  railroad leaders to display greater initiative and to propose  and adopt unique solutions that will have a positive effect upon  the final result. The chief concern is the need for greater  attention and specific work in the labor collectives. Without  this there will be no improvement in the situation.</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / People (Names in the News): Caio says hello at Omnitel Francesco Caio, a 36-year-old former McKinsey consultant who has an MBA from Insead, has become the first chief executive of Omnitel Pronto Italia, which won the licence to become Italy's second cellular telephone operator in March, writes Andrew Hill. Caio, a computer science graduate from the Politecnico di Milano, was head of the telecom and multimedia division of Olivetti, the Italian computer group which is the lead member of the Omnitel Pronto consortium. Other members include Bell Atlantic and Pactel of the US, and Mannesmann of Germany. Omnitel Pronto Italia has pledged to invest up to Dollars 1bn in developing its network in the first two years, and expects to launch its service in the final quarter of 1995. The Omnitel Pronto Italia group learned that it had won the licence just before the polls closed in the Italian general election. Berlusconi's Fininvest was part of the losing Unitel consortium, headed by the Fiat industrial group.</p>

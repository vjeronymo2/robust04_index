			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Briefcase, Q &amp; A: Double protection FROM TIME to time, Financial Times articles refer to the scheme that guarantees 90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000 invested in a building society. Does this mean that a married couple are protected if they have Pounds 40,000 in a joint account, or do they need to have separate accounts each of Pounds 20,000? The protection to which you refer derives from section 27 of the Building Societies Act 1986. The protection for 90 per cent of (currently) Pounds 20,000 is applied to joint accounts in the manner provided in the sixth schedule to the 1986 act. Where the joint account is held for two or more beneficiaries who are not in partnership, they are treated as if each held a separate account, so that the protection for two such joint depositors would be up to 90 per cent of Pounds 40,000. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: "The Two </F> Great Challenges"]    [Text] The fact that the U.S. Department of Commerce has  included Brazil and Argentina among the 10 "large emerging  markets" is an indication of the importance the Bill Clinton  administration gives South America. This selection is due, to a  good extent, to the potentials of the internal markets of  countries participating in free trade areas, such as Brazil and  Argentina. It is also due to the fact that these countries have  a sufficiently developed infrastructure to permit the existence  of powerful economies, but are not developed enough to take full  advantage of all their market potential, that is, the potential  of their population and territory. The recognition of Brazil's  potential derives also, as was recognized by Commerce Secretary  Ronald Brown during a recent interview (he visited Rio de  Janeiro and Sao Paulo, and is today in Brasilia), from the fact  that South America is in condition to become, within a short  time, a more attractive market for the United States than  Europe, particularly as it is open in terms of competition.    The U.S. Government's selection of Brazil and Argentina is  not the kind of decision that is written on a piece of paper and  delivered to whomever might be interested. If there had been a  time for that kind of U.S. Latin American policy, it has now  become obsolete. U.S. internal problems, particularly the  creation of jobs -- as was stressed by Brown during his  interview in Rio de Janeiro yesterday -- have become part of the  U.S. foreign policy agenda (no matter how commercial they may  be). In order to solve this problem, the Clinton administration  has not hesitated to play all the trumps at hand, even at the  risk of implementing an overly aggressive foreign policy. The  Brown mission, carrying both private and public interests in the  same bag, is visiting a country that has so far been  characterized by the strong predominance of the public sector's  bureaucratic mentality over business interests. For this  reason, he risks getting involved in a conversation between deaf  people, or of being coldly received, despite the zeal with which  he champions his viewpoints. We should not forget, however,  that these viewpoints are those of a great power.    The U.S. secretary of commerce is pursuing two important  objectives in Brazil and Argentina. One objective is commercial  and the other is political. The latter contains a great  challenge for Brazilian authorities, both for the members of  this administration, witnessing a sad end, and for those who  will become the Brazilian authorities in the upcoming  administration. The challenge implies an acceptance of the  classification of "large emerging market," and acting in accord  with the norms the United States want to apply to countries with  less power than itself. It will mean sealing an economic  alliance with deep internal social and economic consequences and  speeding up the great transformation of our industries and  services, a process that has been going on since our foreign  trade began opening up. It also means agreeing on the need for  deep constitutional reform, including not only the possibility  of privatizing the communications and energy systems, but also  withdrawing the privileges granted to Brazilian companies formed  with national capital (an extended definition to cover all state  companies) in contracts involving the public administration.  But that is not all. It also means giving foreign companies  without subsidiaries in Brazil the possibility of participating  in public biddings and competing with Brazilian public  companies.    The first objective, the commercial objective, also has  political aspects. One example is the U.S. effort to win the  bidding for the Sivan [Amazon Region Surveillance System] system  to monitor the Amazon region, with advanced technology and  possibly not using exclusively national software.    The previous positions taken by Brown, in defending the  participation by foreign companies without branches in Brazil in  the biddings involving Telebras [Brazilian Telecommunications,  Inc.], give us a pale indication of the emphasis of his mission,  which concludes today after official meetings in Brasilia.    In the Federal District, Brown will without a doubt discuss  the most delicate issue affecting Brazilian and U.S. diplomatic  relations: the patents law, the terms of which do not satisfy  the U.S. Government. It cannot be established with certainty  when the Senate will finish analyzing the bill, which will have  to return to the Chamber of Deputies for further examination  after the Senate votes on it. This slow pace, which is,  nevertheless, a procedure established in the Constitution, will  be slowed down even more by the deadline (which will undoubtedly  be delayed as well) for ratification of the GATT agreement,  which in some aspects conditions parts of the patents law. The  delay in the Brazilian Congress is sometimes annoying, but it is  a routine the that U.S. Government must understand, even with  Super 301 in hand to punish what it calls unfair trade  practices. In the end, the resistance the Clinton administration  is beginning to find in ratifying the GATT agreement show that  legislative powers still have weight in democratic regimes.</p>

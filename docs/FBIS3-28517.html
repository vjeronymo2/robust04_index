			<p>Language: <F P=105> Malay </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Labuan, 20 January -- Sabah Foundation Director  Datuk Dr. Jeffrey Kitingan, just released from house arrest,  said last night that relations between Kuala Lumpur and Sabah  would improve.    Speaking to reporters during a stopover here on his way to  Kota Kinabalu, he said: "We managed to get the message across,  and the leaders in Kuala Lumpur now understand our problems.  These problems have plagued the state over the past few years.  I believe everyone knows that the best way to solve them is  through cooperation." He said there are several leaders in  Sabah and Kuala Lumpur who want to restore relations and work  together again. "We all accept Vision 2020 [national  development plan]; we must set aside our political differences  and work together," he said.    Jeffrey Kitingan, the younger brother of Sabah Chief  Minister  Pairin Kitingan, declined to elaborate further on the matter,  noting that he was returning to Sabah to assist the PBS [Sabah  United Party] in the upcoming state elections on 18-19 February.  The latest reports say that Jeffrey will run in the Bingkor  constituency. He is also expected to strengthen Pairin's  leadership and solve the PBS's internal problems. [passage  omitted]</p>

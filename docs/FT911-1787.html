			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Sharing power in a bid to save electricity - Northern Ireland AN ALLIANCE of Unionists and nationalists opposing the sale of Northern Ireland's electricity industry yesterday left the government rebuffing exactly the kind of co-operation it seeks in historic talks on the province's future. As Unionists prepared to join today the process of round-table talks taking place in Belfast, Mr Richard Needham, the province's economy minister, stuck by the Northern Ireland's Office plans to split the electricity utility in preparation for privatisation. His intransigence came despite pleas for a re-think in order to foster the co-operation ministers hope will see a new devolved government in the province and a replacement Anglo-Irish agreement. As if to tempt participants in the round-table talks, Mr Needham said that, if a new administration for the province was set up this summer, locally elected politicians would be able to reverse his decision. Mr Kevin McNamara, Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, last night called for privatisation plans to be shelved while round-table talks continued. Before 'direct rule' in 1972, energy policy had been in the control of the Northern Ireland administration, he said. Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, today meets Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, leaders of the main Unionist parties, for what could be the last of his bilateral meetings before full round-table discussions start - probably next Tuesday. Mr Molyneaux and Mr Paisley have joined forces with Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, to ask for a meeting with Mr John Major to discuss Northern Ireland electricity. At question time yesterday, Mr Hume drew parallels between the co-operation over the electricity industry and hopes for political progress. He urged Mr Needham to 'reconsider your position'.</p>

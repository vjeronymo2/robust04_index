			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S. AFRICA TO PERMIT MIXED NEIGHBORHOODS;  </P> <P> FIRST SUCH INTEGRATION IN NEARLY 40 YEARS; LIMITED IMPACT SEEN  </P> <P> A new law that will permit integrated neighborhoods in South Africa for the  first time in nearly 40 years went into force Wednesday, but it is expected to  affect only new townships and the few areas where blacks already live illegally  in large numbers.  </P> <P> The government, hoping the measure will ease international criticism of  apartheid, its system of racial separation, hailed the Free Settlement Areas  Act as a significant milestone on the road to apartheid reform.  </P> <P> "It's a very important development," Information Minister Stoffel van der Merwe  said. "Now the whole principle of mixed residential areas has been introduced  and we're dealing with a much more fluid, much more dynamic situation."  </P> <P> But the government, in an effort to mollify its far-right opponents among the  4.5 million whites, has said it remains committed to segregated neighborhoods  for those who want them.  </P> <P> Frederik W. de Klerk, leader of the ruling National Party and heir-apparent to  ailing President Pieter W. Botha, vowed in a major policy speech last month  that the government will continue to protect "group rights," the South African  term for racially separate housing, schools and hospitals.  </P> <P> But De Klerk said the new legislation will begin to allow some people to form  their own "groups" voluntarily, without regard to race.  </P> <P> The new law establishes a Free Settlement Board to hear applications from areas  that wish to declare themselves open. The board then makes recommendations to  the president, who can declare the areas open. No final decisions are expected  this year.  </P> <P> Schools and hospitals will remain segregated, at least at first, and the  government says it has not decided how to deal with the new non-racial groups  on the voters' rolls. Elections in South Africa are racially segregated;  blacks, who account for three-fourths of the population, have no vote in  national affairs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dozen Neighborhoods  </P> <P> The government has said that a dozen neighborhoods have expressed interest in  becoming open. Officials say the most likely candidates are new townships and  several inner-city white districts -- Hillbrow in Johannesburg and Woodstock in  Cape Town, for example -- where more than 50,000 blacks already live in  defiance of the law.  </P> <P> The white Conservative Party has demanded that the government enforce  residential segregation more strictly, and some far-right whites have recently  picketed and vandalized the houses of Indian families living in whites-only  areas. Some of those Indian families have received death threats.  </P> <P> The government tried last year to tighten up enforcement of the 1950 Group  Areas Act, the apartheid cornerstone that divides South Africa into separate  neighborhoods for whites, blacks, mixed-race Coloreds and Indians.  </P> <P> But that move stalled because of a severe housing shortage in black areas and a  judge's ruling that blacks could not be evicted from a whites-only area unless  alternative accommodation can be found.  </P> <P> Anti-apartheid activists, who want the Group Areas Act scrapped, complain that  a law allowing some open areas will have little effect on the overall level of  integration in South Africa.  </P> <P> Most whites in the country live in comfortable suburbs, with neighborhood  schools that have empty classrooms and hospitals with empty beds. Most blacks  live in high-density townships with overcrowded schools and hospitals and long  commutes to work.  </P> <P> Critics also contend that high demand for housing among blacks will create a  run on the few open areas and that this will quickly turn them into overcrowded  slums.  </P> <P> "You will have second-class areas, ultimately, receiving third-class services,"  Tony Leon, leader of the white liberal Progressive Federal Party on the  Johannesburg City Council, said in an interview.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said Wednesday that he has  released 230 of the estimated 1,000 political activists held without charge in  South Africa. He promised to release an additional 50 by Friday. The black  detainees, some held for as long as 32 months, agreed last month to suspend a  mass hunger strike after Vlok promised at a meeting with Anglican Archbishop  Desmond M. Tutu to free "substantial numbers" of them.  </P> <P> Also on Wednesday, the Justice Ministry announced that President Botha had  commuted the death sentences of 16 prisoners -- a move that human rights groups  said may indicate a softening of the government's attitude toward capital  punishment.  </P> <P> South Africa, with 164 hangings in 1987 and 117 last year, has one of the  highest per-capita execution rates of any country in the world. Among those  reprieved Wednesday was Paul Setlaba, on death row for a murder conviction  arising out of the 1985 black consumer boycott. The United Nations, among other  groups, had appealed for clemency for Setlaba.  </P></p>

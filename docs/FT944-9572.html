			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Sea Containers shows modest growth to Dollars 21.7m Sea Containers, the Bermuda-based leisure, ferry and container leasing group, reported pre-tax profits of Dollars 21.7m (Pounds 13.2m) for the third quarter, marginally up from Dollars 21m. The result brings the figure for the nine months to September 30 to Dollars 25.2m (Dollars 35.5m). The group, which owns the Orient Express and Hoverspeed, was adversely affected by the removal of a hovercraft from its cross-Channel route, in anticipation of the opening of the Channel tunnel last summer. Mr James Sherwood, president, admitted that 'in hindsight, this was a mistake'. The group has three groups of high yielding preference shares, and Mr Sherwood said Sea Containers was looking at asset disposals to fund a restructuring. Total revenue was Dollars 154m (Dollars 146m) in the quarter. Earnings per share for the quarter and nine months were Dollars 1.19 (Dollars 1.17) and Dollars 1.16 (Dollars 2.15).</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Clinton sees hope for Mideast peace: Rabin ready 'to take risks for peace' PRESIDENT Bill Clinton insisted yesterday there were 'a lot of reasons to be hopeful' about a resumed Middle Eastern peace process in Washington next month. He said that he had been assured by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, in the course of over three hours of talks in the White House that Israel 'was prepared to take risks for peace' and that the US role was designed 'to minimise these risks'. But neither leader was able to report a breakthrough over the fate of the 400 Palestinians deported from Israel, a stalemate which is still preventing Palestinian acquiescence to resumed negotiations. Mr Clinton said the US stood by the UN compromise arrang-ed last month by Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, providing for immediate return of 100 of the deportees and the rest by the year's end. He said he had not raised the question of further Israeli concessions on the issue with Mr Rabin. Mr Clinton conceded there were 'difficulties' in resuming the peace process. He hoped that recent violence, including the stabbing of an American immigrant to Israel, would not prove a serious obstacle. The prime minister spoke in generalised terms of Israel's willingness to compromise, including in territorial negotiations with Syria over the Golan Heights. But he added: 'We are determined to protect our security. We are willing to compromise but compromise cannot be one-sided.' Mr Rabin secured a public commitment from Mr Clinton that the US would not reduce the level of its military and economic assistance to Israel in spite of budgetary pressures. The two sides also committed themselves to an even more intense degree of strategic co-operation, including the creation of a joint science and technology commission.</p>

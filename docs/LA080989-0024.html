			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SIMI RESIDENTS' SEWER BILLS TO INCREASE 60%  </P> <P> Monthly sewer bills for Simi Valley residents will increase 60% starting next  month, city officials said.  </P> <P> Beginning in September, about 26,000 households will pay $9.56 per month for  sewer hookups, up from the present rate of $5.94. The monthly rate may increase  to about $12 by 1995, officials said.  </P> <P> Members of the Simi Valley City Council, who unanimously approved the increase  Monday, said they were forced to raise rates under the conditions of a  $7-million grant from the state and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  </P> <P> The grant, given to the Simi Valley County Sanitation District in 1977, was  used to expand the capacity of the city's waste treatment plant from 7.5  million gallons per day to its present daily level of 9.1 million gallons.  Construction was completed in 1984.  </P> <P> The terms of the grant were that the costs of operating the sanitation district  had to be passed on to customers, not paid for out of property tax revenues,  said Michael Kleinbrodt, deputy public works director. However, the sanitation  district has used property taxes for the past 10 years to help pay for the  district's operating costs because it mistakenly believed that changes in  federal laws were retroactive and applied to the 1977 grant, Kleinbrodt said.  </P> <P> A routine audit of the grant last year revealed the problem, and city officials  were told to either stop using property tax revenues or to repay the $7-million  grant. The district is not required to repay the property tax revenues it used  in past years, Kleinbrodt said.  </P></p>

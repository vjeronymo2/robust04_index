			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / GPA Group - The Refinancing: Banks count their debt exposure THE FRONTLINE casualties in GPA's fall from grace are its shareholders, whose shares have fallen to less than Dollars 1. Many investors have written off their entire holdingstake in the company. Their stakes will be heavily diluted by GE Capital's investment but the deal gives them hope of recouping some of their losses. The biggest current shareholder is Mitsubishi Trust and Banking, the Japanese bank which owns 12 per cent of the ordinary shares. Other big shareholders are Air Canada, with 10 per cent, and Mr Tony Ryan, GPA's founder, who owns 100 per cent of a special class of shares and 8 per cent of the ordinary shares. Some of these are pledged as collateral for a Dollars 35m (Pounds 22.7m) personal loan from Merrill Lynch International Bank, the European arm of the biggest US securities firm. The next most important shareholders are Irish Life and Aer Lingus, which have about 10 per cent between them. Citicorp, the biggest US bank, paid Dollars 78.8m at the peak share price of about Dollars 34 for its shareholding. Citicorp also has substantial debt exposure to GPA, although it recently said its loans to GPA are 'less than Dollars 250m'. Nomura International, GPA's global co-ordinator during its ill-fated attempt to raise equity via a public flotation, bought 1.36m shares at an average of Dollars 20 a share. But the loss to Nomura's reputation is arguably greater than the loss on its investment. The run-up to the flotation was a public relations disaster for GPA, and some of the group's executives blame the resulting fiasco of the aborted share sale on its advisers. GPA was also irritated that Nomura was only able to meet one of its three commitments made when it won its mandate in 1991 as the group's lead adviser. It provided liquidity for existing shareholders by buying 1m of their shares and later bought out shareholders who refused to agree to a lock-up before the flotation was due to go ahead. But it failed to raise Dollars 250m through a convertible redeemable preference share issue and did not underwrite any of the share issue. GPA believed Nomura had given it an undertaking to underwrite Dollars 500m, although this was disputed by Nomura. A total of 138 banks provided loans to GPA. Those with substantial exposure are Mitsubishi Trust and Banking, which said it had provided a credit line of Dollars 191m. Its Japanese rival, Sakura, provided credit estimated at more than Dollars 110m. Toronto Dominion Bank of Canada is also understood to have substan-tial exposure, as has Swiss Bank Cor-poration, with loans of more than Dollars 100m. UK banks with the biggest exposure are National Westminster, with about Dollars 70m, and Barclays, with less than Dollars 50m. In total, North American banks have provided more than a third of GPA's bank debt, the contribution of European banks is about 30 per cent and slightly less has been provided by the Japanese. GPA estimates its total indebtedness at some Dollars 5.5bn, consisting of Dollars 3.5bn in bank debt and Dollars 2bn in bonds and other forms of publicly traded debt. This will likely still need to be restructured under the GE plan. However, according to one lender, 20 per cent of bank debt is off balance sheet. So banks' total exposure to GPA is more than Dollars 4bn. Assessing the likely losses on this is difficult. Almost all of this debt is fully secured on GPA's fleet of more than 300 aircraft. About 90 per cent of this fleet consists of stage three or modern aircraft, whose value has held up relatively well during the recession in the aircraft industry. The weighted average age of the group's fleet is 3.8 years. Mr Jack Hersch, director of research at MJ Whitman, an investment firm specialising in trading bank debt, estimates that bank loans to GPA are worth 66 cents for every dollar lent. That would imply losses for banks of substantially more then Dollars 1bn. Some banks say, however, the losses should be less. On the other hand, the bonds have recently been trading at between 15 and 20 per cent of their face value. The GE deal will lessen these losses. For aircraft manufacturers the picture will also improve if the GE financing can be completed. GPA had placed orders with them to purchase Dollars 11.9bn of aircraft before the end of 2000 and had options covering the purchase of a further Dollars 9.1bn of aircraft.</p>

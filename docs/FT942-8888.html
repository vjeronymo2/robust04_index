			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Robust sales help lift pre-tax profit at Astra Strong volume growth helped Astra, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, lift first-quarter pre-tax profits by 15 per cent to SKr2bn (Dollars 260m), maintaining its momentum as one of the world's fastest-growing drugs groups. The result was struck on a 28 per cent increase in sales, to SKr6.4bn, with the group's two main drugs - Losec and Pulmicort - performing strongly. Operating earnings were 52 per cent higher at SKr2.05bn. Astra noted that, adjusted for currency factors, sales grew by 24 per cent, a bigger rise in volumes than last year and much better than the market average. However, it said the pace of sales growth had weakened because currency movements were not as beneficial as last year's. It said the same factor would slow the pace of sales and earnings growth over the full year, although both are expected to continue to develop favourably. Last year, group pre-tax profit amounted to SKr7.8bn. Losec, the anti-peptic ulcer agent and one of the world's top-selling drugs, saw sales expand by 49 per cent to SKr2.24bn in the first quarter. Including sales through licensees, sales grew 50 per cent to SKr3.95bn. Sales of Pulmicort, an anti-asthma agent, were 32 per cent higher at SKr850m. Plendil, an anti-hypertensive agent, increased sales by 41 per cent to SKr273m. Astra was particularly encouraged by its performance in Germany, its largest market, where sales rose 32 per cent in local currency terms, compared with estimated market growth of 7 per cent. The performance was driven by improved sales of Losec, even though a German health regulator has been looking into possible side-effects of the drug. Astra noted the German market was 'now recovering from the effects of political intervention in early 1993'. Sales in the UK, the group's second-largest market, climbed 53 per cent. Astra said its pre-tax performance was held back by an (unrealised) drop in the value of its bond portfolio - blamed on increased interest rates at the end of the quarter - and exchange losses. These resulted in net financial expenses of SKr52m, compared with income of SKr344m in the same 1993 period. Analysts are looking for full-year profits of between SKr9.5bn and SKr10bn.</p>

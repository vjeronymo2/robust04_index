			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NIXON ON U.S. CHINA POLICY  </P> <P> Thanks for your in-depth coverage on China (June 25). The case of a  gerontocracy turned "gerontocrazy" reminds me of the ancient Roman Senate,  so-called for being made of "senes" or senescent members. A graphic Latin  saying characterizes that citadel of power for all ages and cultures:  "Senatores, boni viri; senatus, mala bestia" (The senators, decent guys; the  senate, a wild beast.)  </P> <P> MARY C.

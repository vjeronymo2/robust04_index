			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Rely on the Hong Kong Residents To Realize a </F> Stable Transition"]    [Text] Lu Ping, in his capacity of vice chairman and  secretary general of the Preliminary Work Committee [PWC], will  come to Hong Kong to attend meetings of the political and  economic ad hoc groups of the PWC and to solicit the Hong Kong  people's opinions on affairs related to the late transitional  period. During his stay here, Lu Ping will also meet with Hong  Kong deputies to the people's congress, members of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] committee,  representatives of grass-roots masses, and public figures from  all walks of life.    Since Chris Patten has upset the process of convergence with  the Basic Law and is unilaterally enforcing his constitutional  reform program, China now harbors no illusions about him. The  Chinese side is instead working in a down-to-earth manner to  achieve a stable transition and is widely soliciting opinions  among the Hong Kong people. A stable transition would be  impossible in the late transitional period without Hong Kong  people's participation, their ideas and wisdom, and their joint  efforts as the masters of the city. Only by closely relying on  the Hong Kong people, listening to their appeals, and getting  familiar with the actual operation of this city, will the  Chinese side be able to formulate a complete transition program  which conforms with the Basic Law and suits both the historical  conditions and present reality of Hong Kong. Although Lu Ping's  stay in Hong Kong would only be a very short one, it is believed  that he will try his best to meet as many Hong Kong people as  possible and to listen to as many valuable views as possible  from the Hong Kong people.    As for Chris Patten's expressed hope for a meeting with Lu  Ping, because Lu's schedule will be tight this time, it is  believed that this can be postponed to a later, more appropriate  time.    China is relying on the Hong Kong people as the force  supporting the resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over  Hong Kong and safeguarding the territory's prosperity and  stability. No matter how Chris Patten is trying to undermine  convergence in the constitutional system by playing the  "international card" and attempting to drain Hong Kong of its  economic resources, China has the confidence in and the ability  to ensure a stable transition and the implementation of the  principle of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong, as long as  it can enlist the Hong Kong people's support. Therefore, it is  essential for the Chinese side to keep informed of local  circumstances and public opinion in Hong Kong.    Chris Patten said he would roll out the red carpet for Lu  Ping and that he is willing to meet with Lu Ping. This is  nothing but another "political show" of a perfidious politician.  Chris Patten does not have the slightest sincerity about  keeping his promise. He ignored the agreements reached between  China and Britain; when China and Britain were about to conclude  a first-stage agreement on the constitutional matter, he  insistently "derailed" the process; and he has time and again  breached faith, undermined cooperation, and spoiled the  atmosphere for meeting. Even if Lu Ping were to meet with him  for one or two hours during his stay here, what would be the use?    Will Chris Patten assist China in ensuring a stable  transition? No, he will not. Not long ago, the PWC expressed  the hope of hearing the Hong Kong civil servants' opinions on a  stable transition, and it was Chris Patten who deprived the  civil servants of the opportunity to voice their opinions before  the PWC. If we want to ensure the stable transfer of civil  servants, then it is essential for us to hear their opinions.  Chris Patten has not only tried to bar civil servants from  voicing their opinions, but has also belittled the status of the  PWC in every aspect through his henchmen mouthpieces. Now that  Lu Ping, in the capacity of vice chairman and secretary general  of the PWC, is coming to Hong Kong to solicit opinions, is Chris  Patten going to change his attitude? If he does not change his  attitude, then what is the use of a meeting? Let us take the  implementation of the memorandum of understanding on the new  airport project as an example. Up to now the issue has remained  unsolved simply because Chris Patten has deliberately breached  the commitment of not leaving a financial burden for the special  administrative region [SAR] government and not letting the total  amount of debt exceed 5 billion Hong Kong dollars. Furthermore,  he has been trying to have his project approved on a piecemeal  basis. As long as he does not change his stand, the obstacle to  cooperation on the airport project issue will still be there.  Negotiations between the two sides will produce a positive  outcome only if he changes his stand. In citing the memorandum  of understanding, this perfidious politician would only expose  his hypocrisy and remind people of who has actually violated the  agreement. There are many channels for consultation between the  Chinese and British sides, including the joint liaison group,  the expert groups, and contacts between the political adviser to  the Hong Kong Government and the External Affairs Department of  the XINHUA News Agency Hong Kong branch. Chris Patten quite  simply is not using these channels of communication and instead  is insisting on holding talks with Lu Ping, despite the latter's  tight schedule in Hong Kong. This clearly implies that he is  "playing a trick."    In order to alleviate the pressure that he is facing in  political circles at home, Chris Patten purposely granted an  interview to the GUARDIAN in late April. He misinterpreted  facts in an attempt to cheat the British electorate and mislead  the public, saying that the Chinese side "has relaxed its  stance" and some recent moves by the Chinese side have proven  the correctness of his prediction.    To prove his talent for telling lies, he is now brazenly  putting on a show and insisting on meeting with his counterpart.  If his little trick had worked, of course he would loudly boast  that his confrontation of the Chinese side has done no harm to  Sino-British relations, and that China is dancing according to  his "lead." If his trick were to fail, he would say that he  does not mind losing face.    This is a common trick frequently played by charlatans. To  deal with this kind of brazen ploy, the Chinese side of course  needs to be somewhat serious. You want a meeting, well, there  will be plenty of opportunities in the days to come. But, first  of all, for your part, you must create a good atmosphere for a  meeting, simply making empty talk through "megaphone diplomacy"  does not work. As far as economic affairs and the people's  livelihood are concerned, China will certainly take the Hong  Kong people's interests into account. Evidence of this is the  recent agreement on increasing land leases to keep down property  prices. The consultations were conducted through the land  committee, which is a good example of cooperation. Chris Patten,  as the chief executive officer, should do a solid job and take  measures to keep property prices down after land leases are  increased. This is his duty. If he takes no action but is busy  at home making visits with the aim of keeping abreast with the  latest political developments in Britain and paving the way for  his return to Westminster, then he will convince no one, even if  he repeats ten thousand times his claim that he is working "for  the Hong Kong people's interests." By asking to "discuss the  property price issue with the Chinese side," the man seems to  imply that the Chinese side must share the blame if the British  side cannot solve the problem. Is this not too cunning a ploy?</p>

These frequency ranges may also be used to provide service to persons in general aviation or other aircraft. Ground stations transmit on channels in the 849&hyph;851 MHz range. Airborne mobile stations transmit on channels in the 894&hyph;896 MHz range. Systems using these channels must conform to the channel plan described in this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Channel blocks. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The spectrum allocated for commercial aviation air-ground systems is divided into ten channel blocks, numbered 1 through 10. All ground stations in each geographical area must use the same channel block for communication with airborne mobile stations in flight, in accordance with &sect;22.859. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Each channel block is subdivided into 6 control channels labeled P&hyph;1 through P&hyph;6, and 29 communications channels labeled C&hyph;1 through C&hyph;29. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The authorized channel bandwidths are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Each control channel has a bandwidth of 3.2 kHz. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Each communications channel has a bandwidth of 6 kHz. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The center frequencies (in MegaHertz) of the communications and control channels are listed in Tables G&hyph;1 and G&hyph;2 of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

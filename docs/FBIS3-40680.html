			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Bangalore, Jan 2--Prof M.D. Nanjundaswamy, Karnataka  Rajya Raitha Sangha President, declared here on Saturday that  farmers would set up seed banks in all States with a view to  fighting proposed amendments to the Seeds Act by the Government  in line with a GATT pact.    Prof Nanjundaswamy told reporters that a formal decision on  setting up seed banks would be taken in a KRRS State executive  committee meeting to be held at Davanagere on January 9. A seed  bank would be opened at Kittur in Belgaum district on January 19.    With a view to evolving a parallel system to GATT and  multinationals, the KRRS planned to set up seed banks which  would help preserve seeds and also facilitate a free exchange of  seeds between the States. Already two such centres, one in  Karnataka and another in Himachal Pradesh--both called  "Navdhany"--had started functioning, he said.    The country had been provided with one year time to sign the  GATT pact. However, the Government behaved much as a stooge of  the World Bank and the IMF by hurrying to amend the Seeds Act.  There were reports that the Government was also attempting to  discontinue subsidies in some States, against its much repeated  assurance to protect them, he pointed out.</p>

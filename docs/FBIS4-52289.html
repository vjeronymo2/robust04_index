			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Japan has not yet made any  breakthrough with the United States to reopen the stalled  "framework" trade talks, a senior Finance Ministry official said  Monday [9 May].    "Foreign Ministry officials are seeking possibilities  through  various channels, but there seems to be no clear direction yet,"  Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito told a regular news conference.  But he reiterated that substantial progress has been made in  insurance which his ministry is in charge of negotiating among  the three priority areas under the framework talks.    Other areas are automobiles and auto parts, and government  procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment.    In a related development, a senior Foreign Ministry official  said Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa may visit the United States  in late May or early June for talks with U.S. officials on ways  to resume the framework talks.    "I hope that working-level talks will be resumed by the  Middle of this month," the official, who declined to be named,  told reporters.    The official said Kakizawa hopes to meet with U.S. leaders  to discuss other delicate issues such as the suspected nuclear  weapons development program by North Korea.    The official also said Kakizawa is likely to meet U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor in Paris when they attend a  ministerial session of the Organization for Economic Cooperation  and Development (OECD) opening June 7.</p>

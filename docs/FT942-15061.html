			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / UK may back moves to pull out UN troops Britain would be prepared to back moves to pull United Nations troops out of Bosnia, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, indicated yesterday, as ministers came under cross-party fire over their handling of the crisis. Mr Rifkind said the UN was right to warn that it would have to pull out of the region completely if it became impossible to fulfil its peacekeeping mandate. In a BBC Radio 4 interview, he dismissed the 'facile suggestion' of armchair commentators that the warring factions in Bosnia could be bombed into submission by Nato air strikes. His comments came as Labour accused Nato's political leaders of 'indecision and vacillation' while renewing its call for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, said there did not seem to be 'any clear political strategy to guide military action on the ground at Gorazde'. Nato and the UN 'must make clear to the Bosnian Serbs that if the ceasefire does not endure, then air strikes will result'. The government also came under attack from its own back benches, with Mr Terry Dicks, MP for Hayes and Harlington, saying he was 'appalled' that Britain was still thinking about sending in more troops. He called for British troops to be withdrawn 'straight away'. Referring to the death of Royal Marine Timothy Coates, shot yesterday at a checkpoint in Sarajevo while off duty, Mr Dicks said: 'Yet another British soldier has been killed. We should not be there.' But another Conservative - Mr Patrick Cormack, MP for Staffordshire South - said such a pull-out would be a contemptible abdication of responsibility. Ministers are likely to face fresh criticism in the House of Commons today if a Labour demand for Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, to make a statement to MPs is accepted. Downing Street said last night that Mr John Major, the prime minister, was being kept informed of developments while in his Huntingdon constituency. Mr Rifkind criticised countries that had not so far honoured pledges to send extra troops. He said of 1,300 troops provided in the last two weeks, 900 had been British.</p>

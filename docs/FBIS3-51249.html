			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the Panamanian Human Rights Committee; </F> place and date not given]    [Text] The Panamanian Human Rights Committee (CPDH) hereby  addresses the nation and especially canal area employees to  outline its position concerning the recent assertions made by  the Panama Canal administrator regarding the political  participation of canal employees in the upcoming elections in  May 1994.    First, it is worth explaining that the reasons invoked by  the canal administration to justify the ban on Panama Canal  employees' participation in the May elections are applicable  only to U.S. citizens. To attempt to impose them on Panamanians  is to disregard the basic principles of national sovereignty.    Second, Panama's Constitution acknowledges the basic right  to  elect others and be elected to public office. A foreign law  cannot infringe on precepts established in the laws of the  nation.    Third, the canal administrator's assertions are not in  keeping with international pledges signed by the Republic of  Panama by way of important human rights pacts and international  agreements. Article 25 of the International Pact on Civil and  Political Rights establishes that all citizens will enjoy the  right to participate in the conduction of public affairs  directly or through freely elected representatives.    Due to all of the above, the CPDH reaffirms the canal area  employees' inalienable right to participate fully in the  nation's politics.    Panamanian Human Rights Committee    [signed] Roberto Troncoso B., president.</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Electricity in Europe (4): Forward from 1935 - Deregulation knocks at Germany's door When Germany takes over the presidency of the European Union on July 1, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the country's economics minister, will try to place the liberalisation and deregulation of Germany's energy sector high on the agenda. But the chances for pushing through any deregulation of the sector before Germany's federal elections next October are slim. Mr Rexrodt conceded as much during the recent congress of the Free Democrats, the junior partner in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union-led coalition. 'I really do not expect to get these measures through until after the election,' said Mr Rexrodt. Mr Rexrodt had already set out his plans for a new energy law in a bill issued last October. It sets out to replace a law which has been on the statute books since 1935. Its aim is to allow Third Party Access (TPA)throughout the electricity - and gas - sector. Among other things, it states that operators of the electricity grid, upon whom third parties are dependent for transportation, must not unreasonably hinder those seeking contracts for TPA. However, any refusal to grant TPA is permitted if the capacity for TPA is insufficient, if no appropriate compensation for TAP is offered, or if the secure supplies to other customers of the operators of the lines is deemed impossible through TPA. Over the past few months, opposition to the Rexrodt paper has hardened. The economics ministry itself is split. Mr Dieter von Wurzen, a state secretary, is opposed to TPA on the grounds that it should be based on reciprocity by other European Union countries, while Mr Johnann Eekhoff, a state secretary and Mr Martin Cronenberg, an energy expert at the ministry, are anxious to push through liberalisation. The response from the environment ministry has been lukewarm. Officials argue that the draft law does not go far enough in introducing environmental improvements. But it is the reaction from industry which holds the key to the success or failure of any plans by the federal government to deregulate the energy sector. The umbrella body for big industrial energy users (Verband der Industriellen Energie und Kraftwirtschaft, or VIK) has welcomed the proposals. This is understandable. The organisation's current president is the chemicals sector, including BASF, one of Germany's largest chemical groups, which has long campaigned for cheaper electricity and gas prices. 'The electricity and gas prices for industry in Germany are between 30 and 40 per cent, and in some extreme cases, 100 per cent higher than in other European countries,' a VIK paper recently noted, adding that the industry requires greater competition. Indeed, unlike some other European Union countries, Germany has no single formal regulatory body overseeing electricity pricing. Distribution companies - that is, the regional utilities - must agree their tariffs with local municipalities, which in many cases, own part of the distributors. Tariffs are normally based on the operational costs of the distributors. Despite the high cost of energy, analysts at the German association of German gas and water users (BGW) continue to oppose many aspects of the Rexrodt proposals. A recent paper issued by BGW argued that the introduction of TPA and the abolition of the principle of exclusive service areas will create 'inequality of opportunity'. It added that foreign gas companies would be able to supply the German market while foreign markets would remain inaccessible to German gas businesses. It added that TPA would lead to the expropriation of private investment and, more importantly, the obligation to connect customers and guarantee supply could no longer be met. The BGW's views have been reinforced by the association of municipal undertakings (Verband kommunaler Unternehmen, or VKU). Under present legislation, the municipalities have the exclusive right to issue concession contracts. If TPA were introduced, revenues earned from these concessionary payments would be reduced. As it stands, the municipalities receive about DM5bn each year in concession payments which help to finance public services. Yet the Rexrodt plan would give the municipalities the right to choose which utilities supply its customers, or even take over the supply themselves by buying the distribution grid. However, Germany's large utility companies, which are grouped under the VDEW, the trade association which represents them, would perhaps lose out. Currently, they enjoy the principle of demarcation, which effectively amounts to a monopolistic structure. The trade unions, particularly IG Bergbau und Energie, which represents the mining and energy workers, also oppose the Rexrodt paper because social services on the municipal level would be cut, and TPA and greater competition could undermine Germany's heavily subsidised hard coal industry. German coal prices are considerably higher than world coal prices. The latter cost about DM80 a tonne, but electricty companies in Germany pay DM280 per tonne for German coal in order to protect the industry. The electricity utilities are allowed to collect a levy from the consumer, called the Kohlpfennig, which helps to compensate them for using the high cost of coal. Despite this opposition, there is a growing consensus that eventually Germany must open up the energy sector. For one thing, the Kohlpfennig is supposed to be reduced or even phased out by 1996. In addition, many concession rights for towns and cities expire by 1996, raising the prospect of much greater competition in these sphere. As an energy expert at BGW explained, 'we are already allowing in foreigners. If we could get reciprocity, we would move ahead. But we cannot go it alone. But we know we are under pressure.'</p>

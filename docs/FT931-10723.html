			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' transactions LAST WEEK, we noted the tendency of directors to sell shares in spite of the rising market. This week, the situation is little changed. While the monetary value of some transactions can be high, in many cases directors still retain sizeable holdings. Such sales should not be viewed as an indication of lack of confidence in a company. James Hartnett, director of Eurotherm, has sold 120,000 shares at 508p. His residual holding remains in excess of 8 per cent of ordinary shares. Adrian Wallis, chief executive of Vistec Group, sold more than 600,000 shares, raising in excess of Pounds 167,000. He retains almost 1.5 per cent of the company. Shares in Gresham Telecomputing have out-performed the market over the past 12 months. Michael Whitaker, a non-executive director, sold 100,000 shares at 56p, retaining a big stake in the company. Three board members at Stylo, including the chairman and managing director, bought 151,000 limited voting shares at 90.25p, following the sale of Control Securities' stake. At Alexon Group, finance director David Cohen increased his stake to 1m shares following his purchase at 66p. He also bought 150,000 cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares at 60p.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                        No of Company                   Sector   Shares   Value  directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Allied Textiles           Text      4,000      17          1 Barbour Index             BuSe     12,500      34          1 Boxmore Intl              Pack      6,000      13          1 Bradford Prop Trust       Prop     10,000      16          1 Compass Group             Hotl     75,000     414          1 Eurotherm Intl            Elcs    120,000     610          1 Frogmore Estates          Prop     35,357     107          1* Gresham Telecomputg       Elcs    100,000      56          1 Inchcape                  BuSe      3,690      21          1* London Scot.

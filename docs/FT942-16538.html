			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Funds drive up coffee futures London robusta coffee futures were driven to fresh four-year highs this week as investment fund buyers latched on to growing concerns about nearby availability. But dealers were well aware that the speculative nature of the rise meant that the bubble could burst at any moment. The market peaked on Thursday, when the July delivery position reached Dollars 1,450 a tonne. By yesterday's close it had eased to Dollars 1,436, up Dollars 73 on the week. Buyers were encouraged by rumours that the Ivory Coast might halt coffee and cocoa exports unless shippers paid a back-dated export tax. And the advance was underpinned by a report from London broker ED &amp; F. Man warning that consumer stocks of robusta coffee - the coarser type grown mainly in Africa  -had become uncomfortably low, reflecting the success of the export retention scheme producers have been operating since October. At the end of February these stocks stood at 16.9m bags (60kg each), down 3.3m from a year earlier, Man estimat-ed. Apart from driving prices higher across the board, supply worries resulted in the establishment this week of a sizeable premium, or 'backwardation', for the prompt May delivery position at the London Commodity Exchange. At yesterday's close the premium stood at Dollars 21 a tonne over the July contract, which a week earlier had itself been commanding a Dollars 3 premium. At the London Metal Exchange the recent shake-out in copper prices continued until support was found late in the week. The three months position, which had touched Dollars 1,873 a tonne at one stage, closed yesterday at Dollars 1,889.25, up Dollars 1 on balance. There was disappointment, however, that news of another sharp drawdown from LME warehouse stocks had not enabled the contract to regain its foothold above Dollars 1,900. In contrast the aluminium market seemed to take great comfort yesterday from a second consecutive stocks cut that took the drawdown over the week to 11,525 tonnes. Talk of possible output reductions by producers in the Urals, where power cuts are planned, gave further encouragement to buyers and the three months price gained Dollars 19 on the day to close at Dollars 1,319.50 a tonne. That represented a net gain of Dollars 5 on the week and was Dollars 30.50 above the low point reached on Thursday morning. Thursday had also seen the low for lead, which touched a four-month low of Dollars 435 a tonne in the three months position. But investors then decided that the markets fundamentals did not justify such a low price and by yesterday's close it was back at Dollars 452.75 a tonne, down a relatively modest Dollars 5 on the week. The oil market was also defying fundamentals this week, according to some analysts. An investment fund-driven price jump in New York on Monday, was echoed at London's International Petroleum Exchange on Tuesday when traders returned after the Easter holiday. North Sea Brent crude prices were quickly into the heady regions above Dollars 14 a barrel and, to the surprise of many observers, held most of their gains for the rest of the week. The only explanation most analysts could offer was that the market was suffering from a 'guilt syndrome' after over-reacting on the downside to the failure of the Organisation of Oil Producing Countries to agree on a reduction in its output ceiling at its recent ministerial meeting.  -------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  -------------------------------------- (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  -------------------------------------- Aluminium         -5,475  to  2,587,175 Aluminium alloy     -460  to     43,960 Copper            -6,525  to    497,825 Lead                -650  to    336,225 Nickel              -282  to    136,728 Zinc              +9,750  to  1,126,675 Tin                 +390  to     24,505  --------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Airport price row goes to Brussels Luton Airport yesterday took to the European Commission its complaint that BAA, the airports operator, was pursuing anti-competitive pricing policies at Stansted Airport, its rival London airport, Rachel Johnson writes. The airport, owned by Luton Borough Council, said: 'As a result of Stansted's pricing policy Luton has suffered and continues to suffer material harm.' BAA owns all airports in the London area apart from Luton, and handles 97 per cent of all passengers. Luton says Stansted's charges to airlines and tour operators are substantially lower than its own. BAA countered that the Civil Aviation Authority had already declined to take action after holding an inquiry into the complaint, even though it agreed that Stansted's pricing policywas below cost.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Inquiry into MCC foreign exchanges INVESTIGATORS probing the affairs of Maxwell Communication Corporation believe they have uncovered false foreign exchange transactions allegedly used by the late Mr Robert Maxwell to boost substantially the insolvent publishing company's pre-tax profits. Price Waterhouse, administrators to MCC, claim in a New York bankruptcy court filing that pre-tax profits were overstated by at least Pounds 36.9m in the year to end-March 1991. MCC posted pre-tax profits of Pounds 145.5m in the period, including Pounds 80.7m of foreign exchange gains. According to Mr David Lee, head of the litigation and special investigation services unit at Price Waterhouse, investigation of MCC's 1991 profits show that at least some of the foreign exchange transactions may never have taken place. His investigators have examined four photocopies of documents purportedly related to the currency deals which he said, 'show typographical inconsistencies'. The first document purports to show that on November 9 1990 MCC bought a Dollars 242.5m (Pounds 170.7m) contract for settlement on March 28 1991, three days before the end of MCC's financial year. This was followed by a Dollars 279m contract on December 21 1990, and a Dollars 247m contract on December 28 also for settlement on March 28. The fourth document purports to show that on March 28 1991 MCC closed its position by selling the Dollars 768.5m at a spot rate of Dollars 1.739, supposedly generating the Pounds 37.9 profit. However, the Wall Street investment bank purportedly involved in the transactions has told investigators that it has no record of these transactions. The Pounds 36.9m net profit from the currency transactions was supposedly paid directly by the bank to one of Mr Maxwell's private companies which allegedly then paid the money to MCC as part of a Pounds 40m cash transfer received by MCC on April 4 1991. Administrators to the private companies have confirmed that a Pounds 40m payment was made, but said it did not represent the proceeds of foreign exchange transactions. Last night, Mr Lee said: 'The documents could well have been cut and pasted and as a result of this discovery we are now looking even more closely at MCC's foreign exchange deals.' Price Waterhouse has provided details of its investigations to the Serious Fraud Office.</p>

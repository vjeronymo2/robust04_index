			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Russian state oil company in clear Mr Mikhail Gurtovoi, head of the Russian government's anti-corruption commission, yesterday apologised to Nizhnevartovskneftegas, one of the biggest state-owned oil companies in the country, for accusing it of putting aside 1.5m tonnes of oil for illicit sales, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. He said that the accusation was made to his commission by a group of academics who had visited the region but that a subsequent investigation had failed to prove the enterprise was guilty of any wrong-doing. Mr Gurtovoi said yesterday that the commission had been disbanded by President Boris Yeltsin, in a decree which would not be published. He said he did not know why this had happened. The accusation was reported in the Financial Times last August.</p>

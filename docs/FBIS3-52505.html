Police claimed demonstrators had opened fire first.    The crowds had gathered at the family's Al-Murtaza residence  in Larkana to take part in ceremonies marking the 66th  anniversary of the birth of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, former Pakistan  leader and founder of the ruling Pakistan People's Party, who  was hanged in 1979.    Fearing clashes between rival Bhutto family factions, police  had cordoned off the premises and set up check points in the  city to prevent Murtaza's backers from reaching the graveyard  where his father is buried until after Benazir Bhutto had paid  her respects.    Murtaza, arrested in November on charges of terrorism during  the 11-year rule of late general Mohammed Zia-ul-Haq, was  refused parole to visit the grave by a Karachi court.    A slogan-chanting crowd suddenly emerged from Al-Murtaza,  where Benazir Bhutto's estranged mother Nusrat Bhutto was  staying, and tried to march to the grave site 17 kilometers (10  miles) away, witnesses said.    Another group from the city tried to link up by forcing  their  way through a police barricade towards the residence.    Senior Superintendent of Police, Bashir Memon, said police  opened fire only after they were fired on by demonstrators, an  allegation denied by sources close to Nusrat Bhutto.    Her spokesman said the premises came under a "hail of  bullets" and witnesses said numerous bullet marks could be seen  in the gate and walls of the house.    "The incident was worse than anything experienced in the  darkest days of Ziaul-Haq," said one of her supporters.    Members of her personal staff, whose hands were stained with  blood, claimed at least two of the wounded were shot inside the  family compound.    "One of the boys injured in the incident was shot in the  back  while he was talking to someone at the gate. The car trying to  take him to hospital was also fired upon by the police," said  provincial Senator Makhdoom Khaliquzzaman.    Police had surrounded the house, allowing no one in or out,  after reports that Nusrat Bhutto was planning to go to the grave  in a procession, officials said.    "For security reasons we could not allow miscreants to  accompany Begum Nusrat Bhutto," to the Garhi Khuda Bakhsh  graveyard, said Memon.    During the clashes two police were seized by demonstrators.  One was still being held, said police chief Memon.    Earlier Benazir Bhutto had visited her father's grave amid  top security. Police ringed the graveyard within a radius of 20  kilometers (12 miles). She was accompanied by members of the  Pakistan People's Party's central executive committee, federal  ministers and MPs.    Tight security kept reporters away from the premier who  appeared composed. She stayed about 30 minutes and left without  incident.    The Bhutto family has become increasingly divided in recent  months. Benazir has kept her distance from Murtaza since his  return to Pakistan in November from 16 years of self-exile in  Syria. Her mother, however, has actively supported him.    The two women clashed last month when Benazir ousted her  mother from the presidency of the ruling people's party. Nusrat  maintained that her husband before he died had made her the  party's president for life.    It was not clear whether Nusrat would go later to pray at  her  husband's gave.    "She is ill and running a high temperature, said her  spokesman.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Letter: Different light on post-steel era Sir, Anthony Moreton and Stewart Dalby refer to Consett's post-steel experiences as offering hope to Lanarkshire following the closure of Ravenscraig ('Shattered towns that prove there can be a life after steel', January 9). You report that some 5,000 jobs more than were employed in steel have been created in Consett and the remainder of Derwentside District. The facts, as revealed by the Department of Employment's Censuses of Employment, are these. In 1978 more than 12,700 people were employed in manufacturing in Derwentside District. Between 1978 and 1981, manufacturing employment in Derwentside fell by slightly more than 8,000, largely as a result of the run-down and closure of BSC's Consett steelworks. The net gain between 1981 and 1989 was 1,270 manufacturing jobs. Thus between 1978 and 1989 there was a net decline of over 6,700 - over 50 per cent - in manufacturing employment in Derwentside District. Such figures cast a very different light on the prospects for Lanarkshire in its impending post-steel era. R Hudson, Department of Geography, University of Durham</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Names allegations 'damaging to market' Lloyd's of London yesterday said allegations by a group of loss-making Names were 'objectionable and potentially damaging to the interests of the Lloyd's market and members' and warned that it was 'considering appropriate forms of redress'. In a newspaper advertisement headlined 'How many more people have to die before Lloyd's is brought to account?', the Wellington Names Association said that 'at least 30 suicides and premature deaths have been attributed to the losses sustained by Lloyd's Names'. The association accused Lloyd's of failing to discharge its duties under the Lloyd's Acts of 1871 and 1982 and called on the Names - the individuals whose assets support the market - and Lloyd's policyholders to demand an independent inquiry into Lloyd's losses. Lloyd's said it totally rejected the allegations. The market this week reported losses of Pounds 2.05bn for the 1991 year, bringing its cumulative losses since 1988 to about Pounds 7bn.</p>

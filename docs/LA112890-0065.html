			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL COMMITTEE LIFTS ROADBLOCK TO MCA PROJECT  </P> <P> A roadblock to MCA's plans to build a 257,000-square-foot pedestrian-oriented  commercial-restaurant complex at Universal City was quickly removed Tuesday by  the planning committee of the Los Angeles City Council.  </P> <P> The Planning and Land Use Management Committee voted 3 to 0 to lift  restrictions previously placed on the media giant's $70-million "CityWalk"  project.  </P> <P> The restrictions, which were imposed in July and included limits on the hours  of use of a private road on the 420-acre property, had been called illegal by  MCA attorney and lobbyist Burt Pines. They had been imposed when the project  was granted a variance by the city's Board of Zoning Appeals. The road provided  access to a 550-space MCA parking lot.  </P> <P> "CityWalk" was dubbed the "ultimate Los Angeles boulevard" last spring by  architect Jon Jerde, who has worked on its design. It calls for boutiques,  cafes and bookstores to be built along a pedestrian mall connecting the  amphitheater, restaurants, Tour Plaza and movie theaters at Universal City.  </P> <P> Most of the project, set to begin construction in January, is located outside  city limits. However, 28,000 square feet are to be in the city, necessitating  the city variance.  </P> <P> The county portion is already approved.  </P> <P> Several local homeowners opposed to the project had sought the restrictions on  the road to the parking lot and the lot itself, and had urged the city to  require a full environmental review of the project.  </P> <P> But Pines, Los Angeles' former city attorney, said that the protesting  homeowners are a small group and that residents supporting the project are in  the majority.  </P> <P> Pines also said the city had no jurisdiction to regulate the operations of the  road or the lot itself.  </P></p>

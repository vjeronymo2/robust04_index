			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HOME PRICES DROP 3% FROM DECEMBER AS MARKET SLOWS  </P> <P> The average resale price of a single-family house in the San Fernando Valley  fell 3% to $298,300 in January from $308,500 in December, the San Fernando  Valley Board of Realtors said Monday.  </P> <P> The price level still marked a 13% increase from the average price in January,  1989, of $263,600.  </P> <P> The local housing market continued to be sluggish in January as a flood of  sellers put their houses on the market last month, boosting the number of new  listings of single-family homes 111% in January to 2,721 from 1,288 in  December.  </P> <P> Sales, meanwhile, increased 9% to 770 in January from 708 in December. But  sales still fell 27% short of levels a year ago, when a total of 1,057 were  sold in the Valley.  </P> <P> The average resale price of a condominium meanwhile reached a record high of  $156,200 in January, up 1% from $154,700 in December. The latest monthly figure  was 17% higher than in January, 1989, when the average resale price was  $133,100.  </P> <P> The number of condominiums resold increased 7% in January to 304 from 284 in  December. But condominium resales were 13% lower than in January, 1989, when  349 were resold.  </P> <P> The board called the sales of single-family homes "sluggish" in a release, but  predicted that falling or only slowly increasing prices would lead to more  sales volume.  </P> <P> "Because listings are high, a buyers' market exists which is forcing owners who  must sell to reconsider the amount of profit they're willing to accept," said  Jim Link, the board's executive vice president. "Owners have finally realized  that they are not losing money by lowering their asking price, since you cannot  lose what you never had."  </P> <P> Link predicted that increasing prices would soon slow condominium sales. "I  think you'll see the same pattern we're seeing now in single-family homes:  excessive pricing drags sales down, listings back up." Eventually, Link said,  "owners readjust prices, sales resume and the market seeks a new level."  </P> <P> Fixed-rate mortgages have begun to climb in recent weeks and on average are now  higher than 10%, which could slow any comeback in the local housing market.  </P> <P> The Valley realty board, California's largest, reports sales of houses and  condominiums by its members in the area from North Hollywood to Agoura. Its  statistics do not include most new residences.  </P> <P> </P> <P> JANUARY VALLEY HOUSE SALES  </P> <P> NORTH WEST  </P> <P> Avg.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1&hyph;(800) 248&hyph;5100 (in Missouri 1&hyph;(800) 342&hyph;6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed to (Project Director): Petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)&hyph;(v) and 2.714(d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Arizona Public Service Company, et al., Docket Nos.

The licensee proposed to change the Azimuthal Power Tilt limit from less than or equal to 10 percent to less than or equal to 3 percent when the Core Operating Limit Supervisory System is out of service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensees have provided their analysis about the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Standard 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Decreasing the COLSS [Core Operating Limit Supervisory System] out-of service Azimuthal Power Tilt Technical Specification limit does not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The Technical Specification operating limit is being conservatively reduced to conform to the assumptions used in the safety analysis. The reduced operating limit requires a more uniform power distribution in the reactor core. The uniform power distribution may reduce the consequences of an accident previously evaluated by not allowing regions in the core to operate at higher power levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Standard 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment will result in an alarm setpoint change, but does not involve any equipment changes and will not alter the manner in which the plant will be operated. For this reason, this amendment will not create the possibility of an new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. The proposed operating range is smaller and completely within the existing Technical Specification limits; thus, there are no mechanisms to create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Standard 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment conservatively reduces the COLSS out-of-service Azimuthal Power Tilt Technical Specification limit, thereby increasing the margin of safety. The proposed operating range is smaller and completely bounded by the existing Technical Specification limits. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensees' analysis and, based on that review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied.

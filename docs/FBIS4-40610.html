			<p>BFN     [Text] Berlin June 19 TASS -- Today, on the last day of an  official visit to Germany, a State Duma delegation, led by its  Chairman Ivan Rybkin, laid a wreath at the memorial to Russian  liberator soldiers in the Treptow Park, Berlin.    After two days of meetings and talks with leaders and  prominent politicians in Bonn, Russian legislators arrived in  the German capital on Saturday, where they familiarised  themselves with the experience of privatization of state  enterprises in the eastern part of the country, as well as the  examples of the participation of foreign business people in that  process. During their visit to the Kvo Kabel plant, which now  fully belongs to a British firm and supplies half of its output  to Russia, as well as during their conversation with Berlin  Burgomaster Eberhard Dipgen members of the delegation got very  interesting and useful information, Rybkin told ITAR-TASS.  "There should be 101 ways of privatization of state-owned  enterprises instead of just one," Rybkin pointed out. He said  that at present there are some 1,500 industrial enterprises in  Russia which may go bankrupt. In the opinion of Rybkin, their  situation calls for a comprehensive approach.    The Russian delegation will have a meeting today with heads  of the Berlin chamber of deputies in the Palace of  Charlottenburg. The guests will also visit the Reichstag  building. In the afternoon of the last day of the visit they  will have meetings with the command of the Western Army group  and the personnel of the Berlin Brigade.</p>

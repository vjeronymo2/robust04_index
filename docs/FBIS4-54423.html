			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 28 April (MTI) -- After tough internal  squabbles, the Democratic Hungarian Community of Vojvodina  (VMDK) has been consolidated, with its realistic line winning a  two-thirds majority, VMDK president Andras Agoston announced in  Budapest on Thursday [28 April] after meeting government  representatives and party officials. Cross-Border Hungarians  Office President Geza Entz said their talks covered a proposal  for ethnic Hungarian organizations to receive certain  contribution to their budgets.    Agoston said the VMDK's re-elected leadership maintains its  demand for autonomy, and has already talked unofficially to  Serbia's prime minister. Settling the position of Hungarians in  Vojvodina is closely connected with international circumstances.  "An agreement with Serbia will work if it also serves Serb  interests," he added.    He quoted President Clinton's special emissary's call for  autonomy for Croatian Serbs and Albanians in rump Yugoslavia.  With a precedent for ethnic minority autonomy, Hungarians in  Vojvodina would have more chance for their own demands, Agoston  said.</p>

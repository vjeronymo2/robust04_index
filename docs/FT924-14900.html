			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Nigerian poll setback NIGERIA'S military rulers yesterday suspended the process of choosing candidates for December's presidential elections pending the outcome of a probe into alleged irregularities, Reuter reports from Abuja. The Armed Forces Ruling Council (AFRC) said after a meeting that the decision followed a report by the National Electoral Commission on presidential primaries between September 12 and 26. 'The AFRC has found it necessary to put the primaries and presidential candidates' nomination processes on hold until all allegations of use of wealth, falsification of figures, threats, favouritism and all other electoral malpractices indentified in the NEC report have been thoroughly investigated and verified,' it said. Rigging charges following the primaries of the Social Democratic party (SDP) and National Republican Convention (NRC) - both created by the government - have cast a shadow over President Ibrahim Babangida's plans to step down on January 2 after the December 5 presidential election.</p>

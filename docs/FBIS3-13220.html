The Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Hojjat  ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Nateq-Nuri, and Mr. Partovi, Mr.  Amir-Jahani, Mr. Mohammadi, and Mr. Karimi, deputies from Saqz  va Baneh, Abhar, Al-Shotor, and Shushtar, gave speeches. Then  the speaker of the Majles gave a speech in which he noted the  martyrdom anniversary of Navab Safavi. We direct the attention  of our esteemed readers to the detailed Majles proceedings.  <H5>  Majles Highlights </H5> <H5>  Majles Speaker </H5>   The speaker of the Majles glorified and praised the  struggles  of those who are devoted to Islam, especially Martyr Navab  Safavi.  <H5>  Speeches </H5>   Partovi, deputy from Saqz va Baneh, discussed the economic  and welfare problems of the people of Kordestan. He said: Our  faith and belief is that in the long run our demands will be  achieved in the shadow of Islam.    Mohammadi, deputy from Delfan, said in part of his speech:  Islamic justice demands that the Plan and Budget Organization  allocate most of the budget to those provinces where less work  has been done.  <H5>  Legislation </H5>   With the amendment to the Means Law for Combatant University  Admissions, and if approved in the second consultation, the  spouses of wounded veterans will make use of these means.    Iran has become a member of the Islamic Conference  Organization Research Center.    The scientific, cultural and educational agreement between  the Islamic Republic of Iran and the governments of Kazakhstan  and Kirghizestan has been signed.  <H5>  Majles Speaker's Remarks </H5>   At yesterday's open Majles session Mr. Nateq-Nuri offered  congratulations on the birth anniversary of His Holiness Seyyed  ol-Sajedin Emam Zeyn ol-Abedin (peace be upon him). Then in his  speech he commemorated the memory of Martyr Navab Safavi and his  loyal companions. In this regard he said: Martyr Navab Safavi  and his companions (Vahedi, Tahmasebi, and other  comrades-in-arms) once stood in armed struggle against the  oppressor shah's regime. Few people understood these issues or  had the courage to take action in an entirely oppressive period  ruled by suppressors and dictatorship. This cleric and man of  God had courage and faith in the true meaning of the Islam of  Mohammad (peace be upon him). He began the movement, and with a  comprehensive view.    The speaker of the Majles then added: When we read the  history of Navab Safavi, we will understand that he had a  comprehensive view. For him, it was not simply a matter of  struggling against a dictatorship. Just as today we and the  exalted leader are concerned about the cultural invasion, in  those days the late Martyr Safavi was aware of all the enemy  fronts. Ultimately, he was abundantly concerned with moving  towards the nation's independence and the nation's territorial,  political, and economic independence and self-sufficiency. These  are the underlying messages in the slogans, speeches, and cries  of the late Navab and his companions. The Feda'ian of Islam  began the armed struggle against despotism, imperialism, and  ideological deviation before any other group, and dealt with  figures who deviated ideologically or who dared to challenge the  sacred position of the chaste Imams (peace be upon them). Today  when Salman Rushdie has insulted the name of the sacred Prophet  of God (peace be upon him), we are dealing with him. Those days  that same man of God dealt with those who insulted the sacred  name of Imam Sadeq (peace be upon him) and made them understand.  He defended the sacred name of the Imams (peace be upon them)  and he manfully stood his ground and never gave up his beliefs.  <H5>  Mohammad 'Ali Partovi, Deputy From Saqz va Baneh </H5>   The economic problems in Kordestan can be solved with  industrial development and production.    The first pre-agenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles  session was Partovi, deputy from Saqz. During his speech he  said: One of the most important factors in the development and  reconstruction of our Islamic land is public participation.  Among the most important activities, which bring about public  participation in each region, is cultural work, respect for  nationalities and sects, and belief in the people. Observing  these matters based on beliefs, Islamic and real outlooks  requires comprehensive research and study.    Continuing, he said: The views and commands of His Holiness  the Imam (peace be upon him) with regard to the religiously  legitimate rights of the Kurdish people and the principles of  the Constitution in connection with the province of Kordestan  must be implemented in the region to keep the enemies of Islam  from misusing the situation and the realities of the regions,  because without implementing those things, every measure will be  temporary and without roots. If the problems in Kordestan are  not solved at the roots, if they are not systematically treated  and if emigrant forces do not have sufficient understanding of  the culture, way of life and economy of the people, every day  problems and processes will be created that will torment the  people. When every aspect of the lives of our people is in  commerce and border exchanges, naturally the forces combatting  it with violence will cause social disorders and severe  disruptions.    Continuing, the speaker said: In the old days, in the  historical fabric of our border-keeping people, border trade was  the main way of making a living. Kordestan is deprived of a  factory and a simple production center. Agriculture is done in  primitive and traditional ways. Animal husbandry is not  economical. Therefore the border location and the indifference  of the idolaters have positioned the economic pulse in border  trade.    In this regard blood has been shed and lives have been lost  in the course of making a living, leading to mothers and fathers  in black, social disruption, and recently this issue has also  caused the killing of several people, including a girl in the  city of Baneh, and the wounding of a number of people, including  a worker who was kicked to death in public after being hit by  several bullets.    Partovi said: It is never justifiable for a nation, which  has  always guarded the borders with nobility, bravery, and glory and  is the oldest and most genuine Iranian race, to see the blood of  its innocent dear ones spilled on the soil of their country for  trying to make a living and fill their stomachs.    We have repeatedly issued memos that the economic problems  in  Kordestan can be solved with industrial development and  production. Of course, in answer they say that investment is not  done properly at the borders, or that they should do border  trade in a lawful, correct and supervised manner so that the  blood of the innocent will not be repaid by the hunger of the  deprived.    We believe and our people believe that in the long run our  demands and the true face of our aspirations will be realized in  the shadow of Islam. We are hoping for a better day and for the  progress of Islam and the revolution even as we mourn the blood  of our innocent daughter.    He then added: The point is not concealed from observers  that  the revolution's true heirs are mostly the oppressed and the  destitute of society. Therefore, in return for their effort and  sacrifice, it is incumbent upon all government leaders to  coordinate all policies and political and executive positions to  support them.    Continuing, the deputy from Saqz discussed the question of  the origins of the deprivation in Kordestan. he said:    For us, the border location, the difficulty of travel  because  of the geography or the oppressiveness of the idolater regime  are no justification for the respected minister of petroleum to  say that because Saqz, Baneh and Marivan are on difficult  terrain for travel, providing gas delivery to these three cities  is not possible except in the Third Five-Year Plan, because the  real concept of eliminating deprivation is observing the factors  of deprivation.    Even the idolaters could have used difficulty of passage as  a  pretext for making apologies and sad excuses. I therefore direct  the attention to the minister of petroleum to the fact that at  the meeting at the Ministry of Petroleum attended by the  governor-general, the respected minister emphasized that before  the Second Five-Year Plan he would extend gas delivery activity  from Qarveh to Bijar, Divan-e Darreh, Saqz and Baneh. We gave  hope to the deprived Muslim people of the area based on his  excellency's promise, and the identity of the revolution is  based on promises. If difficulty of passage is not an excuse,  Mian-e Do Ab and Bukan will be in the Five-Year Plan. The 25  kilometers between Bukan and Saqz are also planned, and the  route is level. In fairness, these people are truly more  deserving than others.    In conclusion, he directed the attention of the respected  officials to the following matters: Making maximum use of  committed and experienced forces in various posts to bring about  maximum participation, refraining from hiring the well-off and  prosperous, making use of the views and proposals and studying  the criticisms of experts in Kordestan to improve the existing  situation, giving serious attention to the low-income classes in  planning and performance, basic planning for using Kordestan's  natural and mining resources in this virgin area, investing in  Kordestan's ancient sites to attract tourism and its foreign  exchange revenue, creating a Sunni seminary in Kordestan and  equipping it with the needed resources, and creating conditions  for it to attract clerics for the growth and deepening of the  rich culture of Islam.  <H5>  Seyyed Fazel Amir-Jahani, Deputy From Abhar </H5>   The failure to control the prices of items and materials on  the market brings direct and indirect economic pressure on  society's vulnerable classes, especially the workers.    The next speaker was Amir-Jahani, deputy from Abhar. During  his speech he offered congratulations on the arrival of the  blessed days of the month of Sha'ban. He said: Taking  inspiration from the immortal slogan "hardship is regrettable"  [unattributed Arabic quote], representing the Hezbollah nation  we express our anger, hatred, and loathing for the crimes of  filthy America and its agents throughout the world, especially  those against the oppressed Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  Palestine, Kashmir, and other places. We condemn those who use  their evil pens to write of relations with America, and we warn  them of the anger of the combative nation.    He discussed the 15th anniversary of the triumph of the  Islamic revolution and discussed the end of the First Five-Year  Plan. He said: The experience gained in the First Five-Year Plan  included a series of strengths in the plan, such as the start-up  and the construction of basic and infrastructure projects in  various sectors, which we have seen and are seeing. Along with  that, however, the plan's consequences also include weak points.  These include relatively severe fluctuations in the price of  foreign exchange on the market, which created conditions for  abuses by professional brokers. The failure to control the  prices of items and materials on the market brings direct and  indirect economic pressure on society's vulnerable classes,  especially the workers with high school diplomas and less, lack  of attention and failure to pay the necessary subsidies to  farmers, the increase in the number of unemployed people, and  especially the small percentage of employed people in rural  society, which lacks agricultural land, livestock and stable  employment.    The deputy from Abhar thanked the government and noted:  After  the approval of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] Budget  Bill will be the best and most appropriate opportunity for the  Majles to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the First  Five-Year Plan based on the realities, for expert work to be  done in approving the Second Five-Year Plan, for greater care to  be exercised, and for minimizing the weaknesses of the past. Of  course, in this regard the announced views of the exalted leader  addressed to the president of the republic as the policies to  prevail over the Second Five-Year Plan have completely clarified  the directions the plan will take. Some of its paragraphs  mention serious and lawful government and judicial support for  the oppressed class, creating employment, expanding and  improving the social security system, reviving the tradition of  interest-free loans in the nation's banking system, avoiding  foreign borrowing, and making efforts for a gradual liberation  from current commitments.    He added: It is hoped that the deputies will give the  appropriate attention to achieving the goals of self-sufficiency  in agricultural products in order to properly develop such  matters as providing security to rural farmers, planning and  implementing education and promoting proven and successful  methods, encouraging farmers to form cooperative units for  agricultural products and solve the problems of insurance and  social security for the owners of production, insuring  agricultural products and guaranteed purchases for agricultural  products based on a price-setting mechanism that is appropriate  for expenses, making arrangements and finding easy ways to  export their crops, and taking measures to establish conversion  industries.    Amir-Jahani then issued a memo to the Ministry of Power  concerning the implementation of the Law Prohibiting the Use of  Underground Water, and he thanked the Ministry of Petroleum for  its promise to help provide gas delivery to the area.  <H5>  Mohammad Mohammadi, Deputy From Delfan and Al-Shotor </H5>   Islamic justice requires that most of the budget be  allocated  to the provinces where less work has been done.    The third pre-agenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles  session was Mohammadi, deputy from al-Shotor. He offered  congratulations on the birth anniversary of His Holiness Imam  Hoseyn (peace be upon him), His Holiness Imam Sajjad (peace be  upon him) and His Holiness Abol-Fazl al-'Abbas (peace be upon  him), standard-bearer of Karbala. He offered congratulations to  the government of Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani for having achieved  striking successes in the First Five-Year Plan with its  infrastructure work in the enormous economy. He said: It is  natural that there will be intermittent inflation during the  transition from a subsidized economy to a sound and fundamental  economy, especially after the consequences of the imposed war.  However, it is requested that the beloved president of the  republic make great effort and exercise the necessary  supervision over prices to stop excessive price increases, the  primary burden of which falls on the shoulders of the deprived.    Continuing, he said: Islamic justice requires that the Plan  and Budget Organization allocate most of the budget to the  provinces where less work has been done. If projects are to be  suspended, this should be done in the prosperous provinces,  rather than by eliminating a teacher training center in the  deprived region of al-Shotor and several other places in the  province of Lorestan.    He thanked the minister of the interior for appointing Mr.  Mohammadizadeh governor-general of Lorestan and expressed the  hope that the new governor-general would exercise full  supervision and employ native and Hezbollah forces, who are  always with the clergy, in order to be able to serve this  deprived province. The speaker thanked and praised the minister  of labor for traveling to the province of Lorestan to open and  do the ground-breaking on factories for employment and technical  and professional training, which hopefully will alleviate  unemployment in our country.    The deputy from al-Shotor then thanked brother Engineer  Basharati, chief of the Deprived Areas Office, for his serious  concern for the deprived areas.    He said: Engineer Basharati, with his God-given memory, is  entirely familiar with every part of the deprived areas and is  trying to alleviate deprivation. It is requested of the  respected Majles Plan and Budget Commission and respected  colleagues that special attention be given to this office, as  well as the Ministry of Labor, for in this way deprivation will  be alleviated in the country.    In conclusion he asked the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry  of Agriculture, and the Ministry of the Reconstruction Crusade  to give more attention to this deprived and ever-present  on-the-scene province.  <H5>  Zabihollah Karimi, Deputy From Shushtar </H5>   Karimi, deputy from Shushtar, was the final pre-agenda  speaker. In his speech he offered congratulations on the birth  of Imam Sajjad (peace be upon him) and said: 27 Dey [17 January]  is the anniversary of the bloody martyrdom and the red flight of  the passionate martyr 'Erfan Mohammadi, the great martyr Navab  Safavi and his loyal companions. This is a good opportunity to  show respect for the good spirits of the great martyrs of Islam  and sacrificing martyrs of Islam. [passages omitted on Navab  Safavi's life]  <H5>  Legislation </H5> <H3>  Amendment to the Law Creating Means for Combatant University  Admissions </H3>   The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles  session was the report from the first consultation of the  Culture and Higher Education Commission on the Proposed  Amendment to Note 3 of the Law Amending the Law Creating Means  for Combatant, Crusader, and Basiji Volunteer Admissions to  Universities and Institutions of Higher Education, the general  form of which was approved by the deputies.    In discussing this motion, the expert from the Higher  Education Commission Said: Based on Note 3, "the children of  martyrs, invalids and former prisoners and their spouses and the  children of injured veterans with more than 50 percent  disabilities may benefit from the provisions of this law by  notifying the Martyr Foundation of the Islamic Revolution, the  Former Prisoners Staff and the Foundation for the Oppressed and  War Veterans." In this motion it was proposed that the spouses  of injured veterans be added to this note.  <H5>  Bill To Form Supreme National Technical Council </H5>   The second item on the agenda was the report from the first  consultation of the Plan and Budget Commission concerning the  Bill To Form the Supreme National Technical Council, the general  form of which was not approved and was rejected.    In explaining this bill, the expert from the Plan and Budget  Commission said:    In the year 1356 [21 March 1977-20 March 1978] there was a  note in the budget law for that year, which is one of the  permanent notes. In this note the government is authorized to  change and revise base prices, based on prices, regulations and  guidelines approved by the shah's Commission. With the triumph  of the Islamic revolution the Revolutionary Council amended  Article 1. Article 1 authorized technical councils to be formed  in the provinces and it specified the composition of these  councils in the provinces. Among the prerogatives of the  councils, they authorized the supreme technical council to  adjust the base price of the ceiling figure, which is increased  by the amount of each development project. That which the  government has now presented is an amendment to the  Revolutionary Council's Paragraph J, but the Plan and Budget  Commission decided that while we are preparing the government's  amendment, we should approve the Bill To Form the Supreme  National Technical Council, to make this council permanent. This  bill sets general limits on prerogatives and duties.  <H5>  Rural Development Inquiry Motion </H5>   The third item on the agenda was the report from the Plan  and  Budget Commission concerning the motion to conduct an inquiry on  the rural development mentioned in Paragraph 2, Note 55 of the  1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] National Budget Law, and the  inquiry was approved.  <H5>  Topic of Inquiry </H5>   Is what is intended by the term "rural development credits"  (in Paragraph 2, Note 55 of the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March  1994] National Budget Law) all the development measures done by  the reconstruction crusade in the rural areas, or not?  <H5>  Commission's View </H5>   Article 1: What is meant by "credits" (rural development in  Paragraph 2, Note 55 of the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994]  National Budget Law) and other credits are those activities that  are provided in the law under the heading of rural development.  <H5>  Request To Reject 3 Bills </H5>   The next item on the agenda was the request to reject three  government bills:    1. The Bill To Append a Note to Article 7 of the Iran and  World Tourism Industrial Development Law, enacted in 1370 [21  March 1991-20 March 1992] by the Council of Ministers, based on  the note to Article 89 of the Majles Domestic Guidelines.    2. Bill on the Cultural, Scientific, and Educational  Agreement between the Governments of the Islamic Republic of  Iran and the Republic of Azerbaijan.    3. Bill to collect the price of road maintenance services.  <H3>  Bill on Iran's Membership in the Islamic Conference  Organization Research Center </H3>   The fifth item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles  session was the report from the first consultation of the  Islamic Guidance and Art Commission concerning the Bill on the  Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Membership in the  Center for Islamic Historical, Artistic, and Cultural Research  Affiliated with the Islamic Conference Organization, the general  form of which was approved.  <H3>  Scientific, Cultural, and Educational Agreement Between the  Islamic Republic of Iran and the Governments of Kazakhstan and  Kyrgyzstan </H3>   The final item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles  session was the report from the Islamic Guidance and Art  Commission concerning the Bill on the Scientific, Cultural, and  Educational Agreement between the Islamic Republic of Iran and  the Governments of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and this agreement  was also approved by the deputies.  <H5>  Majles Notes </H5>   The minister of energy said in an interview with RESALAT's  parliamentary correspondent:    The electrical power distribution companies were  nongovernment at first. Now 26 electrical power distribution  companies have been formed throughout the country and are  managed by the private sector. After privatization the  efficiency of these companies increased.    Continuing, he discussed economizing on electrical power  consumption. He said: The Ministry of Commerce must be given the  authority to control the labor hours of guilds in view of the  nature of the work, as is done in other countries, because it is  not necessary for some guilds to remain at the work site until  late at night.    The minister of energy said: In studying rate increases, the  Majles should make policy in such a way that those who consume  less will have more subsidies and exemptions.    In conclusion, he said: The government pays a total of about  540 billion tomans per year in subsidies.</p>

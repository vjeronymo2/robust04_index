			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ukrainian RUKH [Ukrainian Peoples Movement for  Perestroyka] supports the idea of introduction of the state of  emergency in Crimea, RUKh leader Vyacheslav Chernovil told  Interfax-Ukraine today. He emphasized that the RUKH definitely  stood for restoration of lawfulness and preservation of the  territorial integrity of Ukraine. He suggested that Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk must assume control over the Crimean  power structures rather than be waiting.    Ukrainian Peasant Party leader Sergey Dovgan announced to  Interfax-Ukraine that a Ukrainian parliamentary delegation had  left for Crimea. "We hope they will manage to persuade Crimean  deputies to make more weighed decisions," he said.    The Agrarian parliamentary faction speaks in favor of talks  on Crimean issue, Dovgan stressed. However, he added that these  issues must be resolved on the basis of the Ukrainian  constitution.    A leader of the UNA-UNSO (the Ukrainian National Assembly --  the Ukrainian National Self-Defense) ultra-nationalist  organization Oleg Vitovich told Interfax he gave his complete  backing to representatives of the Ukrainian organizations  picketing the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet and demanding to annul  the autonomy of Crimea.    Vitovich suggested that the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet must  assess the activities of the president and the former  composition of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet which had led to the  present situation in the Ukrainian-Crimean relations. He  believes that the Crimean problems should be solved in Crimea  rather than in Kiev.</p>

			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNCLAIMED BOXES: GOING, GOING, SOLD  </P> <P> The contents of safe deposit boxes left dormant for five years got new life  Monday, when they were sold at a state-run auction presided over by State  Controller Gray Davis.  </P> <P> The highlight of the auction, held in West Hollywood, came early in the  proceedings when Beverly Hills art dealer Louis Stern plunked down $2,500 for a  baseball autographed by Babe Ruth. He hopes to sell it to a Tokyo real estate  magnate who is creating a baseball museum.  </P> <P> The ball was one of 1,200 lots for sale. Other items included an autographed  picture of the Beatles (which went for $80), coins, jewelry and trinkets. The  total appraised value of the lots was $150,000. Information on the total amount  raised was not immediately available.  </P> <P> After trying to locate box owners through Social Security and driver's license  records and by taking out newspaper advertisements for at least a year, the  contents of the boxes were put on sale, he said.  </P> <P> "Sale proceeds for each item will be held for the rightful owners or their  heirs," Davis said. Until claimed, the money is invested and held in the  state's General Fund.  </P> <P> Through periodic auctions, the controller's office hopes to bring attention to  the approximately $520 million in unclaimed property and assets that the state  currently holds, Davis said.  </P> <P> "One out of every seven people living in the state have something owed to them  by our office. The odds are much better than winning at Lotto."  </P> <P> For information about unclaimed property, call 800-992-4647. JOHN H. LEE  </P></p>

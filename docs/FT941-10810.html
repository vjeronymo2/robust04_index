			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Howard abolishes committal court hearings Magistrates' court committal hearings at which prosecution evidence is reviewed to see if a case is strong enough to go to trial at the Crown Court, are to be abolished, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, announced yesterday. The hearings, most of which are a formality, are to be replaced by an administrative procedure which would save money, reduce stress on victims and witnesses and cut delays in bringing cases to trial, he said. A clause inserted into the Criminal Justice and Public Order bill will still allow for the defence to argue there is no case to answer. This argument will be put to magistrates in writing. The defence will also be able to apply for an oral hearing, but not to call witnesses. The change will affect about 9,000 full committal hearings a year at which witnesses give evidence, and a further 120,000 'paper' committals at which magistrates commit defendants for trial solely on the basis of written statements. Responding to a parliamentary question from Sir Ivan Lawrence, chairman of the home affairs select committee, Mr Howard said: 'These changes will reduce the pressure on vulnerable witnesses by ensuring they will no longer be at risk of having to give evidence twice. 'They will also produce significant savings in court time and costs.' The proposal, which follows procedural changes in fraud cases and hearings involving evidence from children, will apply to all charges to be tried at the Crown Court. The change was recommended by the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice which reported last July. The commission concluded that the present system served no useful purpose. Defendants should still be able to make a submission of no case to answer, the commission said, but witnesses should not be called and thereby made to give their evidence twice over.</p>

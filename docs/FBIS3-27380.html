The  meeting set forth that in 1994 the institutions of higher  learning should emancipate the mind, firmly grasp favorable  opportunities, accelerate the pace of reform, make positive  development, and maintain stability. This year, the  institutions of higher learning in the municipality should  comprehensively carry out reform; make a breakthrough in  cooperatively running schools, developing higher vocational and  technical education, reforming the enrollment and employment  systems, and socializing the reserve service work; and further  strengthen and improve party building and the ideological and  political work.    Li Lanqing, vice premier of the State Council, was present  at  the meeting. He extended Spring Festival greetings to all  teaching and administrative staff members of the institutions of  higher learning in the municipality. He said: The Beijing  Municipal party committee and government have paid high  attention to the educational work and have also completed a lot  of concrete deeds. I express my heartfelt thanks to them. In  regard to the development of moral education, he said that we  should strengthen the reform and improvement of the classes on  Marxist theory and particularly study Comrade Mao Zedong's  several philosophic works and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is  necessary to strengthen education on patriotism, socialism,  collectivism, modern history, and contemporary history. In the  course of conducting education on the national situation, we  should stress education on the current situation. It is  necessary to conduct education on the traditional virtues of  China, moral education, and education on the legal system.    Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party committee,  stressed that the institutions of higher learning should  strengthen party building and ideological and political work.  He said: Institutions of higher learning should rely on the  leadership of the party to achieve their work. Only when party  building is strengthened will we be able to strengthen the work  of teachers and students and to overcome the situation of firmly  grasping one aspect while neglecting the other. Although the  construction of spiritual civilization is strengthened, we have  not done enough in this regard. It is dangerous if we do not  continue to strengthen the construction of spiritual  civilization. We should particularly strengthen the leadership  of the party. Universities and colleges should strengthen the  construction of the leading bodies at various levels and  ideological and theoretical work. We will possibly come across  many difficulties in the course of strengthening party building  and ideological and political work. The municipal party  committee and the municipal government will continue to award  the institutions of higher learning advanced in party building  and ideological and political work and continue to help  institutions of higher learning eliminate difficulties. Chen  Xitong also extend festive greetings to the teaching and  administrative staff of the institutions of higher learning in  the municipality.

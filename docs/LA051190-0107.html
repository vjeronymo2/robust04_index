			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> PEACE CORPS TO SEND TEACHER TO HUNGARY  </P> <P> When Barbara Meehan volunteered for the Peace Corps, she was bracing herself  for stick huts without running water.  </P> <P> But as she embarks on her two-year stint this summer, Meehan will make history  by joining the Peace Corps' first mission to the Eastern Bloc.  </P> <P> Democratic uprisings have landed her a job teaching English in Hungary.  </P> <P> Although the conditions in Central Europe may not be as backward as in other  host countries, the challenges will be just as great, Meehan said. "The  Hungarians are highly educated," she said. "I'll be under a lot of pressure to  meet their high standards."  </P> <P> For the first time in the Peace Corps' 28-year history, volunteers are  venturing into Hungary and Poland to teach English. International talks are  under way to send volunteers to East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, said  Peace Corps spokeswoman Paula Kuzmich.  </P> <P> "We are following the path of democracy around the world," Kuzmich said.  </P> <P> The Peace Corps selected Meehan to join the first 120 volunteers to represent  the United States in these countries. Meehan spent two summers teaching English  to Japanese students studying in Ojai.  </P> <P> With a degree in English and another one in journalism on the way, the Peace  Corps considers her well qualified for the job. Meehan initially expected to  work as a volunteer in North Africa or the Philippines.  </P> <P> To prepare herself, she studied French, the tongue of many North African  countries, and sign language, so she could work with deaf Filipino children.  </P> <P> "I've lived in Ventura for 20 years and I just thought it was time to do  something else," said the 38-year-old substitute teacher for Rio Elementary  School District in Oxnard. "I wanted to do something where I could immerge  myself in a culture and really be with the people." CAROLYN KUSKY  </P></p>

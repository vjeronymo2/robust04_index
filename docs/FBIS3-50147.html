			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lindsay French, spokeswoman for the British UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Forces] units, told HINA [Croatian Press Agency]  this afternoon that the British had no connection with and were  not responsible for a case containing ammunition and weapons  found today aboard the Sir Geraint by Split customs officials  during their routine inspection of cargo transported on this  ship from Trieste yesterday. This cargo belongs to the Nordic  battalion. They hired our ship to transport cargo from Trieste  to Split. This is also involves a mistake in paperwork.  UNPROFOR has admitted to this mistake and apologized for it,  said the spokeswoman for the British UN Command stationed in  Divulje near Split.</p>

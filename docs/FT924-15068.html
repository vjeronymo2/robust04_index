			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Mexican glee at Clinton's Nafta stance - Salinas believes the cloud over the free trade pact has been lifted IF THERE is an unusual flourish today in the signature of Mexican President Carlos Salinas as he initials the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) in San Antonio, Texas, do not be surprised: he and his government again appear convinced passage of the pact is inevitable. The optimism has nothing to do with the high-profile initialling, into which Mr Salinas and Canada's Prime Minister Brian Mulroney have been dragged in an effort to boost US President George Bush's flagging election chances. The cause for celebration is the decision by Governor Bill Clinton, the front-running challenger to Mr Bush, broadly to endorse the agreement and not demand its re-negotiation if he is elected president. While Mr Clinton, the Democratic candidate, has said that an acceptable agreement should toughen Mexico's environmental and labour standards, he has also said this could be achieved through parallel accords. The treaty itself could stay intact. Mr Clinton recently made three flattering references to Mexico, including the statement that he had never known in Mexico a leadership as good as President Salinas's. 'The three references by Mr Clinton show the great affinity between him and the Mexican government,' a Mexican official said. 'We do not believe there will be a great change of attitude in the US (to Mexico) if Clinton wins the election.' President Salinas can barely conceal his glee at the prospect of four more years of excellent US-Mexican relations, a key not just to Nafta, but to investor confidence in Mexico. On Monday, he told a group of treaty advisers: 'It appears to me important that Governor Clinton has pronounced in favour of Nafta, which shows his interest in an economic relationship between the US and Mexico that will benefit both nations. 'Now it can be confirmed the two most important political forces of the US agree in the convenience of having the treaty.' The official said there should be no difficulty reaching the necessary parallel accords with Mr Clinton: 'The government (of Mexico) shares the worries over the environment that Clinton has. I have the impression that many of the worries are addressed in the treaty, but there is a disposition to reach new parallel accords with the US, with or without the treaty.' Mr Bush's campaign managers, in an effort to keep up pressure on the challenger, have said that Mr Clinton can either be for or against the treaty, but cannot be on both sides. The Mexican government evidently feels differently. The Mexican official reckons that the Clinton endorsement does not just remove an 'obstacle' but, 'even more, with this signal, makes the ratification more likely' in the US Congress. Mr Richard Gephardt, majority leader in the House of Representatives, supports Mr Clinton's remarks, backing away from earlier demands that the treaty be re-negotiated. Mexico's stock market seemed to share the government's initial enthusiasm, rising by 4.65 per cent on Monday, the largest one-day gain this year. Mr Felix Bonni, head of research of the brokerage Interacciones, says: 'My position has always been that Clinton is better for Mexico than Bush. The chances of passing Nafta in the Congress are greater, while economic growth in the US will be higher.' Such comments, heretical a few weeks ago, are now almost conventional wisdom. Mr Salinas had been savagely attacked in the independent Mexican press for throwing all his eggs into Mr Bush's basket and acceding to his every wish. Many prophesied doom for Mr Salinas and Mexico were Mr Bush to lose. Mr Adolfo Aguilar, a columnist and academic, captured the spirit of the criticism when he wrote in El Financiero a week ago that 'the presidential victory of the Democrats will bring about changes in three fundamental aspects. 'First, there will be the adverse and possibly devastating psychological impact on investors and savers who depend of the financial stability of the Salinas plan; second, now explicit, will be the re-opening of the renegotiation of Nafta ..and, third, a foreseeable revision of the complacent attitude of the government of the US with respect to the abuses of political power, human rights, electoral fraud, and lack of democracy in Mexico.' Some of this is still likely to happen and will depend greatly on who would run Mexican policy from a Clinton White House. Ms Cathryn Thorup, director of studies for the Mexican-US programme at San Diego University, says: 'The agenda for the relationship under the Democrats is likely to be different and broader. A Democratic president would likely pay more attention to immigration, human rights and democracy. George Bush would continue emphasising economic integration.' Mr Clinton might take his time asking Congress to sign the treaty, or make impossibly difficult demands on the Mexicans to change environmental and labour provisions. He may press Mexico to 'perfect' its democracy faster than it would like. But he is unlikely, say analysts, to upset radically the excellent relations established by Mr Bush.</p>

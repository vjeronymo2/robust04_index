			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Scottish Hydro In theory, Scottish Hydro-Electric has several natural advantages. Its hydroelectric power is cheap. Unlike the English generators it is not obliged to pass on the benefits of low-cost coal. In other respects prices are more tightly regulated in its home market than those of the English RECs. So it is not surprising that exports of electricity to England and Wales jumped by 58 per cent to Pounds 117m last year. But it would be mistaken to read too much into the future from this, even if it was the chief factor behind the 35 per cent increase in pro-forma pre-tax profits. The risk in depending for growth on exports to England and Wales is not only that the pool price at which such exports are priced can fluctuate widely. It is also that any eventual deal between British Coal and the English generators will almost certainly lead to lower power prices south of the border, reducing the margin that Hydro can earn. Scottish Power, which has concentrated on sales to Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man, may be on to a better thing, besides having its venture into telecommunications. It all makes the 8 per cent premium on Hydro's partly-paid share price over that of its Scottish rival look a trifle excessive.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: Olivetti shares slide as trading starts again SHARES in Olivetti, the Italian computers group, dropped by 17.1 per cent yesterday in response to Monday's announcement of a L903bn capital increase and losses of about L650bn (Dollars 404m) for 1992. Olivetti's ordinary stock slid to L1,825 after the suspension in trading, imposed on Monday morning, was lifted, against L2,202 at Friday's close. The sharp fall reflected brokers' reaction to the highly dilutive rights issue and the poor outlook for the company in the short term. Mr Corrado Passera, joint managing director, described the fall as 'an automatic event' in the case of a deeply-discounted rights issue. He said the true measure of the transaction's success would be the price at which the shares eventually settle. Shareholders will be offered six new ordinary shares, priced at a nominal L1,000 each, for every four shares, of whatever category, currently held. Alternatively, they may subscribe to at least half their rights in the form of new shares and the remainder in new six-year convertible bonds, which will be interchangeable with the new shares and pay interest of between 6 per cent and 8 per cent. The deal received a hostile reaction from most brokers, who criticised the deep discount and dilution. 'It's not often you get a rights issue where shareholders are offered more shares than they already have,' said one. The transaction has been accompanied by preliminary results from CIR, the listed holding company controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, which in turn controls Olivetti, and by Mr De Benedetti's Cofide holding company. CIR made a preliminary loss of L540bn in 1992, against a net profit of L49bn the previous year. Around L450bn of the loss stems from extraordinary factors linked to the difficulties at Olivetti and the need for one-off provisions at Cerus, the French holding company controlled by CIR. The special provisions have been chiefly triggered by credit problems at Banque Dumenil Leble in France, particularly as regards lending to the depressed property sector. At parent company level, CIR's loss rose to L680bn from L469bn in 1991. CIR's net debt surged to about L440bn from L41bn due to the effects of its losses, the increased lira value of foreign currency borrowing, and changes in the items consolidated in the group's accounts. The group said almost all its subsidiaries, which include Valeo, the French car components concern, the Italian Sasib engineering group and the Espresso/Repubblica publisher, were expected to report improved results for 1992. Separately, Cofide said it expected to make a net loss of about L290bn in 1992, against net earnings of L41bn the previous year. The company is to make a L112.7bn rights issue of new ordinary shares, priced at L1,000 each.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Gennadiy Charodeyev report: "Riga Has Allowed Moscow To </F> Keep Its Radar Station at Skrunda"]    [Text] The latest round of talks which has ended between  Russian and Latvian state delegations has resulted in a package  of documents which has been prepared for signing, concerning the  Russian troop withdrawal from Latvian territory.    Answering questions from IZVESTIYA's correspondent,  Ambassador Sergey Zotov, leader of the Russian delegation,  recalled that in 1993 we withdrew our troops from Lithuania  without a corresponding treaty being drawn up. Our Latvian and  Estonian partners in talks were tempted to follow that option.  But they forget that at the time Vilnius farsightedly accepted  Moscow's terms, which provided for guarantees for the rights of  the Russian-speaking population to be observed.    For a long time the Russian diplomats' efforts consisted in  convincing the Latvian side of the hopelessness of such an  approach and making efforts to lead the talks out of the impasse  in which they found themselves. Moscow and Riga wasted several  months on this. According to Sergey Zotov, however, significant  progress became apparent in the talks in January.    Today a start has been made on the legal-treaty formulation  of not only the Russian troop withdrawal but also the agreements  concerning social protection for servicemen and military  pensioners in Latvia, the legal status of a Russian strategic  installation -- the radar station in the city of Skrunda -- and  the conditions of its operation.    With regard to the radar station's period of existence, the  Russian diplomat pointed out that the Skrunda station will  function for four more years. In addition, S. Zotov reported,  an additional 18 months are allocated for dismantling it.  Naturally, these periods have to be confirmed by the  governments of Latvia and Russia, but Moscow considers this a  reasonable compromise.    "Thus," the Russian ambassador concluded, "we will be left  with small technical questions, and after resolving them in the  very near future we plan to open up the way to completing all  the work on a package of agreements, so as to submit it to the  two countries' governments for signing."    Sergey Zotov expressed the assumption that the Russian  Government will receive the agreements elaborated in the talks  for approval by the end of February.</p>

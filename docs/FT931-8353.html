			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Gold Greenlees calls for Pounds 15m - Proceeds of rights issue will be used to fund acquisitions GOLD GREENLEES Trott, the marketing services group, is raising about Pounds 14.7m net in a rights issue to fund acquisitions. The 1-for-3 issue of up to 6.49m shares is priced at 235p. The shares shed 12p yesterday to close at 288p. Proceeds of the rights, a rarity in the depressed advertising sector, are to be used for acquisitions planned in the next six to nine months. Before allowing for the issue, net debt was forecast to be about Pounds 14m by the April year-end. GGT has negative net assets. Analysts believe the company is looking to acquire small agencies with a European focus, either as subsidiaries or partners, in a move to balance its growing activities in the US. At Pounds 4.5m, GGT's pre-tax profits forecast for this year would be Pounds 900,000 up on last year (excluding exceptional prof-its), but well below 1990's Pounds 7.68m. Last year's total dividend was 8.3p, with earnings per share of 17.28p. The company's dividend forecast for this year is also 8.3p. The rights issue is GGT's first for five years. It used its 1988 call to buy Martin-Williams, a Minneapolis agency, as part of an expansion strategy in the US Midwest and south-west. US earnings last year accounted for half of GGT's gross profits. Among its clients are Coca-Cola, Red Rock cider, Holsten Pils and Cadbury Schweppes. Mr Michael Greenlees, chairman, said: 'Unlike Saatchi's and WPP, we have not gone in for five-year earn-outs, but have paid for purchases over 18 months or less. I want to continue on that basis.' Mr Vignesh Padiachy, media analyst at BZW, said the issue was likely to be well supported by shareholders. 'GGT is performing strongly in the US - with margins of 20 per cent against a sector average of 8 per cent - and there is plenty of recovery potential in the UK.' Mr Greenlees said he saw 'considerable room for growth' in existing businesses, not least GGT's non-advertising (mainly marketing) activities in the UK, which last year accounted for nearly half of total UK earnings. The rights issue has been fully underwritten by Kleinwort Benson.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jayme Brener and Helio Contreiras] </F>   [Text] Under the rules of an old sea dog, a captain goes  down with his ship. What the rules do not state, but which is  taken for granted, is that before sacrificing himself he should  do everything possible to save the ship. By the same logic,  generals should try to prevent their tanks and troops from  getting stuck in the mud. This was the reason behind the attempt  by Imbel, the Army War Material Industry, to use whatever means  were necessary to save Engesa [Specialized Engineers, Inc.] --  which has built 90 percent of the Army tanks and armored  vehicles -- after it requested a meeting with its creditors in  1990 and went broke in October 1993. Imbel played the role of  government trustee in Engesa until the latter went broke. A  memorable moment in this episode was when entrepreneur Daniel  Birman, of the Arbi group, was asked to invest no less than $7.2  million, without any guarantee, in Engequimica [expansion  unknown], a subsidiary of Engesa. The money was transferred on  20 March 1992. Part of it -- some $2.6 million -- was used to  soften up Elizier Trindade, the supervisor of Engesa's call for  a meeting with its creditors. Everything seems to indicate that  the operation sought to delay the bankruptcy, thus facilitating  the enterprise's survival and possible sale. Trindade's  preventive detention was ordered on charges of passive  corruption, but he fled.    But why did a big entrepreneur like Birman cough up so much  money without guarantees and without knowing what it was to be  used for? "We want to buy Engequimica someday, and the $7.2.  million was an advance on the increase of capital, which will be  accounted for during the first shareholders' meeting," Arbi  group director Haroldo Zago said. One of the enterprises of the  group, the Brazilian Ammunition Company (CBC), produces  gunpowder. Control over Engequimica would have given Birman an  outstanding position on the market, at a good price. ISTOE  learned that Birman also expected to conclude an agreement for  buying part of Imbel's ammunition factory in Piquete. The Arbi  group would thus have almost a monopoly on the gunpowder and  ammunition production in Brazil. How could one deny a request  from Imbel, which is Birman's partner in CBC and in the DF  Vasconcellos enterprise, and a privileged consumer of its  products? With this idea in mind, Birman provided the money  through Spem, which is one of his enterprises. A few days  later, the $7.2 million left Engequimica, which had not asked  for a creditors meeting, and went to Engesa, which was its  creditor. One third of that money went to Elizier Trindade on  the day he arranged a new postponement of the bankruptcy.  Trindade divided the money: some for his brother-in-law Jose  Carlos da Silva, and some for increasing his Bradesco [Brazilian  Discount Bank] account. The largest part of the money went to  an account in Codelsur [expansion unknown] -- a Uruguayan  financial agency -- through the Rio de Janeiro Cash Bank,  apparently without telling Brazilian fiscal authorities. The  courts suspect the money that Imbel sought from Birman is  comfortably lodged in an account of Trindade in the Uruguayan  fiscal paradise. Anything was considered justifiable to save  Engesa. Daniel Birman refrained from making any claim, even  though no shareholders meeting was held after the money was  deposited. Birman, who lost both the money and Engequimica,  spoke after the enterprise went bankrupt last year and is now  trying to be recognized as one of its creditors.    If Imbel asked Birman for multi-million dollar help, who was  responsible for softening up the supervisor of Engesa's call for  a meeting with its creditors? Engesa's owners Jose Luiz and  Jose Guilherme Whitaker, who have exported weapons worth $2.6  billion to 28 countries, swear that Imbel's intervention in  their enterprise has put them out of the competitive market.  The checks that went to Trindade bear the signature of Engesa  attorney Marco Aurelio Montenegro and Imbel attorney Jose Carlos  da Silva, who have already been charged with having received  stolen goods and their properties have been embargoed. The  checks were also "agreed to" by Colonel Lucio Pereira, the then  vice president of Imbel, who is responsible for Engesa's  intervention. Questioned by ISTOE reporters, Pereira declined  to comment "to avoid hindering the investigations." Attorney  Heloisa Maluff, of the first chamber of Barueri (Sao Paulo),  said: "We have already asked for the lifting of the bank secrecy  on the accounts of more than 30 people, among them several  military men, to help conclude the investigation." This chamber  is adjudicating Engesa's bankruptcy.    The Imbel-Birman-Engequimica-Elizier Trindade case is just  another affair in the nebulous relationship between Engesa and  the Brazilian Army. This relationship was so close that in 1982  it led President Joao Baptista Figueiredo to nominate Jose Luiz  Whitaker -- the head of Engesa -- for president of the state-run  company Imbel. "Engesa benefited from that," retired General  Arnaldo Calderari has said. Calderari, a former Imbel  president, resigned in protest over Whitaker's nomination. "Yet  instead of growing -- because it used Imbel's market -- Engesa  plunged into a crisis," Calderari concluded. The crisis was the  factor that made the relationship between the Army and Engesa  even more unusual.    Imbel was willing to nationalize Engesa in 1989 to  guarantee its armored vehicle supplies and to avoid losing the  important know-how that had been developed. Carlos Tinoco, the  then Army Minister, vetoed the operation during [former  President] Fernando Collor's administration. Pedro Paulo Leoni  Ramos, known as PP, who at that time was strategic affairs  secretary, made a new proposal with the support of the Army War  Materiel Department (DMB). Imbel would intervene Engesa and  would pay its debts -- which totaled hundreds of millions of  dollars -- paving the way for privatization. [as published].    The intervention occurred in 1990. Considering it was not  even a state enterprise, the team that was created around PP and  General Armando Paiva Chaves, the then DMB chief, sought to  arrange the sale without an auction. The first step was to  reschedule the debts. Thanks to Colonel Lucio Pereira's efforts,  almost all the creditors -- the biggest creditors were the Banco  do Brasil and the BNDES [National Bank for Economic and Social  Development] -- agreed to modify the established payment  deadlines. Other creditors, like Jose Bizerra Lins, the owner  of the Pecunia travel agency in Sao Paulo, agreed to collect  only 10 percent of the debt and to negotiate the rest later.  Engesa owed $60,000 to Bezerra Lins for the purchase -- a few  days before the creditors were called to their meeting -- of  several first-class tickets from Malaysia to Brazil. The tickets  were a present to a group of Malaysian generals interested in  Engesa's armored vehicles.    The Baureri court believes the creditors who agreed to this  "arrangement" within the creditors' meeting will not receive a  single extra cent because the Bankruptcy Law states that  creditors cannot partially relinquish their rights over amounts  that are owed to them. This means a loss for the Banco do  Brasil and for the BNDES, which in turn means a loss for  consumers. It is a big loss because the two banks accounted for  almost 80 percent of Engesa's debt, which is today estimated at  more than $500 million. To keep Engesa afloat, the state  advanced $100 million as an advance payment on the purchase of  more than 1,000 armored vehicles, which have not yet left the  drawing board: Yet another loss.    After rescheduling the debt it was decided to orient the  privatization toward creating a joint venture [preceding two  words in English] with a big multinational company of the  military sector, a powerful Brazilian private group, and Imbel,  which would thus preserve its interests and the technology of  the Urutu, Cascavel, and Jararaca vehicles. The path chosen was  via the recently created SAO -- South American Ordnance -- which  comprises Imbel, the Royal Ordnance (a subsidiary of British  Aerospace, one of the world's military giants), and, with 2  percent of the shares, Daniel Birman's Arbi group. The initial  objective of SAO was to produce ammunition but the Engesa deal  seemed excellent because there would be no competition for the  purchase, and the British enterprise might manufacture in Latin  America, among other things, its famous Rover jeeps.    Gen. Paiva Chaves, retired, has said: "Our only objective  was  to save a strategic enterprise, of major significance for the  Armed Forces, and to recuperate the Brazilian image abroad."  Imbel president Paiva Chaves has always enthusiastically  advocated cooperation with Royal Ordnance. He added: "We were  not interested in private groups, no matter whom." A High  Command officer has said: "For the British, it will be a fine  deal. They can use Imbel for minor work, while opening new  doors through Imbel contacts with the Army." Considering that  business does not feed on good intentions, the transfer of  Engesa collided with a large green barrier; not of military men  but of dollar bills. The British enterprise demands sound  Brazilian entrepreneurial engagement and a guarantee that the  government will support the new weapons manufacturer. This is  difficult at a time of tight budgets.    The SAO alternative became permanently stuck following  President Collor's resignation and the change in command at  Planalto Palace. Daniel Birman left the South America Company  and was replaced by the Schahyn Cury group, now with 33 percent  of the shares. Gen. Paiva Chaves dreamily said: "The  participation of such a large national company would have awoken  Royal Ordnance's interest and ensure its participation in  Engesa. This is still possible." But reality shows that  business became almost impossible. There are still executives  in London who dream of setting foot -- or a tank track -- on a  tropical shore. In view of its financial problems, however,  Royal Ordnance had to sell the Rover Company to the German BMW  group. This group was involved in a mega-corruption scandal  when it sold materiel to the Malaysian Government.    What can be done to save Engesa and the Brazilian Army  armored vehicle industry? When the SAO option began to fail,  Imbel also began to tumble. The first maneuver, which was  reported by ISTOE in 1993, involved the curious expropriation of  project facilities and the Sao Jose dos Campos plant, Engesa's  most valuable asset. This expropriation has yet to be signed by  President Itamar Franco. It also called for the auctioning of  the remaining facilities in Barueri and Salvador to pay the  labor debt that currently totals $50 million (Engesa failed to  deposit its employees' Severance Payment in 1987). The maneuver  got stuck because the courts informed Imbel that, if the  expropriation really occurred, an audit would be ordered and the  corresponding indemnification would be demanded. The Army,  however, does not have money to pay an indemnification.    The second "all ends are justifiable" maneuver involved the  alleged sale of Engesa to entrepreneur Wilson "Cito" Mendes  Caldeira, which was also to have taken place last year. Mendes  Caldeira agreed to assume the debts as long as they did not  surpass $350 million. He contracted auditing services, spent  $500,000, and then realized he was about to do something  foolish. At the time, it was rumored there never had been a  Mendes Caldeira option: it had only been a trick to delay  bankruptcy. The company went broke in October 1993. Engesa,  the most important symbol of the national materiel industry,  went bankrupt because no one, not even Mendes Caldeira,  deposited the paltry $250,000 the company owed the National  Credit Bank.    All possible Imbel maneuvers to save Engesa seem to be have  been exhausted. A study by the Armed Forces High Command  concluded that the best alternative is to privatize the materiel  industry. What large group, however, is interested in Engesa?  The armored vehicles project -- except that of the Ogum and  Osorio, which are the company's main hope -- belong to the  government. The courts are thoroughly checking on assets in  store and two years may pass before a definitive auction can be  held. Meanwhile, the Urutu and Cascavel tanks of the Brazilian  Army and of two other dozen countries are rusting away. A  colonel stationed at the central Army barracks in Brasilia said:  "Unless a solution to the Engesa problem can be immediately  found, Gen. Paiva Chaves will be in a very uncomfortable  situation." The irony of the problem, however, is that if the  courts establish that the creditors who have signed agreements  with Imbel will not receive a single penny, not even a single  screw, Engesa will reach auction day without debts. It is also  true, however, that it will reach auction day without its vital  sap, which has been consumed by years of looting and rusting.  And that is the dismal end of the "all ends are justifiable"  operation.</p>

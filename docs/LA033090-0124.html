			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> NHI Nelson Holdings International: The entertainment and vending company posted  $4.5 million in net income for 1989, compared to a year-earlier loss of $9.4  million, as the firm's film division scored gains from its various distribution  rights to "When Harry Met Sally," "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" and  "Prancer."  </P> <P> Revenue for the year rose 8% to $108.6 million. Fourth-quarter net was $2.9  million, compared to a year-earlier loss of $5.8 million. Toronto, Canada-based  Nelson's videocassette operation was hurt in 1988 by a virtual collapse of the  market for low-budget films, to which the company was heavily committed at the  time.  </P> <P> Tables, D6  </P></p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Arts: Today's Television It would be as well if you were interested in American life and culture, because they are the subjects of all the more promising programmes tonight. States Of Mind has been a short but fascinating series of documentaries almost beyond categorisation, each showing what it is like to live and think in some small American community. The last in the series (8.10 BBC2) looks at Shoshone, Idaho, full of elderly people, who faced an intense drought at the time of the Gulf War. Channel 4's series about rock &amp; roll legends, Mojo Working (11.05) features Janis Joplin. The billing calls her 'the greatest white blues singer of the Sixties' which is a bit mean since she was one of the greatest blues singers of all time, of any colour. Included here is the best number she ever performed with Big Brother And The Holding Company, 'Ball And Chain'. At 11.55 ITV repeats the classic western, Shane with Alan Ladd as the reluctant gun fighter who has to take up his revolver again to protect the homesteaders against the villainous ranchers, a textbook example of the western myth. It ends just in time to switch over to BBC2 to catch David Dimbleby's report on The Road To The White House (2.00 am). Christopher Dunkley</p>

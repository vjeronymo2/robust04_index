			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: MacMillan Bloedel posts record loss of CDollars 93.4m MACMILLAN Bloedel (Macblo), the Canadian west coast forestry group, has warned that further belt-tightening measures will be needed following a record loss last year. The Vancouver-based company suffered a loss of CDollars 93.4m (USDollars 79.8m), or 98 cents a share, in 1991 compared with 1990 earnings of CDollars 50.8m, or 37 cents. Sales dropped to CDollars 2.73bn from CDollars 3bn. Prices for all key products, except lumber, fell last year. Earnings were also hit by the strong Canadian dollar. The group's pulp mills operated at 76 per cent of capacity and newsprint mills at 72 per cent. The loss from the group's North American operations was substantially higher than the bottom-line figure. Koninklijke Nederlandse Papierfabrieken, the Dutch fine paper and paperboard maker in which MacMillan Bloedel has a 30 per cent stake, contributed CDollars 47.5m to net equity earnings. Net equity earnings from all of the group's affiliates totalled CDollars 37.7m. Mr Bob Findlay, the group's chief executive, said that 'the Canadian industry and Macblo have never had a tougher year'. He warned that the company 'still faces complex problems in the next few years, the most serious of which is that the Canadian industry is no longer competitive with the US. We must face that fact and deal with it quickly.' Macblo has already announced the closure of one newsprint machine on Vancouver Island.</p>

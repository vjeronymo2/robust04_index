			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Arts: Branagh's fine support - Radio KENNETH BRANAGH'S Romeo and Juliet on Sunday, a shared production between Radio 3 and the Renaissance Theatre Company, was studious rather than theatrical. Branagh, who produced in association with Glyn Dearman, has used an almost complete text - I didn't spot more than about a dozen lines missing - and the 'two hour's traffic of our stage' ran three hours and a quarter (with two short intervals, a sensible idea). The most dramatic performances were given in supporting parts rather than in the leads. John Gielgud's Friar Lawrence was even better than one might have forecast, perfect verse-speaking blended with a three-dimensional characterisation of this amenable priest. Richard Briers, too, played a notably human Capulet, a proud, irritable father easy to agree with as his moods followed one another. The Nurse is an infallible part, yet Judi Dench made it personally inventive. It is not that the leading parts were unemotional, but they lacked the individual brio that radio acting must have. Branagh's Romeo was decently spoken, in his beautiful voice; but I bet it was more lively at the Lyric, Hammersmith. And Samantha Bond's Juliet missed the great opportunity the microphone offers; she was a moving young woman, but she was never a tearful 13-year-old. You can argue that no actress has ever played her so (nor I dare say any boy in Shakespeare's company), but it is there in the lines and recording gives the chance. The other young Veronese were a roistering bunch; Derek Jacobi gave charm to Mercutio's silly Queen Mab speech, that I would have cut if I had been directing in 1597, and the faintly dirty chat was amusingly done. There was film-type music by Patrick Doyle that filled the breaks without distraction. The performance is published at Pounds 15.99 by Random Century Audiobooks. Afternoon serials on Radio 4 are a great substitute for the Strand Magazines of other days, and this Wednesday we embarked on a new one with a fresh background, the affairs of a public school headmaster. Patrick Balfour (Steve Hodson) writes books and talks on the media besides running his school, indeed the first play (as it is headed) began with an encounter between Balfour and Brian Redhead. Perhaps he should do less, for we soon learn that his son has been caught cheating in a GCSE paper at another school where he is a boarder, while at his own, there is drug-trouble. 'They can buy it at a cafe,' says his deputy Michael, and the French teacher says there's no harm in it. As if this were not enough, Patrick's wife Judith is too busy on committees and things to be much help and he goes to his invalid son Timothy for family talk and to his publisher Lindsay Nicholson for sympathy. We do not yet have the school-feeling that other school-plays give, and the serial is clearly about the head rather than about his school - Jonathan Smith, the author, is a senior master at a public school. There are enough plots and sub-plots generously to fill four weeks. Porter's Return on Radio 3 covers five short talks by Andrew Porter, one of the founder-members of the FT arts page. He left to be music critic of the New Yorker and stayed there for 20 years, covering New York music for us as well. Much of his New Yorker criticism was collected in book form. Now he is back in this country, on another paper, and his talks compare music in London and New York. He is an observant critic and an outstandingly good speaker. The Thin Blue Line, Radio 4's survey of the United Nations, virtually stayed in New York last week ('where political decisions are supposed to be translated into action,' as presenter James Naughtie said). This week we were in Cambodia to observe that translation on the ground. A really interesting series.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kostas Venizelos] </F>   [Text] Today or tomorrow UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali will send the Security Council an official letter  praising the Turkish side. According to informed sources, the  letter will constitute a supplement (upon a Turkish request) to  the UN secretary general's latest report and will note the  progress achieved in the talks between Gustave Feissel, the UN  secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus,  and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas after 30 May. The letter  will mainly be based on a report prepared by Joe Clark, the UN  secretary general's special representative in Cyprus, following  his recent visit to the island and will be as important as an  official document. Because the events will be listed, the  clarifications and positions raised by Denktas in his meetings  with the United Nations will be given official status. Despite  Nicosia's objection, the submission of the letter will certainly  mean that the procedure is continuing.    From there the Security Council will make decisions on the  Cyprus issue. Obviously, at least behind the scenes, the  British will proceed to "marry," promote, two of the options  included in Butrus-Ghali's latest report. Reliable circles say  the British element -- having long left the initiative to the  United States -- will attempt to undertake an initiative on the  Cyprus issue.    Analyzing developments and the facts in the Cyprus issue,  the  Foreign Office believes that no move must force President  Glavkos Kliridhis to "reject" the procedure that will be  formulated. Clark already received a negative reply when he  asked the president to agree to incorporate the Vienna  agreements in the 21 March UN document. In their own interests,  as usual the British will try to find a formula that will be  accepted both by Kliridhis and Denktas.    How will they proceed? A diplomatic source noted yesterday  that according to all the signs the "five" are being oriented in  promoting a formula that will keep the confidence-building  measures on the negotiating table and at the same time begin a  long-term discussion of the Cyprus issue. The same source  mentioned that signs are being reinforced that the Security  Council believes every move is made on the basis of  Butrus-Ghali's set of ideas and the confidence-building  measures. They claim there is 90 percent agreement on the  confidence-building measures.    The Turkish side has launched a large-scale diplomatic  campaign abroad to convey the idea that Denktas accepts the  confidence-building measures. The reality is this: The  military officers, the National Security Council, recently  confirmed a decision to remain "open" on the Cyprus issue. The  orders that have been given insist that a policy be followed on  a political level to show that the Turkish side is contributing  positively to developments. This is why Denktas, who has  recently been calling on Turkey (obviously for advice), must  give "yes" and "no" answers to the mediators. The current  Turkish strategy dictates that many fronts must be kept open  with Greece.    All that is certain is that the UN Security Council will  decide on the next steps within the next few days. The  substance of the decision is known to an extent. The question  is how to express it, because it requires a positive reply from  both sides.</p>

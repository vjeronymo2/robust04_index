			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Italian banker Roberto Calvi, found hanging under a bridge in London in 1982  after his Banco Ambrosiano collapsed, did not commit suicide but was probably  murdered, Italian judges have concluded. Calvi, dubbed "God's Banker" because  of his close ties to the Vatican, disappeared a week before his death. At the  time, he was awaiting the results of his appeal of a prison sentence for  smuggling currency. The finding against suicide by a Milan civil court came as  a result of an effort by Calvi's widow, Clara, to collect on a $3-million life  insurance policy. A spokesman said the policy ruled out payment in case of  suicide.  </P></p>

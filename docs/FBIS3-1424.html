			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by AVF leader Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg at Church </F> Square in Pretoria, date not given -- recorded; passages within  slantlines in English]    [Text] The Honorable chairman, members of the Executive  Committee, members of the National Representative Council,  members of the council, representatives of member organizations  of the Volksfront National Front, and honorable fellow citizens.  This massive demonstration this morning is proof that a turning  point has been reached in the history of South Africa.  [applause] Ladies and gentlemen, this massive demonstration this  morning has shown clearly and fearlessly that we are united in  our attempt to preserve our freedom. Ladies and gentlemen --  that we are united in saying that we will not give up our right  to self-determination, that we are united in our will to  establish our own state and to govern that state. Friends, I  think what has happened here this morning demonstrates to the  world, which thinks that the Afrikaner nation has been  flattened, but it is heartening to see the Afrikaner nation  demonstrating here this morning. The people are standing up in  its quest for freedom and in its quest for self-determination in  its own state.    Sir, this is the uniting factor, which binds this nation  together today, but there is more than this. There is another  factor uniting us and this is the factor, and this is the most  important, and this is the overwhelming one, that we are not  only united in our quest for freedom, but we are united in our  courage before the king of all kings, and this brings our nation  together.    Sir, the freedom -- we have not stolen this from anyone. We  did not get this at anyone's expense. This freedom is granted  to every other nation in the world and now it is expected of the  Afrikaner nation to voluntarily give up its freedom. The answer  we give today is: It will never happen that we will give up our  freedom. [applause]    Sir, even the United Nations, the whole world recognizes the  right to self- determination of nations. In South Africa we  have nations who have self-determination -- the Swazis, the  Sothos -- in Africa we have nations with the right to  self-determination, but the Afrikaner nation, the Zulu nation,  the Tswana nation, and other nations have to be subjected  because it does not fit in with communists' plans for these  people to be free.    For this reason, Mr. Chairman, what we want to legally  protect today is something we have. We are not on a campaign to  conquer anything. We have our freedom and we are not a  conquered nation, we have self-determination. We have a  country. We are not conquering anything. We are here together  to tell the world: Here stands the Afrikaner nation, and we are  not an aggressive nation committing aggressive deeds. We are  not a nation trying to establish anarchy. We are not a nation  that has left a trail of blood behind us in this country, like  the Americans and the Australians. We built up this land with  patriotism, with love, with dedication, and sacrifice and sweat  and blood, and we are here to protect that to which we are  rightfully entitled, and not to give it up, and this we will not  allow them to take away. [applause]    Mr. Chairman, we are gathered here today to tell each other:  We are here to publicly show our united national will and to  undertake to each other that we will protect this freedom and  these rights with everything at our disposal until we die or  triumph. This we undertake to each other.    Ladies and gentlemen, the big question is -- one of the big  questions: What is the threat to this nation. What is the  threat to our nation, //and ladies and gentlemen, I would like  to deal with this threat in English, because I've got in my  possession a document of the South African Communist Party  [SACP], and it deals with Operation Sunrise, which is an  extension of Operation Vula. And in this document they say the  dangers for them, one of the dangers, which will ensure that  they do not achieve their goals -- if the agenda of the South  African Communist Party is exposed to the international  community, and therefore I challenge the press today. If you  want a communist government in South Africa, then you must  remain silent, but if you ... if you object, and if you want to  resist to a communist takeover in South Africa then you must  expose the plan of the South African Communist Party, not only  to the inhabitants of South Africa, but to the whole  international community [applause], because sir, this ... this  plan is taking place and is developing in South Africa, and in  this document it is stated. It deals with Operation Sunrise,  under the heading, yes, danger for us and that you must expose  to the world.    //Their aims: Our main objective which was and still is to  seize power. Our underground structures -- their underground  structures -- will have to deliver during this period. We must  secure a two- thirds majority. A big event just before the  elections will help greatly, perhaps similar to the death of  Hani, will do it for us. The anger that such an event will  precipitate amongst the people will serve as a powerful  stimulus, say for instance the death of Mandela. If there is  anything sinister about his death it would suit us at that stage.    //They say the South African Communist Party is firmly in  control of the ANC [African National Congress]. We secure a  leadership position in the ANC, COSATU [Congress of South  African Trade Unions], SANCO [South African National Civic  Organization], and in the Women's League and other  organizations. The ANC will in actual fact be our shadow  parliament. The ANC will be there. Their strategies: We at  the same time launch Operation Sunrise, this strategy is based  more or less on the Vula formula. Ciskei was to be a test  ground for the insurrectionists within our party. The aim was  to develop a domino effect, of partial interaction in Ciskei,  Bophuthatswana, and kwaZulu. Venda and Transkei were ours  already, and if we could manipulate events so that the other  three collapsed, it would be possible to instigate a national  insurrection.//    //It has happened. We have witnessed it. It has happened.  They said: Destroy the security force, then we embark on a  full program to weaken their security powers. Operation Hunter,  inter alia, with Operation Hunter we hope to get rid of the bad  elements in the police. That is happening in front of your eyes  -- to establish a communist state in three phases. Phase one  until after the elections, second phase will start right after  the elections. Transformation from capitalism to socialism will  take place during the second phase. Want to restruct in order  to ... [pauses] The capitalists want to reconstruct in order to  make profit. That is, of course, not our aim. We want to use  reconstruction to transform South Africa into a worker state.  Phase three, once the socialist struggle has been completed the  third and final phase will start, in order to transform our  socialist South Africa into a classless, communist state. We  cannot allow farmers to own land that belongs to the people.  The Afrikaner homeland will never be allowed.//    Sir, this is the strategy and this is the plan of the South  African Communist Party, and it is being realized in front of  your eyes, step for step, without any exception. What can we  deduce from this? This revolutionary, communist takeover is  unfolding according to plan, and now we ask the question: Why is  the government allowing this? Because, Sir, if we have this  information at our disposal then the government also has this  information at its disposal. The reason it is allowing this is  because it is a willing partner to the execution of this plan.  Sir, and I challenge the government and the state president, if  you want to be a willing partner why did you not at least inform  the people of South Africa about this plan unfolding now, one  which you must be aware of. Why did you not at least inform the  people. Sir, we see in advertisements the electorate is  supporting the ANC and the SACP, but the government has put them  in this position, enabling them to make South Africa a communist  state.    Mr. Chairman, with this plan they say a two-thirds majority  with or without violence. If they can get it without violence  then good, but Sir, to encourage protests and violence in order  to intimidate people so that they can win the election -- for  this reason there is no hope of a free and fair election in  South Africa -- no hope.    For this reason I want to tell the state president: Sir, it  is this constitution, it is this political dispensation he is  busy with, it is these revolutionaries setting South Africa  alight, and for this reason it is his duty to postpone this  election because there will not be a free and fair election in  South Africa, because there is still no solution. [applause]  There still is no solution for South Africa. Sir, there is no  solution, no dispensation which will bring peace.    Sir, I want to ask why the Goldstone Commission is not  investigating these evil plans of the South African Communist  Party. Why is it not investigating ... [pauses] Sir, in this  document it is clearly stated: //The struggle against the IFP  [Inkatha Freedom Party] in Natal and the PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] area must be intensified and it is  taking place at this very moment. It is taking place.// But Mr.  Chairman, the Goldstone Commission is not investigating this  intensification of violence in Natal. No, he is keeping himself  busy by discrediting honorable policemen, against whom no  charges were laid.    Mr. Chairman, Bophuthatswana and Ciskei have already been  destabilized. Now the charge is against kwaZulu and the  question is Sir: The Goldstone Commission was responsible for  this on two occasions -- for the destruction of the South  African Defense Force and the South African Police's top  management structure. Since 1992 a few hundred police and army  officers, ranked as Colonels and higher, have been removed from  the structures in this manner and the top structure has thus  been destabilized. For this reason Mr. Chairman, not one of  these men were ever found guilty. A legal, tested, valid  complaint has not been lodged against any of them, but these  things are happening, and the question now: Is it not time for  the Goldstone Commission to be investigated for its role in  South Africa. [applause]    Mr. Chairman, with this unfolding communist onslaught and  threat to South Africa, the time has come for each person today  to finally choose if he will resist this, if the Afrikaner  nation will rise up, or if it will allow this takeover to take  root.    For this reason, Sir, I want to say that the decision does  not only rest with every farmer, it does not only rest with  every housewife or every mother, it rests with every security  force member in South Africa, it rests with every state official  in South Africa. It is every worker in South Africa who will  have to decide if we are to be led to the slaughter in this new  South Africa, or if we will enforce our own free, rightful  homeland in South Africa.    Sir, these men who marched a short while ago are the BC  [Boer  Commando] who were formed over a long period as a result of the  suppression of the agricultural sector and as a result of the  general security threat increasing in intensity. These men will  not kneel down to communist domination and we say to these men:  We stand with you. We will, together with you, not kneel down.  These men have continually contributed to the expansion of the  security system of this country and still forms the backbone of  this system. They come from within the nation to the defense of  the entire nation and in solidarity with our people in our  cities. From Monday we will arrange for facilities to be made  available at our National Front's head office, concerning  registration of members of our nation who are prepared and  willing to join this well-disciplined organization.    Mr. Chairman, every fellow countryman has now reached a  crossroads. The choice is either freedom in the homeland or  subjection in the new South Africa. That is the choice we have,  Sir, and I say everyone must choose because one must ask the  question, what is the fate of the policeman, the soldier, the  civil servant, the worker, the farmer, the entrepreneur in the  new South Africa? Mrs. Winnie Mandela said last week at  Virginia: //The ANC will give priority to its supporters when it  provides jobs after the April election. We will prioritize for  our comrades. We are going to provide employment for all of  you, starting with the comrades who served in prison for our  (?cause).// Starting with the comrades, Sir, that is the  situation facing our people, our workers. Not merit, not  dedication, not skill, but //comrades who served in prisons in  the cause of the South African Communist Party.//    Let me show you how this has been applied in Zimbabwe. In  Zimbabwe there are now 26 permanent secretaries who are heads of  departments. There are no whites among them. There are 73  deputy secretaries, 3 of them whites. There are 147 under  secretaries, with only 11 whites. Twenty-four ambassadors, not  one of them white.    Job security, pensions... If there are people in South  Africa today who ought to be concerned about their pensions, it  is the civil servants. If there are people who have the right  to demand the payment of their pensions -- and an ANC-SACP  government has promised that they will use the pension funds for  job creation -- then it is our people, those who will be losing  their jobs, whose pensions will be used. They have the right to  demand that their pensions be paid out.    Mr. Chairman, double standards are being applied. Our people  who are in prison are not granted amnesty, but APLA [Azanian  People's Liberation Army] and MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of  the Nation; ANC military wing] members who are responsible for  murder and terrorism, who are destabilizing Natal against the  IFP and others, they are granted amnesty.    So, we say the Afrikaner nation is demanding that their  people be granted amnesty, and that they be either charged or  released.    Mr. Chairman, we choose the path of freedom in a homeland.  We are not taking anything from anyone. We have had the lion's  share in the building of this country, and we will not establish  our homeland through anarchy. We have never been the aggressor,  but we will defend our freedom and all that is justly ours.  Sir, we prefer that the solution in South Africa be a peaceful  one, but we will not allow ourselves to be forced into surrender  by violence.    The Afrikaner has not lived selfishly in this country. We  control the production of food. The civil service cannot  function without the Afrikaner Boer nation. The factories and  the mines cannot function without the Afrikaner Boer nation.  The security forces cannot function without the Afrikaner Boer  nation. So we demand that we be accommodated. We will not be  satisfied with anything less than our rightful freedom and  self-determination. If we are not accommodated, if we are  pressured, we will not be the ones responsible for the chaos  which will ensue. It will be those who are pressuring us. We  will never bow to the communists.    Mr. Chairman, we have established our representative council  to plan, coordinate, and act on behalf of our people. We are in  the process of creating civic councils. These comprise one  council with serving councillors elected by our people, and in  areas where we do not have representation other people will be  appointed. Their task will be to attend to the safety of our  people because we are aware of the domino effect. First it was  Bophuthatswana, then Ciskei, now it is kwaZulu's turn. The  Afrikaner nation is next to be forced into submission through  violence. So it will be the task of the civic councils to  defend our people, to ensure that our taxes are used for the  benefit of our people. If voters have problems, these must be  attended to. Pressure must be exercised on the National Party  and other councils to see that they act in the interests of the  voters, and to set up civic councils in every town. A number of  these councils are present here today -- Pretoria,  Bronkhorstspruit, Brits, Breyten, Akasia, Verwoerdburg,  Hartbeespoort, and others.    Our next task has to do with the voice of our people, Radio  Pretoria. I ask you, do you accept responsibility for the voice  of our people? Do you accept responsibility for its  maintenance? Do you demand that that voice be heard? What is  the answer? Do you demand it? It has been established with our  money, with our skills. We did not ask for anything from anyone.    Our next step is to set up a security advisory council to  see  to the overall safety of our people.    We have adopted a constitution for our homeland. A  constitution is not merely a document detailing a state's  management structure. It is a living document which expresses a  nation's character, its being, its deepest convictions,  traditions, symbols, and ideals. That is why the French  Constitution is different from the Germans. That is why our  constitution differs from that of the new South Africa. The  major features of our constitution are its commitment to  Christianity, with the recognition of the freedom of religion;  Afrikaans and English as official languages; a republican form  of state; a national assembly consisting of representatives  directly elected in general elections; a state president and  executive council; independent courts; two levels of government  consisting of the national assembly and the local council;  citizenship for members of the Boer Afrikaner nation;  citizenship as a precondition for the right to vote.  Noncitizens are protected under international law and the bill  of rights and duties contained in the constitution. Special  majorities are needed to amend the constitution, and 51 percent  of the members of the national assembly may call a referendum to  amend the constitution. Disqualification of members of the  assembly who act in defiance of their election mandate. The  maintenance of the free market system. The right to private  property [words indistinct] the flag and Die Stem [The Voice --  present national anthem].    In order to maintain good relations with other nations, we  seek a confederal system involving economic cooperation and  political independence.    Mr. Chairman, I now move to the important matter of the  right  of the Afrikaner people to land in South Africa. Nations become  independent on their own territory. Between the Second World  War and the late eighties no nation became independent, no new  state emerged. But since the nineties one new state after  another has come into being because nations are becoming free in  their own territory.    We have asked for a referendum to determine where the  Afrikaners are who wish to be included in a homeland, and where  those are who do not wish to be included in that homeland. That  was the democratic way of doing things, but it was denied us.  So we conducted our own surveys to determine the will of the  people, and today we indicate to you soft borders -- not final  borders -- of where our people wish to have their state. In all  four provinces of South Africa people have indicated their  desire to be part of a homeland. I say to you there are already  parts of South Africa which belong to other peoples, which are  independent states, self-governing states. There is also  farming and urban land belonging to colored and Indian people.  Those areas are not part of the Afrikaner Boer nation's land.  There are also parts of the country which are already occupied  by other nations, for example the urban areas around Pretoria,  around Johannesburg. We do not lay claim to those areas. Then  there are some of our people who have indicated that they do not  want to be part of the homeland. Those are the people like Carl  Niehaus of the ANC and Dawie de Villiers of the National Party.  We do not wish to force them to become part of our homeland.  We know they choose the new South Africa. To them we say, we  grant you the new South Africa, but do not force it upon us, and  we are only to eager to get rid of that baggage.    Mr. Chairman, our surveys have shown that the people of  Natal, for example -- with the exception of northern Natal --  have said they do not wish to be part of the new South Africa;  they want to share a new dispensation with the Zulus. The  people of northern Natal have indicated that they wish to become  part of a homeland. That matter will be negotiated with the Zulu  nation.    But the Afrikaner Boer nation has an indisputable right to  the internationally recognized Boer Republics of the Transvaal  and the Orange Free State. We demand that right. It is our  inalienable right. So with the exception of those areas which  do not belong to us, and with the exception of those areas  already occupied by other nations, as I indicated, and with the  exception of those areas such as Johannesburg, whose people  showed no desire in being part of this new republic of ours...  Mr. Chairman, outside these historical areas there are large  concentrations of Afrikaners, such as in the Cape Province, who  have an age-old right to be part of our homeland. Just as there  are people within the two historical republics who do not want  to be part of the homeland, so too there are people in the Cape  Province who want to be part of it. We say -- and our people  have already decided so -- that Pretoria was historically the  capital of the Afrikaner nation, and therefore it must be the  capital of the Afrikaner nation's homeland.    In spite of reports in the newspapers, the majority of the  people of Pretoria showed in the survey that they wish to be  part of the Boer Republic. It is also a fact that in those  areas outside the homeland where people have said they do not  want to be a part of the homeland, one finds a minority of our  compatriots who also want to be part of the homeland, but the  overriding opinion of the communities there are against it. So  what is their position? We believe they can be citizens of our  state, and just as the Jewish nation has a refuge, Afrikaners  around the world will have a refuge. They can embrace this  homeland. We can serve them, we can negotiate on their behalf.  We are going to maintain first-world standards in our homeland,  and Afrikaners will have a refuge there.    We seek permanent peace and a permanent, peaceful solution  for South Africa. But there is no such thing. It is not in the  constitution, it is not on the negotiating table. Chaos is  increasing. We want a permanent, peaceful solution. Matthew  Chapter 5, Verse 9, reads: Blessed are the peacemakers, for  they shall be called the children of God. What does the present  constitution offer? It was drawn up by communists, its drafting  was dominated by communists. It is a constitution for  communists which totally rejects the authority of God, so we say  it is not our duty to respect that which they have created.  They are responsible for the chaos. Our task is to bring down  the authority of the anti-Christ. Matthew Chapter 5, Verse 11  reads: Blessed are you who are reviled and persecuted for my  sake. That is why the Afrikaner has his back to the wall. The  Afrikaner is not prepared to surrender his freedom.    Mr. Chairman, this constitution carries the germ of  destruction. Wars are waged over land. Wars are waged over  ethnicity. Wars are waged over religion. This constitution does  not provide for these things. It does not provide land for our  people or for others. It does not provide for the  self-determination of peoples. It does not provide for us to  serve our God in our own land. Provision must be made for this  before there can be peace. And not only for our people. Our  people and the Zulus want their freedom; others have been forced  into submission. Our demands must be accommodated in order that  there be peace in South Africa.    The final solution will not be achieved overnight, because  they are moving in the wrong direction. If the rights of others  to govern themselves are recognized, the stranglehold will ease  and South Africa will achieve peace. We know we will again be  free; when and how depends on the nation. We have gathered here  today to demonstrate that our desire remains unchanged. We have  demonstrated here today that we are continuing along the road to  freedom, to self-determination in our own homeland.    Throughout the history of our struggle for freedom we know  that no other nation has ever come to our assistance. Our  people have always had only one refuge to turn to, and that has  been the King of Kings. We seek no enmity with any nation or  country, but we commit ourselves today irrevocably to the Holy  Trinity. We know that, as in the past, under God's guidance,  our people will arrive in our homeland, free under our own flag,  as a free nation, to serve our Creator.    I ask you all, friends, that we accept this declaration of  intent. We, as representatives of the Boer Afrikaner nation  gathered here today, believe totally that God the Holy Trinity  determines the fate of nations and therefore our fate. And  because we believe, in accordance with internationally accepted  norms and principles, that it is the God-given right of every  nation and therefore our nation's right to be free; and because  we are convinced that peace can only be assured if every  peace-loving nation is allowed to govern itself; and because the  Boer Afrikaner nation will never accept subjection, enslavement,  or tyranny from any foreign authority; and because the nation is  determined, with all the means at its disposal, even with its  blood, to restore its freedom in its own fatherland: Therefore  we declare here and now that it is our firm intention, if  allowed, to peacefully govern ourselves before 27 April 1994 in  our own8independent state through the structures already created  for that purpose.    But at the same time, if we are not allowed to declare the  freedom of the Boer Afrikaner nation in a peaceful manner, we  commit ourselves, and undertake hereby, to reestablish and  confirm the freedom of the Boer Afrikaner nation with whatever  means at our disposal, against anyone who threatens the freedom  of the nation or in any way whatsoever attempts to interfere  with it. We declare this for and on behalf of the Afrikaner  nation.    Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to rise [words indistinct]  support me in this undertaking [words in distinct] attach it to  the front door of the Old Council Chamber where our nation's  government met, and where our nation's government will again  meet in the future. I thank you.</p>

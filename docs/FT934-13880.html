			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Hungry Russia watches Georgia carve itself up: John Lloyd and Steve LeVine report from the threatened capital A COUP against the elected president brought him to power; now that president's forces threaten to deprive him of office. Mr Eduard Shevardnadze has had a traumatising 18 months as Georgia's head of state. Today he sits, amid the ruin of all his hopes, in the building from which Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia was forced in January 1992. As the 'Zviadists' advance toward Tbilisi, Mr Shevardnadze turns in desperation to Russia, begging to be let in to the Commonwealth of Independent States, in which he saw 'no future' last year. Russia is reasserting its hegemony over many of the former Soviet republics, and especially his; a Russia which 'is putting its empire together again', in the words of veteran commentator Mr Levan Khaindrava. Mr Shevardnadze told Georgian politicians and intellectuals on Monday: 'We will not be able to live if we cannot settle matters with Russia.' He encouraged the view that he was Georgia's last hope after a coalition of paramilitary and political forces violently ousted Mr Gamsakhurdia. Now, after becoming one of the most famous statesmen of the late 20th century as Soviet foreign minister, he has little to show for his return to the state where he was once Communist party leader. Defending, in an interview last week, his decision to take Georgia into the CIS, he said, 'The CIS is not a powerful union, so we don't have to sacrifice much of our sovereignty.' Yet the very prostration of his country calls into question how much of that 'sovereignty' is left. The economy is ruined. Mr Gia Nodia, who runs Tbilisi's only independent think-tank, says a basic food basket for a month costs Dollars 20 (Pounds 13.20); the official average salary, paid in the wildly inflating coupon, is Dollars 2 a month. Bread lines for loaves priced at the equivalent of one fifth of a cent are massive, while wheat is sold off on the black market to Armenian and other traders. Since Mr Gamsakhurdia's forces took the junction town of Samtredia last Sunday, food in the port of Batumi is denied the capital, and supplies are down to a week or two. Unemployment is at least 50 per cent, and the streets are crowded with lounging men. In the second city of Kutaisi, now directly threatened by Mr Gamsakhurdia, the big truck plant 'barely works', according to the mayor, who adds that 'most enterprises work at around 30 per cent capacity at most. Anyway, who needs what they produce?' The republic of 5.5m people is dismembered. The fall of the resort town of Sukhumi at the end of September ended the Georgian military presence in the province of Abkhazia, which has been agitating for independence for two years and has now declared itself an independent state. It is now another land which is undergoing 'ethnic cleansing': Georgians, once nearly half the population, are down to a few thousand and they are trying to flee. Refugees in Chubery, a village in the Svanetian mountains next to Abkhazia, speak of hideous atrocities. Mr Levan Amliani, who fled Sukhumi three weeks ago, said he saw the bodies of women with breasts cut off; men hanged and nailed to crosses; and - a recurring, nightmarish tale - men and women with throats cut and tongue pulled through the gash to make an 'Abkhazian necktie'. The other two autonomous regions of Georgia are also wholly or partly lost to Tbilisi. South Ossetia, scene of murderous fighting three years ago, is now de facto occupied by Russian troops - and is peaceful. Ajaria, the southern part-Moslem region, is peaceful but prefers Moscow to Tbilisi. Mr Shevardnadze has no army. Thus, he has had to rely increasingly on the showy, violent, semi-criminal band known as the Mekhedrioni, who owe their loyalty (and their pay) to Mr Jaba Josseliani, now effectively second man after the president. Imprisoned by Mr Gamsakhurdia, he has been more or less loyal to Mr Shevardnadze and his bandit-like force has provided the spine of the state's military arm. Though he came in with a string of western friends, Mr Shevardnadze has had nothing from the west but concerned words. 'He addressed many love letters to them,' says Mr Khaindrava in his waspish way, 'but it was in the end platonic.' Even Mr Tedo Japaridze, his national security adviser, concedes that 'he raised too many hopes about the west'. Mr Japaridze claims that, in a meeting with President Bill Clinton, he was told that Georgia must reconcile itself to being in the Russian sphere of influence. He also says that President Boris Yeltsin told Mr Clinton at the Group of Seven meeting in Tokyo that if Russia were to leave the Caucasus, 'they would murder each other'. It is widely believed that Russians have been helping the murdering, by providing arms to the Abkhazian separatists and at least allowing in guerrilla forces from the Russian northern Caucasus. Mr Shevardnaze believes that Mr Yeltsin did not sanction this and that he represents the 'progressive Russia' with which Georgia can live; others believe all the Russians are the same, and they want Georgia back. No-one pushes these points harder than Mr Gamsakhurdia. Interviewed at the weekend in his headquarters city of Zugdidi, the former president, soft-spoken and only occasionally portraying the immense paranoia of former years, inveighed against the 'criminal bands' of Mr Shevardnadze and promised to rid Georgia of them. His prime minister in exile, Mr Pessarion Gugushvili, said: 'Everything we said about Shevardnadze has proven to be true. He has ruined his country and is delivering it to the Russians.' Georgia was as pleasant a place as could be found in the Soviet Union's last years, its towns relatively gracious, its climate warm, its people notoriously hospitable. Now it is grim, squalid, nervy, riven with conflict and patrolled by unpredictable thugs with automatics who answer to unknown authorites or none. Russia may in the end save the republic. Georgia's wild spree of independence is coming to an end.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Arto Astikainen: "Even the Taloustutkimus Poll </F> Found Record Support for SDP"]    [Text] Taloustutkimus Oy in its latest poll found that  support for the Social Democratic Party (SDP) is in the record  range, nearly 34 percent. A few weeks ago, Taloustutkimus saw  the SDP rise already beginning to culminate and turn downward.  Now the situation has returned to the earlier trend.    Support figures for the SDP as measured by both leading  polling organizations, Finnish Gallup Oy and Taloustutkimus Oy,  are quite similar.    The Finnish Gallup poll for March showed the SDP at 34.1  percent, and the poll conducted by Taloustutkimus in the  March-April time frame was 33.6 percent. The margin of error in  the results is around 2 points upward or downward, meaning that  in practice the organizations' figures are the same.    The most recent Taloustutkimus poll was based on interviews  conducted from 11 March through 17 April. The were some 1,800  voters interviewed. This poll was commissioned by the national  daily SUOMENMAA.    Support for the Center Party in the poll remained around the  same figures as previous months. It is now 18.3 percent. The  Conservative Party may have even dropped a little since early  March; its support was calculated at 17.5 percent. Accordingly,  the Center Party in this poll went ahead of the Conservatives.    There were no great gyrations in support for any party.  Taloustutkimus shows the problem-ridden Rural Party at 1.5  percent.    Taloustutkimus also asked whether Esko Aho's government  should now resign. Of the 500 respondents, 37 percent answered  "yes." In January the "yes" replies amounted to 43 percent. In  practice there may have been little change, since the margin of  error with this small a sampling is around 4 percent.</p>

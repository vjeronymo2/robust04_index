			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A statement was made by the Lithuanian Conservative  party, Tevynes Sajunga [Motherland's Union], spokesman for the  press concerning Russia's official reaction to Lithuania's wish  to join NATO.    The statement reads that the statement made on 5 January of  this year by the press secretary of the Russian president  recognizes Lithuania's right to be concerned about her own  security and that Russia respects this right. Now this right is  being implemented by an official request to be admitted to NATO,  however, Russia's regrets about bloc psychology should be  addressed to Russia itself because Russia was the first to take  up the initiative to restore the post-Soviet military bloc,  which, after Belarus had been included, was threateningly  approaching Lithuanian state borders.    According to Vytautas Landsbergis, Chairman of the  Lithuanian  Conservatives Tevynes Sajunga, Europe and NATO should note that  the military bloc dominated by Russia today is just 30  kilometers from the capital of Lithuania. Belarus alone  declared having 100,000 men in its Armed Forces, and what about  the Russian military units in Belarus and the Kaliningrad Region?    Therefore, Lithuania has very good reason to be concerned  for  the expansion of the new Eastern military bloc, especially in  view that regrettably the Belarus Government and the members of  parliament have renounced the neutrality that was solemnly  declared earlier.    Russia's neighbors are also not less concerned about the  openly aggressive Russia's new military doctrine. Assurances  that this doctrine allegedly blocks the way to any  manifestations of aggression in Russian foreign policy  absolutely contradict the text of the above doctrine and the  real actions. The illegal deployment of Russian troops in  Latvia and Estonia and Russia's avoidance of carrying out its  international obligations in the region is a continuation of the  1940 aggression. Actions of the Russian troops in the Caucasus  and Moldavia and threats and pressure exerted on her neighbors  are the everyday examples of this deplorable policy.    We hope that the democratic forces in Russia will rally and  become stronger dissociating themselves from the aggressive  nationalism towards people of other nationalities and the  neighbors, the statement by the Tevynes Sajunga -- Lithuanian  Conservatives -- reads.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mustafa Kurtovic] </F>   [Text] Gorazde -- According to the information we received  this morning from the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army East Bosnian  Operative Group command in Gorazde, the chetniks have not  withdrawn to a distance of 1 km from the town center as  stipulated by the NATO ultimatum. Moreover, UN forces have not  taken up the positions specified by the ultimatum. Groups of  chetniks were sighted yesterday and this morning in areas that  are only 1 km away from the town. Chetnik provocations  overnight were registered in the area of Orahovice and  (?Ostanica), while a tank and infantry attack at Brdarici is  currently in progress.    Life in the city is extremely hard because the small area of  the town now holds over 40,000 citizens and refugees who were  forced to leave their homes in the surrounding villages. Lack  of water could cause large-scale epidemics. That is why we are  appealing to the UN Protection Force and health organizations to  undertake urgent measures to protect the population of Gorazde  from infectious diseases. As we were filing this report, we  were informed that a UN High Commissioner for Refugees convoy,  carrying food and medicine, had entered the town.</p>

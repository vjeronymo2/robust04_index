			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> S&amp;P Cuts Occidental Petroleum Ratings: Standard &amp; Poor's lowered its  ratings on Occidental Petroleum's debt, citing expectations of weak earnings  and cash flow. The agency also cited high fixed costs of servicing total debt  of about $8.2 billion, as well as a $2.50-a-share annual dividend that the  agency called "very high." It reduced ratings on Oxy's senior debt and  preferred stock to BBB-minus from BBB, subordinated debt to BB from BBB-minus,  and commercial paper to A-3 from A-2.  </P></p>

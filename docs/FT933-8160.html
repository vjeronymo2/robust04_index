			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium group to cut production REYNOLDS METALS, the second-largest US aluminium group, said yesterday it would temporarily close another 88,000 tonnes of capacity because of the worldwide supply/demand imbalance. It was also reported that a pay strike by Romanian train drivers might force that country's Alro aluminium smelter to shut down because of a lack of raw materials. But this news produced only a slight rally in London Metal Exchange aluminium prices. Metal for delivery in three months had fallen to Dollars 1,200 a tonne, but recovered to close at Dollars 1.204.50, down Dollars 2.75 from Friday's close. Rumours of Reynolds' cut had been in the market for two weeks and was 'factored into the price already,' suggested Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group. Also the cut was not as big as had been hoped. Nevertheless, in the longer term this was good news for the market. 'The less capacity there is, the quicker the price will recover. The important thing is for the producers to continue to exercise restraint when prices start to rise next year and not bring back all this shut capacity.' Reynolds pointed out that, once the latest cut became effective in late October, 209,000 tonnes, or 21 per cent, of its total capacity of 991,000 tonnes will have been shut. The 121,000 Troutdale smelter in Oregon has been idle for nearly two years. In October a 41,000 tonne line at the Massena, New York, smelter will be closed down and two totalling 47,000 tonnes at Longview, Washington. The group is taking a third-quarter, after-tax charge of Dollars 8m, or 13 cents a share, to cover the costs which involve laying off 350 employees. Nickel production fell 12 per cent to 394,300 tonnes in the first half of 1993, according to the International Nickel Study Group. Nickel consumption rose from 414,200 tonnes to 419,000 tonnes. The International Lead and Zinc Study Group reports that lead mine output in the first half was down 7.5 per cent to 1,059,000 tonnes. However, refined lead output was up 1.3 per cent to 2,258,000 tonnes. Lead consumption fell by 1 per cent to 2,210,000 tonnes. Zinc mine output fell by 7.2 per cent to 2,633,000 tonnes and refined output was 0.4 per cent down at 2,722,000 tonnes. Consumption of refined zinc was down 1 per cent at 2,683,000 tonnes.</p>

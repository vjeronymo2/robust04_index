			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Reputation costs Eurocopy Pounds 8m EUROCOPY, the photocopier distribution and services group, which has faced a barrage of criticism of its selling practices, is taking a Pounds 7.7m provision against costs related to defending its position and resolving customer complaints. The provision, taken as an extraordinary item, compares with pre-tax profits for the year to September 30 of Pounds 7.03m (Pounds 11.32m). The company has suffered from substantial bad publicity regarding its selling practices and a warning by the Office of Fair Trading that it could revoke its consumer credit licences. Earlier this week the OFT decided not to revoke any of its licences. Mr Cyril Gay, chairman, said that the recession and the adverse publicity had led to 'what has been without doubt the most difficult year in the company's history'. The fall in photocopier sales was mainly responsible for reduced turnover of Pounds 43.8m (Pounds 48.2m). There was an overall loss for the year of Pounds 3.12m (Pounds 7.38m profits) which, together with dividend payments, necessitated the transfer from reserves of Pounds 5.05m. Last time there was a payment to reserves of Pounds 5.46m The shares, which surged by 25 per cent to 100p on the announcement of the OFT's decision, yesterday slipped 13p to 87p. Earnings per share were down to 9.49p (15.33p) and a proposed unchanged final dividend of 2.9p makes a same-again total of 4p. Efforts will be directed to rebuilding the group, Mr Gay said. 'It's not an overnight job. It's going to take us six months. But we've something to build on now.' It is pursuing a warranty claim against Sketchley from which it acquired in 1989 two of its subsidiaries criticised for their selling practices. The damages it could claim have been quantified at Pounds 9.2m. COMMENT There is a lot of work to be done at Eurocopy. On the positive side, the OFT's decision was, if anything, an endorsement of the current management. However, efforts to shake off the group's tarnished corporate image and then to generate momentum for growth are only just beginning at a time when market conditions are not exactly favourable. Yesterday's drop in the share price indicates that the response to any adverse news coming from the group can still be jittery. Eurocopy's management, well aware of the enormity of the task, has given a rather downbeat assessment of prospects over the next year. With forecast pre-tax profits being revised sharply to about Pounds 4.5m, for earnings of 6.2p and a prospective multiple of 14, the shares do not look particularly attractive yet, given the extent and probable lengthy duration of the upward climb the group faces.</p>

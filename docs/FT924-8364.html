			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Norcros drops 12% to Pounds 5.56m - Job losses and recession continue to bedevil UK tile-maker AFTER THE false dawn in the building sector early this summer, Norcros was forced to make further redundancies in its UK tile-making business. This was the main component in the Pounds 2.65m exceptional costs which lay behind a 12 per cent decline in pre-tax profit, from Pounds 6.32m to Pounds 5.56m, in the six months to September 30. Operating profit advanced from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 11.7m on sales of Pounds 191.2m (Pounds 196.3m). Interest costs fell to Pounds 3.45m (Pounds 4.29m). Earnings per share fell from 3p to 2.5p, and a maintained interim dividend of 3.5p is again uncovered. There was a retained loss of Pounds 1.42m (profit of Pounds 792,000). Building products, the largest division by sales with Pounds 80.8m in the first half, staged a recovery in operating profit to Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 2.16m). Mr Michael Doherty, chief executive, said losses had been halved at Crosby Sarek windows and doors and Crittall Windows had improved to break-even. Triton showers continued to grow. Profit slipped in ceramics to Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 5m) on sales of Pounds 55.3m (Pounds 60.1m). A further fall in the UK tile market of 12 to 15 per cent this year led to another 150 job losses at Johnson. 'As late as July we hoped there would be no more restructuring, but our attitude had to change after that,' Mr Doherty said. The headcount came down from 2,500 to 1,200 in three years, although capacity increased and quality improved. By the year end the wages bill should be 5 per cent down despite pay increases of up to 4 per cent. In print and packaging, profit fell to Pounds 4.38m (Pounds 5.1m). Norprint was hit by a substantial drop in demand for price labels from small shops. Fierce competition also undermined prices. Property disposals amounted to Pounds 20.6m this financial year, of which nearly Pounds 10m was received in cash, plus Pounds 3m deferred from the previous year. Borrowings were reduced by Pounds 8.2m to Pounds 119.9m, giving gearing of between 80 per cent and 90 per cent. COMMENT Six months ago the story was that Norcros's restructuring was complete and it was ready to start growing. The reverse has happened. It was, of course, not the only company to think the worst was over. The result has punctured the recovery staged in ceramics last year, leaving the joinery businesses short of sufficient sales to make a profit. The continuing slump in commercial construction continues to hold back the tile market, while over-capacity in doors bodes ill for loss-making Crosby Sarek. This year's figures have a small cushion in a pension fund surplus and provisions set up to cover the liquidation of the property portfolio. The group still has a little way to go before it is cash neutral, leaving aside property sales. Full-year pre-tax profit, helped by lower interest costs and reduction of losses in building products, is forecast to inch ahead to about Pounds 16m, a prospective p/e multiple of 15 on last night's share price of 113p. A yield of just over 8 per cent - the final dividend should be maintained - provides a floor for the price.</p>

This is a proof that the  days of the "civilian government" are numbered, declares NODONG  SINMUN today.    The news analyst says:    It has recently been brought to light that the traitor Kim  Yong-sam at the time of the "presidential inauguration" last  year manipulated the "Ministry of Health and Social Affairs" to  buy toothpaste and other goods with the "money donated for  helping poor neighbours" and distribute them as "gifts." It was  also exposed that officials of the puppet Defence Ministry built  the "defence hall" equipped with deluxe amusement facilities  with the money squeezed from the people including primary school  children allegedly for the sake of "defence" and indulged in  luxury.    Scandals of the puppet Home Ministry and many other units  are  reported one after the other.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam's advertisement of "clean politics"  is being shattered.    In fact, the "civilian government" is the hotbed of  irregularities, outdistancing the "Fifth and Sixth Republics."    This shows the puppets are engaged in irregularities and  encouraging them behind the facade of "reforms."</p>

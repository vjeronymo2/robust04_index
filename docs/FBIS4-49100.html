			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Luo Jianlin (5012 1696 3829), and </F> correspondent Meng Yuhong (1322 3768 4767): "Resolutely Check  Violation of Trademarks"]    [Text] Trademark violation has had an unhealthy effect on  the reputation of China's foreign trade. At recent sessions of  the Guangzhou Commodities Fair, investigations and penalties on  such behavior have become increasingly more serious. Some  enterprises with comparatively serious cases of trademark  violation have already been dealt with through the issuance of a  critical circular. On the very day of its opening, the current  Guangzhou Commodities Fair organized an examination of  trademarks and found that cases of enterprises participating in  the exhibition violating regulations and trademarks had been  somewhat reduced compared with previous sessions. Various trade  delegations have universally attached importance to trademark  controls; for example, the Henan delegation has on several  occasions independently conducted checks on enterprises under  its jurisdiction on their implementation of the regulations on  trademark control. Nevertheless, there were still 20  enterprises, including the Shenzhen Kaicheng Company, which  violated the rules, while most trademark violations fell into  the category of marketable goods for export, and some had a  reputation in the world market. The fair promptly adopted  measures and sternly and quickly handled the case of any  enterprise as soon as it was discovered.    Viewing the situations of the 20 enterprises the current  fair  has handled, their cases varied as well as their attitudes. The  goods of some units which violated trademarks were exhibited,  but no transactions were involved; some units had already signed  contracts for transaction, and the trademark violations had  become facts; while the bulk of enterprises violating trademarks  were comparatively active and sincere in admitting their  mistakes. When it was verified that the Shenzhen Kaicheng  Company had violated trademarks on 16 April, the company had all  along delayed in giving a written explanation to the fair based  on the relevant regulations, and displayed a very poor attitude:  a heavy penalty was meted out, its qualification to participate  in the commodities fair was canceled, and its exhibits were  removed. The Guangxi Machinery Import and Export Company and  the Xinjiang Zhongxin Industrial Company were known to have  violated trademarks in previous sessions of the commodity fair,  and during the current fair, they repeated their mistakes. It  was learned that with regard to the commodities fair circular on  checking trademarks and relevant regulations, the Guangxi trade  delegation office had already relayed them to the company  manager; however, the manager had failed to relay them to his  staffers. This showed that the company manager had not paid any  attention to them. This being the case, when penalties were  imposed on the two companies, the managers in charge were  especially criticized in a circular. The China Shenzhen Foreign  Trade (Group) Company was verified to have violated the "White  Dove" trademark on its slippers, and its samples were  confiscated; however, the responsible person on the stall  refused to cooperate. In light of his attitude, it can be seen  that the company knowingly violated trademarks but paid no  attention to the relevant regulations on checking them. Thus, a  stern penalty was imposed on the responsible person.    The current fair has done very specific and meticulous work  on checking and handling trademark violations, while refraining  from adopting a requirement for unanimity in everything,  handling different cases according to their situation, and  ensuring the smooth progress of the fair's export transactions,  while firmly and promptly halting the violation of trademarks.</p>

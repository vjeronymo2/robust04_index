			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Whitbread sees moderate growth WHITBREAD expected 'continuing, but moderate, growth' in most of its markets this year, Sir Michael Angus, chairman, told the annual meeting of the brewing and retailing group yesterday, writes Philip Rawstorne. During the first four months of the financial year, profitability had been maintained in the highly competitive beer market and the food businesses were showing healthy year-on-year growth, he said. The rate of growth would depend on the group's brands and how quickly and deeply the current modest economic upturn was consolidated, Sir Michael said. 'Our brands are strong and extremely well managed. I believe, however, that our customers - particularly in south-east England - are still in the after-shock of the worst recession since the war and it may be some months yet before their confidence is fully restored.' Sir Michael gave a warning to the government that the levels of tax on beer were becoming a threat to the survival of large numbers of pubs. 'We calculate that the beer and pub industry contributes Pounds 12bn each year to the exchequer through all forms of taxes - Pounds 4bn in excise duty alone. For the British beer drinker this means between 40p and 50p on every pint going to the government in the form of duty and VAT. That's nearly one third. It's far too much and there's a real danger that people will begin to vote with their feet and stay away from their locals.'</p>

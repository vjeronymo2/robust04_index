			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Arts: Today's Television It is Norman's big day and the question is: will he or won't he? Wear yet another new sweater with a funny design, that is. Regular viewers of Film 92 are as likely to turn on for Barry Norman's woollies as to see which movies he is reviewing. Today's films include the British-made 'Hear My Song' about Irish tenor Josef Locke which is receiving a lot of attention in the US as well as the UK (10.30 BBC1). FT readers with nothing better to do may want to have a look, earlier in the day, at what Norman Lamont is up to. The Chancellor should stand up in the House at 3.30 but Budget 92 with David Dimbleby, safest hands in the business, begins at 2.30 on BBC2. For those with no television but a wireless, Radio 4 starts PM Budget Special, Valerie Singleton presenting, at 3.00. ITN wades in at 3.15 on ITV with a team headed by Alistair Stewart, John Suchet and Julia Somerville. Channel 4 presents 'a modern fairy tale play combining fact and fiction to mark Adult Learners' Week': Homer And His Pigeons (8.00). That is followed by the C4 arts programme Without Walls which today considers what 12 years of Conservative government have done to culture (9.00).</p>

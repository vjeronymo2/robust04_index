			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Tories support sentiments of strategy paper Conservative backbenchers representing a range of views in the party yesterday voiced support for the main thrust of a strategy paper written by Mr John Maples, the deputy chairman, and obtained by the Financial Times. Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the Commons defence committee, said he agreed with most of the sentiments in Mr Maples's paper. 'It is not the policy itself. It is the way the policies are put over. Our policies are not being explained properly. What he said - although it was lurid language - was something most of us would agree with.' Mr Cyril Townsend, MP for Bexleyheath, said Mr Maples had hit 'a number of nails on the head' and produced the sort of document the leadership needed. 'I don't agree with all his comments, but I think he was absolutely right to give the advice he did in general.' Mr John Townend, rightwing chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee, said he had been pressing ministers to wake up to reality for some time. Mr David Shaw, MP for Dover, said: 'The broad thrust of what John has said is absolutely right. It closely accords with what people have been saying inside the party.' Mr Richard Shepherd, the Eurosceptic MP for Aldridge Brownhills, said the memorandum 'has effectively been written to the government by every Conservative MP over the last year'. Several MPs said Mr Maples accurately reflected their belief that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, should postpone the next increase in value added tax on fuel due next April. Labour, which yesterday submitted a petition to 10 Downing Street opposing the increase from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent, is to try to force a vote blocking it after next week's Budget. Mr Clarke is thought to be determined to press on with the increase. He is thought to believe that postponing it would merely add to the government's difficulties by allowing Labour to prolong its attacks on the issue. Mr Tony Blair, Labour leader, said it was 'significant' that the document admitted 'on the key areas of concern to the voters - the economy, living standards, NHS, social division - we are getting it right and they are getting it wrong'. Commenting on Mr Maples's suggestion that a few backbench 'yobbos' should metaphorically beat him up, Mr Blair said he was not particularly surprised: 'Character assassination is their stock-in-trade.'</p>

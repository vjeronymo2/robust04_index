			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Arts: Starting a search for positive returns - Sponsorship Arts sponsorship was late into the recession and seems to be late coming out of it. The growth in expenditure in the early 1990s created the illusion that companies were so in thrall to the arts that there would be no downturn. It has now arrived, especially in London and the south-east. The main casualties are corporate membership schemes: companies that habitually signed up as friends of the Tate, the Royal Academy, Covent Garden, the Royal Shakespeare Company, Glyndebourne and so on are now selective, hitting the income of arts organisations hard. Also patronage is out; demonstrative advantage in. New sponsors tend to be hard-nosed and practical, seeking a positive return. Often they are keen to use the arts to boost contacts, as the following sponsorships suggest. * The arts event of the year to date has undoubtedly been the Picasso exhibition at the Tate Gallery. It is clocking up around 4,000 visitors a day and is on target to be the most popular show ever held there. This is good news for Ernst &amp; Young, the consultancy firm, which snatched the sponsorship from under the noses of Toshiba and a Spanish bank. It is Ernst &amp; Young's first major involvement in the arts and it is paying a hefty price - approaching Pounds 300,000 down, and a further Pounds 200,000 or so in marketing and hospitality. A recent arrival among the larger consultancy firms, Ernst &amp; Young decided arts sponsorship matched its potential client profile and thought the Picasso exhibition had an appropriate ambiance, familiar but slightly avant-garde. It has three targets. It wants to entertain, and is holding an incredible 30 evening receptions at the show; it wants to build up loyalty among its own staff of 7,000, who get free tickets; and it wants to raise its profile. One bonus is that the BBC is also backing the show, with 13 programmes devoted to Picasso; Ernst &amp; Young gets a mention in ten of them. First indications are that the 400 partners who ultimately fund the sponsorship through their earnings will be happy enough to stick with the arts. * Another new sponsor evaluating its involvement is Capital House, the investment management subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland, which has backed the current exhibition of drawings by Holbein from the Royal Collection at the National Portrait Gallery. Capital House has a narrow target audience and John Ellwood, the company's corporate affairs director, saw corporate advertising and sports sponsorship as expensive and wasteful. Music had appeal, but art seemed to offer the best environment to get the Capital House message across. Based in Edinburgh with a budget of Pounds 100,000, Ellwood first approached the Scottish Arts Council but received no joy. He had never heard of ABSA in Scotland. Finally he rang the National Galleries of Scotland and discovered the gallery wanted to put on a show to commemorate the 450th anniversary of Holbein's death. The Fitzwilliam in Cambridge and the NPG were keen to take the drawings. Capital House money made it possible, in return for the usual perks: company name on the catalogue and publicity material, plus private views and corporate entertainment. As a first-time sponsor Capital House qualified for a Pounds 25,000 sweetener under the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme; but company costs rose again to Pounds 100,000 when the champagne for the hospitality evenings was included. But the final amount contrasts favourably with the cost of media advertising, and Ellwood believes the company profile has been raised. * The Edinburgh Festival goes from strength to strength. It has just raised Pounds 1m in sponsorship for the 1994 Festival, a 15 per cent increase over last year. With the Festival Theatre coming into operation, raising the seat capacity by 25 per cent, it was essential to reach the Pounds 1m target. New sponsors include Scottish Widows and two firms of solicitors, Fyfe Ireland and Maclay Murray &amp; Spens, while there was increased funding from Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of Scotland, Famous Grouse, IBM and Scottish &amp; Newcastle. The sponsorship money will be more important than ever if Edinburgh Council cuts back on its grant, as seems possible. * Swiss-based Alexandra Trading and Investment is using the arts to ease its way into the UK market. It has invested over Pounds 50,000 in the two concerts given by Kiri te Kanawa at the Hampton Court Festival and will use them to entertain prospective clients. * The Prudential is changing its arts awards, the most generous in the UK with Pounds 100,000 for the winning arts company. It has responded to criticism that too much money went on the gala dinner and has switched the next ceremony, in January 1995, to the National Theatre. The budget remains Pounds 800,000 and the money saved has been devoted to a new prize-winning category: film.</p>

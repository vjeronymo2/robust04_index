			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Belgian muddle OF THE EC countries discomfited by last month's ERM crisis, Belgium faces perhaps the most difficult dilemma. A strong supporter of the EC's economic and monetary union plan, Belgium is trying to maintain its previous credentials as a member of the ERM's D-Mark 'hard core'. The price of Belgium's franc fort is not only high, but looks increasingly unsustainable. Belgium would like to cling to hard currency status to keep alive the chance of qualifying for Emu. Additionally, in view of its large dependence on foreign trade, Belgium wants to avoid devaluation to resist imported inflation and preserve macroeconomic stability. Unless present policies are revised, however, neither policy looks likely to be achieved. The Belgian National Bank, which earlier this month increased interest rates to keep the franc close to pre-crisis levels, yesterday cut lending rates by a quarter point to 10 per cent. Yet three-month money market interest rates, at 9.3 per cent, are still nearly a percentage point above their end-July level. Bond market yields, at just over 7 per cent, are 4 percentage points above the inflation rate. For a country saddled by negative economic growth, 14 per cent unemployment, interest payments on government debt of 11 per cent of gross domestic product, and total outstanding public debt around 130 per cent of GDP, high real interest rates are a self-perpetuating depressant. Belgium needs a real rate of economic growth above the real rate of interest paid on its borrowings. Unless this is achieved, the debt level - the EC's highest - will continue to grow. If this happens, the Emu aim will remain a chimera. German promises of 'flexibility' in examining the Emu criteria will not stretch to allowing Emu participation by a country with debt well over twice the 60 per cent Maastricht target. The government is preparing a 'social pact' with trade unions and employers to restructure labour markets and curb social security payments. However, because of the debt burden, even large cuts in public spending guarantee no escape from the deficit treadmill. More aggressive cuts in Belgian interest rates are required, necessitating willingness either to let the franc float down through its wider ERM fluctuation bands, or to carry out a formal devaluation. The Belgian authorities appear to believe that using their newfound ERM flexibility would bring a damaging loss of economic credibility. In fact, such a policy switch may represent the only means of restoring it.</p>

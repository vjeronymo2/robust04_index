			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL MISCELLANY  </P> <P> NAMES AND NUMBERS  </P> <P> * Record Pace: The Toronto Blue Jays had drawn 2,139,313 through 46 dates, an  average of 46,507, which projects to 3,767,058, a total that would break the  Dodgers' major league record of 3,608,881, set in 1982. The Dodgers would argue  that they sold more than 3.8 million tickets that year, but the National  League's announced totals include only turnstile admissions. The American  League announces total sales, including no-shows. On the other hand, the Blue  Jays would argue that the Dodgers' 3.6-million turnstile total of '82 includes  complimentary admissions. Toronto, through Thursday, had 23 consecutive  sellouts and 80 in 110 dates since the SkyDome opened last summer.  </P> <P> * Expo Express: The Montreal Expos remained within striking distance in the  National League East while waiting for the return Thursday of rookie Delino  DeShields, who has 23 stolen bases and will have missed 22 games because of a  broken finger. The Expos were 9-10 through the first 19 of those games,  stealing only 11 bases after stealing 111 in their first 62 games. On the  absence of DeShields, Tim Raines said, "We stopped getting the cheap runs where  he would walk, steal second, ground ball, ground ball and we'd be up a run."  </P> <P> * Road Blues: The Houston Astros' 10-33 road record includes a 4-30 mark since  May 5, and an 8-23 mark and a 5.56 earned-run average by the starting pitchers  -- contrasted with the starters' 11-13 record and 2.35 ERA at home. Of the 64  home runs the Astros have permitted, 17 have been hit by the New York Mets in  only six games at Shea Stadium.  </P> <P> * The Hit (&amp; Miss) Man: The New York Yankees' Don Mattingly, who averaged  .309 in his six previous Junes, batted only .216 in June this year, his worst  month since hitting .205 in September of 1983. Mattingly, through Thursday, was  batting .253 with no home runs in his last 159 at-bats. "I'm done listening and  talking," he said. "The doorman, the groundskeeper, everyone wants to tell me  why I'm not hitting."  </P> <P> * No Explanation: The six no-hitters of the first half don't figure,  particularly since home runs, through June, increased 21% compared to last  season, the per-game run total had increased from 8.3 to 8.7 and the cumulative  major league batting average had risen from .255 to .260. "Offense is up and  no-hitters are up," Texas pitching coach Tom House said. "Those are mutually  exclusive facts, and all it tells you is that it is illogical." ROSS NEWHAN  </P></p>

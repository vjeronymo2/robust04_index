			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Swiss banks The 36 per cent increase in Swiss Bank Corporation's latest annual net profit bodes well for other Swiss banks due to report soon. Though part of the increase was due to an apparent drop in the tax charge, there is little doubt that the bank has made a killing on derivative trading. And while the 44 per cent increase in provisions and other charges in part reflects payments to the former owners of its O'Connor derivatives partnership, the bank seems to have felt inclined to smooth its earnings jump with a high provisions charge. Other banks, including UBS which reports on Friday, should also enjoy a substantial increase in profits from derivatives trading, but Swiss Bank may feel the benefit more strongly in its share price. CS Holding needs the additional income to limit earnings dilution as it builds up its relatively low capital base. UBS weathered the recession better than SBC, which was caught not only by bad domestic loans but also by large losses on overseas lending. At the end of 1992, UBS's provisions were 0.43 per cent of total assets. At 0.65 per cent those of Swiss Bank had further to fall. The large additional provisions made for 1993 together with restructuring efforts by its new management means Swiss Bank is better shielded from any fall in trading income this year. The chances are that its earnings growth will outstrip that of UBS. Its bearer shares, which under-performed its larger rival's by about 3 per cent over the past year, will then also start to pull ahead.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The four other comments addressed both categories. GAMA and ACEEE stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same descriptor should be required for instantaneous water heaters and heat pump water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters that is required for storage water heaters. <FOOTCITE>66</FOOTCITE>  AGA commented that, if pool heaters,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instantaneous water heaters, and heat pump water heaters are to be labeled, the required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disclosure should be the estimated annual operating cost. <FOOTCITE>67</FOOTCITE>  CEC recommended that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission require energy factor, annual energy consumption, and annual cost of operation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disclosures. CEC stated that the energy factor is needed because this is the measure upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which utility incentive programs are based, and that annual energy consumption and annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost of operation are needed ``to fulfill FTC's Congressional mandate.'' <FOOTCITE>68</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 66 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> GAMA, E&hyph;3, 2, 3&hyph;4. At the time the NPR was published, energy usage descriptor for water heaters was estimated annual operating cost. The NPR proposed the disclosure of either estimated annual operating cost or energy factor for instantaeous water heaters. GAMA, therefore, envisioned the choice as between energy factor and estimated annual operating cost. ACEEE, EE&hyph;3, 2, 3. ACEEE assumed that heat pump water heaters would be disclosing estimated annual operating cost in this case, but did not make this assumption for instantaneous water heaters. As of December 28, 1994, however, the required disclosure of energy usage for water heaters will be the estimated annual energy consumption with an ``operating cost disclosure statement.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Note 63, above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 67 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> AGA, EE&hyph;4, 2&hyph;4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 68 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> CEC, EE&hyph;2, 5, 7. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission agrees with GAMA and ACEEE that the energy usage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instantaneous and heat pump water heaters should be expressed with the same descriptor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (estimated annual energy consumption) that is used to disclose the energy usage of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage-type water heaters currently covered by the Rule. This permits consumers to compare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the energy usage of the various types of water heaters that could fulfill their needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, today's amendments will incorporate instantaneous water heaters and heat pump  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water heaters into the existing requirements to disclose estimated annual energy consumption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> See section 305.3(d) of ``Text of Amendments,'' below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Sub-categories for Ranges of Comparability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPR solicited comment about whether to include instantaneous water heaters in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the three existing water heater ranges (one range each for electric, gas [including propane]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and oil water heaters), or to establish a separate range category. The current ranges of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparability for water heaters are categorized on the basis of first-hour rating. <FOOTCITE>69</FOOTCITE>  Under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOE test, there is a method for calculating the equivalent of a first-hour rating for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instantaneous water heaters. Therefore, these products could be included in the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ranges and could be considered with conventional water heaters for range purposes. Because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they have no storage tanks, however, and are different from conventional water heaters, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NPR sought public comment on whether a separate category would be more helpful to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumers than including these products in the existing water heater ranges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 69 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The DOE test defines ``First Hour Rating'' as the amount of hot water the water heater can supply in one hour of operation. See 10 CFR part 430, subpart B, Appendix E, 1.5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The DOE test also contains a provision by which a first-hour rating for heat pump  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water heaters can be calculated. Like instantaneous water heaters, therefore, heat pump water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters could be included in the conventional water heater ranges. The NPR sought comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on whether it would be more helpful to consumers to include heat pump water heaters with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conventional water heaters or to create a separate range category for them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Four commenters addressed the issue of range subcategories for these products. Paloma  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contended that gas instantaneous water heaters are so different from storage-type water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters that they should be in a separate range category. <FOOTCITE>70</FOOTCITE>  GAMA and ACEEE stated,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without elaboration, that instantaneous water heaters should be in the same range category as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conventional storage water heaters. <FOOTCITE>71</FOOTCITE>  ACEEE thought that heat pump water heaters should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be in the same range category as storage-type water heaters, but GAMA and CEC disagreed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommending that they be in a separate range category. <FOOTCITE>72</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 70 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Paloma, E&hyph;2, 4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 71 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> GAMA, E&hyph;3, 2; ACEEE, EE&hyph;3, 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 72 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ACEEE, EE&hyph;3, 3; GAMA, E&hyph;3, 3&hyph;4; CEC, EE&hyph;2, 7. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission is creating separate sub-categories for each of these two types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water heaters, rather than including them in the existing ranges of comparability for water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters. As noted in the comments, the technology of instantaneous and heat pump water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters is different from that of storage-type water heaters. In addition, it is not likely that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> homeowners would substitute these new types of products ``one-to-one'' for conventional,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage-type units. <FOOTCITE>73</FOOTCITE>  The Commission has determined that it would be helpful for consumers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> looking for alternatives to conventional storage-type water heaters to have products using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different technologies grouped separately. Accordingly, the Commission has determined to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amend the Rule to create three new range sub-categories_one each for gas instantaneous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water heaters (natural gas and propane), oil instantaneous water heaters, and heat pump water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters. See Appendices D4&hyph;D6 in ``Text of Amendments,'' below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 73 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, heat pump water heaters do not recover (reheat water after being drained of heated water) as quickly as comparably-sized storage-type models, and instantaneous water heaters are more limited than comparable storage-type models as to how much hot water they can provide per unit of time ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> gallons per minute). Moreover, an instantaneous water heater which would (be gas-fired) that would be large enough to serve a small house would be disproportionately expensive to purchase when compared to comparable storage-type models. Thus, it is not likely that homeowners would substitute these new types of products ``one-to-one'' for conventional, storage-type units. This approach to ranges of comparability for the newly covered water heaters is consistent with the separate range groupings the Commission currently uses for home heating equipment;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> forced-air furnaces and boilers are separate sub-categories within the furnace category. See 59 FR 34014, 34042&hyph;49 (July 1, 1904).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

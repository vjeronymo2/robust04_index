			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 7 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu hinted at a small change in Seoul's initial position  that linked inter-Korean exchange of envoys to resolution of  North Korean nuclear problem Thursday [7 April], saying that the  nuclear issue has become an international problem in the wake of  the statement by the United Nations Security Council, therefore  cannot be limited to a problem of confrontation between North  and South Korea.    In the summits in Tokyo and Beijing, it was recognized that  the nuclear problem should be resolved by three approaches --  between International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and North  Korea, South and North Korea, and North Korea and the United  States, Han said in an expanded party-government meeting to  discuss follow-up measures to President Kim Yong-sam's visits to  Japan and China.    "At present, we will wait and see North Korea's response to  the Security Council statement and continue with persuasion and  pressure," Han said.    "Considering the effect of the North Korean nuclear problem  on tourism, investment, trade, and our overall economy, we need  more efforts to wipe out the understanding that the present  situation in the Korean peninsula is critical," the foreign  minister said.    Han reported that Seoul and Tokyo agreed to resolve  repatriation of ethnic Koreans in Sakhalin as soon as possible  at the initiative of Japan. Seoul will also present  comprehensive measure to the matter within the year.    Seoul trusts Tokyo to resolve the comfort women issue and  Japan is currently mapping out measures, Han said.    Trade, Industry, and Energy Minister Kim Chol-su said he  will  hammer out details of economic cooperation in motor vehicles,  aircraft, and telephone exchange agreed in the Seoul-Beijing  summit.    Korea will expand joint manufacturing of automobile parts  before the summer and seek advancement in completed cars next  year, Kim said.</p>

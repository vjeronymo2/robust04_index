Al-Shar' stressed that  the full peace that Syria wants in return for an Israeli full  withdrawal is the kind of peace accepted internationally by all  states that have formal peace treaties. The Syrian foreign  minister made the remarks to Knesset Members Wahhab  'Abd-al-Darawshah and Talib al-Sani' and the other delegation  members when they dined with him for the final meal of the  Ramadan fast. Our correspondent Qaysar Kabaha, who is with the  delegation, reports that the delegation left Damascus last night  for Cairo and are due home this morning.</p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COBA CLARIFIED  </P> <P> The reason I am writing to you is to point out a couple of inaccuracies in  Steve Weinstein's piece, "Uncovering Coba" (Jan. 7).  </P> <P> The article refers to "a pair of lakes." There are actually four lakes in the  immediate vicinity of the ruins. Another statement: "The pyramid of Nohoch Mul  towers more than 100 feet above the jungle floor. . . ." The statement is  correct, but the actual height is about 140 feet.  </P> <P> H. DEON HOLT  </P> <P> Oceanside  </P></p>

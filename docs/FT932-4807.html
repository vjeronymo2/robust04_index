			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Iran 'close to pact' on debt IRAN claimed yesterday that it was close to agreement with foreign banks on rescheduling some Dollars 2.5bn to Dollars 3bn of short-term debt. Mr Mohammed Hossein Adeli, governor of the central bank, told a news conference in Tehran that a settlement would be reached 'very shortly' but he offered few other details. Central bank officials have been wrestling for nearly a year with Iran's worsening short-term payments problem, caused initially by a flood of imports financed through letters of credit. Mr Adeli yesterday put the figure of total short-term indebtedness at Dollars 6bn, higher than had been officially admitted but still substantially below estimates by some of Iran's main supplier governments. Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department and other international agencies have already suspended cover for Iran because of the payments delays. However, Mr Adeli dismissed reports that Iran's total foreign debts were anywhere near the Dollars 30bn level which had been cited, and said this could only refer to the total of all contracts signed. Several German banks were believed in April to have to have agreed to restructure repayments due on letters of credit, and French banks are now undertaking a similar exercise. At the end of last year, Iran announced that sharp cuts were planned in imports, although there was scepticism about the extent to which cuts would be implemented before the presidential election scheduled for Friday.</p>

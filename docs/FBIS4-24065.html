			<p>BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, June 22 (AFP) -- France Wednesday [22  June] rushed troops, helicopters and vehicles to central Africa  in preparation for an intervention to protect Tutsis grouped in  refugee camps in western Rwanda, witnesses and official sources  said.    French Defense Minister Francois Leotard said in Paris that  the French troops would launch a limited operation to protect  the Tutsis and it could begin as early as Thursday, once the UN  Security Council authorized the intervention. The council gave  the go-ahead hours later.    The commander of the French joint chiefs of staff, Admiral  Jacques Lanxade, said a first contingent of 600 troops would be  deployed once the operation got under way.    Here in Zaire, two huge French transport planes unloaded  troops in the towns of Goma, near the Rwandan border, and  Bukavu, just across the Ruzizi River from Rwanda, sources in  Goma said.    Lanxade in Paris said a total of 200 troops were in these  two  towns and a third, Kisangani.    In Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic,  three  transport planes chartered from the Russian carrier Aeroflot  began disgorging helicopters and vehicles at the city's airport.    At an adjacent French military air base, six other large  transport planes could be seen, with military vehicles on the  perimeter of the air field.    France has 1,400 troops stationed permanently in the Central  African Republic.    Leotard said 2,500 French soldiers would be involved in what  he described as a humanitarian operation. Lanxade said 500  vehicles and 40 planes would be used.    Leotard said the French troops would only be deployed in  parts of western Rwanda controlled by the ethnic Hutu  government, which has been accused of responsibility for most of  the hundreds of thousands of ethnic killings that have rocked  Rwanda for the past 10 weeks.    Tutsi-led rebels who control the north of Rwanda and were  engaged in a major offensive Wednesday to capture the capital  Kigali have refused to allow French troops into their zones.    They blame Paris for supporting and arming the Hutu  authorities despite evidence they were involved in the  systematic slaughter of minority Tutsis.</p>

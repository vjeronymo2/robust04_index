			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Anglo still biggest mining company ANGLO AMERICAN Corporation of South Africa is by far the largest mining company outside the former Communist countries, according to a study released today by the Raw Materials Group, the Swedish consultancy organisation. Anglo controlled nearly 9 per cent by value of the western world's 1990 production of non-fuel minerals compared with the 4.2 per cent of its nearest rival, RTZ Corporation of the UK. RMG's list of the top 50 mining companies is slightly subjective in that the organisation uses unconventional methods to assess whether one corporation is controlled by another. For example, although De Beers is quoted separately from Anglo American, RMG's method suggests it is controlled by Anglo. Many observers would concur in this particular case, given the very tight links between the two South African companies, which are widely assumed to be ultimately controlled by the Oppenheimer family. 'Control can be exercised by many means of which ownership is the most common and important one. But ownership is not the only way of exercising control,' say Mr Magnus Ericsson and Mr Andreas Tegen, authors of the study. 'We look at ownership and management to determine who is in control of a specific company.' Apart from the inclusion of De Beers, Anglo is also helped to its top spot by being the dominant producer of two high-value products: gold and diamonds. RMG says that, although Anglo by their measurement has been the world's biggest mining company since the mid-1980s, its relative strength has been declining, mainly because of the fall in South Africa's gold production. In 1984 Anglo controlled nearly 16 per cent of western world non-fuel minerals production, twice the 1990 percentage. In contrast, since 1984 RTZ has increased its share of production from 3.5 per cent. RTZ was formed only 30 years ago and its recent progress was speeded considerably by the Dollars 4bn acquisition of most of British Petroleum's non-fuel minerals and mining assets in 1989. State-owned companies are still important in the mining and metals industries. Among those in RMG's top 50 are Outokumpu of Finland; Codelco of Chile; BRGM and Pechiney of France; the Malaysian Mining Corporation; Brazil's CVRD and Sweden's LKAB . The revival of US companies is also evident from the statistics. In 1984 the US companies accounted for only 10 per cent of production by the 50 largest mining groups but by 1990 this was up to 13 per cent. The authors point out, however, that the US groups still have some way to go to recover to the 20 per cent they controlled in 1975. Only one Japanese company appears in the RMG top 50 - Mitsui at 49. The main thrust of the study is to keep track of the ownership, control, percentage shareholdings, joint ventures, subsidiaries and affiliations in the mining and metals industry.

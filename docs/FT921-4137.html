			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Morgan Stanley sets up operating committee MORGAN STANLEY, the US investment bank, has promoted Mr John Mack, head of its fixed income division, to lead a new committee which will take on responsibility for day-to-day running of the group. The appointment is part of a management reorganisation which also includes the unusual move of running the group's worldwide government securities business - including US Treasuries - to London. Morgan Stanley says the reorganisation is designed to allow it to make decisions more quickly and strengthen its international businesses. The new operating committee will remove much of the burden of routine day-to-day decision-making from Mr Richard Fisher, Morgan Stanley chairman, and Mr Robert Greenhill, its president. They, and other inside members of the group's board, will retain responsibility for strategy and policy. Mr Mack, 47, will thus become roughly the equivalent of chief operating officer. Other members of the operating committee will be the heads of Morgan Stanley's largest divisions - equity, fixed income, investment banking, asset management and finance, administration and operations - and the heads of the London and Tokyo offices. Mr Mack will be succeeded as head of fixed income by Mr Peter Karches, aged 40. The firm is also relocating four managing directors from New York to London and Tokyo, and as part of this change is moving global responsibility for some businesses from New York to London. Its ability to do so reflects the increasingly global nature of capital mar-kets. The head of European operations, Mr Timothy Hultquist, is returning to New York where he will continue to head the group's foreign exchange business, and will take on responsibility for commodities.</p>

The talks, which were attended by Canadian External Affairs  Minister Andre Ouellet and Georgian Foreign Minister Aleksandr  Chikvaidze, centered on the situation in Georgia, the UN's  possible role in settling it, Canada's assistance, and also  questions of Canadian-Georgian relations.    "We realize perfectly well that the situation in Georgia is  an extremely difficult one, and we would like to help it,  particularly with supplies of Canadian wheat, and also technical  assistance," Jean Chretien said at a meeting with journalists at  the end of the talks. In a brief response, Eduard Shevardnadze  expressed gratitude to Canada for its understanding of Georgia's  problems and for its expression of solidarity with it. He noted  that the signed declaration is a good basis for the further  development of relations between the two countries.    Canadian External Affairs Minister Andre Ouellet, in an  interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, said: "We discussed  the situation in Georgia in the context of the task to achieve  peace in that region. He (Shevardnadze) asked Canada for  support in setting up the UN peacekeeping forces. The prime  minister made it clear that he would give such support and would  inform the United Nstions that the implementation of the peace  mission is an urgent task. The prime minister made it clear  that because of the very important commitments we have  undertaken at this time in Bosnia and Croatia, it would be  difficult for us to send troops (to Georgia), but the prime  minister expressed a readiness to do so if the United Nstions  requests that a certain number of technical and military  advisors, which could become an inalienable part of the  peacekeeping mission, should be sent."    At the conclusion of the visit, Eduard Shevardnadze was  received by Canadian Governor-General Ramon Hnatyshyn, after  which he left Ottawa for home.</p>

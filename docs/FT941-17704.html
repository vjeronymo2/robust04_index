			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Right way to run a lottery and the premium bonds (1) Sir, The answer must be Yes to your question 'Would Britain's national lottery raise more money for good causes if it gave its profits to charities rather than to shareholders?' (leading article, December 20). The lottery will achieve greater popularity if, like almost every other lottery in the world, it is seen to run entirely for the benefit of the community. The lottery should be run to provide maximum money for good causes, rather than to line the pockets of the companies selected to operate the events. Should Lord Young and Richard Branson be the successful bidders, their business achievement and that of their colleagues is a guarantee that it will be run professionally. If their bid is not selected, opportunity should be given to another group offering non-profit-making services. Sigmund Sternberg, Isys, Hyde House, The Hyde, Edgware Road, London NW9 6LH</p>

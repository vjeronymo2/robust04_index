			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vanuatu has a new president. Jean Marie Leye was  sworn in today as the country's third president after two  previous attempts to elect a national leader failed. South  Pacific correspondent Erina Reddan reports one opposition group  crossed the floor to support the government's candidate, paving  the way for a future coalition between the two groups.    [Begin Reddan recording] In the third attempt to elect a  president, the political deadlock was broken when one opposition  group, the Vanuaaku Pati [VP], voted with the government to  achieve the required two-thirds majority.    Leader of the VP and of the opposition, Donald Kalpokas, is  confident that within a few days his party will have formally  joined the government. The VP's nine seats in Parliament will  bolster Prime Minister Maxine Carlot Korman's slim majority.    President Leye, 61 years old, formerly the vice president of  the ruling Union of Moderate Parties, was elected with 41 votes.  Five went to Father John Bani, and nine were spoiled or left  blank. After being sworn in, the president said today's  consensus was only the start of greater harmony and unity in  Vanuatu. [end recording]</p>

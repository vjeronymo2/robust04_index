			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Voice of America reported that Afonso Dhlakama,  Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader, is to begin a  three-day visit to South Africa on 29 January. Radio  Mozambique, however, learned from a Renamo source this morning  that no date has been set yet for the Renamo leader's visit to  South Africa. In the interview he granted to that radio  station, Dhlakama said his visits to South Africa and other  southern African countries are intended to help build a climate  of postwar trust with the political parties and governments of  those countries. The Renamo leader plans to visit the United  States in the second half of February.</p>

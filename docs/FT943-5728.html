			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Arts: Treats from the Fringe If you plan an Edinburgh evening wisely, you can see at the Assembly Rooms Anorak of Fire, followed immediately by The Fabulous Lypsinka Show. The two shows are so completely in contrast that the juxtaposition is very satisfying. Anorak is male, English, naive, inhibited; Lypsinka is female, American, sophisticated, full-out. Anorak has been around for a year and has many cult followers; but oh, Lypsinka] I must explain that I do not call Lypsinka female in the most literal sense. She is John Epperson, who is both writer and performer, and she not only transcends the camp drag act she performs, she actually makes a searing feminist point. She is extremely funny, but she repeatedly wipes the laughter off your face. Like so many drag artists, Lypsinka reproduces feminine glamour, but what makes her so original is that she is all about reproducing femininity. She mimes to a tape that is a brilliant collage of quotes and acts by a hundred different American popular divas of stage, screen and cabaret, and as her act proceeds it becomes a study in the desperation of trying to fit the image of femininity. There are the desperations of the drag artist trying to fake femininity; of the woman trying to fake diva glamour; of the diva trying to maintain glamour. And all of it for the sake of men. Or is it? Within Lypsinka the vamp lies Lypsinka the man-hater that bursts out to the stabbing shrieks of Psycho-type music. The two faces of her persona are, deep down, different faces of the same attitude: desperation again, arising from her need to thrill men, to obtain men, to live for men, and from her plight of never finding Mr Right, of being wronged by Mr Wrong. One moment she is performing to 'The things I've done to make you love me', the next to 'Isn't it plain, I can't bear to be handled. Don't touch me.' The quick alternation is hilarious, and at the same time, horrifying. The artifice of glamour becomes more and more obvious, and the torture of striving for perpetual chic becomes more alarming. And yet, despite yourself, you laugh. Is it possible to be both camp and innocent? The Topp Twins, from New Zealand, manage it. Their show has now ended at the Traverse, but I loved it and I hope Britain sees them again soon. In their late-night show, Camping Out, they welcomed us to the Happy Valley Camping Ground. One of them was called Camp Mother, the other Camp Leader. If you put Dame Edna into Hi-de-Hi], you might begin to get an idea. 'We're going to try something tonight we haven't tried in a long time,' Camp Mother announces, 'We call it audience participation. You call it fear.' And soon we were singing camp songs, up onstage playing camp games, and several of us ate camp food. We knew it was safe, because we had watched Camp Mother frying it. The innocent fun of it never palled. But what made Camping Out something rare was its sheer professionalism - the Topp Twins are very good singers - and the detail with which they built up their characters. Camp Mother and Camp Leader are both relentlessly jolly, bespectacled, spinsters. Camp Mother throws herself into camp activities with immense vim. In consequence, she has to keep briskly readjusting her boob-tube. Camp Leader is more tongue-tied and nervous, but gets terribly over-excited. She grins awkwardly, her little tongue flickers out like a snake's, she blinks rinkles her nose. Then at last she gets to have the stage to herself for two minutes. 'I'd like to point out how mahvellous Camp Mother has been this year,' she says with a nervous giggle. 'She had more than her share of heartbreak last year, you see. Well,' (conspiratorially) 'as a matter of fact,' (chortle) 'she get jilted]' For a moment Camp Leader is convulsed in glee. Another fringe highlight is The Big Window, a 100-minute musical at Theatre Workshop performed by an Anglo-American cast of 10 and band of three. This is a delicate, sophisticated piece which deals with heartbreak and sexual confusion in an urban milieu. The music, composed by Linda Dowdell, is in an eclectic vein of high jazz. The words, by Kate Browne, have a fine talent for light irony. 'You and I have known each other a long, long time. We are, if I remember correctly, even married.' And she and Dowdell have so collaborated that the words move into haunting Gertrude-Stein-type cycles: 'Perhaps she said perhaps.' There is a wide panoply of rhythm, some deft choreography by Kraig Patterson, but the most exciting thing of all is that Dowdell shows a very rare instinct for word-setting. In ensembles, in solos, in high-jumping vocal lines, she plants words with exceptional clarity and to great effect. While you applaud, you hope this is the embryo of some larger project.</p>

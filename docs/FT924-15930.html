			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Sale of privatised debt delayed THE UK government's plan to sell Pounds 1bn of debt owed it by privatised companies has been delayed, though the government's advisers say they can still complete the sale before the current financial year ends next April. The disposal, part of the Treasury's plans to raise Pounds 8bn from privatisations this year, had been due to proceed at the beginning of October, when potential buyers were to register their interest. However, Baring Brothers, which is advising the government, said it will not invite buyers to come forward until it has had another 'two or three weeks' to look into how the sale is handled. Mr Simon Best, a Baring director, denied yesterday that the bank had hit problems with the sale, or that it might completely revise the way the disposal is handled. The extra time would allow Baring to look at possible refinements to its plans, he said. Baring said in August that it would hold two auctions, one for debt of BT and one for the electricity companies. To stimulate competitive bids, only the best Pounds 1bn of bids for the total debt, which has a current value of around Pounds 4bn, will be accepted. Electricity companies are the only ones allowed to bid for their own debt, while BT will bid alongside third parties for its Pounds 1.69bn of debt outstanding. The main tax problem in the way of the privatised companies buying back their own debt has already been resolved. The Treasury has agreed to allow them to bid at a lower level, reflecting the fact that they will not be able to claim any tax losses from buying back and cancelling debt which is trading at a premium. However, Baring is now considering refinements to the tax position. One possibility would involve the debt being sold to specially-created companies run by the privatised companies, allowing the debt to remain until its normal maturity date and so getting around the tax problems of early repayment. Further complications have yet to be resolved on the accounting side. For instance, the premium paid by companies which buy back their debt is likely to be treated as a current expense in their accounts, reducing their profits. A company which borrowed to refinance the debt, could get around this accounting problem.</p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Soap Wars: Washing of dirty linen leaves deep stains - When Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble clash everyone pays a price Clutching a brightly coloured package, Nabil Sakkab hurried to his office and poured the contents on to his desk. Before him was a heap of detergent, a substance Sakkab, as Procter &amp; Gamble's European head of laundry products development, dealt with daily. But as his scientist's eye looked more closely, he could see this sample was different. Scattered among the white granules were myriad, tiny, pink crystals. 'My God] They're really going to use it]' he exclaimed to colleagues. It was mid-March 1994. What Sakkab had spotted was a secret weapon just deployed by P&amp;G's arch rival Unilever: crystals of manganese, a catalyst that could dramatically increase the cleansing power of a detergent. Unilever was claiming its new formula was the biggest advance in fabric detergents in 15 years. Sales of the product - Omo Power - were leaping in the three European countries where it had been launched a month earlier. P&amp;G was worried. Sakkab was astounded that Unilever would use manganese. P&amp;G knew from its research that manganese could speed the bleaching process. But it also attacked fabrics - which was why the US company had abandoned it as a possible detergent ingredient 10 years earlier. Was Unilever committing a huge, and potentially costly, blunder in using the catalyst? With that question began the Great Soap War of 1994 and what was to become a major debacle in international marketing - perhaps the biggest since the botched reformulation of Coca-Cola in the early 1980s. It was a battle that tarnished the image of the Pounds 6bn European detergent industry, that may have permanently changed the rules of engagement in one of the west's key consumer markets, and raised serious questions about management capabilities and structures in two of the world's biggest companies. For Unilever, it was a protracted nightmare. Its new Persil and Omo Power detergents, launched last February, were supposed to regain the initiative in the European fabric detergent market. Instead the detergent was subjected to unrelenting media scrutiny and a fiercely hostile campaign by P&amp;G. The trouble was, the flaws exposed were all too real. Power was not just another new product. It was intended to blaze a trail in the consumer goods business by combining advanced product technology and innovative techniques of pan-European marketing. Much was also riding on the success of the product for one man: Niall FitzGerald, Unilever's global co-ordinator of detergents since 1991. The ambitious 49-year-old Irishman with 27 years' service at Unilever had risen through the ranks, thanks to ability, drive and a persuasive charm. FitzGerald enjoyed nothing more than challenging Unilever's stuffy conventions. When he was eligible for his first company car he chose a powerful Kawasaki motorcycle. The formfiller balked. FitzGerald told him: 'There's no rule says I can't have a motorbike.' FitzGerald knew that his ability to turn round Unilever's ailing detergent business would determine his hopes of eventual ascent to the joint chairmanship of the group. He was out to change things in detergents, breaking down the bureaucratic structures that made Unilever less than fleet of foot in launching new products. In Europe P&amp;G had long since overtaken it in fabric detergents. The gap grew in the late 1980s when Unilever was slow to develop concentrated versions of the product. What Unilever needed to win back the lead was a quantum leap in detergent effectiveness. A senior Unilever executive said: 'We knew our second entry into the concentrated market had to be something very different, not just in the laboratory but to the consumer. Mrs Jones had to notice and say: 'This really is different'.' The salvation was to be science. A veteran of the company's detergents business said: 'Technology creates bigger swings in market power for detergents than any other consumer product.' Selling a big new idea to consumers can differentiate a new product from the pack, and brings big gains in market share. In this case the big idea was the manganese catalyst that Unilever, long after P&amp;G had given up, continued to pursue. After five years of development Unilever decided last December that it had tamed the metal. If the science was ambitious, so was the marketing. Exploiting its new pan-European structure, co-ordinated like P&amp;G's from Brussels, Unilever planned to launch Power in 11 countries in short order. It was a marketing blitzkrieg without precedent in Europe. It was also a plan that would leave Unilever terribly vulnerable if something went wrong. By late February 1994 the alarm bells were ringing at P&amp;G's world headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio. P&amp;G was also working on a new detergent - Ariel Futur - for launch later in the year. As sales of Power took off in Europe P&amp;G was anxious to find the ingredient underlying the rival's success. When the answer came from Brussels - the pink crystals pinpointed by Sakkab  -no one was awaiting it more eagerly than Ed Artzt, P&amp;G's famously domineering chairman. Nicknamed the Prince of Darkness, Artzt had a well-earned reputation for responding rapidly and ruthlessly when he felt P&amp;G's interests were threatened. The Power detergent was, in his view, just such a case. Unilever was not only claiming to have stolen a technological march, it was basing its claim on a formulation which P&amp;G had reason to believe was fundamentally flawed. But was Unilever now proving that conclusion wrong? Sakkab's findings suggested not. Some dark dyes in cotton and viscose fabrics reacted badly to the detergent. A week after finding the crystals he and his colleagues in P&amp;G's European Technology Centre were discovering holes in clothes they had washed in Power. They also believed - although this is a claim that has subsequently won little support from independent testers - that the manganese lingered in the clothes and would continue to damage them when washed in other manufacturers' detergents. Armed with this belief, Artzt resolved on an unusual move. During a visit to London on March 31 he called at Unilever House, the company's imposing art-deco headquarters by Blackfriars Bridge. In a meeting with FitzGerald and other top executives he demanded that they withdraw their new detergent. Power products, he said, were so flawed as to be likely to cause significant overall damage to the fabric detergent market. Artzt's warning left FitzGerald and his colleagues suspicious. True, there was a long tradition of collaboration between Unilever and P&amp;G on technical issues. For all the aggression in the marketplace the two companies had often privately alerted one another to flaws in their products and worked together to solve them. But a visit from P&amp;G's chairman was something else. 'It was too theatrical,' said a Unilever executive who was at the meeting. Another said: 'If it had been anybody but Artzt - say Helmut Maucher (chairman of Nestle) - we would have believed him.' In vain Artzt argued that he had broader industry interests at heart. His Unilever audience concluded that he was on a massive spoiling operation to undermine their important new product. They decided to ignore him. Over the next few weeks Artzt and FitzGerald exchanged increasingly acrimonious letters. Their subordinates met once in Brussels to try to agree on joint testing. But Unilever, insisting that its tests had shown no fault, refused to accede to P&amp;G's demand that Power be withdrawn from the market before joint testing started. FitzGerald could see no need to take the costly and humiliating step of withdrawing a product that had been tested by scientists and consumers for two years without incident. Yet in ignoring P&amp;G's private warning he laid Unilever and its Power detergent open to an unprecedented campaign of public vilification. With hindsight, senior Unilever executives still argue there was little they could have done to forestall an onslaught so contrary to industry conventions. They appear convinced that P&amp;G had been planning a frontal attack on Power all along. P&amp;G vehemently denies this is true. But in one sense it is irrelevant. The inescapable fact is that whatever P&amp;G's intentions, it was Unilever that provided it with ammunition by launching a flawed product. According to company executives, Unilever management compounded the problem with two blunders that magnified Power's defects. First, it was decided to use a high concentration of the manganese catalyst to maximise the bleaching effect. Second, Unilever marketed it as a detergent for broad use with all fabrics, water temperatures and colours, rather than as a more specialised product. Unilever wanted a broad 'positioning' to cut through the proliferation of detergent varieties and specifications that had been sowing increasing confusion among consumers. It was aware throughout that Power would inflict somewhat more damage on fabrics than did earlier detergents. But it accepted that as the price of more effective stain removal. To understand these decisions - which Unilever executives confirm were taken at a high level of the company - one has to imagine the sheer enthusiasm about the Power products that had FitzGerald and his team in its grip. They were egged on by the positive consumer response evident during testing, particularly last autumn when the new formula was applied to an existing Unilever brand in the Netherlands, All-Activ, and sold without relabelling as a new product. A senior Unilever executive said: 'We got very positive consumer responses and got nothing suggesting there was a problem.' It seems that FitzGerald and those around him, buoyed by these results, got carried away and pushed the product harder than had been the norm. Detergent companies often 'front-load' a new product with bigger dosages of the most active ingredient in the launch phase to get the strongest consumer response. Normally they later pull back to strike a balance between cleaning effect and profit. Unilever did not - or at least, not soon enough. A senior Unilever executive said: 'I think we were very enthusiastic about an exciting new product and did not look closely enough at the negatives. Somewhere between research and marketing something went wrong - under the normal pressure to be first to the market.' The first public sign of trouble for Unilever came with a story in the Dutch press on April 27, purporting to quote a spokesman for P&amp;G alluding to fabric damage caused by Power. In a confusing twist, the spokesman said the company would also put 'Power' stickers on its own detergents. Within 48 hours Unilever called a press conference denying the claims. It launched two writs for product defamation and trademark infringement. P&amp;G's press campaign was remarkable not just for its ferocity but for its moments of ineptitude. Neither Unilever nor P&amp;G was skilled in the art of corporate public relations. Past masters at promoting their brands through advertising, they have tended to try to keep out of the corporate spotlight. The brands, not the companies, were supposed to do the talking. P&amp;G, however, undoubtedly had the edge - no doubt in part because it had for the first time enlisted the help of an outside PR firm, The Rowland Company, a Saatchi &amp; Saatchi subsidiary. As for Unilever, it had obviously failed to anticipate how violently P&amp;G would react and how ill-equipped it was to handle the onslaught. Until the end of May the Anglo-Dutch company just about managed to hold its own with consumers. Although Power sales fell after every P&amp;G onslaught, Unilever was able to rebuild them with advertising and special offers. FitzGerald knew, however, that the position could not be held for long. Apart from anything, he and his colleagues had realised that P&amp;G had a point about Power's effect on some dark dyes. Although Unilever considered the circumstances extreme and irrelevant to consumers, the criticism would have to be met - and that meant changing the product's formulation. On the first weekend in June three events transformed the nature of the battle. That Friday Unilever announced that it was dropping the lawsuits against P&amp;G, after P&amp;G assured Unilever that its spokesman had been misquoted. It also announced that it was reformulating the detergent, with an 80 per cent cut in the catalyst to solve the dye problem. Third, P&amp;G released to the press a set of colour pictures showing clothes purportedly suffering the ill effects of Power - including memorable shots of some tattered boxer shorts which were duly reproduced by the press all over Europe - plus results from six test institutes. P&amp;G had to backtrack on the pictures when it was pointed out that the shorts were from its own tests, not those of the institutes. It was one of several examples where P&amp;G went over the top in its campaign. Nevertheless, the awkwardness of Unilever's position was plain to see. Much as the company tried to deny that there was a problem and to claim that the product's effectiveness was unchanged, by reformulating Power it had conceded an important point to the opposition. Unilever also decided to retreat from Power's broad market positioning to a more specialised niche - revamping the packaging to focus use on lower temperatures and white fabrics. This was a climbdown since Unilever had set out at the time of launch to present Power as a product for broad use in order to reduce consumer confusion. It was a shift that, for the time being, the company understandably chose not to broadcast - proclaiming disingenuously that diluting the catalyst was designed to broaden Power's usefulness. With the June announcements 'all hell broke loose', as one Unilever man put it. Power was front-page news in several European countries - notably in the Netherlands, where it had the added spice of humbling a home-grown multinational - and was generating the wildest stories. In Sweden a leading environmental campaigner claimed on television that Power had placed the nation's clothes in imminent jeopardy. Unilever blames P&amp;G's 'well-organised briefing system' for much of the trouble. A senior Unilever executive said: 'We found we were subject to a ruthlessly well-organised knocking copy campaign. P&amp;G was literally running around Europe to consumers' associations, washing machine manufacturers, retailers and anybody else who would listen giving them a very extensive technical briefing with lots of lurid pictures. 'We were chasing this well-armed arsonist around Europe. It took a week to put out each fire. That's why we appeared on the defensive.' The company was not only defensive with the press and public, it also failed to find an effective counter to what eventually became a stream of reports from consumers' associations criticising Power detergents. Ignoring the associations' public support, its usual response was to question their competence. Behind the scenes, both it and P&amp;G subjected them to the most intense pressure to take sides. Nothing summed up Unilever's inadequacy better than the response of a senior company executive to a reporter's hypothetical question. If a negative television news item about Unilever's detergent was followed by an advertisement extolling its virtues, which would the consumer/viewer believe? 'The advertisement, of course,' the executive replied. By the summer the battle over Power detergents had become an obsession for top executives in both companies. In the anger of battle, a certain loss of perspective was evident on both sides. As one supermarket executive, subjected by both companies to persistent lobbying, put it: 'Both think they are morally right and that the other side has been practising the black art.' One UK retailer held a dinner party during the summer for a group of its suppliers. Among the guests were Andrew Seth and Mike Clasper, respectively heads of UK detergents at Unilever and P&amp;G. The spectacle of them glowering at each other all evening has become a legend in one of the soap companies. At Unilever, FitzGerald was spending all his time on the problem even though Power accounted for only one-twentieth of Unilever's global detergent sales. Worse for him, his relationship with the company's ruling 'special committee', consisting of the chairmen of the UK and Dutch arms of Unilever, was changing. FitzGerald had made the running throughout the crisis, informing his superiors of his actions. But insiders say that during the summer Sir Michael Perry and Morris Tabaksblat, the British and Dutch co-chairmen, started to take a more active role. Their questioning of the detergents team became more pointed. Finally, the concern of one co-chairman emerged in public. When Morris Tabaksblat flew to Beijing in September his purpose was to open a new Walls ice cream factory to serve the burgeoning Chinese market. But he clearly had something closer to home on his mind. It took little prompting from the journalists travelling with him to elicit the first clear, dispassionate and on-the-record explanation from a senior Unilever executive of Power's fatal flaw. Remarkably, it had taken a full five months of crisis for Unilever to speak up. Tabaksblat said: 'We made a mistake. We launched a product which had a defect which we had not detected.' He spoke of a lack of appropriate safeguards in tests before the launch and admitted that certain textile dyes which reacted badly with the catalyst had not been in Unilever's 'test battery'. Back in Europe those in the thick of the battle felt betrayed. They came, sarcastically, to refer to Tabaksblat's apparently unscripted intervention as 'The Beijing Initiative'. No one was more embarrassed than FitzGerald. At the very moment that Tabaksblat's remarks were becoming public property, he was on a Warsaw stage expounding to Unilever staff on his favourite theme about changing the company's culture. As he spoke an aide passed him a note summarising Tabaksblat's comments. Stunned, he took the next plane home to rally the troops. No one was more delighted than Artzt. At last Unilever had admitted that P&amp;G had a point. A newspaper article reporting Tabaksblat's remarks has pride of place on his Cincinnati office wall. In the months since Tabaksblat spoke Unilever has had ample opportunity to count the cost of its Power failure. After spending Pounds 200m on developing, manufacturing and marketing Power products, Unilever's share of the European detergent market is no better than a year ago - a poor second to P&amp;G. A heavy price has also been exacted on reputations - that of the company and of its Persil and Omo brands. The brand damage 'is not yet considerable but if it's not put right, it could be', says a senior Unilever executive. As for the company, Unilever's pan-European structure was subjected to its first big test with the Power launch, and was found wanting. Its management looked flat-footed and inflexible. Its image as a savvy marketer and innovator was undermined. A senior supermarket executive said: 'We know Unilever well. Normally they are a class act but they don't look too clever now.' But the damage is not only to the Anglo-Dutch combine. The whole detergents industry will have reason to regret the affair if, as seems likely, it exacerbates consumers' scepticism towards manufacturers. A leading retailer said: 'The whole sector is drowning in over-claiming and publicity which leaves consumers confused.' P&amp;G, for its part, may have halted Power in its tracks. But its executives are aware that they failed to win the outright victory of forcing Unilever to take Power off the market. Moreover, P&amp;G has reinforced its widespread image as a ruthless, self-seeking organisation with the unedifying sight of it picking a street fight with Unilever. 'It is a gross misperception. It needs to be remedied but it can't be changed overnight,' a senior P&amp;G executive said. For some people in P&amp;G, achieving this depends on the personality of whoever succeeds Artzt when he retires in the next few years. Both companies are also learning painful lessons. One is that the rules of the game appear to have changed for good when it comes to testing and marketing new products. Unilever admits that complex new detergents might now have to be subjected to testing as exacting as for food or pharmaceuticals. 'With a quantum change in technology, we may have to re-examine all our test regimes,' said a senior detergents executive. Some extreme tests might not be relevant to consumers but Unilever says it wants to find anything which competitors could use against it. That can only raise costs and slow the pace of innovation. Unilever faces a formidable challenge. In the coming months it has to rebuild confidence in its Persil and Omo brands and its own staff's morale, as well as finding new products in which it can use its pioneering technology without problems. It will also have to address the organisational and management issues the conflict has raised. This is not, executives stress, a question of finding a culprit. 'No one person' is to blame, says a senior Unilever man. 'All the checks and balances work together.' Looking to the future, all eyes are on FitzGerald. He rallied the troops at every setback and has started to preach forcefully the lessons learned. Significantly, this week Unilever delayed his expected ascent to its special committee by a year to 1996 - on the grounds that he still had much to do in detergents. See Editorial Comment</p>

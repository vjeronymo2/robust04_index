			<p>BFN     [Text] Since early this year, the antismuggling forces of  An Giang and Can Tho provinces have uncovered 21,000 cases of  smuggling across the southwestern border or in transit through  the western border gate with contraband amounting to 12.339  billiong dong. They forces have collected 6,180 billion dong as  fines and back taxes and have confiscated over 1,279,000 packs  of foreign-brand cigarettes. In An Giang alone, over one million  packs of cigarettes have been imported illegally.    Lately, because of our regular control over various ground  routes, smugglers have shifted to shipping their goods along  riverways. They have rented boats for transportation and have  hidden their contraband cigarettes under layers of farm products.    Other kinds of contraband originate mostly from China and  are  smuggled through the northern border and from Thailand through  the southwestern border into the western region.    Smuggling has also increased sharply in Binh Dinh in the  first four months of 1994, compared to the same period in 1993.  The volume of contraband has been increasing rapidly as  long-range commercial ships are plying the Binh Dinh sea area  with each bringing in between 2,000-3,500 sets of television or  video recorders; and cigarettes, and beers of all brands. So  far, the province market control committee has collected 502  million dong as fines or back taxes for the budget. The value  of contraband in retention now and in which action has yet to be  taken is estimated to be worth 1.4 billion dong.</p>

Only the official results of the election for deputies  and municipal representatives are now pending. In the  preliminary elections, the two majority forces obtained  percentages similar to those of the presidential candidates.    After working for two days, the TSE finished counting the  votes for president. According to official figures, ARENA  [Nationalist Republican Alliance] leads with 641,108 votes, or  49.03 percent of the total votes for president. The leftist  coalition came in second with 325,582 votes, which represent  24.9 percent of the total valid votes. The Christian Democratic  Party came in third with 214,277 votes, or 16.39 percent. The  National Conciliation Party received 70,504 votes, or 5.39  percent. The rest of the parties won a total of 4.29 percent of  the total number of votes for president and vice president.    It has also officially been reported that less than half the  2.7 million registered voters voted on 20 March.    [Begin unidentified TSE official recording] The grand total  of the voters who participated in the 20 March elections was  1,411,320.

In  addition, the TSE drafted a document saying that ARENA and the  leftist coalition will be the only contenders in the runoff.    [Begin TSE official recording] These are the contenders who  won the largest number of valid votes. Therefore, the TSE must  be convened within the deadline stipulated by law.

If the parties do not  do this, the TSE will declare the results valid and will call  the runoff for 24 April.</p>

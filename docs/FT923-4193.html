			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Futures fall back STERLING futures opened higher yesterday morning as some dealers were encouraged by a promise from Bundesbank officials that there will be no rise in German interest rates 'in present circumstances'. However, futures prices later fell back as sterling dropped below DM2.80 against the D-Mark. The government's recent decision to borrow D-Marks and buy sterling on the foreign exchanges has calmed the atmosphere in the markets. But there is lingering uncertainty over France's vote on the Maastricht referendum in two weeks' time. The September and December contracts were tossed around by this uncertainty. In the morning, both contracts opened 9 basis points higher at 89.79 and 89.78 respectively. but they soon dwindled with the currency: the September contract closed 13 basis points down from its opening level and the December contract 3 basis points off. Both closing prices still discount a rise in base rates of  1/4 percentage point. In the cash market, trading was dominated by the very large shortage of Pounds 2.4bn forecast by the Bank of England in the morning. Some traders felt that the shortage was the outcome of translating foreign borrowings, using part of the Ecu10bn borrowing facility arranged by the UK government last week. In the early round, Pounds 1.8bn of the shortage was removed in a repurchase agreement for resale to the market in equal amounts on September 21 and 22 at 9 15/16 per cent. If banks are willing to have their bills returned at this interest rate after the Maastricht referendum on September 20, they must be confident that there will be no increase in base rates following the result. Simultaneously, the Bank bought Pounds 8m of Band 3 bank bills at 9 3/4 per cent and Pounds 17m of Band 4 bank bills at 9 per cent. After revising the shortage to Pounds 2.25bn, the Bank then purchased Pounds 400m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 3m of Band 3 bank bills and Pounds 35m of Band 4 bank bills. In the afternoon, the shortage was revised to Pounds 2.6bn and the Bank purchased Pounds 355m of Band 1 bank bills. Three-month money softened in the morning to 10 1/4 per cent on the offered side. Following sterling's fall, it closed unchanged at 10 5/16 per cent offered.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Coats Viyella lines up buyers - Yarns, fabrics and carpets attract interest at home and overseas Coats Viyella, the UK's largest textiles company, has lined up several buyers for its yarns, fabrics and carpet divisions, in a move expected to raise more than Pounds 100m for the group. The shares rose 8 1/2 p to 202 1/2 p on the news, reflecting investors' surprise that the company had been able to find a single buyer for what amounts to a mixed bag of relatively unprofitable businesses. The divisions have net operating assets of Pounds 120m, and employ 5,400 people. However, a number of the businesses are scarcely profitable, and despite a recently improved performance they achieved operating profits of just Pounds 6m last year on revenues of Pounds 380m. The group has had offers for some of the businesses in the past, but it is understood that these have been at far lower prices. Mr Neville Bain, chief executive, said: 'We would hope to sell the businesses at close to net asset value.' The group was approached by a number of interested parties from both the UK and overseas. It has narrowed the selection down and is confident that a deal can be completed during the first quarter of 1995. Mr Bain was adamant that employment rights of the staff would be 'fully safeguarded'. Coats has radically reduced its debt over the past two years. It is expected to report gearing of about 25 per cent at the end of 1994, compared with 65 per cent in 1992. The disposal would bring the figure below 20 per cent. Mr Bain said the funds raised from the disposal would leave Coats in a strong position to expand its core businesses, particularly clothing, precision engineering and homeware. However, no acquisitions were imminent, he added. The disposal is likely to have a neutral impact on the company's profits but analysts were optimistic that the cash could be channeled into core businesses that could achieve a far higher return on capital. Coats' Indian fabrics businesses, which are held by a 51 per cent-owned subsidiary, are to be retained by the group. Baring Brothers have been appointed to advise on the disposals.</p>

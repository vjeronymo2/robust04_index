			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 27 (CNA) -- A top Mainland Chinese  tourism official admitted Thursday [26 May] that Mainland China  lost more than Hong Kong and Taiwan in the aftermath of the  March 31 Qiandao Lake tragedy in which 24 Taiwan tourists were  killed.    Liu Yi, director of Beijing's National Tourism  Administration, said during a tourism fair in Hong Kong that the  mainland received some 50,000 fewer tourists from Taiwan in  April and May, resulting in the loss of about US$50 million.    Spurred by the adverse impact, Liu said, Mainland Chinese  authorities have begun a "nationwide overhaul" of tourist safety  and decided to shorten the time it takes for the central  authorities to take charge after the occurrence of major  accidents.    Twenty-four Taiwan tourists were robbed and murdered in a  pleasure boat fire on Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang Province on March  31.    The tourists, together with eight mainland crew members and  tourist guides, were found burnt to death in a small room in the  boat on April 1. Luggage and other belongings were missing.    News of the mishap was suppressed at first and then the  Zhejiang authorities claimed it was an accident. Reporters,  especially those from Taiwan were barred from the crime scene.  Relatives of the victims, who were furious after mainland  officials performed autopsies without their consent, were  confined in a nearby hotel, and officials from the Taipei-based  Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) were three times refused  permission to visit the mainland to probe the case.    Although the mainland authorities arrested three suspects  and  agreed to meet SEF officials and victim's relatives nearly 40  days later, many questions surrounding the incident remain.    Since April, Taiwan has suspended cultural and educational  exchanges, banned sightseeing trips, and is reviewing its  economic policy toward the mainland in protest of the mainland's  inappropriate handling of the incident.    Liu said he was happy to hear that a Taiwan travel agents  association decided to lift the boycott on pleasure tours to the  mainland on May 25.    Xu Heyung, an official from the Hangzhou Overseas Tourism  Company who also attended the Hong Kong tourism fair, complained  that "we have not had even a single tourist from Taiwan in May."    Another official from Hunan Province lamented that planned  visits for nearly 40 sightseeing groups from Taiwan were  canceled, resulting in the loss of US$900,000 in tourism revenue  in the province alone.    Meanwhile, an official from the Hong Kong Travel Agency  Association said since the Qiandao Lake incident, Hong Kong has  witnessed a loss of some 30,000 Taiwan tourists who would  previously make one or two-day stops in Hong Kong before or  after their mainland visits.    Visa applications from Taiwan tourists to Hong Kong also  dropped 40 percent since April, the Hong Kong official added.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By John Clark, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>   [Text] The Royal Navy's newest warship, HMS Somerset, was  launched on the Clyde today.    Officers from half-a-dozen of the world's navies, more than  200 guests and thousands of spectators watched the grey-painted  Type 23 frigate go down the slipway at Yarrow Shipbuilders into  the Upper Clyde.    HMS Somerset is the seventh Type 23, or "Duke" Class,  frigate  to be launched at Yarrow and will be delivered in spring 1996.    She was launched by Lady Layard, wife of Admiral Sir Michael  Layard, Second Sea Lord, and is the fourth Royal Navy ship to  bear the name.    HMS Somerset's primary role will be submarine detection and  she will be equipped with the EH101 helicopter and torpedoes.  Her surface armament consists of Harpoon missiles and a 4.5in  gun.    She will also be defended by the vertically-launched Seawolf  anti-missile system and small calibre guns.    The latest HMS Somerset, which is 440ft long and weighs  3,500  tonnes, was built in six months less than the first Type 23  frigate completed at Yarrow.    Yarrow has five frigates to complete by 1997 -- three for  the Royal Navy and two for Malaysia.</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / August oil and gas output up British oil production averaged 2.44m barrels a day in August, up from 2.39m b/d in July, according to figures issued yesterday by the Royal Bank of Scotland. Mr Mark Smith, the bank's energy economist, said the August level was 26 per cent higher than a year ago. He noted that UK oil output has remained above 2.3m b/d in every month this year, compared with an average 'well below 2m barrels per day' in the same period last year. Natural gas output in August was 6 per cent up from July, the month in which demand is usually lowest. North Sea revenues fell in August in spite of rising production because of lower world oil prices. The total average daily value of production was Pounds 33.8m, against Pounds 34m in July.</p>

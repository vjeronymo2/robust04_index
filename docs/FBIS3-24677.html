			<p>SUMMARY                                 Recent statements by PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and by mainstream  PLO organs have indicated growing concern that continued turmoil  among Palestinians in the occupied territories will threaten the  PLO's ability to establish an effective autonomy regime under the  Declaration of Principles (DOP) with Israel.  While PLO  statements have characteristically charged that Israeli  machinations lie behind any disarray among Palestinians in the  territories, they have nonetheless also carried an implicit  warning to Palestinians that the infighting threatens their own  future.                             END SUMMARY      In an interview reported by the Amman daily Jordan Times, 'Arafat  expressed alarm over rising quantities of firearms among  Palestinians in the territories and was quoted as charging that  "there is a very terrible trade of arms going on under the  auspices of some Israeli officers in the West Bank and Gaza  Strip," an effort he described as "seriously and wickedly  planned" to create "another Afghanistan among the Palestinians."  While noting 'Arafat's charge, the Jordan Times reported that the  Israel-PLO DOP had prompted serious rifts among mainstream  Palestinians in the territories, including within 'Arafat's own  Fatah faction, and that unnamed PLO officials have privately  expressed fear of a "civil war" if Palestinians failed to  exercise "self-restraint" (17 February).      A Fatah statement reported by the East Jerusalem Palestinian  daily Al-Quds on 15 February implicitly confirmed reports of  rifts within Fatah.  The statement charged that Israeli security  services are trying to "prepare the climate for a prolonged civil  war" among Palestinians, and specifically to "create suspect  bodies that raise the national slogan and operate under different  names within Fatah."  It called on Fatah supporters to "act with  alertness and high responsibility and not deal with these  unofficial and illegitimate organizations."  It also asserted  that Fatah statements issued in the territories "are approved  officially by Fatah's supreme organizational committee" in the  territories and that any other statements, including those issued  by "Fatah's [local] organizational offices," are "unofficial."      Recent commentaries broadcast by the mainstream radio Voice of  the PLO in Baghdad also implicitly appealed to Palestinians to  temper their internal disputes.  On 16 February, the radio  charged that Israel is seeking to "create chaos and lack of  security" in the territories and to "maliciously sow disputes and  provoke sensitivities" among Palestinians.  It warned that "some  of us have fallen victim to this black propaganda."  Apparently  reflecting fears that Palestinian residents of the territories  will challenge the authority of returning PLO officials, the  commentary called for "awareness of the masses" to prepare for  "national reconciliation after a long expatriation during the  occupation" and said that factions in the territories "should not  now run after authority" but should rather seek to "enhance  cooperation . . . to launch reconstruction."  Three commentaries  on the 21st warned against internal divisions.  They charged that  Israel is responsible for "all the forged and distorted  statements" and even "tribal differences" among Palestinians and  is seeking to "create seditions and sow discord" to prove that  the proposed Palestinian autonomy regime "cannot run the affairs  of the Palestinian people."  Palestinians, they advised, must  maintain "enhanced national unity" under PLO leadership as well  as "further vigilance against any malicious instigation promoting  discord."   (AUTHOR: MORTON.

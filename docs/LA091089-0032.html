			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Federal inspectors appointed by Energy Secretary James D. Watkins will visit  nuclear weapons plants in Tennessee, Texas and Ohio over the next five weeks to  check for compliance with environmental and safety rules, Watkins said. The  investigations are part of a broader effort by Watkins to identify  environmental and safety problems at the 17 major weapons plants owned by the  department and to attempt to reassure Congress that known flaws are being  corrected. The plants earmarked by Watkins for special investigations are the  Pantex weapons assembly plant at Amarillo, Tex.; the Y-12 plant in Oak Ridge,  Tenn., which processes uranium and other nuclear materials, and the Mound plant  near Dayton, Ohio, which produces detonators and other components for nuclear  weapons.  </P></p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Government Bonds: Short-dated UK gilts rally as Bank details next auction SHORT-DATED UK govern-ment bonds rallied yesterday, gaining a quarter of a point as the Bank of England announced details of its next auction. The Bank will offer Pounds 3bn of 7 1/4 per cent bonds due 1998 on April 28. However, the longer end of the gilt market was slightly depressed by the disappointing public sector borrowing requirement figure for March, which at Pounds 9.5bn was about Pounds 1.5bn worse than expected. The auction announcement generated some relief that the issue was no larger than expected, and the decision to make it partly payable on April 28, with the rest due a month later, was welcomed The price of the 7 1/4 bond due 1998 gained about a quarter point, more than making up the ground lost on Monday ahead of the auction announcement. Although the PSBR figure was described as 'shocking' by some dealers - representing an increase in government spending of about Pounds 5bn compared with March 1992 - the damage was limited at the longer end of the gilt market. The 8 per cent bond due 2003 and the 9 per cent due 2012 each lost roughly  1/8 . Dealers were reassured by the one-off aspects of some of the government spending, as departments used up allocation at the end of the year. Some buoyancy was also detected in income tax and VAT receipts, a trend which was expected to continue as economic recovery took hold. The increase in borrowing was not seen as a threat to the official forecast of Pounds 50bn for this year's PSBR, although some economists are now inclined to see it as a realistic - rather than a pessimistic - projection. Once this forthcoming auction is over, the government will have raised about a fifth of its borrowing requirement for 1993-94, said Mr Simon Briscoe, economist at Midland Global Markets. EUROPEAN government bond markets drifted lower in lacklustre trading as dealers are focusing on today's Bundesbank repo and tomorrow's Bundesbank Council meeting for signs of lower interest rates in Germany. German government bond prices slipped back a quarter-point as new supply helped to depress the market, dealers said. The Treuhand privatisation agency issued DM3bn of 10-year bonds with a 6.5 per cent coupon to the bond syndicate, and dealers expect a further DM6bn to DM7bn to be auctioned today. 'The new bond didn't stimulate much demand for long-dated paper,' said one dealer, who added that response to the issue was not particularly enthusiastic. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 96.34 and edged up to a high of 96.37 before drifting down to 96.10 by late afternoon. Dealers hope the Bundesbank will continue to allow a slight easing of interest rates at its repo, the results of which will emerge today. At last week's repo, the minimum rate was 8.11 per cent. Elsewhere in Europe, French government bonds ended lower on profit-taking. Monday's cuts in interest rates by the Bank of France prompted a rally in the French government bond market, but yesterday the market fell back and the June future closed down 0.26 at 117.86. THE combination of the yen's new high against the dollar and weakness in the Japanese stock market helped to push up Japanese government bond prices. The futures contract rose from 108.80 to 109.22 in Tokyo and then gained slightly to reach 109.25 in London. In the cash market, the yield on the benchmark No 145 bond moved from 4.25 per cent to 4.205 per cent. Further support was lent to the bond market by bearish remarks on the domestic economy from Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan. As expected, the ministry of finance auctioned Y800bn of 10-year bonds with a 4.5 per cent coupon, reopening the No 157 issue. The average price was 99.71, with a low of 99.60. US Treasury prices were mixed yesterday after shorter-dated issues firmed slightly on news of weak housing starts but longer-dated securities fell on profit-taking by retail accounts. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  13/32 at 104 3/4 , yielding 6.750 per cent. At the short end of the market, however, the two-year note was up  1/32 at 100 7/32 , to yield 3.739 per cent. Although the day's main economic figure - a 4.6 per cent drop in March housing starts - was in line with expectations, it still gave a small boost to the short end of the maturity spectrum, helping prices to hold their ground in a weak market. At the longer end, prices fell on retail profit-taking. Dealers remained mostly on the sidelines, content to trade the bond with the yield at 6.75 per cent. The only other activity of note was some modest selling of the 10-year note, which was reportedly hedging related to the Dollars 1bn Eurodollar issue by Abbey National, the UK financial services group. The Eurodollar deal was priced off 10-year notes.</p>

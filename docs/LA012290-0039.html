			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> COCAINE LINKED TO BIRTH DEFECTS  </P> <P> Cocaine use during pregnancy appears to be causing an epidemic of irreversible  birth defects, including heart defects and possible retardation. Babies born to  women who used cocaine during pregnancy tend to be smaller at birth and have  smaller head circumference, and may go through withdrawal like babies born to  women using heroin and methadone, said Bertis Little of University of Texas  Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.  </P> <P> Little and his colleagues recently reported that "cocaine infants" had  significantly more congenital heart defects, primarily holes in the heart  muscle. Such babies are also thought to face a greater risk of brain  hemorrhages and high blood pressure.  </P> <P> The study of 53 women who used cocaine continuously during pregnancy found that  their babies were 10 times more likely to have heart defects than those born to  women who did not use it.  </P> <P> "My major concern right now is that these kids might have some major structural  abnormalities" not detected at birth, Little said at an American Heart Assn.  seminar.  </P> <P> "One of the first things we want to do right now is a physical growth study to  see if small birth weight translates into small children," Little said. "We  want to see if reduced head circumference (at birth) translates into reduced  head circumference later on. If if does, that means they're going to be  developmentally delayed."  </P> <P> Some experts have estimated that 10% of pregnant women in the United States use  cocaine, Little said.  </P></p>

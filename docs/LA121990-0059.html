			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: KCET CALLS CHALLENGE TO LICENSE  'PREPOSTEROUS'  </P> <P> A conservative media watchdog group's challenge to Los Angeles public  television station KCET's broadcasting license is "preposterous," station  executives said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Committee on Media Integrity, chaired by conservative author David  Horowitz, filed the challenge Monday.  </P> <P> The organization asked that the FCC not renew KCET's license until the station  appoints an ombudsman, restructures its board of directors and holds more open  board meetings.  </P> <P> KCET spokeswoman Barbara Goen said station officials believe that Horowitz and  attorney Richard Perkins, secretary of the watchdog organization, are  retaliating against KCET for its refusal to acquiesce to their requests for  more conservative programming. Horowitz said that the call for an ombudsman and  an elected board was in the interest of all viewers, not just conservatives.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, KCET said Tuesday that it has decided to renew the beleaguered news  magazine "South Africa Now" through April. Beginning this week, the station  will label it "point of view." It will be the only program on Channel 28 to  carry such a label.  </P></p>

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Fate of Dollars 600m Bulgarian loan deal in balance The future of a Dollars 600m (Pounds 401m) International Monetary Fund and World Bank loan package, aimed to help Bulgaria settle its Dollars 9.3bn debt to the London Club of commercial banks, may be settled at a meeting of European Union finance ministers in Brussels today. The ministers are due to consider Bulgaria's request for Dollars 330m in balance of payments support for 1994 from the G24 group of countries. The positive response would enable the IMF to go ahead with new stand-by loans and funds designed to help the reform worth Dollars 400m. It would also unlock Dollars 200m in linked World Bank loans. The IMF cannot agree the loan unless Bulgaria has the necessary financial support needed to implement the economic reform programme it agreed with the Fund last December. Foreign financing is needed if Bulgaria is to meet its June 30 deadline to reschedule its Dollars 9.3bn foreign commercial debt. Under a framework agreement reached last November, the London Club banks chaired by Deutsche Bank, agreed to halve the debt. In return, Bulgaria said it would pay Dollars 850m immediately if it could get IMF and World Bank backing. Bulgarian officials say it is essential that G24 agrees the funding without delay because of the severe devaluation of the leva. The currency has lost 25 per cent of its value in the last month, making the 1994 budget unrealistic. 'Everything will fall apart if we do not get support from the G24. Otherwise we will have to renegotiate a whole new package with the IMF and the World Bank which could take months,' Mr Dimitar Kostov, deputy finance minister, said in an interview. Bulgaria is the last former East Bloc country (outside the former Soviet Union) with unresolved foreign commercial debt. Foreign investment, needed to finance the country's transition to a market economy, is not expected to pick up until the debt is settled. According to official figures, Bulgaria had attracted only Dollars 220m in foreign funds by the end of 1993, a fraction of the amount committed to other central European countries.</p>

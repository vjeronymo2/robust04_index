ULIMO is an armed  Liberian faction.    The deployment began on 1 March throughout the country to  disarm all the factions. In principle, this should have begun  under UN supervision on 7 March.    ULIMO guards at the Po River checkpoint told AFP: "We will  not allow ECOMOG to be deployed to our sector because we have  not received orders to that effect." They also reiterated their  request for "financial compensation before handing over their  arms."    Last week, ULIMO chairman, Alhaji Koromah, asked for $5  million from the United Nations to fund the reintegration of his  troops into civilian life.    On 1 March, General Ian Douglas, coordinator of the  reinsertion program of the United Nations Observer Mission in  Liberia, indicated that an "emergency fund" of $180,000 would be  granted.    During a visit to the Armed Forces of Liberia [AFL] camp in  Schieffelin, 20 km east of Monrovia, Gen. Douglas stressed that  "the aid would be effective only after disarmament, camping, and  demobilization" of the forces of the three leading armed  factions, the AFL, ULIMO, and the National Patriotic Front of  Liberia.</p>

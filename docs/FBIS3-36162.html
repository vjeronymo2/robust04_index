			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1700 GMT on 2 February, in its "Vesti" newscast,  broadcasts a 3-minute report by correspondent Gindileyev on  problems in the security service. The announcer introduces the  report by saying: "Our correspondent met with another  representative of the security service today. He said that an  entire subunit of the Interior Ministry has resigned."    The correspondent then takes up the story. He says: "The  `Vympel' team, one of the most secret subunits of the former  KGB'S directorate of intelligence services, was created in 1979.  Its aim was to carry out special operations, often military  operations on the territory of foreign states, for example, such  as the seizure of Amin's palace in Afghanistan. Nobody would  ever know about this unique subunit if it were not for the  October storm at the White House. Officers of `Vympel' and the  `Alfa' team at that moment refused to shoot and seized the White  House without a single shot. They saved thousands of lives. It  seems likely that some politicians did not like this  disobedience. The Russian president has issued an edict  according to which `Vympel' has been transferred to the Interior  Ministry. As a result, 110 out of 180 operational officers of  `Vympel' have resigned." The video shows the building of the  former KGB, then views of Afghanistan, then the seizure of the  White House in Moscow in October, and the faces of Khasbulatov  and Rutskoy when they surrendered. The video then cuts to show  the back of an unidentified person in a car speaking about  resignations in the "Vympel" team, who says:    "It is possible that we are talking emotionally at the  present time but nevertheless, the opinion of many employees  shows that this decree messed up, or more precisely, put an end  to the existence of subunits such as `Vympel.' In practice,  there will be nobody there soon. It seems likely that  practically the entire officers' corps will leave. Probably  some of them will go to commercial structures."    The announcer then concludes the report by saying: "It is  clear that we should pay special attention to the fate of these  people. In the end, peace of mind and security of the leaders of  the state themselves depend on where they will go and whom they  will join."</p>

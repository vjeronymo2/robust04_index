			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Smithson obituary insensitive Sir, Your architecture correspondent, Colin Amery, does himself no credit with his obituary on Alison Smithson ('A brutalist partnership dissolves', August 23). It is not so much an obituary as a continuation of his familiar polemic. It is true that Mr Amery recognises and pays tribute to the Economist group of buildings, but the remainder of the article reveals his visceral beliefs. Mr Amery's right to his opinions and to air them is not in question, but the brutal insensitivity of the headline and of the photograph illustrating his piece were less than chivalrous. There must be hundreds of photographs of the Economist building. The selection, which can hardly have been accidental, of a view taken through a fish-eye lens, with its ludicrous distortion, make his praise of the buildings seem a little hollow. Would that Alison were here to respond. Leonard Manasseh, Royal Academy of Arts, Piccadilly, London W1V 0D8</p>

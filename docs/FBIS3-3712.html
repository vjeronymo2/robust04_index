The conference was attended by over+ 300 people from the  prefectural, autonomous prefectural, city, and provincial  departments; large enterprises; large mines; some Changsha-based  institutions of higher learning party committee secretaries; and  the prefectural, autonomous prefectural, and city party  committee propaganda departments directors.

Wen Xuande, provincial party committee standing committee  member and propaganda department director, briefed the  participants on the agenda and main spirit of the recently  concluded national propaganda and ideological work conference.    Provincial party committee Secretary Wang Maolin delivered a  keynote speech, which was divided into the following three parts:    1. Further unify understanding of the extreme importance of  propaganda and ideological work in light of the overall national  interests during the crucial period.    2. Chart a clear-cut orientation for the province's  propaganda and ideological work in accordance with the basic  principles and major tasks spelt out by the central authorities.    3. Enable the party organizations at all levels to  practically strengthen leadership over and constantly improve  and refine propaganda and ideological work.    In his speech, Secretary Wang Maolin stated: The propaganda  and ideological front has been one of the important fronts for  building socialist modernization. The CPC has always attached  great importance to propaganda and ideological work. Ever since  the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee,  Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly called for attaching great  importance to ideological and political work and carrying it out  practically and conscientiously rather than slackening on it.    Secretary Wang Maolin said: At the recently concluded  national propaganda and ideological work conference, Comrade  Jiang Zemin expounded on the extreme importance of propaganda  and ideological work in the new period in light of the overall  national interests in the course of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics; laid stress on six work aspects; and  urged the party committees at all levels to strengthen  leadership over propaganda and ideological work. This year,  China's economic structural reform is to make bigger strides  toward building a socialist market economic structure on the  basis of a host of successful experiences over the past 15 years  and will, thereby, enter a crucial stage of comprehensive  development. At present, the whole party must work hard, grasp  each and every opportunity; deepen reform; expand opening up,  promote development, and maintain stability, this being tasks  facing Hunan's propaganda and ideological work also. Whether it  is possible or not to raise propaganda and ideological work to a  new level is bound to affect to a great extent the overall work  of the central authorities and also the entire party cause.    Speaking of charting a clear-cut orientation for the  province's propaganda and ideological work, Secretary Wang  Maolin noted: At the recent national conference, the CPC  Central Committee explicitly spelt out a series of principles  and tasks for propaganda and ideological work and called on the  whole party to take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics as the most basic  principle; arm the masses with scientific theories; guide the  masses with correct public opinion; indoctrinate the masses with  a lofty spirit; and encourage the masses with outstanding  literary and artistic works, these being the general and  strategic tasks aimed at intensifying propaganda and ideological  work in the course of building a socialist market economic  structure. The CPC Central Committee also put forward a  12-point principle, summing up both the historical and realistic  experiences in the party's propaganda and ideological work  during the socialist construction period and targeting a series  of major propaganda and ideological issues that have a sizable  impact on the country's overall interests. In order to  implement this principle and attain the abovementioned goals, we  should carry out work in a creative manner and in light of the  province's actual conditions. Hunan's propaganda and  ideological work should be primarily aimed at arming the broad  masses of the party members, cadres, and people with the theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; building a  socialist market economic structure; and training, in the long  run, a new generation of socialist people with lofty ideals,  moral integrity, a sense of discipline, and cultural  accomplishments.    Secretary Wang Maolin maintained: Comrade Jiang Zemin  solemnly stated at the recent national conference: The local  party organizations at all levels should assume greater  responsibility for propaganda and ideological work as well as  spiritual civilization building. To implement the spirit of  Comrade Jiang Zemin's instruction to the letter we should, first  and foremost, firmly adhere to a system under which party  committee secretaries at all levels constantly take personal  charge of and provide guidance to propaganda and ideological  workers; second, the party committees at all levels should  strive to establish a system under which propaganda and  ideological work is to be reviewed and appraised at regular  intervals; third, we should actively implement a system whereby  all party leaders are required to accomplish a number of two  civilizations building tasks during their tenure of office;  fourth, we should build an effective leadership system and a  sound management system for each and every propaganda and  ideological department; fifth, we should gradually increase  input in propaganda and cultural undertakings; and sixth, we  should work hard to create a sound environment under which  qualified personnel are able to develop their talents and skills  with ease and comfort.    Yang Zhengwu, provincial party committee deputy secretary,  also delivered a speech at the conference.</p>

			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses retreat as Bush speech fails to impress MOST BOURSES moved lower yesterday on profit-taking, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT made a technical correction. After a 1.65 decline to 680.93 in the FAZ at midsession, the DAX closed 10.68 lower at 1,672.40 as volume rose from DM5.9bn to DM6.4bn. Carmakers lost what they had gained on Tuesday, since the State of the Union speech from the US president, Mr George Bush, contained nothing of the rumoured repeal, or cut in the US tax on luxury cars. Daimler fell DM5.70 to DM746 and Porsche by DM16 to DM595. Deutsche Bank also lost what it had gained in London after hours on Tuesday, after it raised its dividend from DM14 to DM15. It closed at DM700, down DM4.50 on the day and DM7.70 from its London price on Tuesday. Chemicals were weak after a recent improvement, while steels fell by more than average as they awaited strike ballot news. Retailers were mixed, with some authorities expecting first-half stagnation and others saying that the winter sales, which started on Monday, were going well. ZURICH extended Tuesday afternoon's adverse London reaction to the downgrading of Credit Suisse long-term debt by Moody's, the ratings agency, which also put Swiss Bank Corp on its watchlist. The SPI index fell 10.4 to 1,108.7, and bearer shares in SBC topped the active list as they fell SFr19 to SFr292. CS Holding, the parent of Credit Suisse, had already discounted the downgrading and its bearers fell SFr5 from the London overnight price to SFr1,905. STOCKHOLM dropped after the cabinet's rejection of the proposed Volvo-Procordia merger. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 9.6 to 973.7 and Volvo B by another SKr5 to SKr385. A story that the deal was a precursor to a merger between Volvo and Renault of France hit general sentiment. Ericsson B fell SKr5 to SKr124 and Electrolux B by SKr6 to SKr242. The forestry sector was the biggest loser, down 2.2 per cent. Dealers attributed the decline to the fall in the dollar, which affects the profitability of exported paper and pulp. PARIS tried to turn higher after a mixed start but was hit by an uncertain opening on Wall Street. The CAC 40 index fell 10.96 to 1,879.64, in turnover of FFr2.4bn. Paribas, which is backing the construction company Fougerolle's bid for SAE, fell FFr12.50 or 3.4 per cent to FFr355. Lagarge-Coppee fell FFr7.6 to FFr323 on rumours of a costly dispute with minority shareholders in its Spanish subsidiary Asland. Takeover speculation in the drinks sector lifted Pernod-Ricard by FFr40 to FFr1,495. MILAN closed little changed as early gains inspired by Tuesday's record close on Wall Street were wiped out by profit-taking. The Comit index eased 0.24 to 545.07 in turnover estimated at close to Tuesday's L87bn. Olivetti fell L70 or 2.6 per cent to L2,665 in thin volume, in response to news of a partnership between France's Bull and IBM. Fiat hardly reacted to its 1991 preliminary results announced after the close on Tuesday. Its ordinary shares closed L41 higher at L5,161, but then tumbled to L5,070 after hours. Fiat's results prompted some analysts to issue sell notes. James Capel said that there was a real risk that the dividend would be cut, and that with a 1991 earnings multiple of 41.5 and a probably unsustainable historic yield of 7.1 per cent, the shares looked substantially overvalued. AMSTERDAM fell back in moderate trading, with the CBS Tendency Index down 0.9 to 121.1. DAF rose Fl 0.60 or 2.5 per cent to Fl 24.80 on car industry talk that the truck manufacturer was a possible takeover candidate. Elsevier rose Fl 1.80 to Fl Fl 103.00 as some analysts took a view that the publisher was undervalued. Nedlloyd pulled back Fl 1.20 to Fl 58.70 as the fun sparked by Tuesday's supervisory board appointments wore off. Fokker closed unchanged at Fl 30.0 in spite of earlier activity on reports that one of its aircraft was being considered by SAS. MADRID firmed during early trading but closed weaker, the general index down 1.19 at 253.87. Asland, the cement group, shed Pta100 to Pta2,105 on rumours of a dispute. The construction group Ocisa put on Pta350 to Pta4,550 on news of the takeover bid for SAE in which it holds a 15 per cent stake. ISTANBUL fell slightly in a continued correction after gains on Monday when the index rose above 5,100. The 75-share index closed at 4,983.25, down 36.35.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JAN 29  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     Close 1140.44  1140.21  1139.20  1135.79  1134.96  1133.15  1132.10  1132.85  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       Day's High  1140.50            Day's Low  1131.24  -----------------------------------------------------------------------     Jan 28      Jan 27      Jan 24      Jan 23      Jan 22    1143.22     1142.52     1131.86     1131.98     1134.07  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

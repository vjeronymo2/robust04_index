The symposium, sponsored by the EPA, opened Thursday in  Tokyo  as part of the educational assistance for Russia's economic  reforms pledged by Japan in May 1993.    Russian participants to the symposium, the second of its  kind  following one in March 1993, included Andrey Shapovalyants,  first vice economic minister, Aleksey Ulyukayev, deputy director  of the institute for economy in transition, and Vladimir Volkov,  deputy chief of the department of the social and economic  development.    Japanese participants included Shinyasu Hoshino, president  of  the National Institute for Research Advancement, Nobuyoshi  Araki, chief economist at the East and West Research Institute,  and Masashi Kato, the EPA's vice minister for international  economic affairs.    According to the EPA official, the participants discussed  macroeconomic aspects of the problem of inflation in Russia  under which consumer prices rose by 9.4 times and wholesale  prices tenfold during 1993.    They also talked about the sharp drop in investment in  Russia, to the point that it is difficult even to renew obsolete  equipment and facilities.    The Russian participants reported at the symposium that  Russia's efforts to introduce market economy have now come to  the stage of "irreversibility." But its economy is still in  poor condition, with gross national product contracting by 12  percent and industrial output dropping by 16.2 percent in 1993  from the previous year, they said.</p>

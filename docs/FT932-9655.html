			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Miyazawa denies Cambodia pullout MR KIICHI Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, yesterday gave assurances the country would not withdraw from a United Nations peace-keeping operation in Cambodia, but said the government would renew requests for tighter security for Japanese participants. Controversy over the killing last week of a Japanese police officer has threatened not only Tokyo's role in the Cambodian operation, but challenged the country's longer-term policy of taking an international political profile appropriate to its economic influence. Over the past few days, the Japanese mainstream media has improbably suggested that the peace-keepers were unfairly exposed to risk in Cambodia, that the operation was designed to go wrong to ensure a greater domestic role for Japan's military, and even that the depth of reaction to the killing is due to the unique emphasis that Japanese put on the value of life. In the face of sustained criticism, a government poorly prepared for the likelihood of casualties has fumbled badly in attempting to justify the presence in Cambodia. Mr Miyazawa, in a specially called press conference yesterday, attempted to put the UN peacekeeping operations in a broader context and to put Japan's international ambitions back on course. 'We have a commitment to assist in the Cambodian election process, and we will honour that commitment,' Mr Miyazawa said. 'The death of the officer is regrettable, and I, as the head of government, feel responsible.' In spite of Mr Miyazawa's assurances yesterday, it is clear that the peace-keeping policy could collapse if there are further casualties. A retreat would compromise Japan's campaign for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and make it very difficult for the government to commit troops to future peace-keeping operations. As well as the police officer killed last week, four others were injured in the same ambush, apparently by the Khmer Rouge guerrilla group, which has boycotted the election. The Japanese government, fearing that casualties could rise sharply after the election on May 23, have hinted the peace-keeping policy will be reviewed after the vote, but is likely to wait for other leading countries to withdraw before pulling out. In addition to the 75 civilian police and 600 military personnel already sent to Cambodia, 41 Japanese election monitors left Tokyo yesterday, 12 fewer than originally planned. The government has requested that the monitors be sent to secure areas, and is still negotiating with the UN on improving conditions for the police. However, Mr Keijiro Murata, the home affairs minister, who has just visited Cambodia, said the government should not be seen to be asking for special treatment for Japanese police, although it should ensure that they have enough water, food and other supplies to perform their duties. 'There is really a very large gap between the perception Japanese have of the UN operations and the international perception. We have to be aware of that gap,' Mr Murata said.</p>

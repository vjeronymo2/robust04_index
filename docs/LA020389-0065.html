			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> L.A. ASKED TO HALT 3 STORES' LIQUOR SALES  </P> <P> A Pacoima neighborhood group has asked a Los Angeles zoning board to consider  canceling permits that allow liquor to be sold at three businesses that police  say are havens for drunks, drug dealers and gang members.  </P> <P> The request will be heard at a public hearing before a city zoning  administrator Feb. 10. It concerns Leon's Liquor and Junior Market, in the  10900 block of Glenoaks Boulevard; John's Liquor, in the 13100 block of Van  Nuys Boulevard; and Pacoima Food Market, in the 13000 block of Van Nuys  Boulevard.  </P> <P> The hearing was prompted by complaints from the Hansen Hills Neighborhood Assn.  and police, said Greg Jackson, a spokesman for Los Angeles City Councilman  Ernani Bernardi, whose district includes the area.  </P> <P> In a petition sent to Bernardi's office, the association charged that the  stores have sold liquor to minors and that constant loitering and gang and drug  activity have occurred near them, Jackson said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Several Arrests Made  </P> <P> Sgt. Wayne Woolway of the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed that several  arrests have been made at or near the stores for these and other offenses.  </P> <P> Woolway said the stores' owners have not worked with police to curtail criminal  activity in the area.  </P> <P> Farah Ammari, owner of Pacoima Food Market, said he has tried to discourage  such activity outside his store. Ammari said he spent $70,000 to install more  lights and to erect a 10-foot wrought-iron fence around his parking lot to keep  out drug dealers and gang members.  </P> <P> "What else can I do? I can't control the streets," Ammari said. "That is the  job of Darryl Gates, not me."  </P> <P> Ammari admitted that he sold liquor to minors a couple of times in the past.  "That is no big deal," he said. "Every store has done it. It is no reason to  destroy a business."  </P> <P> Ammari, who has operated his store for 15 years, said some customers have  offered to speak on his behalf at the hearing.  </P> <P> John Chung, owner of John's Liquor, said he believes his store has been  unfairly singled out. "It's just the city picking on me because of the  pressure" from the association, Chung said.  </P> <P> "It used to be bad around here, but now it is clean," Chung said, adding that  he had installed more lights outside his store to discourage loiterers.  "There's no drug dealing in front of my store. It's quiet and clean."  </P></p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Tax wizard takes over the helm at Hanson / Derek Bonham talks about his new role as chief executive of the Anglo-American conglomerate Hanson's appointment of Mr Derek Bonham to the newly created post of chief executive begs a simple question: what does the job entail? For the Anglo-American conglomerate, run by Lords Hanson and White, has never before named a second in command. In an interview with the FT, Mr Bonham, sporting a Hanson tie and tanned after spending the weekend with the two lords in Beverly Hills, said the job would be 'whatever I can create out of it'. He was unequivocal that his remit extended across both sides of the Atlantic. Just as he had been the group's financial director, spending a large amount of his time in the US, so he will now be in charge of managing Hanson's worldwide businesses - including those in the US. This makes the position of chief executive the most senior post ever created within the conglomerate. Mr Bonham said the reason was to make it clear to investors that the management structure would be in place for the rest of the decade, given the advancing years of the two lords. He also believes it will deter other companies from taking a lead from Imperial Chemical Industries - in which Hanson has a 2.8 per cent stake - and attacking the group for its poor corporate governance. 'All the ducks are now in the right place,' said Mr Bonham. 'James (Lord Hanson) is a very youthful 70-year-old but he wants to make sure the younger team is in place under him.' Mr Bonham, recruited to Hanson in 1971 by Mr Brian Hellings, senior director responsible for finance in the US, became a board member in 1981. In such a sweeping managerial reshuffle Mr Bonham conceded that the role of other Hanson executives would change. Lord Hanson, who has traditionally managed the businesses, is to leave more day-to-day decisions to his new chief executive. 'Lord Hanson is to have more of an ambassadorial role, to which he is ideally suited. I plan to take a lot of the managerial work, including meeting with the institutional investors, off his shoulders,' said Mr Bonham. Indeed, Mr Bonham believes Lord Hanson may decide to become a non-executive chairman. Whatever the outcome, he is confident that one man will not hold the reins of chief executive and chairman at Hanson again. Lord White, who has already delegated much of the daily running of the US businesses to his deputy, Mr David Clarke, will continue to have a roving brief trying to spot the next acquisitions, which Mr Bonham believes are likely to be in continental Europe. Mr Bonham said Mr Clarke, Lord White's chief executive and deputy in the US, would continue to have an 'enormous job'. In describing what could be a difficult relationship - Mr Clarke yesterday suggested Mr Bonham's remit would not extend to what he called Lord White's domain - Mr Bonham used the current partnership between Lords Hanson and White as an example of how he sees the partnership between the two developing. 'A good chunk of what I am doing is based over here. But there are no rigid boxes and there has to be integration between the US and the UK. Just as James is chairman of the group so I am chief executive of Hanson plc.' The appointment is bound to be something of a disappointment to Mr Tony Alexander, the 53-year-old chief operating officer in the UK. Mr Bonham said he would continue to manage the UK businesses. One of Hanson's financial advisers commented of Mr Bonham's appointment: 'This underpins the importance not just of tax wizardry but of tough financial controls and squeezing as much cash as possible out of the businesses.' Such a view was an over-simplification, said Mr Bonham. As the architect of Hanson's tax policy, which led to the group paying one of the lowest corporation tax charges in the FT-SE 100 top companies, Mr Bonham is anxious not to exaggerate the important of finance. But he said: 'Finance is the largest part of the Hanson head office.'</p>

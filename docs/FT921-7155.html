			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Gloves come off in fight for Exor: BSN's counter-bid intensifies pressure on the Agnellis The battle between Nestle of Switzerland and the Agnelli family of Italy for Perrier, the French mineral water company, is set to come to a head following last Friday's intervention by BSN, the French food group. BSN sent a clear signal that it was siding, not with its old allies, the Agnellis, but with Nestle, its chief competitor, by announcing a FFr6bn (Pounds 610m) counter-bid for Exor, the French property company that controls Perrier and for which the Agnellis have already agreed terms for a FFr5.6bn friendly takeover. The BSN counter-bid is clearly designed to intensify pressure on the Agnellis to negotiate a settlement in the Perrier battle which has been brewing since Nestle launched its FFr13.42bn hostile bid four weeks ago. 'Nestle wants Perrier. We want Volvic (one of the Perrier waters). The Agnellis want to make a profit. If we negotiate we can all get what we want,' said Mr Antoine Riboud, BSN's veteran chairman. Meanwhile, the outcome of two French court cases will be critical for Nestle in determining its negotiating power. The commercial court in Nimes is expected shortly to deliver its judgment on whether Exor can exercise full voting rights over its 35 per cent of Perrier. The second case starts this Tuesday in Paris when the commercial court considers Nestle's appeal to annul the recent acquisition of 14 per cent of Perrier by Saint Louis, the French sugar company allied to the Agnellis. Unless Nestle wins at least one case, its bid will fail, given that Exor and Saint Louis control 49 per cent of Perrier. Nestle would be a minority investor at loggerheads with the management. If Nestle wins one or both cases, it will fight for shareholder support against the Perrier board, chaired by Mr Jacques Vincent, also chairman of Exor. Mr Vincent would have to decide whether to take on Nestle with a counter-bid for Perrier by Exor. He may be forced to anyhow, after a ruling due on Thursday by the French stock market authorities. The alternative would be for the Agnellis to succumb to pressure from Nestle and BSN to negotiate a settlement. BSN and Fiat have cross-shareholdings and the two companies have significant joint interests in the Italian food industry. Nestle first tried this approach when it met the Agnellis in Italy in January. The Agnellis were then in the early stages of their friendly bid for Exor. The bid, begun as a partial offer for 66 per cent of the company, had already run into controversy in France after complaints from minority shareholders, notably the Suez industrial group. Also at the meeting was Lazard Freres, the Parisian bank which, as a long-standing adviser to the Agnellis and the biggest single shareholder in BSN, had been instrumental in fostering their joint interests. Lazard and BSN had supported the Agnellis's diversification into France until early last year when the Italians bought a stake in Exor without consulting them. Lazard became anxious about its relationship with the Agnellis. Nestle was concerned that the Agnellis's Exor bid would scupper its hopes of buying Perrier, but the Agnellis decided to continue to support the existing management under Mr Vincent. That prompted Nestle's hostile bid for Perrier in conjunction with Indosuez, part of the Suez group, in which it was advised by Lazard. Nestle has continued to press for negotiation. Last Monday in Paris Mr Riboud met Mr Gianni Agnelli of Fiat and older brother of Umberto, who has led the family's drive into France. Mr Riboud suggested a solution. BSN would bid for Exor and give its Exor shares to Nestle in return for Volvic. Nestle would give those shares back to the Agnellis in return for a 20 per cent stake in Perrier. Mr Agnelli did not respond. So, on Friday, BSN counter-bid, supported by Lazard and Indosuez. Mr Riboud described the counter-bid as a strategic move to 'step up the pressure on the Agnellis to persuade them to negotiate.' Both he and Mr Domeniconi say they are convinced the Agnellis would negotiate if it were not for Mr Vincent's objections. They may also hope to play on any rift between Mr Gianni Agnelli and Umberto, whom he has reluctantly named as his heir apparent at Fiat. So far Mr Umberto Agnelli, as head of the family's French interests, has called the shots in the Perrier affair, but it is his older brother who takes the decisions as illustrated by his meeting last Monday with Mr Riboud. It remains to be seen whether the gamble will come off. The BSN counter-bid could make it more difficult for the Agnellis to negotiate without being seen to lose face. This could be what their opponents want. After all, BSN, Suez and Lazard resent the Agnellis' investment in Exor. This raises questions about the wider implications of the Agnellis's ambitions in France and for the future of their joint interests with BSN in Italy. Mr Riboud maintains the Italian ventures will not be affected by the counter-bid. 'France is France. Italy is Italy,' he said. He should soon discover if the Agnellis agree.

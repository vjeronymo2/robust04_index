			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese sales give copper price another battering COPPER PRICES took another battering yesterday as Chinese selling pushed them down to Dollars 1,750 a tonne or 79.40 cents a lb on the London Metal Exchange, their lowest for five and a half years. The collapse in copper, the most heavily traded metal, has been swift and dramatic. In the past month the price has plummeted by more than 19 per cent from Dollars 2,170 a tonne or 98.45 cents a lb. At the begining of the year it was about Dollars 2,400. 'The copper price has been far too high. In recessions metal prices should go down. But speculative activity and nervousness about possible big interruptions to supply kept copper high. Copper producers have been making lots of money when in their cyclical business they should have been losing money,' pointed out Mr Stephen Briggs, analyst at the Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services consultancy organisation. LME stocks had now built up to a nine-year peak of 392,325 tonnes to give a buffer against disruptions, he added. Mr Briggs suggested copper producers would suffer in the future because high prices had encouraged new capacity so copper would not benefit as much as some other base metals as the world economy recovered. 'That is not to say that the price will remain at 80 cents (a lb) or below for the foreseeable future - it just won't see Dollars 1.50 as some have been suggesting.' Mr Briggs said copper prices were unlikely to fall much below 70 cents a lb or Dollars 1,543 a tonne. 'The big issue now is whether there will be production cuts. Some medium-sized and small producers in Australia and Canada will be really hurting at today's prices. But we know from recent experience in the aluminium, zinc and lead industries that people will stare at terrible prices for a long time before taking any action.' A key element in copper's fall has been the switch by the Chinese from being big buyers of the metal to being substantial sellers. Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, pointed out: 'Many metal-using Chinese enterprises have become very cautious about their buying programmes over the last few months because of the fall in their currency, the renminbi, against the US dollar. This caution has fed through to the Chinese merchants operating in the world market. They cannot hedge the renminbi against the dollar and are increasingly restricting their purchases to a hand-to-mouth basis.' Copper for delivery in three months on the LME closed only slightly above the day's low last night at Dollars 1,756 a tonne (79.7 cents a lb). In sterling terms, three-month copper closed at Pounds 1,133.50 a tonne, down Pounds 52. Westmin Resources has declared force majeure on zinc and copper concentrates from its Myra Falls mine as a result of a labour dispute, reports Reuter from Vancouver. The Vancouver Island mine last year produced 68,000 tonnes of copper concentrate and 59,000 tonnes of zinc concentrates.</p>

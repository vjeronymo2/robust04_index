			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Employment Minister Michel Giraud by </F> Beatrice Taupin and Jean-Louis Validire; place and date not  given: "Michel Giraud: The Five-Year Law Is in Line With the  Measures Taken in Other Countries"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [FIGARO] The G-7 is to devote  its Detroit summit to the question of employment. What views  does France wish to share with the other members on this subject?    [Giraud] The seven major industrialized countries meeting in  Detroit will exchange views on the measures they are taking to  counter unemployment which is affecting everyone. A year since  the idea of a G-7 meeting on employment was proposed, I have  seen a degree of convergence in views and proposals. All the  industrialized countries are concentrating on in-depth,  structural, and medium-term measures. These consist of reducing  the overall cost of poorly qualified labor in order to fight  youth unemployment; substantial reform of the relationship  between education and industry through the development of  alternating work and study schemes and vocational training  programs; the modernization of labor regulations allowing  greater flexibility in working time and the development of  part-time work; and the reorganization of employment services  with a view to making them more efficient.    Whether we are talking about the OECD report, the white  paper  adopted by the European Council at the end of the last year, or  the draft law to be proposed by President Clinton, the direction  taken is the same in every case. The interest for France and, I  hope, for all the G-7 countries lies in the fact that these  measures coincide with those proposed in our five-year law on  labor, employment, and vocational training.    [FIGARO] Is it not paradoxical that this meeting will focus  only on the microeconomic aspects of the problem when a  coordination of macroeconomic policies would seem essential?    [Giraud] It is true that the G-7 has traditionally been a  forum for macroeconomic concertation. This unprecedented  meeting is, nevertheless, the sign that the public authorities  are becoming increasingly aware not only of the interaction  between macroeconomics and microeconomics, but also of the fact  that the latter cannot be neglected in favor of the former. It  is a good sign that this trend is now being observed in the  industrialized countries. We need time and effort, as well as  good will, for this point to get through to the leaders of all  the countries in the world. The end of the ideological  confrontation that has dominated the world stage for  three-quarters of a century gives us the opportunity and even  the duty to once again put the individual at the center of  society's concerns.

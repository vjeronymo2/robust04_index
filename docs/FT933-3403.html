			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Profits growth slows at EIS LOWER interest income following last year's five acquisitions for a total of Pounds 12m in cash slowed the rise in pre-tax profits at EIS Group, the specialist engineer, to Pounds 7.86m in the six months to June 30. That compared with Pounds 7.34m last time and was scored on the back of a Pounds 28.4m improvement in turnover to Pounds 123.9m. 'In April we said that the current arduous climate was likely to continue through 1993 and we did not see the worldwide downturn in demand for capital goods ending this year. This has proved to be correct so far,' Mr Peter Haslehurst, chief executive, said. He added that 'about Pounds 25m of the sales increase reflected acquisitions made in the second half of 1992, including Fluidrive and Sime, the transmission companies, for a net Pounds 4.7m, and the Silleck technical mouldings companies for Pounds 3.74m,' he added. First half acquisitions contributed Pounds 528,000 to turnover compared with Pounds 2.1m in the first half of 1992. Operating profits rose to Pounds 7.73m (Pounds 6.73m). 'Most of the growth in profits came from organic growth which in this market is generated by reductions in costs, by design and by improvements in manufacturing productivity.' EIS, which manufactures in 18 countries, said Flexibox had made progress by developing markets such as seals for environmental protection. There was some improvement in machinery for plastic, and wire and cable production. The vacuum and filtration markets remained difficult while aircraft and precision engineering companies traded in 'thin conditions'. Interest received fell to Pounds 80,000 (Pounds 573,000). The company said this reflected its 1992 acquisitions. The Pounds 24m rights issue in April had been successful, with the proceeds received in June remaining intact. The cash would allow further acquisitions. The interim dividend is being lifted from 3.225p to 3.3p from earnings per share of 13.12p (12.48p).</p>

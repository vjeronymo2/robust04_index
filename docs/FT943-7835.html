			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Dog days for the dollar It is bad luck for the US Federal Reserve that the warm glow of approval for its half-point rise in interest rates lasted less than a day. Survey data pointing to inflationary pressure in the US economy - and a slight worsening of the bilateral trade deficit with Japan - subsequently sent the dollar back below Y100 and DM1.55. Stock and bond markets fell in sympathy. But the authorities should not be surprised. The consistent message from the markets this year is that rising interest rates are only one ingredient in the recipe for a stronger dollar. The Bundesbank's decision not to cut rates this week also suggests that interest rate differentials may not be as favourable as dollar bulls had hoped. The German central bank's tough line this week contrasts with lingering doubts about the willingness of the Fed to tackle inflation if its latest measures prove to be inadequate. Even if the Bundesbank cuts rates again this autumn, financial markets will herald the floor in German rates - which could again be bad news for the dollar. This need not imply a currency crisis. The dollar closed the week a shade above the lows last month and higher interest rates may start to attract investors into short-dated dollar assets. But it is difficult to imagine overseas investors flooding into US stocks and bonds while the uncertain climate persists. With no sign of progress on trade and nagging worries about inflation - not to mention President Bill Clinton's renewed political difficulties - the dollar looks certain to remain vulnerable.</p>

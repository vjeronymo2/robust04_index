			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy Given that early summer sales in June had tempted shoppers and produced stronger retail sales figures, it is hardly surprising that consumer credit also grew during the month. Indeed, the strength of credit card advances reinforces the idea that bargain hunters are prepared to buy when prices are right. Whether the trend will continue once the sales end will be the real test of consumer confidence. Yet unless the picture deteriorates badly, there is little pressure for an interest rate cut to bolster growth. Nor is there a need to offset an appreciation of the pound, since sterling's trade-weighted index has fallen over the past two weeks. So short gilts weakened yesterday as the prospect of interest rate cuts receded, while the long end of the market took heart from the fact that inflationary pressures remain weak. The recent powerful rally has not been slowed by the supply of new issues, even though the government is well ahead with this year's funding programme. Banks, overseas buyers and retail investors seem happy to support the market, especially with the prospect of lower interest rates in the autumn to counter any fiscal tightening in the November budget. Any sign of renewed inflation would, however, undermine that complacency.</p>

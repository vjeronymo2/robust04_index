			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARE LATINO PARENTS TO BLAME?  </P> <P> A child's family is almost always the best clue to how he or she will do in  school. If mom and dad -- or just one of them -- care enough about what goes on  in class to get involved with the process -- from helping with homework to PTA  bake sales -- that student is going to do well.  </P> <P> So Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos isn't completely off base when he  says part of the blame for the appalling dropout rate among Latino students  lies with parents who are not as involved with their children's education as  they should be. But Cavazos is oversimplifying a complex social problem and,  among all national education leaders, he should know better.  </P> <P> A Mexican American, Cavazos was appointed to the Cabinet by two different  presidents to give a Latino perspective on education, Topic A to most Latinos.  As one of the nation's largest and fastest-growing immigrant groups, Latinos  know upward mobility in this country starts where it did for all the immigrants  who preceded them: in American schools.  </P> <P> But the world in which Latino children -- in fact, all youngsters -- grow up  today is far more challenging than what previous generations faced. There is  less manual labor today, so more schooling is needed just to qualify for the  most basic jobs. In too many families both parents must work merely to make  ends meet, leaving less time to help with homework or attend school meetings.  There are more distractions for modern kids, from relatively benign things like  radio and TV to real dangers like gangs and drugs. Add the language barrier for  many Latinos, and you have an inkling of how daunting a task Latino parents  face just getting their kids through high school, much less college.  </P> <P> Educators argue, with some evidence to back them up, that getting Latino  parents involved in the schools requires special efforts at outreach --  inviting them in Spanish and making them feel welcome at the school. But that  takes extra time and money when schools are scrambling just to pay for basics  like textbooks and computers. So Cavazos' challenge is not just prodding  resistant Latino parents, but reluctant public officials (like his boss,  President Bush) to ante up more money for innovative efforts that help the  learning process along. If Cavazos could pull that off, Latino students  wouldn't be the only ones to benefit.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSIAL ABORTION PILL  </P> <P> Your editorial says doctors have a "responsibility" under the Hippocratic oath  to give people RU-486 "as a safe alternative to surgical abortions."  </P> <P> This would be news to Hippocrates. His oath, the basis for civilized medicine,  states, "I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor will  I make a suggestion to this effect. Similarly, I will not give a woman an  abortive remedy. In purity and holiness I will guard my life and my art."  </P> <P> MICHAEL ENGLER  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Student loan admin condemned The administrative costs of student loans are diverting public funds paid to universities for educational purposes, a report by the Commons public accounts committee said yesterday. Student loans were introduced in 1990 and are administered by the Student Loans Company, a government body. The committee reported that universities found the average cost of processing loan applications was about Pounds 7, while the company only paid institutions Pounds 4 for each loan processed. It said: 'We are concerned that the company's current level of payments to higher education institutions may be insufficient to cover the administration costs that they incur and this could cause funds provided for educational purposes to be used on the administration of student loans.' Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, described the finding as 'quite unacceptable', and said: 'This situation will only get worse following the Budget cuts in student grants.' The committee noted that it was not official government policy to encourage students to take out loans, and it questioned the amount spent on advertising the scheme in 1990, saying that students should have been aware of the scheme from other sources. Planning assumptions that 80 per cent of eligible students would take out the maximum loan had been inaccurate, as only 28 per cent did so in the first year. The committee was 'concerned that these assumptions led to the company's incurring higher administration and accommodation costs than turned out to be necessary'. Total entry to universities still lags behind most of the country's international competitors in spite of the recent expansion in student numbers, a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development showed yesterday. The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals warned that the British could become the 'village idiots of Europe' if expansion did not continue. Using 1991 figures, the latest available, the OECD said 28 per cent of the UK's 18-year-olds had entered 'tertiary' education, a category that includes specialist colleges as well as universities. The total entry to higher education has risen this year to 31 per cent. Switzerland had a lower figure, with 27 per cent, but several other nations sent a much larger proportion of young people to university. The US had the highest proportion (65 per cent), Japan had 53 per cent, Australia 52 per cent, and Germany 45 per cent. The Administration of Student Loans, Committee of Public Accounts, 62nd report.

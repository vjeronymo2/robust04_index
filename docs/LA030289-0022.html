			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAGIC SCORES 35 POINTS AS LAKERS AVENGE LOSS TO WARRIORS, 142-121  </P> <P> Every time Magic Johnson made a solo foray through the lane Wednesday night  against the Golden State Warriors at the Forum, it brought back painful  memories among Laker watchers, if not Johnson himself.  </P> <P> It was exactly three weeks ago Wednesday -- same opponent, same site -- that  Johnson partially tore his left hamstring after making one of those twisting  layups, resulting in two weeks of forced inactivity.  </P> <P> Wednesday night's sequel between the Lakers and Warriors, however, bore little  resemblance to that Feb. 8 night of upset and injury. This time, Johnson scored  35 points from inside, outside and everywhere in between as the Lakers avenged  a rare home-court loss by pounding the Warriors, 142-121, before 17,505.  </P> <P> If any doubt lingered as to whether Johnson had fully recovered from his  injury, it was definitively answered with one of his most dominant performances  of the season and certainly his best since returning three games ago.  </P> <P> All Johnson did in three quarters of action was make 13 of 20 shots, including  four three-pointers, grab a season-high 14 rebounds and pass for 8 assists. Had  the Lakers needed Johnson at all in the fourth quarter of this blowout, he  probably would have registered his first post-injury triple-double.  </P> <P> That was of little concern to the Lakers, who extended their Pacific Division  lead to 3 1/2 games over idle Phoenix. More important, perhaps, was that  Johnson touched down from each drive without a grimace or a limp and usually  with another Laker basket.  </P> <P> "Don't remind me of that (Feb. 8) game," Johnson said, wincing slightly. "I  couldn't think about that. I was just going right at them. I never get scared  or worried about getting hurt. You just got to continue to drive and see what  happens."  </P> <P> Johnson wasn't the only offensive weapon for the Lakers, only the most potent  one.  </P> <P> Byron Scott benefited from the Lakers' running game by scoring 11 of his 25  points in a 46-point third quarter. A.C. Green had 18 points and 12 rebounds,  James Worthy 15 points and nine rebounds and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 12 points and  eight rebounds.  </P> <P> But it was Johnson, supported by excellent team defense and a 66-40 rebounding  edge, who was responsible for the blowout.  </P> <P> When he wasn't driving through the crowded lane for twisting layups or drawing  fouls and a pounding, he was swishing long-distance shots that eventually  opened gaps in the lane through which he could have driven a Buick.  </P> <P> "He was strong tonight," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. "Real strong. When he  drives to the basket now, he drives with force. He doesn't let the opponent  strong-arm him. It opened things up. I mean, at 6-foot-9, 220, he can do that.  I think that's something he's learned the last three years."  </P> <P> Another thing Johnson has learned, painfully so, is how to swiftly recuperate  from injuries. He said he did not rush back, made sure he was fit and now  totally forgets about his hamstring when he steps onto the court.  </P> <P> "I think I'm all the way back now, except maybe for my conditioning," Johnson  said. "Last game, I was better. This game, better. Not only my game, but my  condition. I don't think I'm far away at all. Another one or two games, and  I'll be (the way he was).  </P> <P> "You feel good being able to do things like before tonight, the twisting layups  and things. You have to do that."  </P> <P> The Lakers, obviously, are happy to have him back. They survived during his  absence, winning three of five games. But since Johnson's return, the Lakers  (38-17) have recorded three straight blowout victories against Pacific Division  teams at the Forum.  </P> <P> Just as they did to the Suns three nights earlier, the Lakers came out strong  and dominated the Warriors from the start.  </P> <P> They led by seven points after the first quarter and stretched the advantage to  17 by halftime.  </P> <P> Then came perhaps the Lakers' best third quarter of the season, the 46-point  quarter that gave them a 33-point lead heading into the final quarter.  </P> <P> In the third, the Lakers held a 25-5 rebounding advantage, forced Golden State  to make just 40% of its shots, held Chris Mullin (25 points) to only two free  throws and converted seven fast-break opportunities for baskets. Then, there  was Johnson, who sank three three-point shots and drove the lane with abandon.  </P> <P> So dominant were the Lakers that they rendered the inevitable matchup problems  moot. Golden State starts four guards and 6-8 Larry Smith at center, but then  can bring in 7-7 Manute Bol and change a game's flow entirely.  </P> <P> But, unlike the three-point loss on Feb. 8, the Lakers handled every  combination the Warriors threw at them.  </P> <P> "We were concerned with the matchups," Riley said. "You have to get them before  they get to you. The key was rebounding. In that third quarter, we had  something like a 24-6 advantage. If you let a team of 6-5 guys outrebound you  and run, you'll get blown out."  </P> <P> Instead, the Warriors (31-22) were on the receiving end.  </P> <P> "We just got blown out," Coach Don Nelson said. "It happens several times a  year, but it hadn't happened to us in a while. This was total domination.  </P> <P> "They did everything they wanted to do. They beat us in the rebounding game,  the shooting game, the defensive game. They just blew us out, cut and dried,  from the first quarter."  </P> <P> Now, instead of Johnson, it is Golden State that carries the painful memories.  </P> <P> Laker Notes  </P> <P> Kareem Abdul-Jabbar declined to comment Wednesday night on his conviction for  misdemeanor assault stemming from a shoving incident involving a tourist in a  Phoenix shopping mall last year. Gary Bettman, the NBA's vice president and  general counsel, said that there is a good-conduct provision in all player  contracts, and that a player who violates it can be suspended.  </P> <P> "But let me say that there's a big difference between, say, shooting somebody  and shoving a camera in his face," Bettman said. "Based on what we know about  the case, it's not exactly a heinous offense. I haven't read the judge's  ruling, so we aren't going to do anything -- if we do anything -- until we get  a full determination from the court."  </P> <P> Only in California Department: At the request of Golden State Warrior owner Jim  Fitzgerald, who lives in Palm Springs, Warrior reserve center Ralph Sampson  spent part of Tuesday receiving treatment from two "anatomical functionalists,"  an elaborate name for physical therapists. The specialists analyzed Sampson's  body motion and discovered a problem with some muscles around his hips and  spine. So, they realigned his hips and spine in hopes of improving his movement  on the court. This, apparently, has nothing to do with Sampson's knee surgery.  . . . The Lakers are off today and play host to the Indiana Pacers on Friday  night. Then, they embark on a five-game trip.  </P></p>

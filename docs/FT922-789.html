			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / (CORRECTED) World Trade News: US labour fears Mexican role in the revolution - The trade pact has divided American labour and business along traditional lines Correction (published 2nd July 1992) appended to this article. Lobbyists locked in debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) concur on at least one point: jobs will be lost and jobs will be gained if the pact becomes a reality. While the Bush administration portrays the Nafta as a job-creating dynamo, American unions fear it will throw thousands of workers out on the streets. There are studies to support each contention. Mr Kay Whitmore, chairman of Eastman-Kodak and head of the government's private sector Nafta group, argues that the pact will create US jobs, citing the example of his own company. Eastman-Kodak expanded in Mexico in the 1960s to penetrate the trade barriers of the day. Since then, for every three jobs created in Mexico, the company says it has hired one additional support person in its US facilities. Mr Whitmore gives numerous examples of added jobs resulting from Mexican trade and investment. Procter &amp; Gamble expects free trade to result in 2,000 new jobs, he said. Dana Corp, a car parts supplier, exports twice as much to Mexico as it manufactures there: 'Every story of added exports is a story of added jobs in this country,' he said. However, US unions cite a long list of companies which have closed down or laid off workers from US plants to move production to Mexico. These include the last Zenith television manufacturing facility in the US, American Car, producer of freight cars, which once employed 4,000 in St Louis, Missouri; Grand Met's Jolly Green Giant, which slashed employment from 12,000 to 115 workers after the move; and three jean-making plants owned by Farah Co. which employed 3,750 in the early 1980s but only 410 today. 'In contrast to the soothing bromides found in the economic textbooks, this rapid increase in trade has produced few benefits to the economy of either Mexico or the US,' says Mr Rudy Oswald, an economist with the AFL-CIO, the US labour organisation. Mr Charles Bremer, international trade director of the American Textile Manufacturers' Institute, estimates that 200,000 of the 1m American clothing workers will lose their jobs as a result of the Nafta. It will be less traumatic for the textile industry, which now supports the pact because it has managed to get protection built in at the negotiating table; its future losses are reckoned in the tens of thousands. The International Institute of Economics, in its report 'North American Free Trade: Issues and Recommendations', by Messrs Garry Hufbauer and Jeffrey Schott, examined all the job projection data and concluded that 112,000 US workers will be dislocated by a Nafta, but 130,000 net new jobs will be created. The outlook for unskilled workers is 'bleak', they say. The Bush administration and the large US companies pushing for the Nafta envisage a marriage between US technology and Mexican labour creating products competitive with any produced in Asia or Europe. They suggest that the US will get 'good' high-wage skilled jobs because its workforce is more educated, while the manual or mass production jobs will go to the cheap labour in Mexico. This sidesteps the fact that many of the 'good' manufacturing jobs also will go south. The pro-Nafta forces argue that companies in search of cheap labour might, without a Nafta, move to Asia; Mexicans, at least, show a preference for US imports. 'With or without a Nafta, low-wage workers in many sectors of the US economy will continue to face strong competitive pressures from abroad,' say Messrs Hufbauer and Schott. For this reason, Democrats in Congress will withhold approval of the agreement unless it is accompanied by a significant job training programme for workers whose job losses can be traced to the pact, and a commitment on funding. They are unimpressed by plans for a new training scheme from the administration which has repeatedly cut back current programmes. The administration last year also promised to agree a joint 'action plan' with Mexico on labour rights, including improved working conditions, child labour laws and health and safety measures. Much to the disgust of many Democrats, all that is expected to emerge is a fact-finding plan, like a study of Mexican labour. This will provide ammunition for the AFL-CIO and its allies in Congress, who say that they will support only 'the right kind of Nafta'. By that they mean one that has Mexican agreement to allow unionisation free of the kind of government control which has suppressed Mexican wages. 'If the collective bargaining system does not function, Mexico will maintain its low wage advantage for a generation or more,' said one US union official. He contended that unless wages are permitted to rise to create a large middle class then Mexico will not develop into a consumer market capable of supporting American jobs. Mr Sheldon Friedman, an AFL-CIO economist, sees the Nafta as an attempt by the administration to help the US oil companies 'get their foot in the door' in Mexico and to help US banks recover their bad loans. Correction (published 2nd July 1992) Grand Met's Jolly Green Giant reduced employment by more than 1,200 to 115 workers in the period from 1983 to the present; not from 12,000 as reported in the Financial Times of June 26.</p>

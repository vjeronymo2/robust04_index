			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / People: United Newspapers Charles Stern is joining the board of United Newspapers as finance director with effect from July 1. A Marlborough college scholar and Cambridge graduate in mathematics and operational research, Stern, 41, had been with Aegis since 1986 as the group's finance director. It was a successful period for Aegis, which saw turnover growing from Pounds 56m to Pounds 2.1bn in the six years. The theatre and opera-loving Stern leaves a healthy group behind; his shoes will be tricky to fill but Aegis is already interviewing candidates.</p>

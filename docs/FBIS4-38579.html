			<p>BFN     [Text] Tbilisi, 31 May -- Apart from the weapons they have  been receiving from the Transcaucasus Military District (since  1992), the authorities in the Republic of Georgia have also been  buying weapons (mostly, firearms) on the territory of the  Russian Federation and from eastern European countries, namely,  Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania.    A small consignment (not more than several hundred weapons)  of Polish-made 7.62mm-calibre collapsible Kalashnikov automatic  guns has been imported from Poland, while 7.62mm-calibre  submachine guns have been imported from Czeckoslovakia and  distributed among security officers guarding government  buildings.    The largest number of Kalashnikov automatic guns arrived in  Georgia from Romania. (It must be noted that Romanian-made  Kalashnikovs are of rather poor quality.) The first consignment  of (7.62-calibre) automatic guns came in two marine cargo  containers aboard a Romanian ship and was unloaded near Batumi  in 1992. Since no one appeared to have ordered the weapons, it  was assumed that they had been ordered by the government of  ex-Georgian president Gamsakhurdia.    In 1993, Shevardnadze's government imported up to 8,000  5.45mm-calibre Romanian-made Kalashnikov automatic guns (for the  price of about $120 each).</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / US coal strike targets Peabody THE United Mine Workers of America expanded its selective strike against US coal operators yesterday, stopping work at Peabody Coal mines in Illinois, Indiana, West Virginia and Ohio. Peabody, the largest coal producer in the US, is a subsidiary of Hanson of the UK. The union also ordered workers at four mines owned by Consol Energy, which is jointly owned by DuPont and Germany's Rheinbraun, to join picket lines. The strike began on May 10 when national contract negotiations broke down between the union and mine owners represented by the Bituminous Coal Operators' Association. The dispute is far from shutting down US coal operations. Following yesterday's action, 9,200 UMWA members are on strike, leaving more than 50,000 still working. The union's workers control only 28 per cent of US coal output nationwide, with the BCOA companies producing about 17 per cent of US coal, mostly in eastern and mid-western states. While the percentage of nationwide production under the union's workers is small, coal operations are regional, with customers such as electricity utilities dependent on cheap local sources of coal. Utilities in strike-hit regions have ample coal supplies, but may have to switch to other fuel sources if the dispute drags on, analysts say. The union is seeking greater job security for its members and has accused BCOA companies of evading agreements by using non-unionised subsidiaries to open new mines. It believes that a 1988 agreement with the BCOA guarantees union jobs in new mines. Mr Thomas Hoffman, a BCOA spokesman, said the union's demands were unreasonable. 'Nobody these days is going to guarantee jobs,' he said. The coal operators had offered the union three out of five new jobs at new mines once 40 per cent of the workforce had been hired. Mr Hoffman said there had been no talks between the two sides since the strike began, and none was scheduled. Mr Richard Trumka, UMWA president, said the BCOA's latest offer 'represents an even further pulling back on their commitment to workers'. A union appeal for international support met some success this week when 1,000 miners at Peabody mines in Australia went on strike in sympathy with the UMWA .</p>

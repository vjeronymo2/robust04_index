			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Letter: Trains offer scant hope for a non-car economy Sir, I felt I had to reply to Richard Tomkins' article on the car economy, and had ample time to compose this letter while sitting for 50 minutes on the stationary 7.23 train to London. I agree entirely that traffic in cities is becoming impossible but pricing people off the road can never work without a widely available and reliable alternative. As in other cities this will have to be the bus and particularly the train system. Unlike other European countries, Britain is the only one where people do not catch the train to meet a fixed appointment time, and unless attitudes are changed by a far better service - which will necessitate public investment in the network - then there is little future for a non-car economy. I for one am about to join the drivers to London, having finally given up on British Rail's incompetence after a 90-minute delay getting to London and 20 minutes returning to Manchester, although I much prefer travelling by rail.

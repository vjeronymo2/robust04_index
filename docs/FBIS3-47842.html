			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government gave an emergency order on 14  January to the ROK Embassy in Japan to grasp the truth of the  irregular export of spectrum analyzers, which are core parts for  missile development, from Japan to North Korea.    The Foreign Ministry said that it should be clarified  whether  or not the spectrum analyzers claimed to have been exported by  Japanese companies are items regulated by the Coordinating  Committee for Multilateral Export Controls [Cocom], and that it  could be possible that North Korea imported them as simple  electronic products and used them as missile parts and ordered  the embassy in Japan to investigate the truth.</p>

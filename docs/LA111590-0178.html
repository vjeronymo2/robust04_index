			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: FASHION MODELS WATCH THEMSELVES ON PARADE  </P> <P> Family home videos it wasn't. But for the 100 women gathered at the Black Box  Theatre in the Orange County Performing Arts Center recently, it was better.  Much better.  </P> <P> After more than a month of waiting, models in the Guilds of the Performing Arts  Center's September fashion spectacular -- "The Center of Fashion" -- got to  watch the show. On video.  </P> <P> Settling back on folding chairs at tables done up with roses, the women oohed,  aahed and squealed as they watched themselves parade before more than 3,000  guests in the first fashion show held in Segerstrom Hall.  </P> <P> Among the models was Judie Argyros, who came down with the giggles after  watching herself vamp on the ramp in a drop-dead ensemble by D.N. Evans.  </P> <P> On the screen, Argyros -- wife of Forbes 400 developer George Argyros -- looked  like a modern Cinderella in silk taffeta, lace and veiled cocktail hat. But  schmoozing with fellow models in the Black Box, she looked ultra-modern in  jersey and leather embellished with beads and chains. "This is an outfit that I  can only wear with the girls," Argyros confessed. "George hates it."  </P> <P> The models left with a special keepsake -- their own copies of the  videocassette.  </P> <P> Also among the throng: Guilds chairwoman Janice Johnson and Shari Essayian,  chairwoman of next year's Center of Fashion.  </P> <P> Two Singular Sensations: "Chorus Line," that singularly sensational kick of a  musical, made its debut at the Orange County Performing Arts Center on Tuesday  night.  </P> <P> Among guests who gathered for a post-performance bash at Birraporetti's was  Center board member Timothy Strader and his wife, Susan, and Center President  Thomas Kendrick and his wife, Judy Morr (Center general manager).  </P> <P> "Judy was in a chorus line once," whispered Kendrick, sipping something cool as  he waited for the cast to arrive. Morr blushed. The secret to being a great  chorine? "Consistency," Morr said. "When you're a chorus girl, you have to be  like everybody else."  </P> <P> Guests dined on pizza and pasta dishes in a room dotted with gold and black  balloons and top hats. (The restaurant's banquet manager, Dolores Aleccia, said  she loves decorating the Irish-Italian bistro for the Center's parties.) Jazz  pianist Jon Garner kept guests' toes tapping. And, tempting guests was a white  sheet-cake emblazoned with the words, Chorus Line. The dancers dug into it with  gusto. (No problem downing cake smothered with Kahlua cream when you dance your  socks off every night.) The show continues through Sunday.  </P> <P> The Center's other singular sensation -- its annual Christmas Candlelight  Concert -- is being held Dec. 9 at the Hyatt Regency Irvine. Up for some  emotional listening: the Boys Choir of Harlem, known throughout the world for  its angelic sound.  </P> <P> The choir was established in New York in the '60s to build self-esteem among  inner-city children and provide an alternative to the street scene. This  morning at the Center Club, an early-bird breakfast is being staged for the  ball's angels -- South Coast Plaza, the Hyatt Regency Irvine, Tiffany &amp; Co.  and American Airlines -- and committee members. Ciel Woodman is gala  chairwoman. Tickets are still available.  </P> <P> Celebration!: Raising more than $50,000 at a benefit luncheon is music to any  fund-raiser's ears. But big bucks are especially dear to the Orange County  Philharmonic Society, sponsors of music programs for 300,000 local youth  annually.  </P> <P> Last week, about 700 Philharmonic supporters -- dressed to kill in autumn  finery (hats are in and so are headbands -- luncheon chairwoman Ann Stern  sported one) congregated at the Hyatt Regency Irvine for "Celebration of  Music." They bid on 250 auction items before they dined and viewed a fashion  extravaganza staged by Saks Fifth Avenue.  </P> <P> Among guests were Marcia Coy, chairwoman of the Philharmonic's women's  committees; Eva Schneider; Susan Beechner; Wolf Stern; Bob Searles, society  president; Elaine Redfield; Erich Vollmer, the society's executive director;  Bobbitt Williams; Barbara Mason; Ann Pange; and Ed Halvajian, chairman of the  Philharmonic board.  </P> <P> Home run for charity: Hundreds gathered at South Coast Plaza's Crystal Court  last week to dine at the culinary extravaganza that annually benefits Orange  County's Food Distribution Center. Two dozen wineries and several plaza  restaurants -- Antonello, Bangkok Four, Gustaf Anders and Gianni, among them --  kicked in specialties so guests could fill up to feed the hungry.  </P> <P> Getting almost as much attention as the mouth-watering fare were Angel pitcher  Kirk McCaskill and his wife, Dana. The handsome couple anted up a $16,000  donation to the distribution center from an organization they founded, Strike  Out Hunger. Also among guests were event co-chairmen Timothy Maurier and  Timothy McMahon.  </P> <P> Butterflies are free: Interval House has dubbed its annual Thanksgiving ball  "Le Bal des Papillons" -- the ball of the butterflies. It's an appropriate  theme for a gala that annually raises funds to free women from the cocoon of  abuse. Word's out that artist Karen Toda has designed 500 gossamer butterflies  for the affair.  </P> <P> The Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point is the site of the $200 per-person black-tie  gala, which will feature a gourmet dinner, dancing to the West Coast Music  Orchestra and an auction with items that include European and spa vacations.  Tickets are still available. This extraordinary event has become Orange  County's signature Thanksgiving gala.  </P> <P> *STAGE REVIEW: An appraisal of "A Chorus Line" appears in Calendar.

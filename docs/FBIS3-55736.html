Except the Defense Minister's Birthday": "It Isn't  Every Minister That the President Visits Bearing Flowers"]    [Text] According to information from confidential sources,  Pavel Grachev received a visit 1 January from Boris Yeltsin, who  congratulated him on his 46th birthday that day. The unofficial  meeting between the president and the defense minister at the  festive table lasted over two hours, after which, according to  an eyewitness, both men went out into the street in noticeably  good spirits. In the opinion of observers, the fact that the  president visited the defense minister on his birthday  demonstrates B. Yeltsin's sympathies for the military department  and its leader. The visit was all the more important for Grachev  since before this event, according to reports in some of the  mass media, he had tried to obtain an audience with the  president to discuss the results of the elections and the  results of the year in the Russian Federation Armed Forces, but  the president did not have the time for a meeting.    That there has been some change in the cool attitude of the  president's structures and B. Yeltsin himself toward the Defense  Ministry and toward P. Grachev since the 3-4 October events is  also indicated by comments from Dmitriy Volkogonov, the Russian  Federation president's adviser on military questions. On B.  Yeltsin's behalf he characterized the Russian Federation Defense  Ministry's activity as "normal."    The Russian president's adviser called the reorganization of  the Defense Ministry and the General Staff at the present time  dangerous because society and the Army are not ready for that  just now, although he did not rule out such a possibility in the  next few years.</p>

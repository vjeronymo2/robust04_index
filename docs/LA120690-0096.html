			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOB AD INDEX OFF AGAIN; MORE LAYOFFS SEEN  </P> <P> Labor market conditions worsened in October with no sign of a quick turnaround,  a leading business research group reported Wednesday in a monthly survey of  help-wanted advertising.  </P> <P> The Conference Board's help-wanted advertising index fell to 116 in October,  six points below the September level and 34 points below the year-earlier  level.  </P> <P> The index's decline substantiated other assessments of growing trouble in the  U.S. labor market, which has been beset by layoffs and reduced hiring plans  because of an underlying economic decline that some are calling a recession.  </P> <P> On Monday, for example, Manpower Inc., the world's largest temporary help firm,  reported in a quarterly survey that hiring plans of U.S. companies will plunge  to "recession depths" in the first quarter of 1991.  </P> <P> "The decline in the economy in the fourth quarter affords very little  opportunity to develop new jobs," Conference Board economist Kenneth Goldstein  said. "Layoffs continue to climb, as does the national unemployment rate."  </P> <P> The national unemployment level, which moved from 5.2% in June to 5.7% as of  October, will likely climb to 6.5% in the second half of 1991, Goldstein  asserted. The Labor Department is scheduled to release its figures on November  unemployment Friday.  </P> <P> The Conference Board survey showed that advertising volume in newspapers fell  almost everywhere in the country, particularly in the Southeast, with a 12.8%  decline, and New England, with a 9.2% decline. Least affected was the Pacific  region, but help-wanted ad volume there still fell 4.2%.  </P> <P> More disturbing, the Conference Board survey suggested, was a 5.2% drop in  help-wanted advertising in the Midwest, which has enjoyed relative prosperity  in recent months because of a manufacturing resurgence and foreign demand for  U.S. goods.  </P> <P> "There has been a significant deterioration in the labor markets of the Pacific  and the South Atlantic," Goldstein said. "Even more telling -- job advertising  declines are now firmly set in America's heartland."  </P> <P> The survey assesses help-wanted advertising volume in 51 major newspapers  across the country every month and is considered a sensitive barometer to  changes in the supply of jobs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Advertising Dips  </P> <P> Help-wanted advertising in newspapers, seasonally adjusted; index base: 1967  equals 100  </P> <P> Oct., '90: 116  </P> <P> Sept., '90: 122  </P> <P> Oct., '89: 151  </P> <P> Source: Commerce Department  </P></p>

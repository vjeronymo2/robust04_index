			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRUCKEE: SOLITUDE IN THE SIERRA;  </P> <P> THIS RUSTIC MOUNTAIN TOWN HAS SURVIVED THE CRAZY DAYS OF SHOOT-OUTS, BORDELLOS  AND ROARING SALOONS  </P> <P> Crowds will invade this old frontier town next weekend in a Labor Day salute  marking the melancholy end of summertime in the Sierra Nevada.  </P> <P> Picnics will be spread on the banks of Donner Lake and vacationers will float  down the Truckee River in a parade of rafts, past rocky coves and deep green  forests where the voice of a blue jay can be as startling as thunder.  </P> <P> Barely 14 miles downriver from Lake Tahoe, the little town of Truckee appears  like a turn-of-the-century post card. Saloons still do business on Donner Pass  Road and trains roll into town regularly, dropping off passengers at Truckee's  old-fashioned depot.  </P> <P> At Bud's Sporting Goods Store &amp; Soda Fountain, waitresses serve ice cream  cones while the proprietor sells night crawlers to fishermen.  </P> <P> Dressed in khaki overalls and sporting a crew cut, Truckee-born Bud Owen  exchanges small talk with customers as they spoon sundaes and string lures.  Bud's ice cream-and-tackle shop features Bud's Secret Lure (a hot fudge sundae  topped with cookies and whipped cream), along with fishing poles, flies, nets  and creels.  </P> <P> A few doors away, James Hacker turns out copper sculptures and glass blower  Frank Rossbach huffs and puffs for a lineup of customers.  </P> <P> Vacationers crowd El Toro Bravo, ordering burritos and tacos, while across the  street, leather goods are displayed in a marvelous old barn of a building that  once served as an ice house.  </P> <P> Although Truckee still resembles a scene out of "High Noon," one scribe  insisted the little town is catching on as the "Carmel of the Sierras." Not  quite.  </P> <P> Truckee, which has survived fires and blizzards, is a rustic mountain town  where shoot-outs once occurred with amazing regularity, saloons roared round  the clock and bordellos flourished during periods when it served as a stage  stop, a lumber center, a railroad town and the site of ice harvesting for the  West before the era of refrigeration.  </P> <P> In an essay on his visit to Truckee, Allan R. Rahn wrote: "I used to think that  towns like this were only recorded in tinted daguerreotypes hanging above  near-sighted historians' desks, or in black and white documentaries about the  oldest living local resident -- but in Truckee I got the feeling I was part of  everything and that this town was part of me."  </P> <P> Stepping through the door at Richardson House, a Victorian B&amp;B overlooking  Truckee, is like lifting the curtain on a 19th-Century stage play. During  winter a wood-burning stove warms the 100-year-old inn as skiers descend on  Truckee.  </P> <P> Deep sofas are scattered through the Victorian parlor, and guests snooze in  rooms that feature high board beds, marble-top tables and clawfoot tubs. The  former home of a lumberman, Richardson House is as snug as the scene from an  old Currier &amp; Ives print.  </P> <P> At Bridge Street and Donner Pass Road, the Truckee Hotel has sheltered guests  since 1873. Lace curtains flutter at the windows and carved oak beds recall an  era when the hotel welcomed railroaders, lumbermen and travelers passing  through Truckee on the trail of the ill-fated Donner party.  </P> <P> For solitude in the Sierra, though, not another lodge matches the magic of the  Blue House Inn. Facing the Truckee River at the base of a towering mountain,  the Blue House Inn rates five stars with its immense stone fireplace and a  skylight for glimpsing the forest and meadows where deer graze and other  wildlife appear at sundown.  </P> <P> Shelves of books line one wall and guests soak in a hot tub and meet for  cocktails at a gazebo beside the river. Pine and aspen rise from a sweep of  lawn that unfolds to the banks of the Truckee, with its soothing song that  mesmerizes the most hopeless of insomniacs.  </P> <P> The Cape Cod-style home, with its shingled sides and gabled roof, features  goose-down comforters, four-posters, queen beds and wood stoves that glow with  the warmth of a chilly evening.  </P> <P> For honeymooners and others seeking complete privacy, the Hideaway Suite offers  solace in a setting of forest and flowers, with a hand-painted bed and stacks  of firewood. In other guest quarters, French doors swing open to the patio and  the tuneful Truckee.  </P> <P> With winter, skiers from Squaw Valley, Alpine Meadows and other playgrounds set  up housekeeping in a room with queen-size sleigh beds, while icicles drip from  eaves outside the window.  </P> <P> The proprietress Ruth Hutchings, an Orange County widow who traded crowded  suburbia for the peacefulness of Truckee, is renowned for her gourmet  breakfasts.  </P> <P> In the Sierra, says she, she's found her peace.  </P> <P> Back in Truckee village next weekend, vacationers will queue up outside The  Cookery for "Harry's homemade chili," Smart's Wagon Train Coffee Shop  (lumberjack breakfasts and fresh fruit pies), the Squeeze Inn for a peanut  butter-jelly-banana-and-honey sandwich and O.B.'s Pub &amp; Restaurant, which  serves up sea scallops in a strawberry sauce, steaks and a specialty known as  Pasta O'Brien, which is to say fettuccini with tomatoes, garlic and herbs  soaked in red wine.  </P> <P> The Bar of America occupies the old Bank of America building on Commercial  Street, where pictures of old-time gangsters line its walls: John Dillinger,  Baby Face Nelson, Pretty Boy Floyd, Willie Sutton, Bonnie Parker, Ma Barker and  the Al Capone mob.  </P> <P> And there's The Tourist Club, through whose doors guests swing 16 hours a day,  10 a.m. till 2 a.m. The Tourist Club caters to both locals and vacationers, its  walls displaying caribou, deer, antelope and mountain goat trophies. While  swilling Bloody Marys and mugs of ale, patrons feed coins into a jukebox that  blares out melodies that include "The Gunfighter's Song" and "There's A Tear In  My Beer."  </P> <P> No one ever accused Truckee of being cosmopolitan. Friendly? Of course.  Sophisticated? Ho-hum.  </P> <P> Summer's vacationers cast for trout at Donner Lake and along the banks of the  Truckee, and when snows fall, skiers crowd the slopes at nine resorts near this  little mountain town.  </P> <P> In the '20s macho types played football with a cuspidor on Truckee's main drag,  and Charlie Chaplin competed in dog-sled races while filming silent flicks. He  was followed by Clark Gable and Loretta Young on location in Truckee for "Call  of the Wild." Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy filmed the old classic, "Rose  Marie," a few miles outside town.  </P> <P> While saloons continue to do a lively business in Truckee, doors to bordellos  lining Jibbom Street slammed their doors years ago. Gunfights are history, and  so the wild and woolly West is as tame as a litter of kittens.  </P> <P> Wine barrels filled with flowers line Commercial Street. A deli serves  chocolate truffles as well as corned beef sandwiches, and a French restaurant  is crowded with visitors up from Tahoe. With all the hullabaloo, some fear that  success will spoil the frontier style of Truckee.  </P> <P> Nearby, the bite of tragedy is recalled on Emigrant Trail, along with memories  of the Donner Party and the fateful winter of 1846-47. It was near present-day  Truckee that the Donner party was trapped by blizzards blowing off the Sierra.  Although a handful succeeded in crossing the summit to safety, 37 starved to  death or perished in fierce snowstorms. Of 89 original members, only 47  survived the ordeal. A park near Truckee marks the scene of their encampment.  </P> <P> Truckee was born as a stage stop in 1863. After that it grew into a bawdy boom  town as the railroad arrived and lumber mills thrived. The Truckee Tribune told  how hotel guests "went to sleep at night listening to the sound of silver at  Truckee's faro tables and the mellifluous strains of music pouring from the  saloons."  </P> <P> Gunslingers dueled in the streets, poker parties operated 24 hours a day and  dance halls seldom closed. Baby Face Nelson did time in the local slammer, and  before that the constable used his basement as a lockup.  </P> <P> By 1868 there were 14 lumber mills grinding away around the clock in Truckee.  During the 1870s ice was harvested from lakes surrounding town to refrigerate  rail cars carrying produce across the nation. After the lumber mills geared  down and electric refrigeration put the ice harvesters out of business, Truckee  took a downhill turn.  </P> <P> In an effort to attract tourists, the town created an ice palace that featured  a skating rink with an orchestra and toboggan rides. Still, Truckee took a dive  in the 1960s when motorists rolled along the new Interstate 80, bypassing the  little mountain town.  </P> <P> A few die-hards hung on, renovating 1800s and turn-of-the-century buildings.  Soon they housed shops and restaurants, and the tourist boom began again.  </P> <P> Bud Owen's tackle shop and ice cream parlor is a veritable gold mine, but the  71-year-old proprietor sees no silver lining. During the down days he had less,  but life was casual and Bud Owen was content.  </P> <P> "Sometimes I feel I'm getting crowded out," he said, scooping up a handful of  night crawlers while a waitress scooped ice cream into a cone. "Once I knew  everybody -- and then business picked up. . . ."  </P> <P> Downriver at the River Ranch Restaurant &amp; Lodge, Labor Day weekenders will  study rafters as they complete the four-mile journey from Tahoe City to this  pleasant inn on the Truckee.  </P> <P> They'll sip drinks on a sunny deck that faces the river, aware that soon the  bright days of summer will pass and guests will retire inside to the warmth of  a wood fire while snowflakes fall and winter returns with a muffled roar.  </P> <P> Accommodations:  </P> <P>  -- Blue House Inn On The River, P.O.

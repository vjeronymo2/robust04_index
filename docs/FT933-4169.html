			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Big trade surplus in France FRANCE achieved a record trade surplus of FFr10.88bn (Pounds 1.23bn) in May, as exports rose much more quickly than stagnant imports, according to customs statistics announced yesterday. The surplus was almost double the FFr5.8bn surplus recorded in April, which was revised down from FFr7.6bn, and was well ahead of expectations. An official at the economics ministry said that May trade figures demonstrated the competitiveness of French industry. But economists cautioned against reading too much into the statistics.</p>

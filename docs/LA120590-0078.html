			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WELCH TO DISCUSS RETIREMENT WITH CANYON PRINCIPAL  </P> <P> Canyon High football Coach Harry Welch will meet with Principal Bill White  later this week to discuss Welch's pending retirement from coaching.  </P> <P> "He and I will talk to make sure that this is what he wants to do," White said.  </P> <P> "We don't really have a timetable. He just needs some time to relax."  </P> <P> Welch announced his retirement Sept. 6, the day before the Hart-Canyon game,  citing his desire for a lighter teaching load. Welch said that he no longer was  willing to teach four English classes and coach football full-time.  </P> <P> "I'm ready (to retire)," Welch, 45, said. "Right now, I have no plans of ever  coaching again. For me to stay, they would have to make me an offer I couldn't  refuse, and that's not going to happen."  </P> <P> Welch indicated that he would continue to coach if his schedule was changed to  mirror that of a student-body director who teaches one class in addition to  heading extracurricular activities.  </P> <P> Canyon's season ended last week with a 10-3 loss to Loyola in the Southern  Section Division I semifinals. Welch posted a 100-19-1 record in nine years and  took his team to the semifinals eight consecutive years. Canyon won Southern  Section titles in 1983, 1984 and 1985 and posted a 46-game winning streak.  </P></p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Unipart climbs 19% to Pounds 11.3m UNIPART, the motor parts and accessories manufacturer and distributor, increased its pre-tax profits by 19 per cent from Pounds 9.5m to Pounds 11.3m in the first half of 1993. The company, which is investing heavily to increase its component manufacturing operations, also disclosed that its Premier Exhausts subsidiary has secured contracts to supply exhaust systems to Saab, the General Motors-controlled executive car maker. The contracts, worth Pounds 6m a year, mark a significant step in a drive by Unipart to broaden its manufacturing customer base in Europe. Once primarily a distributor and maker of parts for its former owner, Rover Group, Unipart also began manufacturing components for Honda several years ago. This year it has begun supplying Toyota's Derbyshire car plant with flywheels, axle housings and shafts through Advanced Engineering Systems, a joint venture with Beans Industries in which Unipart has an 80 per cent stake. The first-half profit increase was on sales 5.6 per cent higher at Pounds 353.2m (Pounds 334.6m). Profit before interest rose by 21 per cent to Pounds 11m. No tax was payable. The company, which is 46 per cent owned by employees and managers, 20 per cent by Rover and the remainder by institutions, has revalued the shares bought for 5p by employees when Unipart was privatised in 1987. They now stand at 980p.</p>

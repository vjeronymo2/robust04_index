			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading CHOPPY, volatile trading continued in the derivative markets early yesterday, but there were signs that the large premium in Footsie futures was being eroded, writes Peter John. The March contract was marked down to 2,512 at the opening to take into account the softer opening in the underlying market. However, it was soon appreciated that a number of traders were needing to buy, and when cash rallied March was squeezed up some 26 points to take advantage of the short positions. The rally was overdone and the contract was sold down, from its high of 2,528 to 2,506. As the premium to cash narrowed the arbitrageurs moved in. Although March was still about 8 points above its estimated fair value, it was substantially lower than it had been and they were able to buy the future and sell stock. At the official close, March was at 2,522, 12 points above fair value with 5,900 contracts traded. On the LTOM, there were just over 26,000 contracts dealt. British steel was the top option after one house sold 1,400 April 70s and bought 700 April 80s. Store concerns Marks and Spencer and Kingfisher were among the most actively traded companies.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Social Democratic Party Chairman Rudolf </F> Scharping by Zbynek Petracek; place and date not given: "The  Time Has Come for a Change"]    [Text] Rudolf Scharping is chairman of the Social  Democratic Party [SPD] of Germany and is also minister-president  of North Rhine-Westphalia. He reached the highest echelons in  German politics only last June, but -- despite this -- the  majority of the FRG's citizens now consider him to be the next  German chancellor. He should achieve this goal following the  elections to the Bundestag in October.    [Petracek] You are 46 years old, the same age as Bill  Clinton when he began his presidential campaign, and the SPD has  been in opposition for 12 years, the same span of time for which  the Democratic Party in the United States had to entrust the  White House to the Republicans. Do you consider Bill Clinton to  be a specific model for yourself and for the SPD? In which  sense?    [Scharping] Such a direct comparison is always undesirable  as there are many things that simply cannot be compared. It is  true, however, that both during the Clinton campaign in the  United States and now in Germany, many people were and are  convinced that the time has come for a change in the political  leadership, that the current government has become worn out, and  that it has run out of ideas for dealing with the challenges of  the present and the future.    [Petracek] You appear in the media and in public more  openly, more naturally, more convivially, and more sportsmanlike  than is normal among the German political elite. Here, too, it  would be possible to discern a certain similarity to Bill  Clinton. Is this part of your program? Do you want to thus  suppress or overcome the distaste for politics often expressed  among German citizens?    [Scharping] Participation in the elections last month and  also participation and involvement in political activities  recently have shown that talk about antipathy toward politics  has been exaggerated. It has been a long time since people were  interested in politics. There is, of course, indignation toward  individual politicians and also toward political behavior and  the means of political decisionmaking. This situation has  arisen because the truth has been concealed from the people, and  because "the ratio between value and performance" in politics is  often discordant. This can only be dealt with by speaking  candidly and honestly about the general conditions -- which have  become complicated -- and by seeking a solution to them together.    [Petracek] What do you say to the fact that the Czech  Republic is the last state whose victims of World War II have  still not been compensated by Germany?    [Scharping] The SPD faction in the Bundestag submitted a  proposal in January 1991 in which it demanded that, in  connection with the signing of the German-Czechoslovak treaty, a  foundation be established -- in accordance with the solution  agreed with Poland -- to benefit the Czechoslovak victims of  Nazism. Naturally, this also applies under the changed  politico-state groupings. We must indeed strive bilaterally to  overcome the traumas of history to the benefit of our common  future. I am coming to Prague in order to contribute to this.    [Petracek] Clinton's election slogan was "change." What  slogan will the SPD and you personally use to try to win over  the German voters?    [Scharping] The capital "W" of our election campaign stands  for "Wir" [We], "Wechsel" [Change], and "Wahlen" [Elections],  because this year's elections to the Bundestag must bring about  political change so that this country again becomes fit for the  challenges that lie ahead of us. Our main motto is "certainty  instead of anxiety" according to the view that Willy Brandt once  formulated as follows: "Whoever wants to live in certainty  tomorrow must take care of the reforms today." Our policy is  oriented toward ensuring that people in this country can be  certain that their jobs and homes are safe and that they can  live with their neighbors at home and abroad in security and  peace.  <H5>  The Social Wolf and the Taxation Goat </H5>   [Petracek] Some 70 percent of FRG citizens believe that  there will be a change in government following the autumn  elections. However, according to the ZDF television channel's  "political barometer," only 29 percent of Germans are convinced  that the SPD would cope with the economic problems better than  the current government coalition. A substantial difference is  evident in this issue between Germany in 1994 and the United  States in 1992. Do you agree with this view?    [Scharping] I am skeptical about polls. Therefore, I always  issue an urgent warning: Do not allow yourself to be overly  influenced by them in political practice. Incidentally, I could  also quote to you from polls that ascribe more economic  proficiency to us than to the current government. We have just  completed the draft of our policy statement, which we are now  making available for discussion throughout the country. I am  certain that our ideas for dealing with the economic problems  will then gain even greater support than hitherto.    [Petracek] According to this draft, another 200,000 social  apartments, for example, are to be built within two years. At  the same time, however, payroll and income taxes among the  lowest and average income categories are to be reduced and -- in  the event that new enterprises are established -- the  "improvement of conditions for private stock by means of  taxation measures" is being taken into consideration. How does  this go together -- lower income taxes and higher social  expenditures? Where would your government get the necessary  resources?    [Scharping] The tax burden for 1995, already set by the  Federal Government, is very high. It must not be increased  further. Therefore, we are planning changes in favor of economic  progress and social justice. It is essential to relieve the  burden on people with low and average incomes, because those on  the minimum subsistence level are exempt from taxation as  decreed by the Federal Constitutional Court. We need a fair  adjustment in expenditures for pan-German recovery. Our  proposals for appropriate supplementary benefits are on the  table. It is possible to save money by means of strict  expenditure discipline and by modernizing the state; we are  taking this into consideration. Finally, the investment stimuli  planned by us to create jobs and intended to favor ecologically  sustainable growth will increase the state's financial scope.    [Petracek] The SPD's draft policy statement gives the vague  impression that it was written by Hillary Clinton: First and  foremost in the passage "On Equality" where female quotas for  vocational and training centers -- in enterprises with more than  50 employees -- and objective support for women in research  facilities and at universities are envisaged. Do you really  think that such quotas can lead to genuine equality?    [Scharping] The experience of women in Germany has shown  that equality, if not mandatorily endorsed by a form of fixed  quotas, is probably unattainable. Since the SPD thoroughly  implemented its resolution on quotas, equality in our party has  made a great deal of progress to the benefit of political  discussion in this country. What applies in politics must also  be applicable in the world of work to the benefit of women and  families.  <H5>  You Must Seek a Relationship With Russia </H5>   [Petracek] Like Bill Clinton, you are also reproached for  your lack of foreign policy experience. You yourself have also  said, in the spirit of the current U.S. President, that "what is  achieved abroad depends a great deal on what is done at home."  Nevertheless, despite this, can you define your foreign policy  priorities?    [Scharping] First and foremost, the social and economic  tasks associated with German unity are the main priority.  However, it is clear to me that German reunification has  expanded our foreign political responsibility in Europe and  throughout the world. We want to place considerable foreign  policy emphasis -- along with our partners from the European  Union -- on support for the reform processes in Central and East  Europe, since we will not be able to cope with these challenges  without a pan-European perspective. We see another focal point  in environment and environmental resources policy and in  reducing the gap between North and South -- it is only possible  to approach these tasks internationally with the involvement,  first and foremost, of North America and Japan.    [Petracek] It is no secret that there is a dispute within  the SPD on the possibility of the deployment of Bundeswehr  units. The issue involves whether German soldiers -- under UN  orders -- should only take part in peacekeeping operations or  also in peacemaking missions. What is your view?    [Scharping] There was a dispute within the SPD on the  Bundeswehr's deployment, but we have already reached a  consensus, which is clear from the resolution approved at our  recent party congress. According to it, we endorse all the  operations that the United Nations may carry out on its own  responsibility; these are primarily peacekeeping missions  (deployment of the blue helmets). Moreover, the SPD is in favor  of enforcing embargoes imposed in an attempt to quell military  flash-points -- should the need arise -- by a blockade.  Incidentally, I also see an important sphere for cooperation  between Germany and its neighbors in joint exercises for  intervention within the UN framework, since the need for UN  peace missions -- and later, the deployment of CSCE blue helmets  -- will, by all accounts, increase.    [Petracek] In your opinion, should Germany gain a permanent  seat in an expanded UN Security Council in the future? Under  what circumstances?    [Scharping] We social democrats are of the opinion that, if  the circle of permanent Security Council members is expanded,  the important countries and regions of the world must be  represented. We would give preference to a joint European Union  seat, which, however, is unfeasible in the foreseeable future.  Therefore, Germany -- like Japan -- is a candidate for a  permanent seat in the UN Security Council. The United Nations  is not setting down special conditions, as the general secretary  of the global organization has said repeatedly. Of course, it  is rightly to be expected of Germany that it will contribute to  strengthening the United Nations in accordance with its  potential.    [Petracek] As the German media have noted, Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel did not protest when in November his  Russian counterpart Kozyrev expressed himself in favor of a  "German-Russian axis." How would you react in such a situation  -- as federal chancellor?    [Scharping] We are aware of the fears of smaller states that  the larger ones can reach an agreement behind their backs. Such  uneasiness was manifested particularly strongly during the  period of German reunification -- and definitely not only in the  Central European states to the east of us. At that time,  Germany undertook to deal responsibly with its increased  influence, and respect for the interests of our neighbors forms  the main part of this. On the one hand, it is clear that it  would have been impossible to achieve peace and security in  Europe without cooperation with and the understanding of Russia.  On the other hand, however, it is just as clear that a German  agreement with Russia would certainly not suffice to guarantee  stability in Europe. Thanks to the stabilizing influence of  democracy, the Central European countries are appearing  self-confidently on the international arena, which is also  leading them into a situation in which they must again seek a  relationship with the Russian Federation. West European or  German policy cannot replace this, but can only support it.  <H5>  What Social Dumping Means </H5>   [Petracek] In your interview for DER SPIEGEL, you pleaded  for "more social justice." How do you intend to achieve this  aim since the possibilities of the welfare state have now been  virtually exhausted?    [Scharping] I have already mentioned that we are planning  changes in the system of taxes and levies, which will lighten  the burden on people with low and average incomes. Our  intention to pay the same allowance of 250 German marks for each  child, instead of the current system of allowances exempt from  taxation, will also lead to greater social justice. By  implementing changes in housing construction it is also possible  to attain the strong support of those who are really dependent  on it. In the final analysis, our views on modernizing the  state also concern our social security systems -- there will be  less red tape and the distance from the citizens will be  lessened. The "welfare state" is not to be used freely, but it  must be reformed in keeping with the times.    [Petracek] In the same interview, you also said that there  would be no social democracy in Germany without the SPD -- not  as a political trend (Sozialdemokratie), but as a specific type  of democracy (soziale Demokratie). Can you explain this  semantic difference? What is the difference between social  democracy and democracy without attributes?    [Scharping] I consider renewing social democracy in Germany  to be a fundamental task of political social democracy. No one  is denying that our country is arranged democratically, but the  social aspect of our statehood has come up too briefly in recent  years. Redistribution from the bottom upwards is more than a  slogan; it is a sad reality provable by the figures. In a  social democracy there should be tasks that belong to the common  interest that are commonly shared and financed. Incidentally,  this is a constitutional requirement in our country, since the  market economy itself cannot now guarantee social justice.    [Petracek] You use the word "social" very often. What do  you think of the concept of "social -- or rather, ecological --  dumping," especially since the SPD is concerned, first and  foremost, with employment and cheap labor in Central and East  Europe may threaten jobs in Germany?    [Scharping] If the low price of the goods offered is derived  exclusively from the fact that these products come from  enterprises that cause great ecological damage and whose  employees have to work in undignified conditions, then I speak  about ecological or social dumping. Therefore, we are striving  for international agreements on minimum social and ecological  standards. However, do not view this as a pretext for  protectionism, which is harmful to all economies.</p>

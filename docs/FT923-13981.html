			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Le franc fort THE FUTURE of Europe, or at least of European union a la Maastricht, lies in the hands of the French. A yes vote in the September referendum is a necessary, though not quite sufficient, condition for the treaty to survive. But the immediate stability of Europe's exchange rate mechanism also lies in French hands. No country has dedicated itself to the cause of European monetary union as devotedly as France; and none with such success. France is the only EC country, other than Luxembourg, that satisfies all the convergence criteria in the Maastricht treaty. With an inflation rate below that of Germany, France carries, at least for now, the disinflationary standard to which lesser states aspire. This achievement has not come cheaply. The French policy of competitive disinflation has demanded almost a decade of modest growth and high unemployment. But the government has compounded the pain. Too much of the French unemployment problem, particularly among young people, arises from deleterious government regulations and persists despite apparently well-targeted labour market spending. Whether France's disinflationary policies should be judged an entire success remains in doubt. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, in its latest report on the French economy, points to large gains in export competitiveness over the past few years as evidence that disinflation has worked. 'It would be inappropriate,' it argues, 'to abandon the policy of competitive disinflation when it is clearly bearing fruit.' Nevertheless, the trade account remains in deficit; and the markets are still not persuaded that France can sustain a lower inflation rate than Germany. The suspicion remains that deflationary policies are necessary to maintain both a low inflation rate and a manageable trade deficit. Meanwhile, the discontent of sections of French society has already been made apparent, both in the streets and at the ballot box. France may not yet have established its credentials as a permanently low-inflation country. But it has come far enough and sacrificed so much that to give up now by realigning the franc against the D-Mark would be foolish. Other member currencies cannot expect French assistance if they wish to ease the ERM strain. If Maastricht were to fail, however, the ERM would become a less secure guarantor of low French inflation. French policymakers should take steps to insure against this outcome, steps that they would have to take, in any case, if Emu were to go ahead. If France wants to keep a Germanic inflation rate, why not put in place a central bank a la Bundesbank sooner rather than later? Such an independent Banque de France could manage the franc, independent of shifts in European or French politics. The master is a bit weaker, but by now the apprentice has learned the trade.</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / NHS wins first no-strike agreement THE FIRST no-strike agree-ment in the National Health Service was signed yesterday by several unions and Homewood Trust, one of the first wave of new hospital and community services trusts, Lisa Wood writes. The agreement with three unions, the Royal College of Nursing and the British Medical Association introduces a joint commitment to binding pendulum arbitration in the event of a failure to agree. This is a system in which an arbitrator accepts either side's final offer. The deal also introduces procedures to exclude strikes. Homewood employs 1,000 staff in mental health and services for handicapped people in north-west Surrey. Mr Steven Weeks, a senior researcher at the Cohse health service union, said the arrangement might spread to other trusts, although Cohsewas yet to be convinced of the merits of binding pendulum arbitration. The union's view is that the agreement is not technically a no-strike deal, but the effect will be to make strikes extremely unlikely. The agreement is one of several radical new arrangements over pay and conditions being introduced by the new NHS trusts. For staff recruited since the trusts were established the trusts are able to opt out of nationally agreed Whitley terms and conditions for staff as well as pay-review settlements.</p>

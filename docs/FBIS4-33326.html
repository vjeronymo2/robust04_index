According to a PRD press release, most of the people  interviewed approve of Perez Balladares' activities as Panama's  president-elect, while 22.7 percent of those polled disapprove.  On his choice of cabinet members, the poll indicates that 62.7  percent agree with the appointments, while 27.3 percent disagree.

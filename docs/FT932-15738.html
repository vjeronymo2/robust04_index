			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Letter: Subsidise the labour of the low paid Sir, I understand Prof Snower's frustration in seeing the government implement a job subsidy scheme which may destroy as many jobs as it creates ('Job subsidy pioneer hits at schemes', April 1). However, the need to prevent substitution between subsidised and non-subsidised jobs is clearly a difficulty with his proposals. Another method is to subsidise the labour of the low-paid. This would boost demand for low-paid labour without generating inflationary forces at the more affluent end of the economy. A convenient method for implementing such a scheme would be to raise the nominal VAT rate and give each employer a subsidy for each worker employed. This has the effect of subsidising goods and services that use a lot of labour and taxing those that do not. Using a simple model of the economy I estimate that reducing unemployment by 2m would imply net subsidies to the most labour intensive industries of about 40 per cent of their value added and net taxes to the least labour intensive enterprises (eg petrochemicals) of about 20 per cent. Average prices do actually fall because savings on unemployment are fed into the system. Geoff Beacon, 36 Belle Vue Street, York YO1 5AY</p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / School-leavers likely to lose out in jobs revival JOB prospects in the third quarter of this year are set to improve, except for people living in London or seeking work in the public sector, according to the latest Manpower survey of employment prospects. But another survey published today reports that there will be fewer jobs for school-leavers this year than in 1991, with 11 per cent of organisations surveyed planning no recruitment of school-leavers. The Manpower survey found that 19 per cent of employers were planning to create jobs, with only 13 per cent forecasting job cuts. Manufacturing continues to predict a gradual improvement in job prospects, with builders in the private sector now more likely to be recruiting than cutting jobs. Clothing and textiles, retailing, and transport and distribution are the most optimistic sectors. The most pessimistic are energy and water, local government and banking. London is the only region where a net 3 per cent of employers surveyed still predict further job cuts. Scotland is the most buoyant, with a net 20 per cent expecting to recruit, followed by East Anglia and the East Midlands. The school-leaver survey of 186 employers by Industrial Relations Services found that, of those companies which were still recruiting school-leavers, one in three intended to recruit fewer this year. The starting salaries for school-leavers are expected to average Pounds 5,854. Pay rates have risen about 4.7 per cent in the past year. More than half of the jobs now include training leading to a qualification, but school-leavers in jobs with high-quality training receive only 6 per cent less pay than those in jobs where training is not provided. Apprentices typically receive 50 per cent of the adult rate, with those in clerical jobs receiving 75 per cent. The Young Ones: a survey of school-leavers' pay.

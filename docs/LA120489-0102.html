			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KENNEDY CENTER GALA: A FIVE-STAR TRIBUTE FOR LIVING LEGENDS  </P> <P> In the ornate halls of the State Department reception rooms, even the rich and  famous were in awe as this year's Kennedy Center honorees were feted Saturday  night with a black-tie tribute attended by the center's board of trustees and  star-studded guests.  </P> <P> Actress Cicely Tyson worked the room with her camera, asking guests to  photograph her with this year's honorees: singer Harry Belafonte, actresses  Claudette Colbert and Mary Martin, ballerina Alexandra Danilova and composer  William Schuman.  </P> <P> Perhaps none was more enraptured than Bernadette Peters, who never seemed more  than five yards from Martin.  </P> <P> "Mary is so wonderful, so graceful, so full of life," Peters whispered to  another admirer. After the dinner and formal presentation, when Peters finally  approached the stage legend, she was tentative and almost withdrawn.  </P> <P> Peters, and others like her, bore testament to the prestige and honor of the  Kennedy Center award, now in its 12th year.  </P> <P> "This is not an industry award and it's not how successful you've been," said  Belafonte, who at 62 is the self-described baby of the honorees. "It's how  people perceive you as a person. In that sense, it's one of the greatest honors  I could have received."  </P> <P> The weekend salute also included a White House reception Sunday afternoon with  Barbara Bush. It was wrapped up late Sunday with the 12th annual Kennedy Center  Honors extravaganza, to be televised Dec. 29 on CBS.  </P> <P> It was Saturday's intimate board of trustees fete, though, that captured the  essence of the prestigious award, bestowed for performing arts achievements  that have made a lasting impact on American culture.  </P> <P> "It is a rare privilege to be graced with such talent," said Deputy Secretary  of State Lawrence Eagleburger at Saturday night's gala. He cited the honorees  as "diplomats who bear witness of the United States all over the world and the  vitality of its culture."  </P> <P> In introducing Colbert, 84, Gregory Peck noted her stylish portrayals in a  series of movies, including her Academy Award-winning performance in the 1934  comedy "It Happened One Night," co-starring Clark Gable, who also won an Oscar.  </P> <P> "She always seemed fresh, always herself and always the character," said Peck.  "She was the first Cleopatra (in movies), the first torch singer. She makes us  laugh with her sophistication."  </P> <P> Delivering the toast to Colbert, television personality Kitty Carlisle Hart  called her "the best thing France has sent us since the Statue of Liberty."  </P> <P> Danilova, 85, is "the model of a ballerina. Grace, dignity and genius are the  gifts of Alexandra Danilova," said Peck. Danilova, who began her career in the  Soviet Union, was later a choreographer for the Metropolitan Opera in New York  and played a ballet teacher in the 1977 movie "The Turning Point."  </P> <P> Peck described Belafonte as "an actor, a singer, a director, a producer . . .  truly a Renaissance man. He has labored for the cause of human rights and has  lived the words he once sang, 'We Are the World.' "  </P> <P> Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), offering the toast to Belafonte, said the  entertainer "has given nobly and unselfishly to the cause of making our country  a better place and our planet a better world. Many great artists have a  conscience too, but none greater than his. He has two qualities that describe  the brilliance of his life: courage and excellence."  </P> <P> In introducing Martin, Peck said: "She was, and is and always will be Peter  Pan," noting the 1955 Broadway and television role for which Martin is perhaps  best known. "If we didn't have musicals, we'd have to invent them for her."  </P> <P> Composer Betty Comden, who helped write the songs for "Peter Pan," toasted  Martin as a "great artist and a great star who has that rarest of qualities --  bundles of charm."  </P> <P> Schuman, 79, who served as president of the Juilliard School of Music and won  the Pulitzer Prize for music in 1943, was hailed by Peck as "a giant of the  performing arts."  </P> <P> "Composer Aaron Copland once said of Schuman's pieces that only an American  could have written them," Peck added. "He's set to music the poetry of Walt  Whitman, done a baseball opera . . . and written madrigals from the Sears &amp;  Roebuck catalogue."  </P> <P> Past recipients include comedian George Burns, actress Myrna Loy, actors Jimmy  Stewart and James Cagney, and composers Leonard Bernstein and Aaron Copland.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Esteban Huertas G.] </F>   [Text] Ruben Dario Carles, Change '94 presidential  candidate, said during an impromptu news conference in the lobby  of the Europa Hotel yesterday that "the U.S. Government has  authorized drug trafficking and money laundering in Panama for  some years now." He also said "the charges against Panama are  unfair."    Carles acknowledged "money laundering is taking place in  Panama more so now than during the past regime."    According to Carles "this activity belittles the country's  image throughout the world." According to Carles "President  Guillermo Endara's administration has ample means to defend  itself from the attacks imposed by U.S. policies."    Carles said "we Panamanians cannot accept the U.S. charges,  but we must condemn the performance of certain court officials,  judges, district attorneys, the Prosecutor's Office, and certain  institutions responsible for curbing drug trafficking."    Regarding the discrediting of certain Panamanian  organizations involved in the struggle against money laundering  and drug trafficking, Carles said "we must improve the tarnished  image of official institutions by implementing measures aimed at  ensuring officials' performance so as to prevent them from  submitting to this illegal activity."</p>

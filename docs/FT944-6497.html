			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: BK Vision wins UBS injunction BK Vision, the investment fund controlled by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking group which is challenging the management of Union Bank of Switzerland, has won an injunction preventing the bank from converting its registered shares into bearer shares until an appeal against the plan is heard. UBS shareholders narrowly approved the conversion plan - with 57.8 per cent of registered shares in favour - at an extraordinary meeting last Tuesday, following a tense proxy battle between BK Vision and the UBS board. BK Vision, the largest shareholder in UBS, claims the plan is illegal because it does not offer compensation to registered UBS shareholders for the loss of the extra voting weight attached to their shares. The registered shares have a par value of one-fifth that of the bearer shares, giving an investment in them much greater voting power than a similar investment in bearers. A Zurich district court judge yesterday accepted BK Vision's argument that it would be difficult to reverse implementation of the plan if an appeal court ruled much later that it was illegal. The two sides will now present their arguments to the judge on a suitable deadline for BK Vision to submit its appeal case. By law, the latest possible date is January 22, but UBS will argue for an earlier deadline so that the case can be decided as quickly as possible. The UBS board wants to implement the conversion before the next annual general meeting in April. At that meeting, 10 of the 23 directors' terms expire, and BK Vision is trying to rally a majority of votes in support of substantial changes to the board. If the conversion goes through, the voting power of BK Vision and other large registered shareholders will be substantially reduced.</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Letter: Urging BR to bite on bullet Sir, In 1901, Japan was described by a foreign observer as 'the land of approximate time'. Another writer noted that in 1907 'their modern trains do well if they maintain an average of 20 mph over a short distance'. This is the country of today's bullet trains, where commuter and long-distance trains can be relied on to depart on time, almost to the second. British Rail, take heart] The past, or even the present, need not be an indicator of the future. Andrew MacLean Watt, Watt International, Gosei Building, Minami-Azabu 5-16-7, Minato-ku, Tokyo 106</p>

			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIAMI BEATS BROWNS WITH FIELD GOAL IN OT  </P> <P> Miami Dolphins rookie Pete Stoyanovich may have saved more than a game with his  35-yard field goal in overtime Sunday against the Cleveland Browns.  </P> <P> He also may have saved his job.  </P> <P> Stoyanovich missed a 46-yard field goal in the third period and a 45-yarder  with three seconds left in regulation time, but gave the Dolphins a 13-10  victory when he connected on Miami's first possession in overtime.  </P> <P> "This is a big, big kick in his career," Dolphin Coach Don Shula said.  </P> <P> Stoyanovich, an eighth-round draft choice who became Miami's kicker when  veteran Fuad Reveiz was injured in training camp, said he was confident about  the final kick despite his earlier misses.  </P> <P> "It wasn't that far out," he said. "I had no doubt I was going to make it. I'm  just really fortunate that the team gave me a second opportunity to win it for  them."  </P> <P> Cleveland took the kickoff to start overtime and drove 46 yards, but Matt Bahr  was wide left on a 44-yard field-goal attempt.  </P> <P> "We all miss," Stoyanovich said. "Nobody's perfect."  </P> <P> The winner, with 8:32 left, capped a 55-yard drive that included two  third-and-10 passes from Dan Marino to Fred Banks. On the first pass, Stephen  Braggs was called for a 26-yard pass interference penalty at the Cleveland 47.  The second pass was a 20-yard completion to the Cleveland 27.  </P> <P> Miami's previous home games this season, both losses, also were decided on the  game's final play.  </P> <P> "There have been two games we should have won at the end, but we didn't,"  Marino said. "This will be a big boost for us."  </P> <P> The Dolphins (2-3) and Browns (3-2) both had a chance to win the game in a wild  final minute in regulation.  </P> <P> Cleveland's Felix Wright returned an interception to the Miami 37 with 1:08  left, but Louis Oliver intercepted Bernie Kosar's pass two plays later. Marino  completed two passes for 23 yards before Stoyanovich missed.  </P> <P> The Browns drove to Miami's 45-yard line with five minutes to go in the fourth  quarter. Two penalties set them back, and safety Jarvis Williams broke up a  third-down pass at the Miami 30.  </P> <P> "We didn't do it when we had to," Browns Coach Bud Carson said. "We had our  shots."  </P> <P> Cleveland was hampered by eight penalties for 86 yards.  </P> <P> "Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy football," Carson said. "Ten points don't win many  football games."  </P></p>

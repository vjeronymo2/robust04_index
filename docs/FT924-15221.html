			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Thumbs down for the bank manager - In a Nutshell British businesses have become more ready to change their bank in recent years, according to a survey* for Financial Director magazine carried out by Manchester Business School (MBS). One-fifth of the 670 finance directors polled had changed bank relationships in the past five years, most in the past two. Fewer than 8 per cent confined their banking business to a single bank and European, American and Japanese banks had a foothold in a quarter of UK corporate accounts. Only half of respondents believed their bank provided dependable support in a crises, while common complaints were of overcharging and attempting to sell ineffective products. The customer charters published by many banks last year had little effect, the finance directors said. *From Jean Jepson, Centre Administrator, MBS, Booth Street West, Manchester M15 6PB.

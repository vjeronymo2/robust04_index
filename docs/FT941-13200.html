			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: Swiss textile machinery group plans restructuring programme Zellweger Uster, the Swiss textile machinery manufacturer, said it fell into loss last year because of the severe recession in the world textile industry. The group, whose earnings have been depressed since 1989, announced a SFr45m (Dollars 31m) restructuring programme, with some 200 redundancies expected in the spinning division in the first half of this year. Zellweger Uster said that the restructuring charges would expand the final deficit for 1993 to about SFr55m, compared with net income in 1992 of SFr2m. Consolidated sales last year reached SFr990.8m. The traditional divisions contributed flat sales of SFr743.3m while Luwa, an associated textile machinery company acquired fully last July, added SFr247.5m. Orders were down in all important markets except the US and margins were under heavy pressure. At the pre-tax level, the loss was some SFr5m compared with a profit of SFr19.9m in 1992. The group, in which the Bechtler family-owned Hesta has a majority stake, said that it was aiming to reach break-even point this year, but the results of a cost cutting programme would take full effect in 1995. Zellweger last paid a dividend on 1990 results, but said it expected to be able to pay a dividend for 1995. It also announced a plan to split its bearer and registered shares on the basis of five for every one held and to offer holders of participation certificates the opportunity to swap them into bearer shares.</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Leading Article: The house that Jacques built Where would - and will - the European Commission be without Jacques Delors? Back in August, the collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism in the face of a deepening European recession seemed to signal the final disintegration of the project to which the Commission president has devoted the last 10 years. But, far from admitting defeat, Mr Delors has forged ahead with work on a white paper designed to address the competitive deficiencies within the European economy that the last few years have cruelly exposed. As a coherent vision of Europe's future, the document is only half convincing. But that, given the obstacles that Mr Delors faced, is better than most people expected. Mr Delors - a Brussels-based socialist at the centre of a predominantly conservative-governed Union - has a reputation as something of an ideologue, a man determined to pursue French-style dirigisme on a wider European stage. But the white paper demonstrates that the Commission president is, above all, a pragmatic and skilful politician. The white paper rightly states that more needs to be done in order to build a dynamic, liberal and competitive European economy; most obviously, a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round is required. Aspirations for private involvement in the financing of trans-European infrastructure projects, streamlining welfare systems and removing remaining obstacles to free trade all suggest that the Commission remains on the liberal-minded road. The labour market remains Europe's Achilles' heel. But the Commission's willingness to embrace an agenda of reducing regulations - including minimum wages - and cutting non-wage labour costs, combined with investment in education and skills, is encouraging. The sentiments suggest that Mr Delors, and his Commission colleagues, have moved a long way towards accepting the need for deregulation to promote job growth. Rigid timetable Yet there are substantial holes. The document confirms, for example, the importance of a stable, European macroeconomic framework. But it does not acknowledge, let alone draw conclusions, from the failure of the hard ERM to deliver that stability. Nor does it explain how a growth and job oriented strategy can be meshed with the rigid timetable and convergence criteria laid down in the Maastricht treaty. The problem is that the events of the summer, while derailing the Maastricht monetary timetable, have clearly been to Europe's benefit. The shift to wide ERM bands and the consequent freedom to cut interest rates that this has given European governments seems to have delivered, by accident rather than design, the necessary combination of loose exchange rate co-ordination and monetary flexibility. The resulting downward trend in European interest rates is helping both the German and French economies to emerge from recession. French growth is still being being dragged down by unnecessarily high real interest rates, but that is now the sole responsibility of the French government. Sensible approach In short, Europe seems to have stumbled into a workable monetary system. But what of the monetary union timetable, the role of European Monetary Institute, the apparent French desire to stay within narrow bands, or the fiscal convergence criteria? The sensible approach would be to maintain the current flexibility, abandon the requirement to move to Emu via narrow bands, set up a system of consistent national inflation targets and entrust the EMI with monitoring convergence across a broad range of nominal and real variables. All these issues Mr Delors studiously ignores. But it is on fiscal policy that the white paper is most misjudged. The case for investment in trans-European networks is strong. The argument for a European-wide fiscal expansion is less so. But the case for allowing the Commission to borrow directly from the capital markets in order to finance this investment - the proposed Union bonds - is full of holes. As a trick to allow national governments to bypass the Maastricht fiscal criteria, it is transparent and unnecessary. As a means to enable fiscally irresponsible countries, such as Greece and Italy, to borrow cheaply under a different name, it sets a dangerous precedent. But it is the constitutional implications of the fiscal proposals that are most worrying. Mr Delors' strategy, it seems, is to use the shield of a recovery programme to enable the Commission to assume more of the fiscal powers of a sovereign state. But that is a step which begs questions that go far beyond the scope even of the most wide-ranging examination of Europe's economic future. The white paper sets out clearly Mr Delors' vision of a flexible, low regulation, high investment, job-creating community of nations. The task of explaining how Europe's political institutions are to be developed to match this economic aspiration is one for the EU's political leaders, aided and abetted by Mr Delors' successor.</p>

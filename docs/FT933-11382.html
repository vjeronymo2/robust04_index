			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Sharp setback in Turkey as Pakistan rallies / Review activity in the world's emerging markets A sharp setback in Turkey last week contributed to a near 4 per cent decline in the Europe/Mideast regional index of emerging markets. The data, supplied by the IFC, a member of the World Bank, also shows that Pakistan put on an impressive gain during the week in dollar terms, although over the year to date its performance is less substantial. Pakistani equities fell yesterday, ending the bullish fervour which began with continued rises since the appointment on July 18 of a new interim government. The KSE-100 index on the Karachi stock exchange fell by 26.88, closing at 1,405.99. That is still 125.25 points higher than the 1,280.74 closing index on July 19, the day before the beginning of the latest rises. Although many saw the day's activity as a short-term interruption in rising trends, some were confused as to whether the recent round of large profits was gradually ending. Mr Mudassir Malik, a director at BMA Capital Markets, said many stocks had risen earlier with last week's devaluation of the Pakistani rupee. That had created expectations of larger profits for export-oriented companies, especially in the textile sector. However, yesterday's falls were partially on account of adjustments for industrial companies other than textiles whose shares had risen, without realising that they were likely to face new pressures on account of higher import bills for their inputs, he added. A leading Karachi businessman said future trends will be set after Mr Moeen Qureshi, the prime minister, returns from Washington at the end of this week. Mr Qureshi is due to meet senior officials at the IMF and World Bank to discuss Pakistan's external financing needs. Pakistan has just completed a budgetary year with a record high deficit, and the gov-ernment is under pressure from external donors to introduce measures for tight fiscal controls, as a step to balance its books. Elsewhere, Nomura's global strategists this week recommended a switch out of south-east Asia into Mexico, thereby lifting their weighting in the latter from 2 per cent to 5 per cent. In explanation, Nomura's strategists, Nicholas Knight, Anthony Broccardo and Allison Southey, refer to the combination of fundamentals  - less than 10 times 1993 earnings, potential catalyst for a sharp rise if the Nafta negotiations are successful, and a sound technical position.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------          EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                      Dollar terms                          No. of   Jul 23    % Change    % Change Market                   stocks    1993     over week  on Dec '92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Argentina                 (11)    606.30      +0.8         +4.5 Brazil                    (44)    188.29      +3.3        +50.6 Chile                     (20)    409.92      -0.9         -2.1 Colombia*                  (8)    397.95      +1.9         -6.4 Mexico                    (59)    661.16      +1.6         -2.2 Venezuela**                (8)    598.27      +3.1        +15.1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- East Asia  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- South Korea***           (130)     99.76      -2.5         +1.6 Philippines               (11)    152.04      -0.1        +13.9 Taiwan, China****         (76)     84.12      +1.5        +14.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- South Asia  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- India*****                (61)     73.33      +1.6        -21.7 Indonesia******           (31)     79.11      -0.6        +34.8 Malaysia                  (61)    210.53      +4.5        +28.7 Pakistan*******            (8)    235.67      +7.7        +17.7 Thailand                  (52)    245.10      +1.2         +6.4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Euro/Mid East  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Greece                    (17)    226.75      +2.8        +16.1 Jordan                     (5)    164.39      -3.2        +40.7 Portugal                  (16)     90.27      -2.7        +17.0 Turkey********            (31)    127.42      -6.5        +90.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                       Local currency terms                                Jul 23      % Change      % Change Market                          1993      over week     on Dec '92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Argentina                   372,043.54       +0.8           +4.7 Brazil                   17,151,437.18       +9.8         +722.4 Chile                           663.78       -0.9           +3.5 Colombia*                       562.18       +2.0           -8.1 Mexico                          889.75       +1.4           -2.0 Venezuela**                   1,241.38       +3.7          +33.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- East Asia  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- South Korea***                  106.01       -2.4           +4.2 Philippines                     205.08       +3.1          +26.9 Taiwan, China****                83.59       +2.3          +19.9  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- South Asia  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- India*****                       81.09       +1.6          -15.1 Indonesia******                  89.81       -0.7          +36.6 Malaysia                        199.25       +4.3          +26.3 Pakistan*******                 300.21      +11.6          +29.5 Thailand                        246.51       +1.0           +5.7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Euro/Mid East  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Greece                          362.87       +3.4          +27.4 Jordan                          235.71       -3.6          +42.1 Portugal                        106.46        0.0          +36.6 Turkey********                  664.18       -6.5         +147.7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.

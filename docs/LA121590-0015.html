			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEATON TOO GOOD FOR LENDL;  </P> <P> TENNIS: HE UPSETS THE WORLD'S THIRD-RANKED PLAYER TO JOIN THREE OTHER AMERICANS  IN SEMIFINALS OF $6-MILLION TOURNAMENT.  </P> <P> David Wheaton used a powerful serve and an aggressive game to upset Ivan Lendl,  6-2, 7-6 (7-4), Friday to reach the semifinals of the $6-million Grand Slam  Cup.  </P> <P> Wheaton, a 21-year-old second-year pro ranked 27th in the world, dominated from  the first point to overpower Lendl of Czechoslovakia, the world's third-ranked  player and the top seeded player remaining in the richest tournament in tennis  history.  </P> <P> His victory in 1 hour 27 minutes made it certain that it will be an  all-American final.  </P> <P> Earlier, Brad Gilbert outlasted Aaron Krickstein in an error-filled match to  win, 6-7 (7-5), 6-4, 6-3.  </P> <P> In today's semifinals, Gilbert will play Wheaton, and Pete Sampras will face  Michael Chang.  </P> <P> "This is the biggest win of my career," Wheaton said. "I had a simple strategy  and that was to hit as deep as I could and to try to keep him under pressure."  </P> <P> Wheaton broke Lendl in the opening game to set the tone of the match.  </P> <P> Wheaton scored another break for a 4-1 lead, dropped his serve in the next  game, but broke again to lead, 5-2. Wheaton served out the set at love.  </P> <P> There were no breaks in the second set, but Wheaton was down 15-40 in the  fourth game.  </P> <P> "He hit an ace with his second serve, then an unreturnable serve, then another  ace. He served himself out of trouble," Lendl said.  </P> <P> Lendl himself fought off two break points in the ninth game.  </P> <P> Wheaton, seeded eighth, raced to a 3-0 lead in the tiebreak and had two match  points. Lendl saved the first with an effective return to the corner, but his  next return went long.  </P> <P> "The court is fast and favors his game," Lendl said. "He took full advantage of  it. I knew he can hit powerfully, but I was surprised how consistent he was. He  deserves to be in the semifinal."  </P> <P> By getting to the semifinals, Wheaton made sure of winning at least $450,000,  nearly doubling his career earnings of $481,712.  </P> <P> Gilbert, ranked 10th in the world, was also happy about the money.  </P> <P> "This is about three times more money than I ever made in a week and I feel  great about it," said Gilbert, who only came to the tournament as a replacement  for injured Andre Agassi. "And I can still make more."  </P></p>

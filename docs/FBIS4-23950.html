			<p>BFN     [Text] The Federal Government has reaffirmed the specific  dates for elections at various levels and the terminal date for  handing over power to a democratically-elected civilian  government will be announced on 16 January next year. The  minister of information and culture, Professor Jerry Gana,  stated this in Abuja yesterday while receiving the new British  high commissioner to Nigeria, Mr. Thorold Masefield, in his  office.    He said the announcement would mark the commencement of the  second phase of the political transitional program of the  present administration. Prof. Gana said government commitment  to a return to genuine democracy was total and irrevocable.    The minister pointed out that the government believed that  the transitional process should be peaceful, orderly, and  implemented in accordance with the popular will and not the wish  of a minority however vocal. Prof. Gana solicited the  understanding and support of Britain in view of her importance  in world affairs.    Responding, the British high commissioner, Mr. Masefield,  expressed the hope that the forthcoming national constitutional  conference would be able to solve the country's political  problem. He said it was in anticipation of this that he donated  books recently in support of the conference.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Munich SUEDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG writes on the outcome of  the European Parliament elections: The election expresses three  things. First, the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] is  experiencing an uplift; on the other hand, chancellor candidate  [Rudolf] Scharping's Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] is  in heavy turbulence. Second, the adventurous victory procession  of the Republikaner is over. Third, the Greens are taking over  the role of the Free Democratic Party [FDP] as the third  strongest party of the Republic. The CDU is quite obviously  benefiting from the improved economic situation and from Helmut  Kohl's authority in European politics. The Greens are winning  thanks to a clear opposition policy. The SPD is hardly likely  to gain any consolation from the communal elections for the  disaster of the European Parliament elections, says SUEDDEUTSCHE  ZEITUNG.    The SAECHSISCHE ZEITUNG of Dresden says: Nothing has been  decided yet in the German superelection year. In the 126 days  left until the Bundestag election, literally everything is  possible. That is the main message of the European Parliament  election, despite the clear victory of the CDU/CSU and the  equally clear defeat of the SPD. If people had voted in October  the way they did yesterday, the CDU/CSU would not have been able  to govern in the way it does now. Its partner, the FDP, would  not have attained the 5-percent threshold. In such a case, it  could only have governed together with the Alliance 90/Greens,  which is absolutely improbable, or entered into a grand  coalition with the Social Democrats under a new Helmut Kohl  chancellorship. But, in that case, an alliance of the SPD with  the Alliance 90/Greens would have been more probable, claims the  SAECHSISCHE ZEITUNG.    The LEIPZIGER VOLKSZEITUNG views things thus: The heirs of  the SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] are clearly profiting  from the economic problems; they are finding support above all  among those who have lost out on the change, especially the  unemployed. In addition, they have succeeded in representing  themselves as a kind of red CSU, the only eastern party to do  so. Many in the west will fail to understand this, but they  will have to live with this eastern German viewpoint and this  party, though it remains to be seen whether it will enter the  Bundestag.    DIE WELT of Berlin says: Chancellor Kohl is experiencing a  driving force for the decisive battle for the Bundestag in the  autumn. Obviously his CDU has succeeded in overcoming the  depression of the beginning of the year and stopping the  advancement of the parties situated to its right. Right now,  the rickety coalition partner FDP seems to be the only risk to  his government's future. Challenger Scharping's bid for power  is already pausing before it is ready to take a swing. His SPD  had to witness the disastrous march of the SED's heir PDS  [Democratic Socialist Party] in the east and the rise of the  Greens in the west, which are on its left, says DIE WELT.    The BRAUNSCHWEIGER ZEITUNG comments as follows: While the  SPD possesses a willing coalition partner in the surprisingly  strengthened Greens, whose admission to the Bundestag now seems  sure, the FDP's stroke of bad luck is continuing. In the end,  although Helmut Kohl could end up an election winner in October,  he might not have a coalition partner, and would thus end up the  loser after all. This imminent insecurity is probably clouding  the chancellor's pleasure not only with his party's performance,  but also with Austria's good election turnout and surprisingly  unanimous yes to membership of the European Union, the  BRAUNSCHWEIGER ZEITUNG believes.    The NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG reaches the following  conclusion: The strong gains of the PDS, and this must be said  with all due clarity, are no glorious chapter for the new  laender. Even if they mainly represent a protest,  understandable from the point of view of the labor market, it  will not be so easy to quickly forget the causes of the economic  misery. After all, it was the PDS' political forebears, the  autocrats inside the SED, who ruined the former GDR ecologically  and economically. To see them as emergency rescuers again is  asking for trouble, the OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG concludes.    The KOELNER STADTANZEIGER says that Helmut Kohl is now ahead  of Rudolf Scharping as the favorite in the race for the  Chancellery. The Free Democrats have once again been catapulted  out of the Strasbourg parliament. That is painful for the  foreign minister's party. Even so, in the second-vote election  campaign, the liberals can still hope to cross the 5-percent  threshold in the Bundestag election. After yesterday's vote,  the chances of a continuation of the Bonn coalition have even  improved markedly, says the KOELNER STADTANZEIGER.    Now a quotation from the KOBLENZER RHEIN-ZEITUNG: The upturn  for Kohl and his peers, which could be observed parallel to the  improved economic situation, is obviously continuing. On the  other hand, the extent of the defeat is a disaster for the SPD  and, above all, for its chancellor candidate Scharping. This is  no longer a question of a slight loss of form that was talked  about following Rau's defeat. Now Scharping's entire election  strategy is probably at issue, states the RHEIN-ZEITUNG.    The RHEIN-PFALZ, which appears in Ludwigshafen, notes: The  SPD, lately beset with sudden attacks of weakness, and  chancellor candidate Rudolf Scharping, who has acted clumsily  once or twice, have made victory easy for the CDU. In addition,  Scharping made a strategic error by dealing with almost nothing  but labor and employment policy topics in his election campaign.  He failed to show how he would handle foreign and security  policy in Europe, the RHEIN-PFALZ says.</p>

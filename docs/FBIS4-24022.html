			<p>BFN     [Text] All political parties in the PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Provincial Legislature have  indicated they will support the choice of Johannesburg as a  provincial capital. The report in which a special committee  recommends Johannesburg in preference to Pretoria or Midrand was  tabled in the Legislature this afternoon. The Freedom Front  said a condition for its support was that the ANC deal with the  question of Afrikaner cultural freedom with great  circumspection. The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] said it  supported Johannesburg as a short-term choice, but that Midrand  was more suitable in the long term. The Provincial Legislature  is to discuss the question tomorrow.</p>

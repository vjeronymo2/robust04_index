			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Leading Article: Living with US trade policy WASHINGTON'S self-righteous indignation over the sins, actual and alleged, of its trading partners is both irritating and depressing. But it is not a justification for despair. Much of the posturing is for domestic effect and also reflects the early days of an inexperienced administration with a predominantly domestic focus. Many in the administration, not least the president, understand the US interest in multilateral trade. It is up to others, above all the European Community, to help them focus on the wider picture. It will not be that easy, given the unwillingness of the administration to think trade policy out from first principles. Mr Mickey Kantor, President Clinton's feisty trade representative, argues that policy will be 'pragmatic', 'realistic' and 'results-oriented'. Not for him, he insists, are debates over the 'theology' of free trade versus protectionism. Yet only last week Mr Kantor said that 'we see a trade policy emerging that is more active, anticipatory, inclusive and flexible.' This may not be theology, but it is obscure. And what of the insistence on 'fairness'? Can anything be more theological than a notion that can be neither defined with precision, nor measured with accuracy. And, if 'fairness' means anything, what can be 'fair' about reliance on clout available only to a superpower? The starting point has to be an understanding of what trade is for? Trade's aim is to import things more cheaply than when made at home. In short, 'it's the imports, stupid.' The problem with much trade policy is that it is not based on this truth. This is true of 'fair trade' law, whose aim is to make imports more expensive than they need be. The policy is 'pragmatic', but largely in the sense that it buys more political support than it loses. Current US priorities are likely to fail the test of 'pragmatism' in far more than merely this fundamental sense. The North American Free Trade Agreement is economically important, but it cannot offer as much to the US as the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. Similarly, what has made more than 60 countries liberalise unilaterally since the start of the Uruguay Round in 1986 is recognition that such liberalism was in their own interest. But the more they are told that they owe liberalism to the US, the less politically acceptable such liberalism is likely to be. The end of the cold war has provided what may turn out to be a unique opportunity for establishing a liberal trading system with a truly global coverage. For the new administration this opportunity still has a relatively low priority. But this is no more than a period of transition. What could turn it into something more prolonged than that would be a decision by the EC, encouraged by the new French government, to take the US gauntlet up prematurely. Mr Clinton is still likely to obtain from Congress a relatively unencumbered renewal of the 'fast track' authority needed to complete NAFTA and the Uruguay Round. The US could then be once more the source of both the ideas and the energy to move global trade policy forward. In the meantime, it is up to the EC above all to stop the global trade show from running off the road.</p>

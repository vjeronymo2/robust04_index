			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> INFLATION SURGES 1.6% IN MONTH; GAS PRICE SOARS  </P> <P> Wholesale prices soared 1.6% in Sept-  </P> <P> ember -- an annual rate of more than 20% -- as gasoline prices shot up at their  fastest pace on record, the government reported Friday.  </P> <P> "The oil shock is hitting with a vengeance. . . . It's just one more jolt to an  already fragile economy," said Robert Dederick, chief economist at the Northern  Trust Co. of Chicago.  </P> <P> "This is the start of the wave of double-digit inflation we will have to suffer  through for the next quarter or two because of Iraq," said Allen Sinai, chief  economist at the Boston Co. "It's going to propel an economy that's already in  recession into a deeper recession."  </P> <P> While the Labor Department blamed much of the steep increase in wholesale costs  one step short of the retail level on costlier petroleum, prices excluding the  volatile energy and food areas were still up a worrisome 0.6% -- twice the  August gain.  </P> <P> The 20.6% rise in the cost of gasoline was the highest one-month increase since  the government began tracking the commodity in 1947.  </P> <P> At the earliest stage of the production process, crude oil prices rose 20.4%,  fueling analysts' concern that the higher prices will begin affecting the  thousands of plastic, chemical and other products made with petroleum.  </P> <P> Oil also shows up in utility costs and figures in prices for products that must  be transported long distances.  </P> <P> In a separate report, the Commerce Department said retail sales jumped 1.1%  last month, to a seasonally adjusted $151.2 billion, and were bolstered by the  soaring cost of gasoline and a partial recovery in auto sales. Excluding  gasoline, sales rose 0.8%.  </P> <P> Analysts say the combination of higher prices and stronger consumer spending  deepens the dilemma for the Federal Reserve, which has been under pressure from  the Bush Administration to ease its inflation-fighting campaign and lower  interest rates to spur the economy.  </P></p>

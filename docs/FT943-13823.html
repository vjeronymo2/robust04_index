			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Media Futures: WPP backs US study Martin Sorrell's WPP has joined the million dollar Electronic Assess Study in the US - one of the most significant attempts so far to find out what the electronic highway is actually going to be used for. WPP, the world's largest advertising group, whose agencies include Ogilvy &amp; Mather and J Walter Thompson, is the only marketing communications company to sponsor the study, which should continue beyond 1994. 'We believe our stock in trade is a deep understanding of the consumer. And our exclusive access to the findings of the study - exclusive, that is, in our line of work - ought to further sharpen our focus on consumers,' Sorrell said last week. The study, other sponsors of which include US West , Bell South, British Telecommunications, Fidelity Investments and the US Postal Service, will look at both supply and demand. Seventy companies will be asked about the services they would like to supply down an electronic highway. Researchers will also talk at length with 1,400 households to learn everything they can about what people are likely to want, and how much they will pay for it. One part of the research will be specifically about advertising. Sorrell believes that whatever form the information superhighway takes, interactive marketing - any back-and-forth communication between a buyer and a seller - will be in there some-where. The WPP chief executive believes that, no matter how, or at what speed, the technology develops, consumers will in the end be sitting in front of computers, television sets or videophones ordering, receiving and paying for a wide range of information, entertainment and other services.</p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Arts: Arguments rage over the ashes The strolling crowds that pack Barcelona's Las Ramblas at weekends will today throng in even greater numbers and gather halfway along the boisterous boulevard around the gutted remains of the Gran Teatre del Liceu opera house. In the bars and taverns on and off Las Ramblas, arguments will develop. There will be two broad camps in conflict with each other: the 'Liceu should stay where it is and be faithfully rebuilt' brigade and its opponents, who argue that the opera house should be moved elsewhere and be completely redesigned. The arguments have been rising in pitch and tone, repeated endlessly in the Spanish media, ever since a maintenance man's blow torch ignited a curtain on the Liceu's stage on Monday morning and set the building ablaze. The fire burnt out the stage, the backstage and the auditorium, a tiny stalls area and row upon row of perpendicularly stacked boxes. The Liceu was a deep and gorgeously decorated cylinder but when the flames were finally put out, what remained was a charred bucket. Only a blackened, roofless shell was left peering out on to Las Ramblas. Barcelona justifiably considered its 150-year old opera house to be the equal of La Scala and Covent Garden. When theLiceu was burned down in 1861, 17 years after it first opened, the city rebuiltit within a year and ensured that it was even more fabulously ornate than before. Montserrat Caballe, who started her career in the Liceu and whose brother and agent Carlos is believed to have an important role in arranging the opera house schedule, is a stalwart traditionalist. The opera house has to stay in the 'heart of Barcelona' because, she says, it is a 'symbol' of her home city. And what is more, 'we have the duty to give our children an inheritence to feel proud about, just as we received it from our forefathers.' The architect Oscar Tusquets, a celebrity in a city that has always put its local architects on a pedestal, belongs to the second camp. 'What's happening to us in Barcelona?' he taunts the old guard. 'Have we lost all confidence about doing something new?' In Gaudi's city these are strong words. When it was first built in the 19th century, Barcelona's opera house was designed to be the flashy cultural citadel of a high bourgeoisie that was coining it in with its cotton looms and assorted sweat shops. The plutocrats paid fortunes to buy their own boxes, which came complete with sitting rooms, dining rooms and private kitchens. The problem for these opera patrons, who handed down their boxes from father to son, or sold them for sums equivalent to the price of an average family home, was that as the city developed, the Liceuended up slap in the steamy centre of bohemian and working class Barcelona. It has always been the target for a certain amount of hostility. Towards the end of the last century an anarchist tossed a bomb into the Liceu's stalls and in the twilight of the Franco years, when the city was again in ferment, lefties would regularly jeer at first night audiences as they turned up in their jewels and tails. Supporters of the architect Tusquets would like theLiceu of the 21st century to be daringly innovative; 'courageous' is the wordTusquets uses. They seek a mix of the Parisian La Bastille and the Sydney OperaHouse which would be set gleamingly atop the Montjuic hill where the 1992 Olympics were staged. And they decidedly want a 'people's opera house' since it will be public money which will be used to relaunch the Liceu - more than Pta9bn (Pounds 43m) according to initial estimates). The likelihood, however, is that the Caballe camp will win the battle. The soprano gathered her supporters around her yesterday inside the Liceu's charred hull to give a necessarily open-air performance. Caballe sang 'El Cant dels ocells', the Song of the birds, the hauntingly sentimental ballad of fellow Catalan Pau Casals. Itwas a magical start to her campaign to have the Liceu rise phoenix-like out of its ashes.</p>

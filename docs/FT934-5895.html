			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Bourne End purchases and rights Bourne End Properties is effectively trebling in size through two acquisitions and a rights issue. The 63 per cent stake held by Mr Leo Noe, chief executive, through his company Vasella, will fall to 36 per cent after the deal. The shares were suspended at 97p pending an announcement on the deal in October, when the group announced reduced losses of Pounds 145,000 (Pounds 543,000) for the six months to end-June. There are three elements to the deal, which will leave the group with gross assets of Pounds 135m and net assets of Pounds 35.1m. Bourne will acquire from Mr Noe property independently valued at Pounds 44m and with debts totalling Pounds 33.4m. It will pay Pounds 600,000 in cash and issue 13.9m shares at a notional price of 70p apiece. Bourne will acquire from Dawnay Day property independently valued at Pounds 48.1m and with debts totalling Pounds 36.5m. It will pay Pounds 5.95m in cash and an issue of 5.8m ordinary shares, also at a notional 70p. It will make a 3-for-1 rights issue at 65p a share, fully underwritten by Credit Lyonnais Laing, to raise approximately Pounds 16.3m before expenses. Mr Noe is not taking up his rights; Credit Lyonnais will place the entitlement of 15.9m shares.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities depressed by US economic fears Wall Street INVESTOR skittishness depressed US equity markets yesterday afternoon, with worries about inflation conspiring with the recent release of disappointing economic data to leave Wall Street unsettled, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 34.04 to 3,449.93 and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 4.41 at 441.43, while the Nasdaq composite shed 2.27 to 702.22. New York SE volume was 220.7m shares. Before the afternoon sell-off, prices were trapped in a narrow trading range throughout the morning, never breaking more than a few points above or below opening values. Many investors and dealers were reluctant to trade equities because of doubts about the outlook for the economy and the approaching second quarter reporting season. Even strong overseas stock markets, and a morning jump in bond prices, which sent the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond to a record low of 6.664 per cent, failed to stimulate buying interest. Foreign equities were boosted by last week's cut in German interest rates, while bond prices rose on reports that the poor June jobs figures would persuade the Federal Reserve to postpone any plans for an inflation-curbing rise in US rates. By the afternoon, equity and bond prices moved solidly lower as surging commodities prices left investors increasingly nervous about inflation. In late trading the long bond's yield had risen to 6.676 per cent. General Motors, however, added Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 44 1/8 on reports that Wall Street analysts were turning increasingly bullish on the stock in the wake of improvements in the company's product line. In the afternoon the company reported the best sales month ever for its GMC Truck unit. Ford slid Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 48 3/8 and Chrysler eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 45 5/8 . Selected technology stocks were hard hit by analysts' downgrades. Hewlett-Packard dropped Dollars 5 to Dollars 75 1/2 in volume of 2.2m shares after SoundView Financial lowered its 1993 earnings forecast because of concern over possible weakness in the printer business. Tandem Computer fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 10 after Morgan Stanley cut its investment rating from a 'buy' to a 'hold' and lowered its earnings forecast. On the Nasdaq market, Apple Computer ended a net Dollars  3/4 lower at Dollars 37 3/4 after firming in morning trading on news that it plans to shed 16 per cent of its staff. Canada TORONTO posted a small loss in active trading after gold shares rose but oils continued to decline. The TSE 300 index ended 6.1 off at 3,984.4 and falls led rises by 412 to 358. Volume swelled to 86.3m shares, the fourth highest on record. The golds sector advanced 2.45 per cent as the bullion price jumped USDollars 6.50 an ounce in New York. The oil and gas index fell 2.2 per cent.</p>

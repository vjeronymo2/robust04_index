			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Pressure for action on Maxwell MINISTERS ARE to come under fresh pressure over the plight of pensioners of companies formerly owned by Robert Maxwell, after an informal cross-party meeting of MPs this afternoon. Mr Richard Page, Tory MP for Hertfordshire South-West and one of the organisers of the meeting, said yesterday that the government should give an up-to-date statement or provide time for a Commons debate, because in certain cases the pension money would run out at the end of June. He also expected the meeting to agree to put a firm request to ministers for an investigation into the role of the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (Imro), the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, which has come in for particular criticism. The MPs are likely to renew questions to Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England, calling on the Bank to take a more active approach to its supervisory role. The meeting may also lead to pressure for the early re-establishment of the cross-party social security committee, so it can continue its investigation into the affair. Mr Frank Field, the Labour chairman of the committee in the last parliament, is the meeting's co-sponsor. So far since the election, the government's only comment on the Maxwell affair has come from Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary. Last Thursday he rejected opposition calls for the government to commit itself to underwriting any shortfall in Maxwell pension funds, but promised to announce plans to review the framework of occupational pension law in the next few weeks. In the Commons, delays over the mounting of prosecutions in cases where former employees of companies controlled by Maxwell had been 'swindled' out of their pension rights were criticised by Mr David Winnick (Lab Walsall North). He pressed for an assurance that there would be no 'cover-up' over what had occured in Maxwell's companies. The attorney general, Sir Nicholas Lyell, said the matters arising from the Maxwell case were being carefully, professionally and expeditiously investigated by a special team. Referring to a meeting of the Commons social security committee in January, Mr David Harris (C St Ives) recalled that counsel representing one of Mr Maxwell's sons said he should not answer questions because 'he believed he was on the threshold of charges'. Sir Nicholas emphasised that the counsel who appeared before the select committee for Mr Maxwell had no authority to speak one way or the other for the prosecution. Also yesterday, Mr Dennis Skinner (Lab Bolsover), called for a fraud squad investigation into Olympia and York, the troubled property developer involved in Europe's biggest new office project at Canary Wharf in London. He said it was a 'scandal' that the company, which owed Dollars 12bn (Pounds 6.7bn), was now in hock to the banks which, as in the Maxwell case, were having to 'loan it money in order to keep it afloat'. Mr Skinner also said it was 'despicable' that the government was bailing out the company. Resolution nears, Page 22</p>

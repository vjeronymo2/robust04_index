			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE OFF BEAT: A PLEASANT, SOULFUL SURPRISE FROM HOLMES BROTHERS  </P> <P> Never fails. Every time you think there can't possibly be any surprises left in  American roots music, something surfaces that isn't 12-bar business as usual.  New artists like the Holmes Brothers pop up with a fresh set of influences or  an obscure recording by an underrecognized singer like O. V. Wright is  re-issued.  </P> <P> Pleasant surprises are the focus of this American edition of "On the Offbeat,"  a periodic review of roots, ethnic and non-mainstream pop music from around the  world.  </P> <P>  1/2 The Holmes Brothers, "In The Spirit," Rounder. This New York quintet,  anchored by transplanted Virginians Wendell and Sherman Holmes and Popsy Dixon,  isn't a blues band per se -- the sound covers the R&amp;B front from the  mid-'50s up to the late '60s Stax soul era. The most distinctive of its debut  album: a vocals-oriented approach from the gospel church, drummer Dixon's  falsetto cries.  </P> <P> The arrestingly rough, soulful singing helps the Holmes Brothers weather  occasional lapses in the arrangements and breathes some life into a couple of  too familiar blues/soul standards. Even though the musical components are  hardly new, there's a refreshing absence of formula on "In The Spirit."  </P> <P> O.V. Wright, "Live," Hi/Demon import. Wright was the gospel shouter counterpart  to Al Green's smooth slickster during the latter's mid-'70s salad days on  Memphis' Hi Records. Wright never became popular outside the R&amp;B market . .  . and Japan, judging from the crowd response to this live album recorded at two  Tokyo concerts in 1979.  </P> <P> The reaction isn't too surprising considering the dynamic opening salvo of some  of Wright's best songs -- "Blind, Crippled and Crazy," the exceptional "Eight  Men and Four Women," and "Precious, Precious" -- and the rough-edged,  passionate support of the Hi rhythm section that backed Green on all his hits.  The rest is merely a history lesson of gospel-rooted Southern soul delivered by  a great singer (who died of cancer the following year) and a band that isn't  just going through the motions. You need more?  </P> <P>  1/2 Buckwheat Zydeco, "Where There's Smoke, There's Fire," Island. Buckwheat  Zydeco may be too versatile for his own good. His previous Island albums  suffered from a patchwork eclecticism that prevented potent individual tracks  from adding up to a cohesive whole. "Where There's Smoke, There's Fire,"  produced by Los Lobos' David Hidalgo, falls victim to the same malaise.  </P> <P> The most inspired selection -- and biggest missed opportunity -- is the Stones'  "Beast of Burden." The first two minutes are so soulful that a Top 40 hit for  Buckwheat Zydeco is actually conceivable . . . until the arrangement falters  badly and the song sadly just peters out.  </P> <P> Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to five (a classic).  </P> <P> </P></p>

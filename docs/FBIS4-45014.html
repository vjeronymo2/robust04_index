			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dinesh Kumar: "Stinger Finds Way Into Valley"] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, May 10.    A new and dangerous dimension has been added to the Kashmir  militancy with the first ever recovery of the highly capable  U.S.-made shoulder-fired surface-to-air Stinger missile by the  army in the Valley on April 30.    Initial reports had mentioned that a five foot long missile  had been recovered by a routine army patrol close to the border  in the Valley's high altitude Kupwara sector. Along with the  missile, the army had recovered two rockets and a booster.    However, while credible sources here confirm that the  missile  was a Stinger, it has been difficult to obtain further details  in view of the claim that the missile was destroyed while being  transported to an army formation headquarters. One army jawan  was reported to have been injured in this claimed incident.    This is the first substantive report among many rumours and  claims in the past that the dreaded Stinger missile has actually  entered the Valley. It is also the first time that a Stinger  missile has been recovered by security forces in any of the  terrorist and insurgency stricken areas in the country.    The introduction of the shoulder fired Stinger adds a lethal  dimension to Pakistan backed terrorism in the Valley. Not only  does this U.S.-made missile render vulnerable commercial and  VVIP [very very important person] aircraft flying in the valley,  but it also impedes routine sortie flying and occasional air  exercises undertaken by Indian Air Force fighter aircraft in the  Valley.    In winter when the Valley is cut off by road owing to heavy  snowfall and landslides, the only link between the Valley and  the rest of the country is by air.    It is noteworthy to mention here that it had been the US  made  Stinger which had decisively tilted the balance against the  Russians in Afghanistan despite the former's advanced military  power. The Stinger, which has an advanced heat-seeking missile  can detect the hot exhaust of an aircraft at even four miles  away and upto 5,000 feet in altitude.    The Americans no doubt have been making efforts to recover  each and every Stinger missile it had initially given out but  evidently has not been entirely successful in this mission.    The more readily available Russian SA-7 Grail shoulder fired  infra-red missile is way behind its U.S. counterpart in terms of  accuracy and range.    In the recent past, hauls of sophisticated weaponary in the  Valley supplied by Pakistan have ranged from 107 mm artillery  shells, fin stabilised 57 mm air-to-ground rockets, 60mm  mortars, high velocity grenades meant to be used from automatic  grenade launchers, disposable rocket launchers, grenades of NATO  origin, long-range high-frequency sophisticated wireless sets  with multi-mode facilities and even U.S. made portable solar  panels for charging batteries for wireless sets.</p>

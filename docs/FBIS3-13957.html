In an address to the nation, Prime Minister Bhutto said the day  is not far off when Kashmir will be a part of Pakistan. She  said her government would ask the Geneva-based Human Rights  Commission to expose Indian repression in Kashmir. Whatever  gestures one makes, Pakistan does not want to cool off the  anti-Indian tirade. With the same objective in mind, a call has  been made to observe a general strike in Pakistan on 5 February  on the Kashmir issue.    The Pakistani Government last week sent two nonofficial  proposals on holding a plebiscite in Kashmir that were rejected  by India because it said only the Shimla Agreement could be the  basis for talks. On the other hand, Pakistan believes that  unless the so-called repression in Kashmir is not stopped,  jailed Kashmiris are not freed, and the siege of Hazratbal  Shrine in Srinagar not ended, there could be no meaningful  dialogue with India. Obviously, Pakistan does not desire  negotiations at all. It is only putting forth excuses.  Pakistan should realize that eventually all issues are settled  through talks and not by guns. If Pakistan still does not  desire to enter into a dialogue, it will mean that it is not  serious and wants to vitiate the atmosphere before the start of  any negotiations.    The six proposals sent by India are definitely significant  in  the context of the normalization of relations. India has  proposed to maintain peace at the Line of Control in Kashmir --  like the one agreed upon with China, although both sides will  not give up their claims. This means that as an interim measure  it will be accepted that for the time being that the  Pakistan-ruled part of Kashmir will remain with it and the  Indian-ruled Kashmir with us, while mutual talks will continue  on the border claims. If Pakistan does not accept such a  revolutionary proposal, it will be clear that its intentions are  not honest. After all, how would Pakistan be threatened if it  agrees to the proposal that no country make the first use of its  nuclear capability against one another? The above two proposals  are aimed at creating mutual trust. The demilitarization of  Siachen Glacier, the delineation of Sir Creek maritime boundary  near Kutch, and the settlement of the Tulbul barrage issue are  all proposals made by India in good faith. Revitalizing the  Joint Working Commission is also a need of the hour. If  Pakistan agrees to hold talks on all these proposals, a  favorable atmosphere will be created for a dialogue on Kashmir  as well. Pakistan will achieve nothing by putting the Kashmir  gun on India's temple. India is fully capable of defending its  borders. Pakistan is intimidating the world by shouting Kashmir,  Kashmir, and by doing so it is also gaining sympathy. We should  strive to counter Pakistan's Kashmir diplomacy. Dialogue should  go on, Pakistan should be brought to its senses and war  readiness should be ensured, that is the only alternative left  for India. However, the best scenario will be if good sense  prevails upon Pakistan and it comes to the talks with a  realistic approach.  *</p>

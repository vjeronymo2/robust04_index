			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / International Company News: Motorola beats IBM to market with PowerPC-based machines Motorola, the US electronics and communications manufacturer, has beaten International Business Machines, its technology partner, to market with personal computers based on PowerPC microprocessor chips, jointly developed by the companies and Apple Computer. Apple introduced its first 'Power Macintosh' computers incorporating the new microprocessors earlier this year but IBM postponed its range until next year. IBM already offers scientific workstations and multi-user computers based on PowerPC technology. Motorola yesterday announced a range of PowerPC computers including desktop models aimed at the PC market, 'servers' which are used to manage networks of desktop computers, and multi-user computer systems. The launches mark the first time that Motorola has entered the high-volume PC market with a system-level product. The company said it planned to broaden the computer product line with systems aimed at departmental and enterprise-wide computing over the next year. 'The Motorola computer group is committed to becoming the premier source of a full line of computer systems and single board computers based on the PowerPC microprocessor,' said Mr Karl Stoltze, vice-president of marketing. The company aims to sell the computers to third parties, most of whom relabel them, add software and sell on. Motorola also disclosed technology agreements with IBM to license that company's AIX (a version of Unix) computer operating system software, and with Groupe Bull to license its symmetrical multiprocessing technology. Bull is expected to be one of Motorola's customers for the new line of computers. The PowerPC microprocessor is more powerful than competing chips from Intel, say Motorola and IBM. This makes them well suited to demanding desktop applications such as multimedia with video and graphics. However, the new chips lack the broad software base available for Intel-based PCs. It was this lack of software that led IBM to delay the launch of its PowerPC personal computers.</p>

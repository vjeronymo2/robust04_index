			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Han Zhenjun [7281 2182 6511]] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 27 November (Xin Hua) -- Researchers at the  Chinese Atomic Energy Research Institute had successfully built  China's first radioactive nuclear secondary beam line on the  largest domestic tandem accelerator. On 20 November, they  succeeded in obtaining Carbon-11 and Fluorine-17 radioactive  nuclear beams from the beam line. This achievement greatly  expanded the scope and depth of nuclear physics research in this  country; it also made China one of the world leaders in this  field.    According to reports, researchers at the Tandem Accelerator  National Laboratory used Boron-11 and Oxygen-16 produced by the  accelerator to stabilize the nuclear beam, then used the newly  constructed secondary beam line to separate, transport and focus  the nuclear beams of different mass and energy; finally, the  desired Carbon-11 and Fluorine-17 were obtained in the target  chamber at the end of beam line. The test results indicate that  the performance of this facility meets the expected performance  indices. It is believed that currently only two or three large  laboratories in the United States and Japan have constructed  similar radioactive secondary facilities to carry out these  experiments.    Today, the radioactive nuclear beam is an active area of  research in nuclear physics. The knowledge base accumulated in  nuclear physics has been built on the foundation of experimental  research where more than 2,000 nuclides have been produced by  bombarding a target with stable nuclear beams. But we have  reached a point where it is very difficult to produce new  nuclides using stable nuclear beams. Radioactive nuclear beam  provides a possible means for producing thousands of yet  undiscovered new nuclides; it also provides a unique opportunity  for studying the evolution of celestial bodies, nuclear  structures, and new phenomena and basic laws of nuclear  reactions. As a consequence, the scope and depth of China's  nuclear physics research will be significantly expanded.    This tandem accelerator has an end voltage of 13 million  volts; it is located in the Tandem Accelerator National  Laboratory of the Chinese Atomic Energy Research Institute. In  the past, this accelerator has played an important role in  China's nuclear physics research where it has been used to  perform mass spectral analysis of beryllium-10, to simulate the  single-particle effect in large integrated circuits, and to  study the time of flight of abnormal fast neutrons.    This project is supported by the National Foundation of  Natural Science and the Chinese Nuclear Science Foundation.</p>

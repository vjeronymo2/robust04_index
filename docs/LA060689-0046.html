			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: DEER HUNTERS GET THE DROP ON BAMBI  </P> <P> Every so often the question arises -- why do Americans need semiautomatic  weapons to kill deer? Even the President is concerned that if he bans domestic  assault weapons he would be hurting the rights of sportsmen.  </P> <P> In order to understand why you need a semiautomatic for sport, you have to go  back in history before these guns played such an important role in splatting  animals.  </P> <P> Once upon a time there lived a very ferocious deer named Bambi (also known as  Bambi the Bully), who roamed hither and yon with a gang of terrifying animals,  including squirrels, rabbits and chipmunks. They preyed on innocent hunters and  sportsmen who just wanted to enjoy the outdoors with their dogs. Bambi had  hoofs that could trample a mushroom to death. He also had sharp teeth that  could scare a butterfly out of a duck blind. He was truly the most dangerous  animal in the forest.  </P> <P> Such was the power of Bambi and his henchman, Thumper, a killer rabbit, that it  didn't take long before many hunters were afraid to go into the woods.  </P> <P> One day Bambi was out looking for food with his mother when he heard shots. He  became furious and turned to face the men who had fired them. As soon as they  saw the look of maniacal hatred in Bambi's eyes, the hunters fell to their  knees, and one of them cried, "Don't hurt us. The Constitution says we have a  right to rat-a-tat-tat."  </P> <P> "Guns don't kill deer," the other hunter yelled, "deer kill people."  </P> <P> At this point, Bambi stuck his antlers into the hunters' backsides and they ran  away. The owl hooted, the frogs croaked and the foxes ran in circles.  </P> <P> The screaming hunters made straight for the headquarters of the National Gun  Lovers Society where they breathlessly told their story to Charlton Heston. Gun  lovers at the target range heard the tale and decided to hang Bambi in effigy  -- and boycott his movies.  </P> <P> A man shouted to the armed multitudes, "The reason we can't go into the forest  is because we don't have enough fire power to protect ourselves."  </P> <P> Someone in the crowd yelled back, "Give us the guns so that we can do the job."  </P> <P> Another person said, "Unless we have heavier magazines, we'll never thin out  the herds."  </P> <P> The rally went on all afternoon. Finally, because the gun lovers had done so  much to get the President elected, they went to see him to make their pitch.  </P> <P> They related the story of Bambi and how he was destroying the pleasures of deer  shooting. To emphasize their point, the two hunters took down their pants and  showed the President what Bambi had done.  </P> <P> The President, who had seen a lot of terrible sights during World War II, was  never more horrified. He decided that the only way to protect deer hunters was  to allow them to purchase the assault weapon of their choice, without any  questions.  </P> <P> Once permission was granted, thousands of gun lovers traded in their rifles for  semiautomatics. Now the battle between deer and the American sportsman is even.  People who have seen Bambi in the woods say he is no longer the cocky, vicious  stag he used to be. He has been hiding in the thicket, as has Thumper the  rabbit. Thanks to semiautomatic weapons, the Bambis of this world will never  frighten a hunter again.  </P></p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Unsteady footing at financial summit: Why Mediobanca, the Italian merchant bank, is in need of new ideas Italy's most powerful merchant bank, Mediobanca, is facing a crisis of confidence. After 40 years at the pinnacle of the country's financial establishment, serious flaws have been exposed in the strategies on which it built its success. Even some of its long-standing industrial clients have begun to question their close relationship with the bank. Ever since the Second World War, Mediobanca has controlled the levers of power in Italy's financial and business world. The man tugging on the handles has been Enrico Cuccia, now, at 84, Mediobanca's honorary chairman, but still very much in charge. Mr Cuccia has built Mediobanca's influence on two sets of alliances, at home and abroad. Within Italy, it has acted as the house bank of the salotto buono, the family groupings that dominate Italian business, enhancing their control with ever more complex webs of shareholdings. Elsewhere in Europe, rather than open its own foreign offices, it has developed close, informal links with a handful of well-established merchant banks, such as Germany's Berliner Handels-und Frankfurter Bank (BHF), the UK's S G Warburg and France's Lazard Freres. Until now, these twin sets of alliances have reinforced one another. Mediobanca's dominance at home has increased its usefulness to its foreign allies; the strength of its international relationships has enhanced its usefulness to its domestic clients. Now, this neat pattern is unravelling. In three recent deals, for some of the bank's biggest clients - the Agnelli family, the Pirelli tyres and cables group and Generali, Italy's biggest insurer - Mediobanca has stumbled. Its strategy is running into trouble, at home and abroad. Within Italy, Mediobanca's dominance is threatened by the passage of investor protection laws to safeguard minority shareholders and promote greater transparency in big business transactions. This is a direct attack on the salotto buono's pattern of secretive pacts between small groups of shareholders - and hence on Mediobanca, architect of many such agreements. In the rest of Europe, Mr Cuccia's policy of alliances rather than direct expansion looks increasingly old-fashioned. The creation of a single European market and the growth of cross-border mergers and acquisitions have led the continent's big banking houses to establish wholly-owned pan-European networks. Informal working alliances are out of style. The problems created by its failure to establish a wider network of its own is well illustrated by the most spectacular of Mediobanca's recent setbacks: Pirelli's defeat in its 15-month struggle to take over Continental, its German rival in the tyre business. The failure has a number of causes but neither Pirelli nor Mediobanca, traditionally its principal adviser, emerges well from the story. Continental's adviser was Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank bought in November 1989 by Deutsche Bank - with which Mediobanca has worked closely in the past. Deutsche Bank's acquisition of Morgan Grenfell was a striking example of the newly forming pan-European investment banking networks. The Continental battle was a clear victory for the new era: the combination of Anglo-Saxon takeover expertise and solidarity among the German financial and industrial companies which rallied to Continental's defence left Pirelli and Mediobanca outgunned. Mediobanca's second setback has come in France, where the Agnelli family, which controls Italy's biggest industrial group, Fiat, is fighting for control of Perrier, the mineral water concern. For decades, Mediobanca has been the Agnellis' closest and most trusted financial adviser. It is not directly involved in the Perrier bid, and so its prestige is not immediately at risk. But the stakes are high, nonetheless: the Agnellis look like losing Perrier to a bid from Nestle, the Swiss food group, backed by Lazard Freres and other important French banking names. Mediobanca has had to stand helplessly by as one of its most important clients has run foul of one of its traditional allies, Lazard Freres. The third setback came at home, where its L1,750bn rights issue for Generali last year - the biggest capital-raising exercise by a quoted company in Italy - prompted unprecedented criticism by politicians and the press. For years, Mediobanca has been the company's merchant bank; it is also the biggest single shareholder in Generali, with a stake of almost 6 per cent. Bankers criticised Generali's rights issue as an attempt by Mediobanca to reinforce its hold over the company. Suspicions were aroused by the byzantine structure of the deal, which involved both new shares and warrants to purchase additional stock in future. Under the terms, voting rights for those shares not taken up immediately by investors would rest with a Mediobanca-controlled subsidiary. That could leave Mediobanca controlling another 20 per cent of the company's expanded share capital. The storm caused by the Generali deal provoked an outcry in the Italian parliament. The controversy played into the hands of politicians seeking new rules to protect small shareholders. Legislation to guarantee minority shareholders' rights is commonplace in most big industrialised countries, but only became law in Italy at the end of January. The new regulations strike at the heart of Mediobanca's use of equity holdings to cement its dominant position in corporate finance. One of Mr Cuccia's most famous observations is that shares in Italy are not counted, but weighed. That refers to Mediobanca's technique of assembling small groups of shareholders, each owning a fraction of a quoted company, but whose pooled interests are enough to give them control. Such long-term shareholder pacts lie behind many of Italy's best-known groups like Pirelli and Olivetti. The new Italian laws do not specifically ban shareholders' pacts. However, the exact status of these agreements is now uncertain, and could soon be tested in the courts. The new legislation also outlaws the practice of selling significant stakes in quoted companies at a premium price, one of Mediobanca's favourite corporate power-broking techniques. The laws threaten Mediobanca's style of backroom diplomacy, increasingly anachronistic in Italy's new era of corporate transparency. Its whole style  -an intense dislike for publicity, a powerful, inbred corporate culture - may also have been overtaken by events. Mediobanca has just over 100 professional bankers among its 300 staff, all based in a single Milanese palazzo. Competitors define them as almost a 'fraternity', professional and dedicated, but prone to arrogance. 'Its staff may be brilliant, but even Mediobanca has to adjust to the new era,' says a leading Italian banker. 'Merchant banks much bigger and more powerful than Mediobanca have recognised they must follow their clients abroad.' The pressures on Mediobanca are worsened by growing domestic competition. Dozens of new merchant banks have sprung up in the past five years. Many are insignificant. But some, like Akros, the highly capitalised merchant bank, are already licking at Mediobanca's heels. Others, like SIGE, the Milan-based investment banking arm of the IMI financial services group, can rely on a steady flow of business from their parent companies. A turning point may have come last year when SIGE was appointed by the UK government to be the lead manager for the Italian part of the UK electricity privatisation. Traditionally, Mediobanca would have expected that role by right. It is not too late for the bank to adapt to the new era, building on its strengths to create a new, less inward looking and conservative institution. Its chairman, Mr Francesco Cingano, is a respected banker and former managing director of Banca Commerciale Italiana, the country's most prestigious commercial bank. He is well regarded, but hardly the breath of fresh air to revolutionise Mediobanca. To safeguard its central role in Italian finance, Mediobanca will have to come to terms with more transparent domestic markets and a new era of European competition. That may have to wait until the moment Mr Cuccia surrenders control. To preserve the bank they inherit, Mr Cuccia's heirs may find themselves dismantling much of his legacy.</p>

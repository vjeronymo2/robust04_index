			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Short-Term Economic View Is Fair </F> Says the National Institute for the Study of the Economic  Situation"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 16 -- The barometer gauging the  Italian economic trend is set on fair, said ISCO [National  Institute for the Study of the Economic Situation], the  institute for short-term economic trend studies, which cited a  substantial pick-up in domestic demand, renewed confidence among  consumers and businessmen, increased exports and inflation still  well under control.    In a report issued today, ISCO said the only cloud on the  horizon is that represented by industrial production suffering  from "domestic demand which is still weak." The institute  recalled that ISTAT, the National Statistics Institute, reported  an industrial output increase of only 0.9 percent in January "as  a result of differing trends in various sectors."    Uncertainties in industrial activities, moreover, still  weigh  on the labor market as seen by joblessness which grew from 9.4  percent in January 1993 to 11.3 percent in January this year,  said ISCO.    On domestic demand, the institute said already in November  last year, ISTAT indicated that retail sales were growing at the  annual rate of 6 percent, led by mass marketing outlets for  which the increase was put at 6.9 percent, by hard goods, up by  9.7 percent for home appliances and consumer electronics and by  7.9 percent for photography equipment. Sales reported by big  supermarkets rose by 13.7 percent annually, noted ISCO.    For inflation, ISCO said the increase for March was limited  to 0.2 percent, as reported by ISTAT, and well below the figures  for January and February, 0.6 and 0.4 percent, to leave the  annual rate steady at 4.3 percent.    Growth on the export front has been further confirmed by the  heightened competitive stance of national industry and  accompanied by a lower profile on the side of domestic demand,  said ISCO.</p>

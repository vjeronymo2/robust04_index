			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> MARY'S DANISH SELLS OUT THE ROXY  </P> <P> Riding high on the local success of its debut album "There Goes the  Wondertruck," Mary's Danish graduated from minor club status to headlining a  sold-out Roxy on Thursday night. Part of the sextet's burgeoning popularity is  based on "Don't Crash the Car Tonight," a hot KROQ-FM item filled with enough  late-night despair and rumbling, roaring energy to please the pickiest of X  fans.  </P> <P> And X -- the much admired Los Angeles rock band led by John Doe and Exene  Cervenka -- does mark one of the several roads the energetic Mary's Danish  travels. Singers Gretchen Seager and Julie Ritter often resemble dueling  Exenes, the blond Seager's hollow-toned drawl caroming off the dark-haired  Ritter's nasal, histrionic squall. And it works -- at first.  </P> <P> On songs like "Mary Had a Bat" and "Hey There Man," the women's idiosyncratic  harmonizing created a striking complement to some bluesy rock 'n' soul grooves  reminiscent of a Haight-Ashbury party band. (How did these two former UCLA  French majors develop those Southern hick accents? Chalk it up to that L.A.  street-rocker/poet-discovers-Americana aesthetic that confuses country and  Western with Hollywood and Western.)  </P> <P> But without the personality, poetic suspense and X-perience of its role models  behind it, the static vocal assault eventually became an irritating drone.  </P> <P> But Mary's Danish (which returns to the Roxy on Monday and Tuesday, opening for  Stan Ridgway) was a delectable confection compared to second-billed Too Free  Stooges, a dead-on-arrival joke band featuring two guys impersonating tacky  lounge comedians in front of a trio playing hoary Cream songs and "Jesus Christ  Superstar."

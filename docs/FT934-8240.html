			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / Strike starts in Bolivia BOLIVIA'S trade unions began an indefinite national strike yesterday to protest against plans to eliminate thousands of government jobs, Reuter reports from La Paz. The Roman Catholic Church, acting as a mediator between the government and unions, said after last-minute talks on Sunday night there was still a chance of resolving the conflict. But the government told the unions to call off the protest, saying it would not negotiate while the strike was on. The strike is the worst conflict between workers and the government since the centrist government of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada took over in August. Union officials said miners, railway and health workers and teachers had joined the strike, which began at midnight on Sunday. But transport in La Paz, as well as shops, banks and private industries, were all working. Four earlier protest strikes called by the union confederation, COB, failed to paralyse the country. Mr Sanchez de Lozada, a wealthy businessman who criticised the former centre-right government of President Jaime Paz Zamora for economic drift and corruption, has announced plans to fire 10,000 of the country's 220,000 state employees. Another 70,000 state workers are due to be gradually removed from the payroll over the next few years. Union leaders were due to meet late yesterday to decide whether to continue the strike.</p>

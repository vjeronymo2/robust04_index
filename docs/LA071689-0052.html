			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PULL LIGHT INTO HOME FROM ABOVE;  </P> <P> BETTER SKYLIGHTS MAKE INSTALLATION AND UPKEEP EASIER FOR HOMEOWNERS.  </P> <P> Skylights: For the past 20 years or so, they have been one of the hottest  "accessories" to be added to the home. And during that time, the reasons for  adding them have gotten better and better.  </P> <P> Not many years ago, skylights were "net energy wasters." What they gained in  terms of free light and wintertime solar heating, they more than lost in terms  of winter heat loss and unwanted summer heat gain.  </P> <P> To solve that problem, the major makers formed a committee to discover ways to  improve efficiency. What they found was that most energy loss was taking place  through highly conductive metal skylight frames, and through air leaks.  </P> <P> It didn't take them long to remedy that situation. Improved seals and gaskets  were the answer to air leaks. To combat conductive losses through the frame,  some makers switched from metal to vinyl or fiberglass. Others stayed with  metal, but installed "thermal breaks," insulating barriers of plastic between  inner and outer shells of the frame.  </P> <P> With those improvements, skylights turned into net energy gainers. And with the  introduction in the past few years of new energy-efficient glazing systems such  as Low-E glass and Heat Mirror, energy performance has gone up another notch.  </P> <P> Today, a good skylight can probably pay for itself in energy savings in 15  years or less, including the price of installation. And some are so easy to  install that you can do the job yourself, cutting pay-back time even further.  </P> <P> If all this convinces you to put a skylight or two in your home, here are some  tips and features to look for.  </P> <P> SIZING: As a rule of thumb, a skylight should have an area roughly equal to  1/23 the area of the room it will serve. If you want extra light -- perhaps for  a plant room -- you should increase the size. You'll also need a bigger  skylight if your ceilings are higher than the usual eight feet.  </P> <P> GLAZING: Single- glazed skylights are OK in the West or other regions where the  climate is mild. But even there, double glazing can help fight excessive heat  gain. In colder climates, single glazing just doesn't make sense. Here you  should consider, in order of increasing effectiveness, double glazing, Low-E  glass, and Heat Mirror systems. What about plastic? There was a time when the  plastic bubble ruled the roof. But over the years, glass has begun to take  over, partly because of its flat, crisp look, and partly because of the  efficiency of the new glass glazing systems. Double-glazed plastic still  performs well, however, and if you live in the hail belt, plastic's impact  resistance is a strong selling point.  </P> <P> FEATURES: If you plan to try installing a skylight yourself, you'll want a  self-curbing design with an easy installation system. Try to get ahold of the  installation instructions for any skylight you are considering. If you don't  like what you see, investigate another brand. Some makers such as Wasco  actually encourage do-it-yourself installation. Others don't.  </P> <P> VENTING OR FIXED? Skylights that open may cost 50% more than fixed types, but  that can be money well spent in some cases. Located high in the ceiling, an  open skylight does a good job of venting off hot, stuffy air. I have two  skylights in my bedroom and opening them both can usually get me through a hot  summer night without air conditioning.  </P> <P> Some venting skylights are designed to open so you can clean them from inside  the house, and this can be a boon if you live in an area with dusty or polluted  air or heavy bird traffic. If your skylight will be located high in a cathedral  ceiling, you might want to invest in a motorized opening system, controlled by  a wall switch. I run my bedroom skylights by hand with a long extension crank.  It's not particularly easy to handle.  </P> <P> SHADES: At certain times of the day or year, a skylight can let in too much  light. For those occasions, a shade is the answer. Most makers offer them as  options. I put a light tan roll-up shade on the skylight in my dressing room. I  still get lots of light, but I keep direct sun off the clothes in the open  closets, and that helps prevent fading. If you want to block off light almost  completely, a shade in a dark, opaque color will do the trick.  </P></p>

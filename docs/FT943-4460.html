			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia's US grain imports likely to reach 7m tonnes Russia will import some 7m tonnes of grain from the US this year in spite of earlier declarations of self sufficiency - a sign that the Russian harvest will be down on last year's modest levels. Mr Michael Espy, the US agriculture secretary, said in Moscow yesterday that the US had cleared the obstacles to export of 400,000 tonnes of wheat to Russia, and in doing so had opened up the way to further purchases which Russia wished to make. The two sides had initially disagreed on who should bear the carriage costs of the wheat consignment - the US has agreed to do so. Mr Victor Khlystun, Russia's agriculture minister, speaking after talks with Mr Espy, said that it would buy between 5m and 7m tonnes of assorted grains from the US - including corn, soya cakes and feed grains. Russia imported 1.8m tonnes of grain in the first six months of the year - in part because the US Dollars 700m concessional sales programme announced last year had been exhausted. Mr Khlystun said that grain bought and supplied from the US to the Russian Far East would be cheaper to deliver to these regions than grain bought and delivered from the European areas of Russia - a sign of the spiralling transport costs which have depressed coal and other domestic sales. The official news agency Tass, quoting figures from the Russian agriculture ministry, said that 47.2m tonnes of grain had been harvested so far - 20m tonnes down on the harvest at the same time last year. In a separate report, the Interfax agency said that the ministry forecast a total harvest of between 90m and 94m tonnes this year compared with last year's total of 99m tonnes. Mr Espy said he had told Mr Khlystun that, 'the US stands ready to fulfil whatever requests they have'. He said he had discussed long- and short-term credit programmes for grain imports to Russia, and that an agreement on amounts should be reached. Mr Khlystun told his US opposite number that Russia was interested in importing corn, wheat, soybean meal 'and perhaps other commodities like pork and beef'. The US agriculture department is forecasting Russian demand of than 8m tonnes of grain. Deliveries to Russia last year ran at 11.1m tonnes, and 25.5m tonnes in 1992. Reports from the Russian countryside point to a worsening position in the state and collective farms, as credits to agriculture are cut and sowing and harvesting are reduced. At the same time, however, demand is falling. The newspaper Moskovskii Komsomolets headlined its main report at the weekend 'There is a harvest - but who will eat it?'. It also said that 'the statistics show that we are eating less - and not because we are worrying about our figures'.</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Councils warn on budget cuts LEADERS of local authorities yesterday renewed threats of wide-scale redundancies to come if next year's grant settlement is, as expected, capped at the rate of inflation or below and councils are not allowed to spend their capital reserves. The threats were given substance by an announcement by Sheffield City Council that deep cuts, necessitating up to 800 redundancies, would be needed to balance the ciy's budget. Sheffield needs to save about Pounds 7.25m to keep spending down to about Pounds 400m. The council's Labour leadership yesterday rejected suggestions that it had deliberately overbudgeted, hoping to be rescued by a Labour victory in the general election, but said that government limits for continuing a normal range of services were too tight. The city employs about 27,000 people, equivalent to 25,000 full-timers. Its management standards have in the past been commended by the District Auditor, the government's local watchdog on public spending. The cuts package will be put to a council meeting on Monday. About 150 jobs will go across all departments, plus 225 in works, cleansing and cleaning. Some public toilets will be closed. Other cuts will affect book purchases by libraries, council house maintenance and school clothing grants to parents in need. Mr Jeremy Beecham, chairman of the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities, urged ministers to allow local authorities to spend accumulated capital receipts to boost employment. He said: 'English councils have about Pounds 7.2bn of accumulated capital receipts, largely from the sale of council homes. But we can spend about Pounds 700m of this because of government dogma that use of such receipts increases the public-sector borrowing requirement.' Local authorities are particularly concerned at shortfalls in funding for community care of the elderly and disabled, for which councils will take responsibility next April.</p>

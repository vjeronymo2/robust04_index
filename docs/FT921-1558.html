			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / People: Harding takes on BET Sir Christopher Harding (below), the chairman of British Nuclear Fuels, is to become non-executive chairman of BET, the business services group, following the resignation of Nicholas Wills at the end of April. He will have been chairman for just a year and is leaving to pursue other interests. Sir Christopher, 52, who spent from 1961-69 with ICI, has been a non-executive director of Hanson since 1979, and of BNFL since 1984, was due to step down from BNFL at the end of this month but is remaining in place until John Guinness, the permanent secretary at the department of energy, moves across after the general election. John Clark replaced Wills as chief executive following City criticism of the group's trading performance. In July the company made a Pounds 670,000 payment to top up Wills' pension.</p>

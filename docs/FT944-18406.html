			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Mental health plans may win legislative slot A bill introducing stronger government powers to supervise the mentally ill after they are discharged from hospital has emerged as a candidate for inclusion in next year's legislative programme. The measure, which is being strongly promoted by the Department of Health, is one of a number whose prospects would be improved by a decision not to go ahead with Post Office privatisation. The fate of the proposals to privatise Royal Mail and Parcelforce is now more firmly than ever in the hands of government business managers, who must decide whether the legislation could be pushed through without a high risk of damaging defeats in parliament. This follows a succession of critical responses to the government's plans for the mail service in recent weeks, including a formal submission by the nine Ulster Unionist MPs at Westminster saying they oppose them. Privatisation continues to enjoy strong support in cabinet, particularly from Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. But Mr John Major, the prime minister, has not yet made up his mind. Downing Street said yesterday it would be surprised if a final decision on how to proceed would be made at Thursday's meeting of the cabinet - the last before next week's Conservative party conference in Bournemouth. A decision to press ahead with the introduction of a new power of supervised discharge for mentally ill patients would give the Department of Health under Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, a heavy legislative workload in 1994-95. Ministers have already given the go-ahead for a potentially controversial bill providing for the dismantling of regional health authorities and the extension of fund-holding by GPs. Other measures which may get better prospects of parliamentary time if the Post Office legislation is dropped could include the gas deregulation bill and a bill setting up a body to investigate alleged miscarriages of justice. Ministers are also still considering whether a bill implementing further reform of the unpopular Child Support Agency is needed. A senior Department of Social Security official is understood to have visited Australia during the summer to assess whether there is anything to be learnt from experience there. The government first announced its intention to introduce the new power of supervised discharge in August last year. This followed a review of the 1983 Mental Health Act and growing public concern over murders and other acts of violence involving former mental patients released into the community.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In a letter addressed to the Nonaligned Movement  conference convening in Cairo, brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir  'Arafat], president of the state of Palestine and chairman of  the PLO Executive Committee, has said that the statements made  by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on Jerusalem cast doubt  on Israel's willingness to comply with the self-rule accords  signed with the PLO.    Brother President Abu-'Ammar said: The prime minister of the  Israeli entity made statements in which he said Jerusalem is the  united capital of Israel forever. Abu-'Ammar added that these  statements are a violation of the agreement signed in Washington  on 13 September, particularly with regard to Jerusalem. He said  that these statements call into question the willingness of  Israel and its leaders to comply with signed agreements. He  noted that the Declaration of Principles on the self-rule  stipulates that the final status of Jerusalem will be discussed  during the last phase of talks together with the issues of  settlements and refugees.</p>

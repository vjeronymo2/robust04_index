			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Fang Su (2455 5685): "Is Corruption Harmful to </F> Economic Development -- Liu Pei-chiung on Mainland China's  Corruption Problem"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Liu Pei-chiung (0491 0160  3890), director of (?Hong Kong Polytechnic's Business  Department) [hsiang kang li kung hsueh yuan shang yeh hsi 7449  3263 3810 1562 1331 7108 0794 2814 4762] and assistant director  for training of the (?China Commerce Exchange Center) [chung kuo  shang yeh jiao liu chung hsin 0022 0948 0794 2814 0074 3177 0022  1800], says that, according to her observation and analysis,  corruption on the mainland, though a big problem, has not become  an established practice, nor is it causing tremendous harm. On  the other hand, she adds, irrational allocation of resources has  a much more adverse effect on the economy. This article will  give a summary of her view. [passage omitted]    Corruption means that someone gains by taking advantage of  his or her power or position to control the supply of materials,  information, or other things. From the viewpoint of economics,  what he or she gains is an "economic rent," and the act is "rent  seeking." However, no value is created in this process. In some  cases, it is legal to receive this kind of "rent." For example,  a charge can be collected for the supply of information. In  other cases, to do so is illegal, or in other words, it is not  permitted by law. Generally speaking, the latter is called  corruption.    Some acts, though illegal, are "good acts" if viewed from  the  perspective of economics. For instance, a nascent developing  country may have too much control over its economic activities.  Under such circumstances, some corrupt acts can help break  through man-made control and serve as a "lubricant" for economic  activities.    In nascent developing countries, though corruption is linked  with the relative shortage of materials, its occurrence is also  attributable in part to the system that gives officials power to  manage materials, information, and so forth. For example, some  officials have the authority to approve the supply of materials  and control the allocation of resources. This often provides  opportunities for corruption, such as abusing power for private  gains and granting business people's requests in exchange for  money.    In developed countries, certain political operations such as  lobbying are also "rent seeking" activities. However, since  these countries allow open economic competition, their society  and politics are relatively institutionalized, and rule by men  exists only to a small extent, the chances for corruption are  reduced.    As for the situation on the Chinese mainland, everyone knows  that, more often than not, there are many barriers to pass  before a task can be accomplished. It is necessary to form good  relations with various parties, including officials and  organizations. As a result, instances of bribery, embezzlement,  and corruption have come into being. Since some corrupt  activities can serve as an economic "lubricant," many business  people do not mind them. As long as you have a "clearly marked  price," I will include that in my operating cost and go on with  my business. And, matter-of-factly, most of such "transactions"  are fulfilled as promised; only a few have been aborted. For  this reason, a lot of business people from Hong Kong and the  branch offices of many foreign companies in China employ special  personnel to do diplomatic work. Their job is to promote good  "public relations," using such methods as holding dinner  parties, so as to remove barriers and "lubricate" business  activities. [passage omitted]    Through more than a decade of reform and opening-up and with  the development of the economy, corruption on the Chinese  mainland has changed its style. In the past, corrupt officials  often asked for cigarettes, liquors, dinner parties, and  electrical appliances from business people. As time has passed  by, few of them are now asking for cigarettes, liquors, or  electrical appliances, and dinner parties are not so welcome as  before. On the one hand, this is because they earn a higher  income and no longer have a strong demand for such things. On  the other hand, they have shifted their demand to other areas,  like traveling overseas in the name of making observations and  sending their children to study in foreign countries.    As can be seen from numerous reports and instances,  corruption on the Chinese mainland occurs mostly in government  departments and state-owned enterprises and institutions.  Corrupt departments and personnel can be roughly divided into  four categories: 1) cadres in charge of economic work, such as  managers and factory directors of state-owned enterprises, and  certain government departments, such as the State Land  Administration Bureau, urban construction departments, and other  units that control the use of land--these government departments  have relatively more corruption problems; 2) judicial and  law-enforcing departments, such as public security police and  courts; 3) departments of public utilities that have long  experienced shortage of supply or inadequate capacities, such as  transportation, water, electricity, and telephone departments;  and 4) bank personnel responsible for loan business.    The above government departments and state-owned enterprises  and institutions either enjoy privileges or hold a monopoly in  their respective fields of operations. Privileges and monopoly  have not only created corruption, but also resulted in seriously  inappropriate allocation of resources. For instance, most  state-owned enterprises are suffering losses either overtly or  covertly and have to rely on state support to survive. Another  example is that the government's manner in approving  appropriations cannot achieve effective use of funds. In fact,  there are not so many instances of embezzlement in  fund-approving departments and units, and the amounts of  embezzlement are limited. However, the economic losses caused by  them due to inappropriate allocation of resources are enormous.  The harm done to the economy is more serious than corruption.    The primary reason for this state of affairs is that for a  long time economic questions have been dealt with by  non-economic methods. Another reason is that property rights are  not clearly defined. Under the public ownership system, what is  dealt with by economic policymakers are not their own property,  and they are not held responsible for any economic consequence  if their policies are wrong. If a deficit has occurred, they can  ask for subsidies from the higher authorities. A similar logic  applies to extravagant wining and dining at public expense.  Anyway, the money spent is from the public coffer. [passage  omitted]    Has corruption become an established practice on the Chinese  mainland? The answer is that it has not reached such a terrible  extent. In the first place, the regulations stipulate that those  in charge of economic work are not allowed to do government  work. This "distinction between government and economic work"  has greatly cut the political power of those running state-owned  enterprises and managing state assets, thus reducing the  possibility of simultaneous monopoly of political and economic  powers.    Second, at present the economic power is not so centralized  as in the past, but is being gradually delegated to departments  in various localities. Although local party and government  cadres have a lot of substantive power in political and economic  affairs, there is a local election system, and officials are  accountable to the collective. So it is impossible that they can  act without scruple.    Third, most people grumbled seriously when they saw children  of high-level cadres do business or conduct other activities by  taking advantage of their privileges. These activities are, of  course, unhealthy, but they have not become an established  practice and created a corrupt regime with monopolized political  power as former Filipino autocrat Marcos did.    Fourthly, the Chinese Communist Party's discipline still has  a binding force on cadres, though its effect is diminishing.  Generally speaking, high-level cadres are well-disciplined,  while most problems occur in local governments. Since they are  far away from the central authorities, "local emperors" have  come into being. As for launching movements to strike at  corruption, the reason is that a discipline-inspection movement  is more effective than law. When law must be used, because of  the high cost involved, the method adopted is to "deal with  typical cases" so as to "punish one as a warning to a hundred."  [passage omitted]    After the Chinese mainland has opened itself to the outside  world, foreign capital has flowed in. Has this induced more  corrupt activities? This is not necessarily the case. On the  contrary, market competition has been introduced along with the  in-flow of foreign capital, smashing the disastrous monopoly.  Now, all localities on the mainland are rushing to solicit  capital from outside, aren't they? Before competition is  introduced, you had to give someone benefits if you wanted to do  something. Now, there is competition. In one locality, you are  required to give out benefits; in another locality, you may find  this is not necessary. In one locality, you must go through a  number of departments; in another locality, you may find that  all departments related to foreign investment are located in one  place, and they serve your needs from beginning to end. This has  reduced the instances of corruption.    By studying the problem of corruption as an economic issue,  we have arrived at this conclusion: Building a market system to  promote open competition will not only raise efficiency in  utilizing resources, but also reduce the possibility of  corruption.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (16): Killer virus hits at heart of economy - AIDS / More than half of the world's 15m sufferers are in Africa TWELVE YEARS after the world first woke up to the consequences of Aids, sub-Saharan Africa remains in the grip of the disease, and many fear its economic impact threatens to reverse the continent's development well into the next century. Figures from the World Health Organisation show that more than half of the world's 15m sufferers are in Africa. The virus has already killed about 1.2m Africans, and it is estimated 14m of the region's people will be infected by 2000. The disease in Africa is mainly transmitted through heterosexual contact, affecting men and women equally. Figures for each country remain patchy, but Aids-control programmes in Uganda suggest between 7 and 10 per cent of the population is infected with HIV. In Zambia, the ministry of health estimates between 20 and 25 per cent of Zambian women of child-bearing age have HIV. The problem is believed to be growing in West Africa and in South Africa. According to the World Bank, in many African countries, particularly in the urban areas, Aids has become the 'major cause of adult mortality, leading to a doubling and even a tripling of the adult mortality rate'. In Africa, the disease is concentrated in the 20-45 age group, the strongest section of the labour force, and many now fear labour shortages will become widespread on the continent - leading to rising employment costs, which could impede development. The increasing incidence of tuberculosis, which has killed more than 1.3m people since 1980, has also been linked to the increase in Aids, with nearly 50 per cent of sufferers said to be HIV-infected. Experts now believe there is a real danger that the disease will derail attempts in recent years by African governments to restructure their economies. In rural areas, the backbone of many African economies, the disease has had a devastating impact. A report for Panos, the research charity, by Tony Barnet, of the University of East Anglia, said in many parts of southern Uganda (an area once known for its fertility), HIV-related illness and death had resulted in less careful tending of banana plots, unpruned coffee bushes, a reduction in the size of cultivated plots and a narrowing in the range of crops. In parts of Zimbabwe, the cultivation of Chilli peppers had grown at the expense of more lucrative crops - it needs less energy for harvesting - and, as Panos says, 'in Rwanda, the long-term effects may be increased cultivation of cassava and reduced cultivation of other foods and cash crops'. This in turn could lead to less export income and poor nutrition. In parts of Tanzania, agricultural production is said to have fallen by between 3 and 20 per cent, due to HIV-related deaths. In addition, says the recent World Bank report, 'the viability of agricultural credit schemes may also be affected. The number of defaulters may rise, as households use credit to finance medical care, leaving survivors to liquidate their remaining assets in order to repay loans'. But it is perhaps in the urban areas and more formal sectors of the economy that the impact of Aids is most visible. In many urban centres, the infection rate has been put as high as 30 per cent. Ironically, the higher the income, the greater the sexual activity, and a 1988 study in Zaire found higher HIV rates among better-educated and higher-paid workers. In industry, whole sectors are under threat. In Zambia, where the copper industry is the source of 75 per cent of export earnings, researchers have not only warned that workers, supervisors and managers will die of Aids faster than replacements can be trained, but have added: 'The result will not be a sudden collapse in minor output; rather there will be a slow but steady increase in the incidence of breakdowns, accidents, and delays and output will suffer.' In other countries, the loss of output and earnings in manufacturing due to HIV/Aids illness have become apparent with the decline in production levels. The service sector has not escaped either, and Panos highlights the situation in South Africa where life insurance companies face a huge increase in payments. Aids-related claims in the period 1985 to 1988 amounted to Pounds 855,000. Yet in 1989 alone the figure was Pounds 700,000. Productivity levels have been hit across the continent, due to ill-health among workers and funeral attendance. An official at the Uganda ministry of commerce and industry said last year: 'Even if someone does not die here, every week we have at least three employees asking for permission to attend a relative's funeral.' According to forecaster DRI/McGraw Hill, Aids will see Africa's gross domestic product depressed by more than 4 per cent by the end of the decade. Companies have already taken action. BP's African subsidiary has a formal 'common agreed policy' on Aids written into its employee handbook. Unilever, with 80,000 employees on the continent, has 'guidelines rather than a formal policy', and takes an active monitoring and educational role in relation to Aids. British American Tobacco in Uganda subjects its workforce, or even prospective employees, to blood tests. The South African Chamber of Mines is reported to have refused to recruit anyone who reacts positively to a test. The World Bank adopted an Agenda for Action on Aids in Africa, in 1988, and has loaned more than Dollars 100m in its fight against the condition and other sexually-transmitted diseases since 1986. That total includes its single biggest loan for fighting Aids, totalling Dollars 64.5m, which it gave to Zimbabwe in June. If Africa is to fight the scourge, more assistance is vital.</p>

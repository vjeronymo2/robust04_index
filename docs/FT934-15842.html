			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Leaders attempt to staunch Euro-split CONSERVATIVE leaders yes-terday moved to avert a split over next year's European elections by warning that the party risks political suicide unless it buries divisions over the Maastricht treaty. Mr John Major, the prime minister, Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, and Sir Christopher Prout, leader of the Conservative group in the European parliament, all warned that a poor Tory performance would strengthen Labour at Westminster and federalists in Brussels. The warnings reflect concern that divisions over Maastricht, combined with the government's unpopularity, could lead to substantial opposition gains in the June elections. The Conservatives lost a third of their European seats at the last election in 1989, and emerged with only 32 of the 78 British mainland seats, compared with 45 won by Labour. Party leaders fear that up to a quarter of Conservative seats could fall. Defeat on such a scale would seriously damage Mr Major, and could trigger a leadership challenge. Fears that the elections might turn into a re-run of the Maastricht debate were revived on Thursday when Lord Tebbit, one of the strongest critics of the treaty, said he would decline to campaign for some Conservative candidates. The leadership hopes to defuse the row by basing the election manifesto on Mr Major's free market vision for Europe, expressed in a recent article in the Economist. The article, which argued strongly for a revival of national sovereignty within the European Community, has been well received by right wingers, who believe it demonstrates a substantial shift of policy. However, senior ministers acknowledged that the tone of attacks on the EC had risked alienating pro-Europe MPs on the centre and left of the party, who have been loyal to Mr Major so far.</p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEMORIES OF WAR BRING PEACE AT LAST;  </P> <P> HISTORY BUFF TRACKS WWII FIGHTER PILOTS  </P> <P> Even after 43 years, an American World War II fighter pilot kept wondering  about the Japanese plane he shot down near Shanghai in 1945 -- the one that  flipped on its nose but didn't burn.  </P> <P> Now the former pilot from Pennsylvania thinks he knows, thanks to Henry  Sakaida.  </P> <P> Sakaida believes he has discovered the identity of the Japanese pilot. "The guy  lived!" Sakaida said when he finally found a big missing piece to his unique  puzzle.  </P> <P> Sakaida, who makes a hobby of pairing former combatants in the aerial dogfights  of World War II, is eagerly awaiting final confirmation that the two men did  indeed try to kill each other on that fateful January day.  </P> <P> Sakaida said he was delighted to take on the seemingly impossible task of  tracking down the enemy pilot that Edward Bollen of Sewickley, Pa., only  vaguely remembers shooting. He did so just because Bollen, whom he has never  met, was curious about his long-ago foe.  </P> <P> Sakaida believes the man is Eiji Mitsui of Urawa, Japan, a one-time flying ace  who not only can't remember the date he was shot down but who has also changed  his surname.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Most Unusual Hobby'  </P> <P> Admitting to "a most unusual hobby," Sakaida, a Rosemead nurseryman, has been  able to identify dozens of World War II combat pilots who played deadly games  in the skies over Asia and the Pacific.  </P> <P> In many cases, one of the opponents was killed in combat or has since died.  </P> <P> But they now see themselves as comrades with common bonds. Like others Sakaida  has linked, Bollen said he hopes he and Mitsui will someday meet and exchange  friendly greetings.  </P> <P> This case was particularly knotty for Sakaida, since in his flight report on  Jan. 14, 1945, Bollen misidentified the type of plane he downed at Hankow  Airfield. Most Japanese military records were destroyed after the war, Sakaida  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Both Pilots Recall Incident  </P> <P> But both former pilots recall exactly the same experience at about the same  time, when the Japanese plane, after it was strafed by Bollen's gunshot,  flipped over into some grass while trying to make an emergency landing.  </P> <P> Sakaida worked on this puzzle for a month, putting pieces together through  World War II flight reports he got from government archives and through friends  in Japan who share his interest in history and fighter pilots.  </P> <P> In many other cases, he said, his research and investigation continued for  years before he was able to establish combatants' identities.  </P> <P> "That Henry is something else!" Bollen said from his home in Pennsylvania. "I'm  personally interested in people I've fought against, but I never realized I  would have the opportunity Henry Sakaida has given me. When he located Mr.  Mitsui, he was so excited he called me in the middle of the day, and again that  evening. Henry seems like a real neat guy."  </P> <P> Sakaida, 38, was born in California long after World War II ended and has no  personal connection with that period, nor is he a flier. During the war, his  father, John, was assigned to Manzanar, a relocation camp for  Japanese-Americans. His mother, Tokie, grew up in Japan. The family owns the  Sakaida Nursery in Rosemead.  </P> <P> </P> <P> World War II Memorabilia  </P> <P> A graduate of Rosemead High School and San Jose State University, Sakaida lives  in Temple City with his wife, Donna, and their two little boys. One room in  their home is devoted to World War II memorabilia and includes shelves of books  that fellow history buffs have written and sent him. Sakaida, in turn, has sent  them copies of his 1983 book, "Winged Samurai," which tells the story of Saburo  Sakai, a Japanese flying ace.  </P> <P> Sakaida said his interest in contacting enemy pilots began in 1975 on a  vacation in Japan. A former fighter pilot asked Sakaida to help him identify  the American who had shot him down over Guam in 1944.  </P> <P> "After checking around, I found it wouldn't be that difficult," Sakaida said.  Although he was unable to determine who the American pilot was, he found  himself hooked on a hobby that promised great personal satisfaction.  </P> <P> Several years ago he wrote a small newsletter about fighter pilots. Since then,  most requests for information and research come to him by word of mouth, mostly  from former pilots who keep in touch with each other.  </P> <P> "The reward is the smile on people's faces, you know?" he said. "If I got money  out of it, that would just kind of ruin it. It's just fun seeing these people  so happy, especially the ones that meet and shake hands."  </P> <P> In 1983, Sakaida arranged a meeting at his parents' home between Sakai and an  American adversary, Harold Jones, who battled in 1942 in the skies above  Guadalcanal.  </P> <P> Sakaida has discovered that the fighter pilots he has researched have distinct  traits, among them a total lack of animosity for their opponents.  </P> <P> "They were technicians -- super soldiers," Sakaida said. "So much training went  into being a pilot, that was a common bond. They liked to fly, the thrill of  combat, and now they like to relive the  </P> <P> excitement.  </P> <P> "It was a life-and-death game, not like ground action. They were kind of above  it all. I've never had any problem with hatred -- no animosity on either side.  They all say war was a tragedy, they just had to do their jobs. Nothing  personal."  </P> <P> Bollen said: "This was not like the infantry, where you're surrounded by dead  bodies. Of course, during the war you have a hate on for the enemy because  they're shooting your buddies. But they weren't necessarily wanting to kill any  more than we were. And after the war, you wonder what it was all about and wish  you knew about the ones who were still living. So then you want to meet and  shake hands."  </P> <P> Sakaida's explanation for the reason he spends so much time matching up enemies  who don't know each other -- most of whom he has never met and never will --  is: "It's just fun. I like history, and I like to solve mysteries. It's  fascinating trying to track these people down."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bored Staying Home  </P> <P> He said he doesn't know of any other Americans who provide this kind of  research as a hobby, although he has some counterparts in Japan. Bollen said he  knows of no one else who does what Sakaida does.  </P> <P> Although he has devoted most of his research to locating fighter pilots,  Sakaida has delved into other unsolved mysteries. He does it in his spare time,  he said, especially when he gets sick and is bored with having to stay home.  </P> <P> Stacks of files in his home contain several dozen "cases" he continues to work  on. He lists about 35 he has completed. They range from the case of a Japanese  nurse whose pleadings spared the life of a captured American pilot whose  identity she never knew to that of the widow of a man whose signature was on a  Japanese battle flag.  </P> <P> Sakaida once worked off and on for four years to identify a New Zealand flier  who parachuted from his plane and was rescued by Sakaida's friend and neighbor,  Minoru Fujita of Rosemead, who commanded a Japanese navy gunboat in 1945.  </P> <P> Fujita had been haunted by the memory of the injured pilot, who had asked  Fujita to pray with him. After saying the Lord's Prayer together, the pilot was  taken to a hospital. In 1987, with Sakaida's help, Fujita learned that the New  Zealander had died two weeks later.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Found a Pilot's Grave  </P> <P> So important was this information to Fujita that he located the pilot's grave  in New Caledonia, where he prayed for him again. He also met the victim's  brother in New Zealand.  </P> <P> In 1979 Sakaida bought a World War II-era Japanese life jacket -- standard  equipment for fliers -- and eight years later found the original owner. The  Japanese pilot had made a crash-landing near Shanghai, discarded his  possessions -- including the jacket -- and hid in the mountains for three days  before being rescued.  </P> <P> The life jacket was apparently picked up by a native and ended up in the United  States, where Sakaida bought it from a collector for $250. In 1987, Sakaida  delivered the jacket to the flier's commanding officer, who was visiting in Los  Angeles. The flier and jacket were subsequently reunited.  </P> <P> "He was so happy and overcome, he cried," Sakaida said.  </P> <P> "I'm really nostalgic. I keep in contact with a lot of people -- buddy-buddies,  you might say."  </P> <P> Once he found a 1923 yearbook from Polytechnic High School in Long Beach and  identified the original owner, who he discovered had died in the 1950s. Then he  picked out the prettiest girl in the graduating class and tracked her down. She  is an 82-year-old who lives in Newport Beach, "and she was just flabbergasted  when I called," he said.  </P> <P> Now, Sakaida said, his favorite mystery is that of a Japanese combat pilot who  came upon a lone damaged American Hellcat over the Marshall Islands. The  Japanese pilot, Isamu Miyazaki, said the American had "such a pitiful  expression on his face, I didn't have the heart to shoot him down," according  to Sakaida.  </P> <P> "So now Miyazaki wants to know if the American made it back safely, and if he  lived," Sakaida said. "This is a good one. I expect to find out."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of the Popular Front  for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC] has  said in an exclusive interview with AL-BILAD that the Zionist  enemy's atrocious and terrorist campaigns are nothing new. The  massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque committed at dawn last Friday  will not be the last, he addded.    He said that this brutal massacre came naturally to the  Israeli enemy, that it is part of common practices against our  people in Palestine--a people who will not be terrorized by all  the practices of occupation or by any Israeli military power.  Their determination to liberate their occupied homeland will  not be harmed, he added.    He said: The brutal massacre the Zionist enemy committed  against worshipers in the mosque reflects the concessions [made  by Yasir 'Arafat], which ignore the Palestinian's blood,  dignity, and rights. The massacre is the fruit of the  Gaza-Jericho agreement, which has made the Zionist enemy's path  shorter and given legitimacy to its occupation.    He added that what the Ibrahimi Mosque witnessed makes us  see  that the real killers are those who encouraged the Jews--such as  'Arafat--and extended their hands, which are stained with the  bloods of the people and the cause, to shake the hand of the  enemy. This enemy found that its interest are served by the  concessions offered by the 'Arafat leadership.    Meanwhile, 'Abd-al-Jabir Burghul, member of the PFLP-GC  Central Committee told AL-BILAD: We in the PFLP-GC were not at  all surprised by the massacres committed by the gangs of  settlers in the occupied territories. Before these massacres,  several massacres were committed by [Former Israeli Prime  Minister Menachem] Begin and other Zionist gangs such as the  massacres in Dayr Yasin, Qibyah, Nahhalin, and Sabra and  Shatila. The history of the Zionist movement is full of  massacres against the Palestinian people.    He said: We in the PFLP-GC will never halt our Palestinian  armed struggle in the occupied territories. The coming days  will witness military operations against this entity in the  occupied territories, not outside.    He said these operations will target the settlers and the  gangs that supervised the execution of these massacres, in  addition to assassinating Israeli officials in the Zionist camps  as happened in the operation of Khalid Akar [not further  identified].    He expressed the belief that 'Arafat will go ahead in the  negotiations process, and said: 'Arafat is a man who became  involved in this process and will not retreat, the same thing  happened with [Former Egyptian President Anwar] al-Sadat. We  hope that what is taking place in the occupied territories will  be a lesson to 'Arafat and his clique, and that they will  benefit from this lesson and refrain from wagering on the  Zionist enemy.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nedret Ersanel: "PKK's Chemical Arms Depots"] </F>   [Text] The latest reports on the late-night newscast on  television on 21 January informed the people of the Workers  Party of Kurdistan [PKK] attack on Akyurek and Ormancik in  Mardin Province. The way the PKK attack was carried out  indicated a new tactic on the part of that organization. The  PKK guerrillas forced the women and children into a house and  killed them with hand grenades in Ormancik. What was left  behind was a few tearful people, who escaped from the attack by  coincidence, and a strange odor that could be detected  regardless of the sharp smell of smoke in the burning village.    The enigma of the strange odor was resolved when State of  Emergency Governor Unal Erkan and several experts arrived in  that village. The fact that several people suffocated to death  as a result of the smoke in the burning village raised  significant anxiety. The truth was that the PKK used chemical  weapons. The preliminary reports on the attack mentioned that  chemical weapons may have been used. The final decision was to  be made in light of the autopsy reports. However, the main  question was the source of the PKK's chemical arms.    Ascertaining that source was not difficult. The matter was  clarified through the study of the "geographical anatomy"  [cografi anatomi] of chemical arms.    An authority vacuum has existed in northern Iraq for a long  time. That is an indisputable fact. That region is controlled  by the Hammer Force. Another indisputable fact is the existence  of large quantities of various types of arms in northern Iraq.  Many of the basic foodstuffs are sold at exorbitant prices in  that region. However, arms are very cheap to buy, so much so  that a dozen hand grenades may cost as much as $9 or $10. Even  the chemical grenades, the type that the PKK used in its attack  on Ormancik, are sold at low prices. Dumping also exists in the  chemical arms market in northern Iraq. For example, the local  cost of a chemical weapon, which can affect any living creature  in an area of three square kilometers, is about 200,000  dinars--that is, nearly 70,000,000 Turkish lira.    Four types of "gas-based" chemical arms, which are sold over  the counter, are in great demand in northern Iraq. A great  demand exists for the type that contain mustard gas, a toxic  substance that was tested on the Kurds in Halabja in the past.  They are the most expensive in the market. How can such  extremely effective arms be easily acquired in that region,  where no one dares to turn his back on anyone?    The minority peoples and terrorist groups have greatly  benefited from the authority vacuum in northern Iraq after the  Gulf War. The Iraqi military forces abandoned large quantities  of various types of arms, including chemical weapons, in that  region. In fact, the amount of arms left in the area was enough  to arm a medium-size army.    Obviously, forces other than the Saddam administration in  the  region possess various types of arms, from light and heavy arms  to chemical weapons, at the present time. Nearly all the arms  the Iraqi military forces abandoned in the past are in the hands  of the Kurdish leaders, most of whom we know very well.  Democratic Party of Kurdistan Leader Mas'ud Barzani and  Patriotic Union of Kurdistan Leader Jalal Talabani, who are  among the "legal" leaders of the Kurds in northern Iraq, top the  list of leading Kurdish officials who control the chemical arms  in the region.    Chemical arms are stored in more than 10 small and large  residential areas. Zakho and Irbil are the largest and most  important among them. The surrounding areas of the two towns  provide an opportunity for the Kurds to store and sell their  chemical arms.  <H5>  Depots and Sales </H5>   The arms depots in Irbil are located in four areas. The  largest depots are in Sheyhulla and Hasankaya Districts. The  entire basement of the bus station in Irbil, which is known as  the Karkuk Bus Terminal, is a chemical arms depot. Another  depot is known to be in Diyana, which can be reached after three  hours of driving from Irbil. The Kurds sell their chemical arms  in those depots. Anyone can buy chemical arms from them,  provided that he has the cash to pay it.    The situation in Zakho, which is an important settlement in  northern Iraq, is no different than that in Irbil. A large  amount of chemical arms exist in that town. The area adjacent  to the Abbasi Bridge is a well-established chemical arms depot  and sales center. Meanwhile, various types of chemical arms can  be purchased in Izza, which is not far from Zakho. However, the  depot in Izza is smaller than those in the other areas. The  Karkuk Bus Terminal in Irbil and the depot in Zakho are regarded  as storage centers for chemical arms. Small chemical arms  depots also exist in Hajj 'Umran and Chamchamal.    Jalal Talabani is known to be the patron of the chemical  arms  depots in and around Irbil. He decides who should buy chemical  arms and the amount to be sold. Talabani retains the profit  made from the sales.    The chemical arms depots in and around Zakho are under the  PKK's control, that is, with the exception of those in a few  small settlements. The most noticeable of them are those in  Cisri Abbasi and Izza. In fact, the chemical grenades the PKK  militants used against the people in Ormancik Village were  acquired from those depots.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By freelance correspondent Anatoliy Kholodyuk for ITAR-TASS] </F>   [Text] Tiraspol, 29 Mar -- The 14th Army Military Council  describes as a political provocation an amendment made on 15  February to the unrecognised Dniester republic's law on the  status of Russian troops stationed within the republic.  According to the document, Russian troops' weapons, fighting  equipment and other military property are declared the property  of Tiraspol.    A statement by the Army Military Council issued today says  that the Dniester authorities have demonstrated utter contempt  of the Russian Federation and its efforts to uphold peace in the  region.    Announcing that Tiraspol "is at state level encouraging the  seizure of the 14th Army's sites, armaments and hardware," the  military council of the Russian amalgamation of guards has  lodged a strong protest with the Dniester authorities and demand  that the law in question be repealed.</p>

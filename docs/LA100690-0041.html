			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PEOPLE OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY;  </P> <P> PERCENTAGE OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS  </P> <P> Anglo: 41.9  </P> <P> Black: 11.3  </P> <P> Latino: 35.0  </P> <P> Asian and Other: 11.8  </P> <P> The use of the term "minority" to designate people of color has become  increasingly erroneous. Anglos are the largest racial group in the county,  accounting for 41.9% of the population.  </P> <P> But when "minority" figures are combined, these groups account for 58.1% of the  overall population.  </P> <P> Source: L.A.

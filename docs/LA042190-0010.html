			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. BISHOPS' PR CAMPAIGN AGAINST ABORTION  </P> <P> Novak is upset because of the heat the Catholic bishops are taking over their  opposition to abortion. Why, he asks, were these same bishops cheered when they  favored a nuclear freeze and progressive views on economics? There are several  reasons.  </P> <P> First, the bishops' public efforts to kick out of the Catholic Church any  politician who differs with them on the abortion issue repels those of us who  cherish freedom of expression. Many women see the church's campaign as a thinly  disguised attempt to keep them pregnant and in the kitchen.  </P> <P> Just a quick glance over our southern border will show anyone with eyes in his  head the terrible effects of the bishops' opposition to any form of birth  control or abortion: wretched poverty, overcrowding, and a vast army of young  people with no way to earn a living. These same young Latin Americans are  flooding across our borders, creating problems in this country. The reluctance  of the French drug company that invented an abortion pill, which could cure  many other diseases, to market it in this country because of gangster-like  threats from the anti-abortionists, also repels those of us who cherish  freedom.  </P> <P> No, Mr. Novak, this is no "happy day" as you would have us believe. This is a  case of a church that is still operating as it did in the Middle Ages. And the  most sickening part is that, because churches don't pay taxes, they are  indirectly using our tax dollars to finance their nonsense. For shame!  </P> <P> S.

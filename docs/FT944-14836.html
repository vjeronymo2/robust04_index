			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Rover signs deal with Malaysia - T Series engine may be manufactured under licence for use in Proton cars Rover, the leading UK carmaker, and Proton, the Malaysian car producer, yesterday signed a memorandum of understanding which could lead to the manufacture of Rover engines under licence in Malaysia. Rover, a subsidiary of BMW of Germany, said that the two carmakers would investigate the manufacture of its T Series 2.0 litre petrol engine in Malaysia for use in Proton cars. The agreement would cover the transfer of technology to Proton, including future developments of the T Series engine range as well as the training of Proton employees in engine assembly and installation. The memorandum of understanding with Proton follows Rover's final agreement earlier this month with Kia, the second largest South Korean carmaker, for the joint development of a new range of V6 engines which will be built in the UK and in Korea. Proton, which last year produced 117,000 cars, would use the Rover engine in its larger cars for sale in the domestic market and for export. Proton started producing cars in the mid-1980s in co-operation with Mitsubishi of Japan. Mitsubishi initially held a 30 per cent stake in Proton but through various restructurings that has been reduced to around 20 per cent. While Proton boasts that its car now has a domestic content level of more than 70 per cent, high cost components such as transmission systems are still imported from Japan. The Malaysians have become frustrated at what they consider to be Japanese unwillingness to transfer technology. They have also been concerned about cost increases following the rise in the value of the yen. Mr Mohamad Nadzmi, head of Proton, said that Mitsubishi could be affected in the short term, but as a Proton shareholder the Japanese conglomerate would benefit from an improvement in the Malaysian company's profitability. Proton has a 73 per cent share of the Malaysian market and exported 17,000 cars last year, mostly to Britain. Rover is believed to be in the final stages of negotiating the sale of up to 4,000 of its Land Rover vehicles to the Malaysian armed forces. Rover is also discussing collaborative ventures in Indonesia. Hawtal Whiting, a leading UK automotive design and engineering consultancy, yesterday signed a memorandum of understanding with Bakti Muhibbah, a Malaysian land development company, to conduct a feasibility study into a joint venture high technology business park in the state of Negeri Sembilan.</p>

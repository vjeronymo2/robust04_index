			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Arts: The rhythm of life after Stalin - A finely written but overly-cosy play about genius The ice on the Neva cracks with the resonance of fine writing - French writing, to boot, than which there is none finer. The poetics come up like thunder. Black Sail White Sail, playing at the Gate in London's Notting Hill, is that tricky thing, a play about intellectuals written by a cosmopolitan Francophone with a thing about 'feminine writing'. Not feminist, mind you, but something subtler and deeper, to do with basic rhythms. It is also about genius - another trap for the over-confident writer. How do you express genius without sounding like a press release, a book-jacket blurb or a Reader's Digest 'Most unforgettable character I ever met' article? You could do worse than get Donald Watson to translate from the French. Tact, sensitivity, and extensive practical experience of the theatre mark his version of Helene Cixous' play. This does not, however, quite efface the impression of self-conscious monologues, or negate the slightly laboured superimposition of the heroine's poetic gifts on to an everyday story of post-Stalinist folk. The play deals with the poet Anna Akhmatova (1889-1966), for many years an unpublished cultural outsider, two of whose husbands disappeared and whose son was interned in a labour camp. After Stalin's death came the thaw - of a sort. Significantly the play begins with Anna, played by Kika Markham, gathering firewood with Nadezhda, widow of the writer Osip Mandelstam, as the frozen river splits with the onset of spring. Disappointments and frustrations await her before some semblance of recognition and restitution, due not least to her own stubborn refusal to compromise with the literary authorities' required cuts, omissions and general censorship of her poetry. The play is a hymn to endurance in apparently hopeless conditions, to a struggle for survival so basic as to be barely distinguishable from death: 'Committing suicide to live,' as Anna puts it. The light it casts on the old regime in Russia is fascinating: the pervasive paranoia that prevented poets from writing down their works, instead enlisting friends to memorise them - and the funny, sad dismay when author and confidante find they have forgotten lines, like failing to remember what a loved one looks like after a long absence. Anna lives in a room separated from a communal cooking area only by a curtain, behind which sits a nosey neighbour (aptly nicknamed Polonius) who eavesdrops, goes through Anna's things, dabbles in the black market and eventually becomes something of an ally. The poet's chief friends are Lydia, an eagerly helpful go-between with contacts, who spends her time championing Anna's cause with publishers, and Nadezhda, with whom she argues over the authorship of some poems - did Anna write them, or the late Osip? The puzzlement seems genuine in this shadowy world of disowning one's creative progeny for its own good. Mia Soteriou makes Lydia rather touching, not least when, loyalty strained, she rebels against Anna's imperious demands. No genius, as she admits, Lydia still 'in her small corner needs a life of her own'. Her revolt fails to ring entirely true, since Markham's Anna is simply too nice for the cantankerous unreasonableness of genius depicted. A woman as pleasantly straightforward as this would have lacked the resilience to survive in a world where she had to resort to placing the odd hair in a book to tell whether her private possessions had been disturbed by a stranger. Sue Parrish's direction makes this a soft-centred, almost cosy world, surely the last thing intended - though the author's prolixity, more intellectual than theatrical, must take much of the blame. The curtains of Iona McLeish's set, white with slashes of black, evoke the birches of Mother Russia - hinting at a prison-camp palisade as much as a lyrical backdrop. Gate Theatre, Notting Hill until October 1</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 1--The recent killing of the first  non-combatant officer in Kashmir and last week's incident at  Kupwara are part of a conspiracy to embarrass India at the U.N.  Human Rights meet which opens in Geneva today, according to  senior officials here.    The slaying last month of the Border Roads Organisations  [BRO] officer, Major Bhupinder Singh, is seen as an attempt to  provoke a violent response from the security forces which could  then be denounced before a global audience at Geneva, as proof  of India's disrespect for human rights.    "After February 15 when the global spotlight from Geneva  wears thin, the violence here is bound to taper off," said a  highly-placed source.    Returning alone (unlike other uniformed personnel, BRO  officers often travel without an armed escort) after supervising  road clearing in snow bound Kashmir, Major Singh was waylaid  near Verinag on January 17. His bullet-riddled body was dumped  by the roadside the following Sunday. It also bore visible marks  of torture.    Outraged peers call the slaying "the grossest violation of  human rights." Fellow officers recall Major Singh's obsession  with pushing road building in the Himalayas, a perfectly  civilian friendly activity. With three road building projects in  the troubled State, the BRO is a major employer in the region.    The young Sikh officer with an infectious sense of humour  was  a daredevil who preferred to travel alone, his colleagues say.  "When will the locals with whom he was so friendly break their  silence and with it the militants will to heap atrocities," they  ask.    Hiding her anguish, his wife, Abnash Kaur, tries to  reconcile  herself to the loneliness which lies ahead. Too young to fathom  the tragedy, daughters Nirmat (11) and Robina (7) are oblivious  to the uncertain future they now face. Rewards varying from Rs.  50,000 to Rs. 1 lakh have been announced to apprehend the  culprits, one of whom has been identified.    Singh's colleagues say the newly-formed pro-Pakistan outfit,  the Hizbul Ansar (made up of the Harkat Ul Mujahideen and the  Harkat Ul Jehad-al Islami) is behind his killing. They claim  that competition among the militants to obtain rewards from the  Pakistan Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) could be another  provocation for the killing.    Demonstration of "results" on the ground releases a flush of  funds and weapons from across the border. When the squeeze on  militants tightens in the winters (snow-bound passes block  infiltration routes) brutality can reactivate support from  outside, they point out.  *</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Arts: Today's Television Tomorrow's World provides a timely 'Sport Special' which considers the part played by science in achieving success, whether by improving the ability of athletes, their training, psychology, equipment, or what they ingest, including drugs. The programme highlights the British bobsleigh team which prepared for the winter Olympics by taking its sledge design and philosophy from the east Germans (7.30 BBC1). Bookmark (8.10 BBC2) offers a drama documentary called 'Miss Pym's Day Out' which re-creates November 23 1977 in the life of novelist Barbara Pym. On that day she went to the Jubilee bazaar in Finstock and then travelled to London for the Booker Prize ceremony, her novel 'Quartet In Autumn' having been shortlisted. Channel 4 begins a series of six 'weekly glimpses' of how the 6m inhabitants of St Petersburg are surviving their first winter since the collapse of the USSR. Kevin Sim (who made the excellent documentary 'Four Hours In My Lai') is living in the city, making the programmes there, and sending them back for sub-titling (9.45). Dispatches is yet another attempt to whip up interest in satanism (10.30 C4).</p>

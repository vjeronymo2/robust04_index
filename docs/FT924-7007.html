			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Survey of Turkish Finance, Investment and Industry (5): Adaptable but independent - Profile of Rusdu Saracoglu, governor of the central bank HE HAS been described as Turkey's Felipe Gonzalez. The combination of an astute economic brain, a good political pedigree and those eternally boyish good-looks has made Mr Rusdu Saracoglu, the governor of Turkey's central bank, one of the most enduring figures on the political scene. At 38, he was the world's youngest central banker when he was appointed in 1987. Today, this grandson son of a former Turkish prime minister has made the job of Turkey's top banker his very own. Talking to him in his dark wood-panelled office, in the Bank's Ankara headquarters, he remains urbane, soft-spoken and totally self-assured. 'Actually, I normally work in the other office. It's brighter, and suits my mood,' he explains. But it has not been an easy task. The only incumbent of the office to be re-elected, he is nonetheless one of the few high-ranking bureaucrats appointed during the former Motherland party government to survive the change of administration. Mr Saracoglu has had his differences with the new government, particularly with Mrs Tansu Ciller, the economics minister. During the recent IMF-World Bank meetings, in Washington, she publicly blamed the governor for Turkey's current economic ills. But today the Bank's balance sheet has rarely looked more robust. Reserves are near record levels. And for the moment, at least, the tussle with the Treasury over the use of cheap credits to finance its expenditures seems to have been resolved, in the governor's favour. He even shows little concern about what some economists believe is the worrying growth of foreign borrowing by the private commercial banks. As he likes to point out: as a percentage of Turkey's external receipts, foreign borrowing has in fact fallen steadily during his governorship. In many ways, Mr Saracoglu sees himself as a classic central banker - there to preserve the domestic and external value of the currency, contain inflation, and influence the price of money by containing the liquidity of the financial system. But he is the first to acknowledge the limits of the Turkish system: 'Given the monetary constraints, and given our culture, it is not easy. The central bank has never really been looked at as an independent institution, and still is viewed as an arm of government.' Nonetheless, he is quick to recognise what he feels is the new maturity of the Turkish financial system, which six years ago had no interbank money market, and only four years ago started foreign exchange trading. Through the Gulf crisis, the turbulence of the last days of the old Motherland party government and the political and economic uncertainty surrounding the new coalition, confidence in the lira has never really looked under threat, says the governor. Structural problems remain. The central bank is still required to fund the agricultural purchases of TMO, the state-owned cereals board. More damaging, the Treasury can still turn to the Bank for up to 15 per cent of budget appropriations. Many countries set such a limit; however, it is normally considered more prudent to set the figure as a percentage of revenues, not spending as in Turkey's case. The governor's personal opposition to such a provision is well known. 'A government must voluntarily choose not to resort to it. Even if it is legally feasible, it is not economically sound,' he argues. For, as Mr Saracoglu maintains, the size of Turkey's budget deficit is not itself the problem, so much as the way it is financed. 'The problem is the size of the fiscal deficit, relative to the financial system,' he says. The Treasury's ability to draw on cheap central-bank money threatens fiscal stability. In 1989, the Treasury and the Bank agreed a protocol, under which they put a monetary ceiling on the volume of these cheap credits, over which the Treasury must pay market rates. 'And lo and behold, the Treasury never borrowed more than the limit,' the governor says. Today it is a different matter altogether. Mrs Ciller spent the first half of the year fine-tuning the level of credit in the system, in pursuit of her goal of lower interest rates. The strategy has meant increasing lira liquidity, by turning to the central bank, rather than the bond market, to meet the Treasury's growing demand for funds. The strategy failed, in part because Mr Saracoglu entered the market to absorb the lira expansion he had just been forced to create. But by adopting a tight money policy, inflation was held in check, and the confidence in the lira was maintained. The Bank's intervention prevented a run on the lira. It also served to contain the lira value of servicing Turkey's foreign debt. But, just to absorb the increased liquidity, the Bank estimated that it ran down its reserves by Dollars 2.5bn selling foreign exchange to the market. With central bank gross reserves now recovered to Dollars 7bn, compared with Dollars 4.8bn in June, some analysts wonder whether Mr Saracoglu may just be preparing for another tussle with Mrs Ciller.</p>

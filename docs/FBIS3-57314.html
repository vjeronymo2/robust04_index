			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Kim Boldokhonov] </F>   [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 26 Jan -- A protocol on trade and  economic cooperation between Mongolia and Russia for 1994 was  initialed here today. As last year, Russia remains Mongolia's  principal trading partner. Areas of cooperation include  Mongolia's leading industries -- mining, power engineering,  geology, agriculture, and transport. Both sides expressed their  intention to increase two-way trade, which was worth about $400  million last year.    Mongolia will significantly increase deliveries of copper  concentrate, currently its main export commodity. The Russian  side will also receive fluorspar and articles made from leather  and fur. Exports of meat will resume after having been  interrupted for a while.    Mongolia will import a greater range of goods from Russia.  Russia will supply Mongolia with all its requirements for  petroleum products. Imports of agricultural machinery and  vehicle spares will actually resume. Cooperation in health care  and medicine is also resuming.    Agreements on the establishment of joint ventures in mining,  oil exploration and extraction, and construction work on  projects built in Mongolia with technical and economic help from  the former Soviet Union also testify to stabilization and  progress in the development of bilateral cooperation. Amongst  other things, the Russian side will help to modernize the  capital's heat and power plant No. 3 and a junction on the  Trans-Mongolian railway.    Another new feature of the current stage of  Mongolian-Russian  cooperation is the fact that neighboring regions of Russia --  Buryatia, Irkutsk, and Chita oblasts, Tuva, Krasnoyarsk Kray and  others -- are being actively brought into it.    Another noteworthy aspect of the equitable and mutually  advantageous cooperation between the two neighbouring states is  noticeably greater involvement of commercial organizations in  foreign trade. Their share accounts for roughly 40 percent of  total trade.    The sides agreed that this year Mongolia would continue  repaying its current debt to Russia.</p>

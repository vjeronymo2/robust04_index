			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Survey of Relaunching the Ruhr (1): Innovation in Germany's industrial heartland - Planners are diversifying away from traditional heavy industries, such as coal and steel SIX years ago, in the winter of 1987, the steelworkers of the mighty Krupp industrial empire took to the streets of the Ruhr region to protest against the planned closure of their steel plant at Rheinhausen. For them, the proposed closure of that 100-year-old integrated steelworks was the last straw in three decades of decline in the traditional industries which had made the Ruhr the cradle of Germany's industrial revolution. It was a protest which sparked a nationwide response. The steelworkers and coalminers of the Ruhr held a candlelit vigil which stretched from Duisburg to Dortmund, from west to east of the region which remains the greatest industrial agglomeration in Germany. The protest marked a turning point for the region. Sympathy and support poured in. Not merely the politicians, but the business community was galvanised into action. Krupp reversed its decision to close Rheinhausen, and 2,000 jobs were saved. This year, the steel crisis has struck again, and the plant at Rheinhausen has closed for good. And yet this time round, the protests have been half-hearted, and the national sympathy decidedly muted. The mood on the Ruhr has changed. One reason may be sheer exhaustion. The inevitability of a radical restructuring of Germany's steel industry, efficient though it is in west European terms, has finally percolated through to the labour force. There is also a realisation that in the depths of a national recession, and with the huge burden of rebuilding a united Germany weighing on the public purse, the Ruhrgebiet is on its own. Another reason is more hopeful: the experience of the past six years has shown that there is another alternative for the Ruhr to its traditional industries. Not only are new industries springing up in place of the old, such as environmental enterprises created to clean up the damage of the past, but the coal and steel giants are themselves diversifying. There is a new mood of determination to prove that the Ruhr valley, the last and most modern of Europe's heavy industrial heartlands, can find a new lease of life. What happened after the first Rheinhausen crisis was critical. Three important initiatives were launched to give new impetus to the painful restructuring process, and ease the transition from the steady decline of coal mining, iron and steel to new industries providing the guarantee of new jobs for the 5.5m population. For the first time in years, the whole business community lined up with the state government to reverse the decline. Thirty-five leading businessmen joined forces to found the Initiativkreis Ruhrgebiet, each contributing DM1.5m to a lobby group intended to transform the grimy image of the area, and revive its self-confidence. 'The business community said: 'We cannot leave it all up to the politicians,'' says Dr Elke Esser, director of the organisation. Led by the late Mr Alfred Herrhausen, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, they committed themselves to step up their own investments in the region, and to launch a series of high profile cultural and sporting events to put the Ruhr back on the international map. At the same time, the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia launched its own Zukunftsinitiative Montanregionen, or initiative for the future of the coal and steel regions. For the first time, the plan abandoned the long-running effort to preserve the industrial structure of the region, and sought instead to promote innovation, new technologies and new training to replace the old industries. The state government also threw its weight behind another ambitious project to blend the old structures of the Ruhr with the new: the Emscher Park international building exhibition, a 10-year programme, covering 17 towns and 2m people, to transform the most depressed part of the region into a place worth living and working in. Perhaps it was more good fortune than design, but the launch of those initiatives co-incided with a turning point in the local economy. Unemployment, which had been rising steadily in the region from a low point of less than one per cent in 1970, peaked at more than 15 per cent in 1987 and 1988. Since then it has slowly declined, although it still remains over 11 per cent, well above the national average. The net emigration of the population also ceased, and a new inflow of immigrants - mostly German-speakers returning from eastern Europe - reversed the trend. New jobs were being created fast enough not only to reduce unemployment, but to absorb new market entrants, too. Between 1965 and 1985, total employment in the region fell from 2.37m to 1.92m. From 1985 to 1991, 237,200 net new jobs were created. That is not to say the challenge is not huge. In the past 30 years, the region has lost more than 100,000 steel jobs, and some 240,000 in the coal mines alone. Latest forecasts by the RWI economic research institute in Essen suggest that 50,000 more will be lost by the steel industry in the coming years. Coal mining production has tumbled from 115.4m tonnes in 1960 to barely 50m tonnes today. That level of production still depends on massive state subsidies, through the so-called 'coal penny' imposed on household electricity bills. The whole basis of the subsidy system is under review, with pressure from Brussels to phase it out rapidly. On top of that threat, the competition for new investment from the former east Germany has been intense. And yet the promoters of the region are remarkably sanguine. 'We won't have much chance this year and next to attract new investments, because most enterprises have spare capacity,' says Mr Gerd Frohlich, chief executive of the Emscher-Lippe agency, responsible for promoting the north of the region, the real heartland of coal mining. 'I don't see much competition with the east just now, but the reason is there is no demand. Normally, for capital intensive investment, we would have no chance. The advantages in the new federal states are much more obvious. They can offer double the level of direct subsidies. But we can offer planning certainty. We can get building approval within six weeks. We can offer suppliers very good connections, a good technical basis, and trained personnel.' He believes that for foreign investors, like the Japanese, it is planning certainty, and the reliability of the local partner, which is more important than the immediate cost of an investment. He also suggests the Ruhr must think long-term: 'It's not just a matter of attracting big investors. We must go for small businesses, and we must promote co-operation with our universities. We must do more to make the region attractive for higher qualified people. We have a very well developed green infrastructure, and a wealth of cultural facilities. Everything is there. But we lack good housing for highly qualified workers.' Ironically, she believes part of the problem is that property prices are too low - 'you pay DM2,000 a square metre in Munich, DM1,000 in Frankfurt, and DM800 in Dresden. Here you can pay as little as DM50 to DM100 a square metre.' That means private developers are not attracted. Yet in spite of the scale of the challenge, indeed perhaps because of it, the Ruhr is looking up. 'Within a very short time, the region has become attractive for investors because of its human potential and an affordable quality of life,' according to Prof. Klaus Kunzmann, of Dortmund University's planning institute. 'For others, it is an innovative laboratory of regional change. The Ruhrgebiet is no longer a loser, a place to avoid.'</p>

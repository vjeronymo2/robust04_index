			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BRAVES SIGN RED SOX SLUGGER NICK ESASKY  </P> <P> Free agent Nick Esasky of the Boston Red Sox today signed a three-year contract  with the Atlanta Braves, a team that had been wanting the first baseman for  years.  </P> <P> "He's going to be a great addition to our ball club and our rise to the top,"  vice president and general manager Bobby Cox said at a news conference  announcing the signing.  </P> <P> "It was a decision that was long coming," said Esasky, a Florida native who  lives with his wife and three children in Marietta, Ga., a suburb north of  Atlanta.  </P> <P> "I know there was talk for many years of me coming here," Esasky said. "It  never seemed to work out. I'm totally excited about coming here and playing."  </P> <P> Esasky became one of the top prizes among this year's free agent crop after  batting .277 with 30 home runs and 108 RBIs for the Red Sox last season.  </P> <P> Terms of the contract were not disclosed, but it was believed to be a package  worth $5.7 million over the three years -- a $1.1 million signing bonus and  salaries of $800,000 next season, $1.8 million in 1991 and $2 million in 1992.  </P> <P> Esasky ranked third in the American League in RBIs and fifth in home runs. He  was fourth in slugging percentage at .500, sixth in extra-base hits with 61 and  seventh in total bases with 282 in his first AL season.  </P> <P> "Nobody could be any happier than me," Braves manager Russ Nixon said. "Nick  and I go back quite a ways."  </P> <P> Esasky made his major league debut with Cincinnati in 1983 when Nixon was  managing the Reds.  </P></p>

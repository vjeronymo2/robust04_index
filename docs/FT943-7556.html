			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Greece steps up deportations Greece has stepped up its deportations of tens of thousands of illegal Albanian refugees in retaliation for Albania's trial of five ethnic Greeks. The trial has been described as a 'parody' by Greek officials. More than 5,000 Albanians have been expelled within the past eight days. Greece says there are over 300,000 ethnic Greeks living in Albania but Albania claims the number is about 70,000. In a separate development, the British Helsinki Human Rights Group has published a report which accuses the Greek government of routinely suppressing the small Macedonian community which lives in northern Greece.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (7): Inefficient structure - Service industries Visitors boarding a domestic flight at Haneda Airport in Tokyo will realise that high technology in Japan does not necessarily mean rationalisation of operations. At a ticket-cutting machine at the boarding gate, passengers hand their ticket to an airline employee who inserts it into the machine, then the stub is handed back to the passenger by another employee. Such inefficiencies in Japan's service sector have been tolerated for decades in the name of 'extra service'. Banks, for example, have several employees standing at the door to greet customers, while 'elevator girls' operate the elevators at leading department stores. The economic implications have also been large because the sector has served as a buffer for unemployment, providing extra jobs when the economic conditions required it. Large manufacturing companies have tended to set up subsidiaries in service sector industries where unwanted employees can be shifted to. However, the inefficient structure is now under fire because of deregulation and increased competition. Although heavy government regulation and the tolerance among consumers have helped maintain the low productivity of the domestic service sector, pressure from foreign governments has lowered barriers for new entrants while a new awareness of value is spreading among Japanese consumers. According to Bain, the consultancy group, the productivity gap between service sector industries, including airlines, telecommunications, retail banking, general merchandise, and restaurants in the US and Japan is as large as 40 per cent. This gap, it said, had been 'subsidised' by Japanese consumers, who were paying premium prices. The changes are most apparent in the retail sector, where discounting has become a new trend. Japanese consumers, many of whom have travelled overseas, have started to question expensive domestic retail prices. The downturn in the economy has also prompted consumers to tighten their belts in search for value. Deregulation of the large-scale retailing law, which controlled new store openings in order to protect small retailers, has spurred the increase of large supermarket chains' bulk purchasing power. The large-scale supermarket chains are bypassing the multilayered wholesale network, which has kept retail prices high, and are procuring merchandise directly from the manufacturers or producers. A stronger anti-trust law, put in place following demands by the US government, has overturned the manufacturers' grip on retail prices. Large manufacturers had controlled the retail prices and prevented discounting of its products by threatening to stop supplies. However, electronics companies including Sony and Matsushita Electric Industrial, and leading breweries, have been warned by the Fair Trade Commission (FTC), Japan's anti-trust watchdog, to allow retailers to discount their products without fear of losing supply contracts. McKinsey, the business consultants, believes that foreign retailers will now be able to bring in their innovative organisation, management and marketing skills which the traditional Japanese players lack. With the rise in the yen prompting manufacturing industries to move overseas, combined with a rapidly-ageing population, and further domestic demand for added value, business leaders and many government officials see the service sector as a key to further growth in the Japanese economy. For this, says the Keidanren, the business lobby, deregulation of government restrictions is essential. Deregulation will help the creation of new businesses and improve productivity in the service sectors, including sport, travel, telecommunications, multimedia and environmental businesses. For example, the organisation estimates that deregulation of the telecommunications business will help the market, whose size is presently 1.4 per cent of gross domestic product, to grow to 2.7 per cent - the equivalent of that in the US - by the year 2000. This means the sector will grow by some Y6,000bn and an extra 260,000 jobs will be created. However, such changes may not come easily for some sectors of the service industry. Some branches of the government and some politicians are keen to protect certain interests and are the stumbling blocks to increasing the competitiveness within sectors which have traditionally been heavily regulated. The airline industry met heavy opposition from Mr Shizuka Kamei, transport minister, when it tried to lower costs by hiring air hostesses on a contract basis. Although Mr Kamei finally approved the move, he had strongly opposed it on grounds of safety, claiming that the contract employees would not be able to co-operate with other air hostesses in an emergency. Innovation has also been restricted within the retail banking sector due to heavy regulation by the Ministry of Finance and self censorship among the banks. A new deposit account introduced by Jonan Shinkin, a large credit association, which comes with a chance of winning a Y50,000 lottery, recently caused an uproar within the industry and an investigation by the regulators. So far, with backing from the FTC and popular support from the public, Jonan has remained unscathed. However, the frenzied reaction which Jonan provoked within the financial sector and the ministry of finance, may have prompted other institutions trying to introduce competitive products to think twice.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vera Lima from Manaus, Amazonas State] </F>   [Text] The Amazonia Military Command [CMA] is monitoring a  Venezuelan operation against gold prospectors at the  Venezuelan-Brazilian border. The operation seeks to destroy  clandestine airfields.    In an official communique, the CMA reports that it was  informed in advance of the operation by the Venezuelan Army.  The communique notes that the Venezuelan Air Force is trying to  destroy clandestine airfields in the Alto Quieto and Alto Ocamo  townships, adjacent to the Brazilian border.    The communique adds that this operation has been planned  since late March. At that time, 36 gold prospectors who had  been illegally prospecting in Venezuelan territory were turned  over to Brazilian authorities.    The CMA states that there are no reports of damage in  Brazilian territory as a result of an air strike that took place  in Venezuelan territory on 8 April. The CMA believes the  Venezuelan authorities are just exercising their legitimate  sovereign rights.</p>

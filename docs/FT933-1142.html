			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Czechs see threat to investment THE FLOW of foreign investment to the Czech Republic is threatened by the recession in the west and by rising local costs and wages, Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, trade and industry minister warned this week. Bureaucracy and the poor quality of information were also deterring investors, he said in an article published in the daily newspaper Mlada Fronta Dnes. Mr Dlouhy, who is a fervent advocate of foreign investment as well as a staunch defender of Czech interests, said that investment in the first half of this year was Dollars 392m (Pounds 260m), slightly less than for the same period of 1992. A large part of this was an investment carried over from last year by Philip Morris, the US tobacco company, in Tabak Hutna Hora. Mr Dlouhy said that the decision by Volkswagen, the German car manufacturer, to scale down its investment plans for Skoda, the Czech car maker in which VW has a 31 per cent stake, was 'another proof of the fact' that the recession in the west was limiting investment plans. 'It does not make for too optimistic a picture,' though it was too early to assess the likely results for the whole of 1993, he said. Privatisation programmes in France, Brazil and other countries increased the competition to attract foreign investors, while the recession in Germany was causing a drop of 10 per cent in investment activity. The Czech Republic's greatest attraction was its qualified, low-paid workforce, but this was threatened by a 22-25 per cent rise in wages in the first half of this year. The price of goods, raw materials, services, and transport were also rising. There was serious overstaffing in companies, and bureucracy made investment difficult, he said. 'When will all our complicated specifications which foreigners cannot understand disappear. There are 20 serious projects worth Dollars 540m for the Prague area alone sitting in the network of the administration at the moment.' Investors seeking to buy companies through the Prague stock exchange or its over-the-counter RM-System rival were provided with poorer information than they can find in other markets.</p>

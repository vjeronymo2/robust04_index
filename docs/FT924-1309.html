			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / International Company News: Daf seeks additional financial aid DAF, the financially-troubled Dutch truckmaker, has secured additional loans of Fl 190m (Dollars 108m) and has begun negotiations to obtain yet further financial aid. The company also said that the weakening west European truck market had forced it to reduce its profit forecast. At the time of the interim results, Daf forecast a net loss of Fl 100m. The group yesterday said that the loss would be greater, but gave no details. It also warned that it may be necessary to make provisions in this year's accounts if the restructuring proposals are put into effect in the new year. Daf is in renewed talks with the Dutch and Belgian governments and its banks which could lead to any of the parties taking or expanding equity stakes in the group. While no details have been given, these proposals are intended to lead to further significant cost-cutting and involve further substantial job losses. While Daf would not comment yesterday on the precise amount of the extra funds it is seeking, its main trade union, Industriebond FNV, claimed that the loans could only guarantee Daf's survival until February. Some industry analysts suggest that Daf is seeking up to Fl 500m.</p>

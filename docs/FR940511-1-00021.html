			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The threat of someone either inadvertently or deliberately damaging or manipulating equipment that affects plant operations or could result in radiological consequences arises from that person having access to the equipment. Persons whose tasks involve design, operation, or maintenance of that equipment represent a greater potential threat because of their familiarity and more direct access to that equipment. Safeguard measures that protect against someone from inside the organization are intended to counter this threat by ensuring that persons who have an opportunity to operate or manipulate any equipment affecting plant functions are not impaired and are trustworthy and reliable. To achieve these goals, the Commission believes that although there are substantial unknowns currently associated with the true detection and deterrence effectiveness of random testing, the use of random drug testing provides an effective means for both detecting and deterring the use of illegal drugs or abuse of alcohol.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fundamental approaches for selecting those to be included in a random testing program are to either test everyone (the ``universal'' approach) or to test only those in ``safety-sensitive'' positions. Proponents of the universal approach contend that the safety-sensitive approach tends to be discriminatory in that blue-collar workers are tested but management is not. Proponents of the safety-sensitive approach contend that random testing should be limited to only workers in positions where a direct link to safety exists. The NRC's current approach is a combination of these two fundamental approaches. The NRC's approach tests everyone who has unescorted access to a protected area and, therefore, tests everyone who has an opportunity to operate or manipulate important systems and equipment that could challenge the safe operation or emergency shutdown capability of a nuclear power plant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To satisfy the intended objective of random drug testing, one approach would be to base the decision on who should be randomly tested on a person's access to equipment that could, if manipulated, cause a safety problem. This is a conservative approach and does not take into account the abilities and skills of persons who may have access. For someone who has access and whose tasks do not include safety-related activities, the approach assumes they present some risk of either inadvertently or deliberately causing safety problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nuclear power plant security requirements provide distinct security boundaries where personnel access is controlled. The nuclear power plant protected area is one of these boundaries and is defined as an area encompassed by physical barriers to which access is controlled (10 CFR 73.2). Protected areas contain components and systems that are important to plant operations and whose failure could result in challenges to more critical plant systems and components. The NRC staff's evaluation study cites numerous cases where reactors have been tripped and safety systems challenged as a result of accidents that occurred in protected areas. Since 1987, there have been over two thousand ``events'' that caused reactors to be scrammed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Within protected areas are vital areas. Vital areas contain equipment, systems, devices, or material, the failure, destruction, or release of which could directly or indirectly endanger the public health and safety by exposure to radiation. Unescorted access from protected areas into vital areas is controlled and limited to persons who require access to perform their duties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An approach based on unescorted access to protected areas results in a large variation among sites in the number of people subject to random testing. Many power reactor sites have few administrative or technical work stations inside their protected areas. At these sites, most workers who have unescorted access also have job functions directly related to plant operations and require access to one or more vital areas. However, a number of power reactor sites have administrative and technical support buildings located inside protected areas. At these sites, many workers who have unescorted access only to protected areas (and not to vital areas) do not have tasks directly related to plant operations or maintenance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another approach to designating who would be subject to random testing would be to base the decision on tasks the person performs. This approach recognizes that people whose tasks directly involve plant safety have the access, the opportunity, and the knowledge to cause a safety problem. This approach addresses more directly the safety problems that might be caused by a person who is impaired due to substance abuse. Many positions and tasks are fairly well defined at nuclear facilities. A core of individuals such as plant operators, maintenance personnel, and quality control inspectors have tasks that are clearly subject to NRC regulations and directly involve safety-related activities. However, the relationship of some positions to plant safety is more difficult to establish.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One ongoing NRC activity that could affect considerations for changes in regulatory requirements for persons subject to random testing is a study of security requirements associated with the insider threat. There have been some indications that access control safeguards could, in some circumstances, make it much harder for reactor operators to maintain control of a plant. The NRC staff is considering whether reductions are possible in the safeguards that control access into vital areas from protected areas. Substantial reductions in the access control safeguards for vital areas could alter the safety impact assessments for optional approaches to random drug testing. These safety assessments are based to some degree on the use of access controls to segregate persons having access to vital areas from persons whose access is limited to protected areas (i.e., persons who do not have access to vital areas). Depending on how much importance is given to concerns about deliberate acts based on influence from illegal drug or alcohol abuse, future relaxation of the safeguards to control access into vital areas from protected areas could significantly affect any considerations for narrowing the scope of persons subject to random testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assist in the ongoing evaluation of the scope of random testing, the Commission seeks comments on the proposed alternative approaches to the scope of random testing and other related issues. Further information on these alternative approaches is contained in the NRC staff's report cited previously. This study addressed five options for the scope of random testing. The first option is maintaining the existing random drug testing scope, which is based on personnel access to a particular location. Option 2, which would exclude certain groups of workers from the random testing pool, and Option 3, which would apply random testing to persons who have access only to vital areas, represent relatively simple variations of the current program. Options 2 and 3 would narrow the pool of individuals subject to random testing. Option 4 would base the scope of random testing on the tasks the person performs. Option 5 would allow alternative testing (in lieu of urinalysis) for workers in certain defined positions. For all five options, it is assumed that the other elements of the FFD program (such as suitable inquiries, preaccess testing, and for-cause testing) will remain applicable to all workers who are given unescorted access to protected areas. Specifically, comments are requested on the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Should the Commission retain the current scope of the random drug testing requirements in 10 CFR part 26, which requires that all persons granted unescorted access to protected areas at nuclear power plants be subject to random drug testing? (Option 1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Should the Commission revise the scope of the 10 CFR part 26 random drug testing requirements to adopt one or more of the following approaches?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : GRACES REGISTER ON STAGE BUT NEED MORE GIGS, RISKS  </P> <P> In performance, as on paper, the Graces should be a heroine experience.  Saturday at Bogart's, ex-Go-Go Charlotte Caffey, local sing-sations Gia  Ciambotti and Meredith Brooks and their three-man rhythm section displayed much  more energy and a tad more personality than in the  set-the-controls-for-the-heart-of-the-main-stream pop sounds of their album  debut, "Perfect View."  </P> <P> The tunes, however, might as well have been painted in air.  </P> <P> Sure, your group's Muse-ical focus is on love'n'stuff, but you've gotta put  some blood on the tracks -- or have some kind of wonderful melody -- to really  make it all the way, as evidenced by your sparkling, toss-away version of Nick  Lowe's "What's So Funny (About Peace, Love and Understanding)," which, of  course, has both.  </P> <P> It's not hard to see that the Graces have tremendous potential. It's also not  hard to hear that more gigs, more songs, more risks, in musical range and in  vocal arrangements, are needed. DON WALLER  </P></p>

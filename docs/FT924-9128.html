			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Scent of blood on campus SHOULD he ever seek the French presidency, as it is rumoured he might, Mr Jacques Delors, beleaguered president of the European Commission, was given a dry run in presidential treatment yesterday. Mobbed by television cameramen and crowds of students alternately jeering and cheering, the hapless Mr Delors was almost physically carried into the London School of Economics where he delivered the first Jean Monnet lecture. Security services were a little sparse and Mr Delors must have wished for the muscular presence of truncheon-wielding French CRS policemen to knock a few heads together and clear his path. In the event, he was dumped breathless, but still remarkably composed and good-humoured, on the podium. It was not, of course, Mr Delors' learned expose of the history of monetary co-operation that the scribes and picture- takers had turned up to hear. They had smelled blood. Mr Delors' visit to the LSE followed the reported allegation by Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC's chief trade negotiator, that his boss had sabotaged an agreement with the US to protect the interests of French farmers and, by implication, his own ambitions for the French presidency. Appetites were whetted even before the famous man's arrival by whispered information from a harassed academic. The Foreign Office, he indicated, had just telephoned to speak to Mr Delors. At the moment Mr Delors was about leave for lunch with the LSE's director, it was divulged that Mr John Major had summoned 'monsieur le president' to Downing Street. The dry academic atmosphere positively crackled with electricity. The LSE's political scientists are not often given such a taste of realpolitik. On the substance of the row over Gatt, Mr Delors' tormenters went away unsatisfied. Lost in a forest of microphones and pushing journalists, he was heard to protest that he never interfered in the negotiations conducted by Mr MacSharry. 'I give my advice, but afterwards, if the majority of the Commission do not share my advice, I express my full solidarity with the commissioner in charge of negotiating.' Would he resign? Mr Delors looked bewildered. ' Why? I am in good health,' he answered. In Dublin, a tired-looking Mr MacSharry arrived for a quiet weekend at home in the west of Ireland. Unfortunately his arrival coincided with the opening day of an election campaign. Long thought of as a candidate for the premiership and leadership of the Fianna Fail party, a post could be up for grabs if Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, fails to win a majority in the election.</p>

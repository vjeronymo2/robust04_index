			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Private future for civil service is spelt out With the publication of yesterday's white paper on executive agencies, the government has for the first time spelt out its vision of the future shape of the civil service after a decade of piecemeal reform. It has also given notice that the emphasis in future will be on bringing in the private sector to provide public services wherever possible. Agencies which have previously escaped the threat of privatisation may find that they are up for sale following reviews which are already conducted for all agencies at regular intervals. At the heart of the government's vision is a distinction between the core departments concerned with making and implementing policy and the much larger periphery of organisations that will be responsible for delivering public services. A core of about 10 per cent of the civil service - perhaps 50,000 civil servants in all - will work for the Whitehall departments servicing ministers, distributing public funds and setting standards for public services. The remaining 500,000 civil servants will work in the provision of public services. A small minority will directly work for government departments, particularly where their functions need to be under strong central control as in units which support front-line units in the armed forces. But more than 80 per cent of all civil servants will soon work in executive agencies; separate organisations created to deliver particular services to the public such as benefit payments or tax collection. Each of these agencies has its own chief executive, often appointed from outside the civil service and given considerable management freedom. Each must meet financial and service targets negotiated with government departments, and publish an annual report on its performance. As a result of yesterday's announcement more of the work of agencies will be carried out by the private sector. Some agencies will be privatised, as has happened for DVOIT, the information technology agency of the Department of Transport. Others in information technology, accountancy, payroll, scientific testing and property services could follow suit and would be attractive to the private sector. In other cases, commercial management will be brought in to manage agencies which the government wishes to retain in public ownership. This has happened with the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston. It is managed as a Goco (government-owned, contractor-operated) company by Hunting, the aviation, defence and oil services company. Similar arrangements may be attractive for the agencies which manage the royal parks, the public records office and palaces such as Hampton Court and the Tower of London. Some agencies will be too sensitive for either approach in the foreseeable future. This would apply to the controversial Child Support Agency, which extracts maintenance from absent parents, the prison service and the Crown Prosecution Service. Their managers will be expected to introduce commercial disciplines through further market-testing, by putting parts of their work out to tender. Even those parts of the civil service remaining in the core will not be immune to change. The government plans to recruit more outsiders for top posts and to make top mandarins more accountable. Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, in presenting the changes yesterday said civil service reform was alive and well, with 'the momentum of change gathering pace'. The civil service which emerges will be very different from that inherited by the Conservatives when they came to power in 1979. Next Steps Agencies in Government Review 1993. HMSO.

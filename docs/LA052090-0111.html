			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART WORLD: HER ART HELPS OTHERS BACK NEA FUNDING AT PHOTO STUDIES CENTER  </P> <P> FACES  </P> <P> "When I heard that between 20% and 40% (of letters written to members of the  Reauthorization Committee of the National Endowment for the Arts) are against  the NEA, I just freaked and decided, hey, this is really important. If we don't  do something now, it will be too late," said artist and independent curator  Karen Atkinson, who has taken the current NEA debate to heart by creating a  pro-reauthorization installation in the Los Angeles Center for Photographic  Studies.  </P> <P> Atkinson's installation, "Art Protection Services, Karen Atkinson and  Associates, ARTtorneys for Art," is certainly not your typical art exhibition.  In fact, a newcomer walking into LACPS might not even know he was entering an  art space. That's because, thanks to Atkinson, the gallery has become a mock  lawyer's office set up to fight censorship and other First Amendment issues.  </P> <P> Included in Atkinson's office are her extensive files of clippings on NEA  issues, a bookshelf filled with red, white and blue books on "all the things an  ARTtorney would need to know to defend art," and Atkinson's "degrees" from  Artists' State University and Los Angeles School of Artists at Law. Also  included are artworks featuring wordings from Article I of Congress and the  Official Secrets Act, a looming American Flag and a rack of about 40 different  postcards created by 20 artists for gallery-goers to sign and send to members  of the Reauthorization Committee.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of people that support this issue; but how many people have time  to sit down and write 42 letters?" Atkinson explained. "Here, we have  everything available to you at cost -- the (pro-reauthorization) postcards, the  mailing labels, the stamps -- so people can do in a couple of minutes what it  would take them days to do at home. I'm hoping it will help, especially since  the people that are fighting against the NEA are so organized."  </P> <P> As Atkinson tells it, the practical aspects of this exhibition -- getting as  many postcards as possible signed and sent in to committee members by the time  the exhibition closes June 15 -- are much more important that the art. But  that's the whole idea, she says.  </P> <P> "I wanted to do something that would really make a difference," said Atkinson,  34, a CalArts graduate who now teaches at her alma mater. "There's always the  old saying, and my students always say, 'Art doesn't make a difference; it  doesn't do any good.' But I'm hoping that it does."  </P> <P> </P> <P> OVERHEARD  </P> <P> A man in his mid-20s wearing horned-rimmed glasses, talking to an equally  yuppified female while admiring Rauschenbergs at the Gemini G.E.L. gallery on  Melrose Avenue at a reception for the Tricia Brown Dance Company: "You know,"  he said looking around the room at older people eyeing the art, sipping white  wine and talking of their collections, "I won't feel comfortable at these  things until I'm a collector myself. And that means after the Wharton M.B.A."  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENTS  </P> <P> Look out for a sleeping dog. Noted Santa Monica-based artist Laddie John Dill  is offering a reward for the sculpture "Sleeping Dog," which was stolen from  the walled sculpture garden at his home in early May. The bronze piece, by L.A.  artist Gwynn Murrill, a personal friend of Dill, is worth $25,000. Pat Faure of  the Asher/Faure Gallery, which represents Dill, said the artist wants dealers  to be aware that the sculpture is at large in case they encounter someone  trying to sell it. Anyone with information can call Asher/Faure at (213)  271-3665.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HAPPENING  </P> <P> The ears as well as the eyes will confront AIDS issues when poetry readings  accompany an art exhibit at the L.A. Municipal Art Gallery in Barnsdall Art  Park. The poetry is written by eight Los Angeles poets whose lives and works  have been affected by the disease. The poets will read their works in a program  called "A Fury of Words" on May 26 and June 9. The readings, by Mark Haile, Bia  Lowe, Gil Cuadros and others go along with the dual art exhibit, "The  Indomitable Spirit" and "Raging at the Visible: AIDS in the City of Angles,"  which runs until June 24 at the gallery, 4800 Hollywood Blvd. Information:  (213) 485-4581.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ETC.  </P> <P> In conjunction with the L.A. Municipal Art Gallery exhibition of the same  title, "The Indomitable Spirit," a new limited edition portfolio of 10  previously unpublished photographs is available in Los Angeles at BlumHelman  Gallery. The portfolio features works by John Baldessari, Chuck Close, Jan  Groover, Annette Lemieux, Duane Michals, Richard Prince, Robert Rauschenberg,  Cindy Sherman, Bruce Weber and William Wegman, and is available in an edition  of 50 plus 15 artist's proofs. Proceeds from sales of the portfolio, available  in a number of galleries nationwide, benefit the American Foundation for AIDS  Research and the National Community AIDS Partnership.  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based sculptor and media artist Barbara McCarren has been selected  as the first artist to have work acquired by the L.A. County Museum of Art  under the Marvin B. Meyer Family Endowment. Income from the $50,000 endowment,  established in 1989, will provide for the acquisition of one work by an  emerging artist from the Los Angeles area each year. For the first acquisition,  McCarren will create a new work to be installed this summer.  </P> <P> L.A. artists who want to say it on a billboard can submit their work to the  third annual ArtBulletin Program by June 29. Judges will select three artists  whose work will be reproduced on 14-by-48-foot billboards. The billboard spaces  will be donated by Patrick Media Group Inc., which is co-sponsoring the program  with LACE. Since the billboards will be on city streets for public viewing, a  spokeswoman for the contest reminds artists to do something that uses the  outdoor medium and catches the attention of people driving by. Each winner will  receive a $750 honorarium. Last year's winning billboards included one by  artist May Sun depicting the student demonstration in China's Tian An Men  Square. Information: (213) 731-5111.  </P> <P> Artists interested in workin' on the railway can contact the Los Angeles County  Transportation Commission by June 15. The commission is searching for one  artist to create a permanent work for the Metro Blue Line tunnel, which will go  from under Flower Street to the 7th Street station. Artists should plan on  incorporating light and reflective materials and creating an installation  designed for a moving audience. The budget for the project is $325,000. Artists  may work alone or in teams. Information: (213) 236-9556.  </P> <P> Art gets down to earth as ART/LA90 joins with the Natural Resources Defense  Council in a project called "Art for Earth's Sake." The sponsors of the annual  ART/LA90 event in Los Angeles have announced a liaison with the environmental  action group, and has selected the organization as the beneficiary for the 1990  Gala Preview to be held in December at the Los Angeles Convention Center.  Artists, collectors and galleries will participate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE SCENE  </P> <P> The glowing letter "W" sits atop the Woman's Building as a rallying point for  women. "In a few short strokes, I tried to distill what I see as a  representation of women," said artist Eve King-Lehman of her colorful and  grand-scaled sculpture. "I came up with the letter as the first letter of the  word woman, of course, but it also stands for the West, where we are, which  gives off an exploratory kind of energy."  </P> <P> King-Lehman's piece is part of the face-lift the building at 1727 N. Spring St.  received when three works were added to its exterior as part of the "Gilding  the Building" project last week. She was chosen to adorn the building's walls  along with artists Norma D'Andrea and Barbara Romain by jurors Sheila De  Bretteville and Betye Saar.  </P> <P> King-Lehman created a work that "reflected how the Woman's Building sees  itself." To the artist, the building feels full of "explosive energy. And it  has a strong connection to nature." As a result, she said she used colors from  nature -- deep blues and earthy tones -- within the W.  </P> <P> She illuminated her W with florescent lights to attract attention to it. "It's  bright so I could easily share it with all women, and with the outside world  who passes the building," she said of her first public commission.  </P> <P> "And the lines of the W, which arch up from the building to the sky, symbolize  a positive future for women," she added.  </P> <P> Artist D'Andrea's piece is also devoted to the future. Located at the entrance  to the building, it's a three-paneled etched glass structure of an artist  drawing in front of a planet while she maps out her future.  </P> <P> Romain has done a frieze that runs across the entire building. The piece,  called "Las Angelinas," was a community project put together by local woman  artists.  </P> <P> Also at the Woman's Building . . . let Imogen Cunningham, the 20th-Century  photographer, tell you about her works in her own voice. In a film by her  granddaughter, filmmaker Meg Partridge, Cunningham discusses her photos. The  28-minute film is based on interviews with Cunningham when she was in her late  80s. "Portrait of Imogen" can be seen in the Video Gallery until June 30.  </P></p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / ILO reports trade union repression SOME 200 trade unionists died in the 15 months to March as repression of trade union activity continued in many parts of the world, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) says in a report published today. The ICFTU's annual report to the International Labour Conference in Geneva cites abuses of trade union rights in 85 countries, including 2,000 cases of detention and numerous instances of death threats, abductions, disappearances, harassment and spying. Colombia - where over 50 trade unionists were murdered in the survey period  -China, Guatemala, El Salvador, Iran, Peru, Sudan and South Africa 'are the world's most dangerous places for trade unionists', the report says. The ICFTU says an increasing number of companies, often multinationals operating in developing countries, are resorting to mass dismissals to oppose workers' basic demands. More than 50,000 workers were sacked in the survey period for activities recognised as legitimate under international conventions, the report notes. It also draws attention to evidence in a growing number of countries of connivance between managers, landlords and local security forces. The previous year's report listed 264 deaths and 2,422 detentions, citing 72 countries.</p>

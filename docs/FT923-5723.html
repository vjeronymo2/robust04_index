			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Observer: Eye on the ball No doubt it is a statistical quirk. But have you noticed that some big British property companies, where the chairman has collected lots of outside directorships, don't seem to be doing as well as those property companies where the chairman has few outside interests? Take Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman and chief executive of Slough Estates, Britain's largest industrial landlord. The 54-year-old Sir Nigel, whose grandfather started the business, has been an executive director since 1963 and has led the company during the most successful period in its history. He is also a non-executive director of Barclays Bank, Kingfisher, Cookson and chairman of the DTI Advisory Panel on Deregulation. Sir Christopher Benson, 59, chairman of MEPC, is another property magnate with lots of outside jobs. He's also chairman of Boots and The Housing Corporation, deputy chairman of Sun Alliance and a director of the Royal Opera House. Both men have able lieutenants to keep an eye on the shop when they are on other duties. Even so their own companies are finding the current property slump tough going. Slough Estates has cut its dividend for the first time since World War II and there must be some doubt about MEPC maintaining its payout. Contrast the performance of these two companies with that of Land Securities and British Land, whose respective bosses - Peter Hunt and John Ritblat - are not over-burdened with non-executive directorships.</p>

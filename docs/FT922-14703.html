			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Truce breaks in Croatia ahead of UNdeployment FIERCE fighting erupted in Croatia yesterday, a day before United Nations peace-keeping troops were due to start arriving to police a truce in the former Yugoslav republic, Reuter reports from Belgrade. Hospital officials in the north-eastern Croatian town of Osijek said 12 people were killed and 28 injured in an attack in which the hospital itself was also hit. Police in the town of Valpovo, 30km to the west, said five people were killed and 10 injured in an attack there. Belgrade television reported two deaths just across the border in the republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina. The fighting, among the most serious in Croatia this year, erupted one day before the first part of a 14,000-strong UN force was due to arrive to try to stop nine months of conflict over Croatia's secession from Yugoslavia. Violence also flared in Bosnia, prompting its leaders to ask the UN for help to end fighting which has killed more than 30 people in the past week and increased fears of civil war among its mixed population of Moslems, Croats and Serbs. Belgrade television said two people were killed in the Bosnian town of Bosanski Brod.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee producers in fresh drive for international pact THE WORLD'S coffee producers are going all out to cement the foundation of a new pact at the International Coffee Organisation meeting in London next week. They are confident that the first steps towards negotiating the pact - a meeting of producers over this weekend - will ensure a united front. But there have been so many obstacles to the establishment of a new pact that even Colombia's coffee authorities are less buoyant than usual. Since the Bogota meeting in late August, Brazil, Colombia and Costa Rica have been on a diplomatic offensive, particularly to EC countries. President Cesar Gaviria will be in the US this weekend doing his best to push the coffee pact along at the highest levels. Although the US president is clearly more interested in re-election and other matters, producers are encouraged by the political support of several EC heads of state. But the most reassuring development in recent months from the producer point of view has been Brazil's revived interest in a pact and its active role in suggesting new formulae and options. Brazil, Colombia and Costa Rica have been exploring ways of resolving import controls, one of the main problems created by the proposed universal quota system, which is based on exports by all member countries to all consuming countries. 'The producers are prepared to accept that non-documented coffee enters a country, but only if there are strong disincentive mechanisms,' said Mr Diego Pizano of Federacafe, the Colombian coffee growers federation. 'The producers will do the maximum to control exports and be very active in this, but we need some collaboration from consumers or the universal quota won't work. We need to discourage fraud.' One possibility is a mechanism by which the importer puts up a substantial guarantee if a coffee shipment arrives without documents of origin. Then there would be a period for verification and the guarantee would be forfeit if no satisfactory documents could be provided. As far as the few non-member producers are concerned, a very low limit on imports could be set - otherwise leaving the ICO could become a way of escaping quota control. Mr Gilberto Arango, former head of the private coffee exporters association and a grower himself, is outspokenly sceptical: 'The possibility of reaching an agreement is very remote and if that miracle should happen, I don't see the possibility of having one that can operate successfully.' He believes that there is not enough political backing for a pact and that world stocks are too large to allow prices to react, even with an agreement. The main producers are uncharacteristically relaxed about negotiating quotas. 'There's agreement on using exports to all destinations over a recent period as the basis for distribution. This reflects both the capacity to supply and the demand, because in the free market, consumers have been able to choose what coffee they buy. There is some fine tuning to do, to define the recent period,' said Mr Pizano. Colombia is the only country that can expect a quota increase regardless of how the 'recent period' is defined. Its share of world exports rose rapidly after the collapse of the pact and reached 18 per cent last year. Exports for the 1991-92 coffee year will mark another record at about 15m bags (60 kilos each) and this year's production is forecast at more than 17m bags. Now the concern of the coffee authorities is to bring production down to a more manageable level of about 15.5m bags. A Colombian plan to eradicate 100,000 hectares of coffee will be extremely difficult and costly to implement, said Mr Arango, who thinks that prices will have to do the work. Colombian coffee growers continue to be sheltered from the full impact of low international prices and the crisis is just beginning to bite deep, with unemployment and violence affecting the coffee zones.</p>

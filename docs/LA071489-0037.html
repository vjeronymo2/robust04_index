			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NO FINAL AGREEMENT IN LAND-SWAP TALKS  </P> <P> Negotiations between Rep. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City) and a representative  of Los Angeles County concerning a complicated land-swap proposal did not  produce a final agreement in Washington on Thursday, a Berman aide said.  </P> <P> "The negotiations are ongoing," said the aide, Marc Litchman. "There's optimism  that it can be resolved. There's still more work to be done."  </P> <P> The land swap involves proposals to turn Elsmere Canyon near Santa Clarita into  a public trash dump and to set aside strips of land across Nevada for lines  that would carry electricity to Los Angeles from a coal-burning power plant in  that state.  </P> <P> In return, Berman proposes preserving several scenic canyons as park land,  including three in the Santa Monica Mountains -- Mission, Rustic and Sullivan  canyons -- that are owned by the county and the county sanitation districts.  </P> <P> Under Berman's plan, the Hansen Dam Recreation Area, a run-down park in the  East San Fernando Valley, would receive $300 million in dumping fees from the  Elsmere landfill. In addition, the Lopez Canyon Landfill, operated by the city  of Los Angeles above Lake View Terrace, would be closed.  </P></p>

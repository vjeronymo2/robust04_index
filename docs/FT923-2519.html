			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Banks underwrite planned Swedish loan of Ecu8bn SWEDEN'S proposed Ecu8bn loan from international banks, part of its move to bolster currency reserves and defend the krona, has been successfully underwritten, despite continued disarray in the country's financial markets. There had been concern, when the proposed loan was first announced last Friday, that banks would hesitate at taking on greater exposure to Sweden in the current climate. This feeling was exacerbated by the requirement for any bank taking part as an underwriter to take Ecu350m of the loan, before selling on the loan to other banks. However, JP Morgan, which co-ordinated the loan, announced yesterday that 25 banks had come forward to act as underwriters. The banks represented in the underwriting group are drawn mainly from Germany, the UK, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland, with only two big US banks - Morgan and Citibank - present. According to one underwriter, the yield on the three-year loan, around twice that offered in the similar facility launched by the UK in late August, made it sufficiently attractive to guarantee widespread support. Meanwhile, it emerged that the UK has not accelerated the draw-down of its own foreign currency banking facility, despite the heavy intervention to defend sterling yesterday. As originally planned, half of the bank loan has already been drawn down, with the remaining half due to be drawn on 25 September. By late yesterday, that timetable had not been brought forward.</p>

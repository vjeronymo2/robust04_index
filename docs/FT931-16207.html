			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Architects' confidence 'lowest since early 1991' ARCHITECTS ARE expecting a grim 1993 and confidence is at its lowest level since the start of 1991, the Royal Institute of British Architects says in a report published today. Architects in every region expect a fall in workloads in the first half of this year, with the gloomiest being those in Northern Ireland and south-east England. The figures coincide with a Gallup poll for Building magazine of 80 building contractors, materials producers and consultancies which found that 53 per cent believed the UK market would improve a little this year. But building sector insolvencies are expected to continue at the same or a higher rate by 89 per cent of those polled. More than half of the 33 housebuilders interviewed believe sales will be higher in the next three months than in the previous quarter, and 55 per cent plan to build more private-sector houses this year. The institute says only 15 per cent of architects' firms expect any improvement in workloads over the next six months while 47 per cent expect a fall. In the third quarter of last year a rise in public spending helped new commissions to steady after marked falls in the first two quarters of the year. New commissions for housing and offices show marked declines in the quarter although work on production drawings increased. The institute sees this as the best sign in the figures because it may signal that projects put on hold during the recession are gradually being 'unfrozen'. Retail, leisure and industrial sectors all showed a decline in new commissions. RIBA Leads, Carmargue House, Wellington Road, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire GL52 2AG.

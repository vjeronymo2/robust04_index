			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> ISRAEL PEACE ACTIVIST ENTERS JAIL  </P> <P> About 2,000 people staged a rally outside an Israeli prison today in a warm  farewell to veteran peace campaigner Abie Nathan at the start of his six-month  jail term for meeting PLO officials.  </P> <P> Nathan, a popular broadcaster, was convicted of breaking a 1986 law barring  contacts with members of what Israel brands terrorist groups. He met Palestine  Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat in Tunis last year.  </P> <P> "They have clipped my wings only for a little while, but they know I'll be back  in the air and I'll be back flying to every corner of the world . . . to search  for the enemy to convince him that only dialogue can overcome the confrontation  on the battlefield," the Iranian-born Nathan told the crowd.  </P></p>

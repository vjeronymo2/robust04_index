			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAMPBELL OUTSTRIPS COUNTY'S LEGISLATORS IN SPEAKING FEES  </P> <P> Private groups paid Sen. William Campbell $46,900 to speak to them in 1988,  more than his taxpayer-paid salary and five times the amount received by any  other lawmaker representing Orange County, according to his annual statement of  economic interests.  </P> <P> Campbell, a Republican who represents a stretch of the county from Brea to  Laguna Niguel, ranked behind only Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San  Francisco) and Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) among  lawmakers whose annual financial disclosures were filed Wednesday with the  state Fair Political Practices Commission.  </P> <P> Campbell, who could not be reached for comment Wednesday, also reported  receiving gifts valued at $5,534 and more than $10,000 in income to his spouse  from a consulting firm that has produced Campbell's annual conference on women.  </P> <P> State legislators are paid $40,816 a year, plus $88 per day in living expenses  while the Legislature is in session. In 1988, lawmakers could receive unlimited  gifts and speech-making fees but starting Jan. 1 were limited to $1,000 a year  from each source.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Spoke to 30 Groups  </P> <P> Campbell spoke for money to 30 groups in 1988, receiving amounts as low as  $150, from the United Domestic Workers of America, and as high as $5,000, from  Friends of Lubavitch Inc. of New Orleans. His largest gift was a $3,140 trip in  April funded by Pfizer Pharmaceuticals.  </P> <P> Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) finished a distant second to Campbell among  Orange County lawmakers, collecting $8,400 for nine speeches. Among others,  Seymour received money from the California Assn. of Hospitals and Health  Systems, the California Medical Assn. and Johnson &amp; Johnson. His largest  fee was $2,500 from the California Assn. of Realtors, a group for which Seymour  once served as president.  </P> <P> But Seymour's fees in 1988 were less than what he earned in 1987 and not even  half of the amount he received in 1986. He attributed the drop to his lower  profile since losing his post as chairman of the Senate Republican Caucus in  May, 1987.  </P> <P> "I don't think it has anything to do with John Seymour," he said. "If you can  get the leader or a leader of any organization to speak, somehow that carries  greater credibility than a member of the rank and file."  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) led the delegation in the value of gifts  received with $18,017. More than $15,000 of that amount came in legal and  accounting services from Santa Ana lawyer Lisa K. Hughes and from accountant  Bruce Hughes.  </P> <P> Allen Wednesday said the fees were in connection with her divorce last year  after 21 years of marriage.  </P> <P> "I paid some of it, and we negotiated the last part of it," Allen said. "She  (Lisa Hughes) is a good Republican and wanted to do it for me. Part of it she  just wrote off."  </P> <P> Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) received gifts valued at $14,954 in  1988. Much of her total came in two privately funded trips to New Zealand and  Egypt.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trip to Egypt  </P> <P> Bergeson's $4,041 trip to New Zealand was financed by a consortium of  industrial companies, including Atlantic Richfield, Chevron and Dow Chemical  Co. While she was abroad, officials from Southern California Edison and  Southern California Gas paid for some of Bergeson's meals.  </P> <P> Bergeson said the South Pacific trip focused on alternative energy sources,  particularly geothermal energy and liquid natural gas, which she said is used  extensively in the country's automobiles.  </P> <P> The Egyptian trip, on which Bergeson was accompanied by her husband, Garth, was  sponsored by the government of Egypt at a cost of $3,000. In addition, the  California Optometric Assn. and the California Retailers Assn. picked up the  tab for a $66 dinner the couple had in Egypt.  </P> <P> Bergeson said the trip to Africa was part of Egypt's effort to increase foreign  investment in that country.  </P> <P> Bergeson was also paid $200 for a speech she never gave. The meeting she was  scheduled to address was canceled, but the engineering company that sponsored  the meeting, Guyer Santin Inc., paid her anyway for her "consideration in  agreeing to speak."  </P> <P> "I had a speech all prepared and then they called and canceled the meeting,"  Bergeson said. "They said they would have it later, but it never came about."  </P> <P> At the low end of the scale, Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), who  took office Dec. 5, reported receiving no gifts or speech-making fees.  Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange), the only member of the delegation who has  a personal policy against speaking for money, also reported no fees.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), who usually does not accept  honorariums for speeches, said he decided to take a $1,000 payment from  Farmers' Insurance Co. in 1988 and then use the money to reimburse his district  office staff for the cost of their parking at luncheons and other local  functions they attend.  </P> <P> "I don't want to get into that thing where I'm selling myself as a politician  to speak places," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> GIFTS AND FEES REPORTED BY ORANGE COUNTY LAWMAKERS  </P> <P> Here are the gifts and fees for speeches collected by Orange County's  delegation in the state Legislature during 1988.  </P> <TABLE CWL="5.19IN:1.89IN:2.00IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Gifts  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Speeches  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> SENATE  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $14,954  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $7,500  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5,534  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 46,900  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Cecil N.

			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOYEURS' CONCEIT?  </P> <P> Hats off to the infantile conceit of the dirty-minded voyeurs who think women  nurse babies in restaurants for the sake of entertainment (Saturday Letters,  July 15)! Because these misogynists have so little concern for the children of  our society, we will probably suffer many more generations just like them.  </P> <P> Women don't need to be ashamed of their breasts because some men can't get  their brains out of their underwear.  </P> <P> Many cathedrals have statues depicting the Madonna nursing the infant Christ.  I'm sure this is pure exhibitionism on the part of the Mother of God.  </P> <P> REGINA FLETCHER SADONO  </P> <P> Sylmar  </P></p>

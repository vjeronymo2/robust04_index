			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] South Africa is moving closer to being a respected  member of the African community. Today for the very first time  a secretary general of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  arrived in South Africa on an official visit.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Linda van Tilburg] The OAU  has been watching political developments in South Africa closely  for decades. Now they're keeping an even closer watch on  political developments here as observers during the country's  first multiracial election. There are 15 here at present, but  there will be more than 200 before the elections. On his  arrival at Jan Smuts Airport, the OAU current secretary general,  Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim, underlined the continent's concern about  the forthcoming election.    [Salim] Africa is following these elections very closely,  and  there is going to be a very impressive, massive African presence  during elections -- whether they come from the Organization of  African Unity, whether they come from the Commonwealth, or  whether they come from the United Nations.    [Van Tilburg] During his four-day visit Dr. Salim will meet  leaders of the government, the ANC [African National Congress],  PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], Inkatha Freedom Party, and the  Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front]. Although he wouldn't  elaborate, it is expected that he might try to convince General  Constand Viljoen and Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi to  participate in the election.    [Salim] It is absolutely essential that all should be  involved in the process of election.    [Van Tilburg] Dr. Salim today said there would be massive  support for South Africa's membership of the OAU. It's expected  that South Africa will for the first time become part of the  33-year-old organization shortly after a government of national  unity is formed. [end recording]</p>

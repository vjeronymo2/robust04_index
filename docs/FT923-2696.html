			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Survey of Wales (9): New approach to nation's heritage - Growing public interest in historic sites, treasure trove and works of art OUTSTANDING additions continue to be made to the national heritage of Wales, whether it be the 210m-year-old dinosaur footprints found two years ago near Barry, the three outstanding Bronze Age gold torcs recently uncovered near Milford Haven, or the ever-expanding remains of Roman and Romano-British life still being excavated at the legionary fort of Caerleon and the nearby Roman town of Caerwent. Yet, although Wales has long been a treasure trove for those interested in learning about man and his accomplishments, the ways in which much of the information has been presented has - with some notable exceptions - often been as likely to discourage as to encourage the casual observer from inquiring further. The revolution that has now taken place in the way Wales's past is being presented is the result of a number of factors happily co-inciding. Interest in the past has grown, fostered by books, articles in the press and television programmes. At the same time, growth in visitors during the 1980s has brought with it a rising demand for access to historic monuments and other buildings, including relics of Britain's great industrial era, developments in which Wales was at the forefront. The two main bodies in Wales charged with preserving and interpreting the nation's heritage, the National Museum, and Cadw, the equivalent of English Heritage, have responded to this challenge with a re-think both in attitudes and approach, as, too, have a number of private owners. The National Museum has been nursed back to financial health by its new director, Mr Alistair Wilson, who has overseen an investment programme designed to make the museum one of the finest in Europe. Under this, the main building in Cardiff's Cathays Park, the foundation stone for which was laid by George V in 1926, will finally be completed next October, when the last stages of a Pounds 26m scheme, doubling its size, are finished. This will add a further six centre block galleries, totaling 85,000 sq ft, to two new galleries recently completed in the east wing, giving the museum the space it has long needed to display its collections to the full and to the highest standards. The museum will, as a result, be able to mount for the first time a comprehensive display of art, including its renowned Impressionist collection, (the bequest of two Welsh sisters Gwendoline and Margaret Davies), other older works and its paintings by Welsh artists such as Richard Wilson, Thomas Jones, Augustus and Gwen John, and Ceri Richards. Other developments made possible by the large increase in space are a new Welsh ceramics gallery to house the museum's extensive collection of Nantgarw and Swansea porcelain. A number of important additions have recently been made to this from the Pounds 1.1m auction of the collection of Sir Leslie Joseph, the Welsh former vice-chairman of Trusthouse Forte. Though some critics have accused the museum of an excessively conservative approach, and of failing to pay enough attention to Wales's indigenous cultural heritage, the result is an impressive addition to the visual arts in Wales, Ahead of these latest developments, the museum has been attracting greatly increased numbers of visitors through imaginative temporary exhibitions, sometimes shared with other museums elsewhere in Europe and often designed to appeal specifically to younger people. A successful dinosaur exhibition has been followed by another on the Ice Age featuring woolly mammoths. The museum was also one of the venues for a touring exhibition of the Queen's Windsor Castle collection of paintings, and last year produced its biggest ever temporary exhibition, on the Celts in Wales, much of it using material usually stored. This policy has helped to attract more than 200,000 people to the main museum annually, enabling it to recover from a sharp downturn after the introduction of charges in 1989. Total visitors to all the museum's sites - which include a north Wales branch, Oriel Eryri, and specialist museums on Welsh folklife and on various aspects of Wales's industrial past at locations around Wales - are running at around 800,000 a year, with a target for this to grow to 1m. A new permanent exhibition on Man and the Environment exemplifies the move away from the traditional glass-case approach. This brings together a number of the museum's exhibits, including the largest Leatherback Turtle ever found - washed ashore on Harlech beach in north Wales - and uses the latest audio-visual techniques. Cadw (the Welsh word for save) was set up in 1984 to take over the management of 127 historic monuments and buildings (out of a total of 2,700 altogether in Wales) in the care of the secretary of state. It also carries out a range of statutory responsibilities for preserving, conserving and promoting the Principality's built inheritance. An executive agency of the Welsh Office since 1991, Cadw has, like the museum, sought to inject greater energy into the presentation and preservation of Wales's past. Visitor centres, which put developments their historical context, have been added at the main monuments and a survey is being undertaken at all the sites in Cadw's care to see how they should best be presented to the public. At the bigger sites permanent exhibitions and seasonal events have been introduced, together with shops offering relevant, and where possible, locally-made, products. Acquisitions of important sites continue to be made. Cadw has recently acquired Plas Mawr in the heart of Conwy's walled town, the finest surviving example of a 16th century town house in Wales. Formerly owned by Lord Mostyn and leased to the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art,the building contains a fine Jacobean ceiling, and, when the first stage of restoration is completed in 1995, it will be presented as it appeared about 1700. Cadw is also responsible for administering in Wales applications for grant assistance for historic buildings. Among its biggest beneficiaries is the National Trust, which received more than Pounds 1m. last year towards the cost of maintaining its properties. Cadw's attention is also being focused on townscapes within urban conservation areas. Though lacking the mediaeval buildings which are feature of many historic English towns, Wales is full of interesting Victorian buildings and streets, the virtues of which are in many cases only belatedly being recognised. Last year grants worth some Pounds 646,000, funded jointly by Cadw and local authorities, were made in support of 23 town schemes. Working through four regional archaeological trusts, Cadw also provides finance for rescue digs at sites throughout Wales. The Second Severn crossing, east of Newport has already proved to be a rich source of discoveries from palaeolithic, bronze age and Roman times, including what could be bronze age fish traps. Sadly, in two important areas, Wales's more recent past continues to disappear or suffer grievous damage. The decline in religious observance and the movement of population from older industrial areas has left many of Wales's fine chapels high and dry, or converted to unsuitable uses, such as tyre depots or carpet warehouses. The vast miners'institutes, complete with libraries and a range of social and other function rooms, which dominated former pit communities, are also now largely disused, though one at least is being moved from Oakdale, in Gwent, to a new home at the Welsh Folk Museum in St. Fagans. The help Cadw can provide, however, is limited. Because most of the buildings remain in private hands, their only safeguard is listed building status, and where no viable future use can be found this is very often not enough to prevent demolition. Because of the nature of its attractions Cadw is probably more dependent on overseas visitors than the National Museum and the past financial year has been disappointing, Cadw's chief executive, John Carr, admits. With fewer American visitors last year because of the Gulf War, total admissions to Cadw properties fell by 11.7 per cent to just under 1.3m, with revenue also slightly down. There are still hopes for a recovery in the present year, though the high sterling-dollar relationship and poor August weather may well prevent this. The improvement that has taken place in the facilities on offer seems likely to have laid much of the groundwork, however, for a strong recovery when the economy does pick up again.  ----------------------------------------------------------- POPULARITY OF NATIONAL MUSEUM SITES  ----------------------------------------------------------- The number of visitors to each site in a year was: Cathays Park, Cardiff: 221,737 Welsh Industrial and Maritime Museum, Cardiff: 40,670 Welsh Folk Museum, St. Fagans: 269,260 Amgueddfa'r Gogledd, Llanberis: 54,530 Welsh Woollen Industry Museum, Felindre: 17,169 Roman Legionary Museum, Caerleon: 32,291 Turner House.

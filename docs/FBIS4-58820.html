			<p>BFN     [Text] Commenting on the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli  agreement, 'Allamah Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah said that  the agreement was a victory for Israel, not the Palestinians.  Israel, Fadlallah pointed out, polished its public image and  got many doors open in the Arab World. Dazzled by the  agreement, some Arabs are opening their doors to Israel and  hastening to normalize relations with it even before the latter  makes any overture.    Fadlallah added: The Arab world is under a spell. Israel is  not offering the Arabs much. The enemy's prime minister told a  Qatari newspaper: We want to be stronger than the Arabs so that  the latter may understand that they cannot get anything from us  except through negotiations.    This, Fadlallah said, means that America helped Israel  militarily so as to force the Arabs to make concessions.  America wanted to deprive the Arabs of any clout they may use  against Israel.    Therefore, this agreement has no legitimacy. We believe that  the nation should hold firm to its principles, because once we  start making concessions we will never stop. We might even lose  more land.    France once saw Algeria as French territory. America may  come to see the Gulf as U.S. territory. We recently read that a  U.S. official visited Yemen and no sooner was he gone than the  war broke out there. We in Lebanon are used to such visits by  U.S. officials, who are adept at playing a double game. This  double game, long known to us in Lebanon, has just started in  Yemen.</p>

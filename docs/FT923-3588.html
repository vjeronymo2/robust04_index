			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Top NHS man sent to health authority THE GOVERNMENT is to send Sir Roy Griffiths, one of the National Health Service's most senior figures, to strengthen the management of the West Midlands Regional Health Authority. Sir Roy's appointment follows a critical district auditor's report on a cost-cutting study on which the authority spent Pounds 2.5m. The auditors found that the study - which managers admit yielded few benefits - was badly managed and involved Pounds 350,000 of expenses including entertainment. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said last night that Sir Roy, deputy chairman of the NHS policy board, would help the authority discharge its role efficiently and effectively for the future. He would help it 'continue to strengthen and improve its management structures and controls so that they command public confidence.' The contract criticised by the auditors was intended to identify ways of saving up to Pounds 50m through better purchasing and efficiency. It was awarded to United Research Group, a consultancy run by Mr Chris Watney, former director of the authority's supplies division. Sir James Ackers, chairman of West Midlands Regional Health Authority, said yesterday that Mr Watney had left the authority in June last year, after an internal review. Mr Stuart Fletcher, the authority's recently appointed managing director, said the auditors' report showed that the project was badly managed with 'serious shortcomings' in budgetary, financial and managerial control. Very few of the projects involved in the cost-cutting study had brought any lasting benefit to the NHS. 'Clearly there were failures in the handling of this contract.' Action since the report, Mr Fletcher said, had included efforts to recover any overpayment on expenses, a review of the actions of officers, and revision of contracting procedures.</p>

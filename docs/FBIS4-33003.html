			<p>BFN     [Text] National Police Commander General Luis Rocha said  yesterday that his institution supports the military patrols  being carried out in the Chapare region since early this week in  accordance with constitutional regulations.    Rocha said: "The Armed Forces belong to the nation, and they  have the constitutional right to be wherever they want to be in  accordance with their needs."    He said, however, that this does not mean that the Special  Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) is not capable to keeping order in  the conflictive region of Chapare, in Cochabamba Department.    Asked about the alleged formation of irregular groups  financed by drug trafficking, General Rocha said that the police  intelligence services have not confirmed their presence, but  that the situation is being investigated because of the latent  threat of criminal groups linked to drug trafficking.    He also indicated that the investigation is being carried  out  jointly with Army intelligence. Answering reporters, Rocha  said: "All the actions are of course being coordinated with the  Armed Forces."    He added that the current situation does not demand an  increase in the FELCN presence in the Chapare. On the contrary,  he said, there are enough agents there to maintain control over  any possible conflict.</p>

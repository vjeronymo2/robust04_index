			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ANY THOUGHTS ON THE UMPS, JACK?;  </P> <P> PADRES' CLARK RIPS 'AWFUL' AL UMPIRING AFTER EJECTION  </P> <P> Jack Clark, who has spent the spring rejoicing over his return to the National  League as a first baseman for the Padres, paused briefly Wednesday to issue a  farewell address to American League friends.  </P> <P> "The umpires over there are awful, they don't have a clue . . . I don't know  whether they don't practice or what," Clark said of American League umpires  after being ejected by the AL's Tim McClelland following a disputed  third-strike call in the sixth inning of the Padres' 11-3 exhibition victory  over Oakland at Phoenix Stadium.  </P> <P> "Bad umpires is maybe the biggest reason I'm glad I'm back over here (NL),"  Clark continued in even tones. "There's a lot of bad umpires over there (AL);  that's why Billy Martin kicks dirt on them, trying to cover them up."  </P> <P> Clark's only kicks at McClelland Wednesday were verbal. After arguing a called  third strike in the fourth inning, Clark became incensed in the sixth after  another call put him down one ball and two strikes. He then cursed McClelland.  </P> <P> "I told him, 'I'm glad I never have to see you (expletives) again,' " said  Clark, who spent his first season in the AL last year with the New York Yankees  after spending most of 13 years in the National League.  </P> <P> "Yep," McClelland confirmed. "He cursed me."  </P> <P> But Clark was not thrown out until after the next pitch, a high, outside  fastball that was also called a strike. Clark dropped his bat at the plate,  flung his helmet and walked off as McClelland shot his fist into the air with  the ejection.  </P> <P> "That pitch was in the dugout. I think Honeycutt (A's pitcher Rick) was almost  laughing." Clark said. "They've got a lot more low-lifes umpiring over there  (in the AL), a lot of scabs. They must have a code of ethics where they all  stick together, like collusion. See today, the guy can run back and tell his  friends -- guys like (AL umpire) John Shulock, he's the absolute worst -- tell  them, 'Hey, I got Clark for you.'  </P> <P> "Maybe the AL umpires are jealous of the NL umpires. I think a lot of them get  their jollies throwing out million-dollar ballplayers."  </P> <P> McClelland, who listened to Clark's comments just as calmly, disagreed.  </P> <P> "We don't have notches on our belts, we don't want to throw guys out, it's more  of an aggravation to us," McClelland said. "And there's no difference to us  between a million-dollar ballplayer and a rookie. We don't even notice who is  up there. When the ball is coming 90 mph, you don't have time to notice who's  batting. You're just trying to call balls and strikes.  </P> <P> "And there's absolutely no difference between the umpiring in the two leagues.  Absolutely none."  </P> <P> Clark begged to differ.  </P> <P> "I've notice the difference, and it's not just in the strike zone, it's in the  quality of umpires," Clark said. "I think they try so hard to be different from  the National League. I've always thought umpiring was just umpiring, no matter  what."  </P> <P> As Clark was finishing his discourse in the clubhouse underneath Phoenix  Stadium, in walked pitcher Bruce Hurst. In five innings, he had allowed two  runs on five hits with five strikeouts but had looked distressed on some close  ball and strike calls.  </P> <P> "Who had a longer day, me or you?" Hurst asked Clark.  </P> <P> Coincidentally, it was McClelland who issued a normally calm Hurst one of his  two major league ejections, in Game 3 of last year's American League  Championship Series. Although Hurst was not pitching, he was upset because he  claimed McClelland had laughed at him during an argument in Game 2.  </P> <P> "So I'm arguing over something else from the dugout, and I ask him, 'Why don't  you laugh at me now?' " Hurst recalled. "So he threw me out, and I gave him my  hat, my coat, my glove and told him, 'Take all this, you've already taken away  my game.' "  </P> <P> If nothing else Wednesday, the Padres, who have cruised through the first 24  days of spring training doing little more than preening and shaping, finally  found emotion. Two batters after Clark's ejection, catcher Benito Santiago hit  his second homer of the game, a shot over the left-field fence that Santiago  admired before defiantly celebrating by tossing his bat near McClelland's feet.  </P> <P> "Then I think, maybe I should run, what if the ball goes down -- bloop --  inside the fence?" Santiago said. "That happened once in Las Vegas, I think I  have homer, I was thrown out at second base, I not play for three days. This  not happen again."  </P> <P> Following this, the game became so captivating that Manager Jack McKeon was  able to pull off the move of the spring. In the eighth inning, in the middle of  leading his team in another cheer, McKeon sneaked out of the dugout and into  the clubhouse, where he quickly showered and changed and caught a van for the  airport and a flight to San Diego. The Padres ended their 10-game Phoenix trip  here and with an off day today, they weren't required to report back to Yuma  until Friday afternoon. Not even McKeon.  </P> <P> "It was an awesome move, I think I was the only one who saw him," Tony Gwynn  said. "He was clapping and saying 'C'mon guys, c'mon guys' and then -- boom --  he's gone.' "  </P> <P> McKeon missed the game's biggest blow, as struggling prospect Sandy Alomar Jr.  hit a ninth-inning grand slam off Eric Plunk. It was Alomar's second hit in 18  spring at-bats. The Padres hope it gets the attention of the league's scouts,  who have been looking at the Padres' chief bit of trade bait with interest. The  closer they have watched, the more Alomar, 22, has squirmed.  </P> <P> "I finally think now, I can be the Sandy Alomar of last year and the year  before," Alomar said. "I can be me."  </P> <P> And hopefully for him and the Padres, he can then be gone. McKeon spent much of  the pre-game workouts in conversation with New York Mets scout Harry Minor, who  has followed the club throughout the spring. Trade talks could be heating up  between those two clubs; the Padres would send Alomar Jr. to the Mets for  center fielder Len Dykstra and infielder Howard Johnson. Alomar Jr. is also  being watched closely by the Yankees, who might be persuaded to send the Padres  third baseman Mike Pagliarulo.  </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> The Padres leave Phoenix with an 8-4-1 spring mark and begin a nine-game "home  stand" at Yuma's Desert Sun Stadium beginning Friday at 7:05 p.m. MST against  San Francisco. That game will be telecast back to San Diego on KUSI-TV Channel  51, with the pregame beginning at 5:30 p.m. . . . Outfielder John Kruk missed  Wednesday's game with a sore neck, which he twisted when he broke up a double  play Saturday against Seattle. "It's been every little thing with me this  spring," lamented Kruk, who was sporting a new wavy haircut. "It's a new  hairstyle," he said. "It's called a comb." . . . On Wednesday Bip Roberts was  once again misidentified as "Biff," this time on the Phoenix Stadium  scoreboard. Unfortunately, until Jack McKeon quits calling him "Biff," the  infielder has little reason to complain to anyone else.  </P></p>

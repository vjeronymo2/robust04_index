			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Airtours Airtours may prefer to concentrate on persuading the market of the virtues of its hostile bid for Owners Abroad, but it would be dangerous for it to ignore the pressure building up on the competition policy front. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission has grounds at least to take a look. After doubling in size following a successful bid, Airtours argues it would be better able to offset the aggressive dominance of the market leader, Thomson. This would bring a better competitive balance to the package tour industry even though the two leaders would control 60 per cent of it. A cartelised market would not develop because of the industry's low barriers to entry and its competitive character. But the case looks suspicious, given the degree of vertical integration developing. Since Airtours owns the Pickfords travel agency and Thomson owns Lunn Poly, the travel business is starting to resemble the brewers' tie. These two powerful players can push their own brochures through their own travel agencies, at the expense of other operators. Even domestic ones such as Rank, owner of Butlins, admitted this week to a sharp loss of business last summer as a price war raged among package holiday operators. The MMC might well conclude that the emergence of a strong number two is desirable to temper Thomson. It may refrain from being any more ambitious after its chastening experience of trying to free up pubs. But it is hard to accept that that Airtours' bid for Owners Abroad only affects a limited section of the holiday market.</p>

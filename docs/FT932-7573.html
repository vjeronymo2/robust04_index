			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / The Long View: Greenback blues SO FAR this year the score for conventional wisdom in the foreign exchange market appears to be one hit, two misses. The safe bets for 1993 were that the dollar and the yen would go up and the D-mark would drop. Sure enough, the yen has duly done its stuff, rising 12 per cent on the basis of its trade-weighted index so far this year (and by 25 per cent since its low point last August). But there are some very stale bulls around of the dollar (down 3 per cent since the end of December) and some very unsatisfied bears of the D-Mark (down 1 per cent). It is a reminder, perhaps, that when currencies are floating freely the foreign exchange market is likely to come up with some reasonably sensible answers, and will certainly not make life easy for forecasters or corporate treasurers. How different is the rigged situation in the European Monetary System, which last week endured its latest little upset (although the EC continues to assure us that the ERM would work wonderfully if only the politicians behaved sensibly). It is interesting to remember that a year ago, before the first Danish referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, the Spanish peseta was bursting through the top of its ERM fluctuation band because it was a higher-yielding D-Mark (no risk, extra return). Since then it has been devalued three times (and has even depreciated against sterling). Of course, foreign currency traders who base their decisions on patterns in the five-minute charts cannot be expected to come up with sensible long-term parities. But the standard views on the dollar and the D-Mark have been based on perfectly reasonable economic projections: that a US recovery would in due course lead to a tightening of monetary policy and a rise in bond yields, while on the other hand the slide into German economic decline would trigger sharp cuts in interest rates and a perceived need for a significantly lower exchange rate in order to permit an economic revival not only in Germany but right across Continental Europe. These views have not yet been proven wrong, but they are getting dog-eared. The American recovery, for instance, has been disappointing. It is normal enough for the pace of a cyclical recovery to slacken after an early spurt, but the 1.8 per cent GDP growth in the first quarter was unimpressive. And although the long bond yield has duly risen - it topped 7 per cent briefly this week - the US Treasury is so dependent on a steep yield curve to persuade the banking system to finance its fiscal deficit that short-term rates seem likely to stay low for some time. So holders of dollars will continue to suffer an income disadvantage. As for Germany, the Bundesbank continues to fight a dogged rearguard action, worried about 4.3 per cent inflation and overshooting monetary growth. It passed up this week's chance to cut its official interest rates further. The Danish 'yes' vote was thought likely to erode some of the german currency's safe haven appeal, but in the event the movements have been modest. If the D-Mark is indeed poised on the edge of a cliff it is certainly not suffering from vertigo. But from a global perspective the economic weakness of Europe and the overvaluation of several of its currencies are what stand out at present. The European Commission is now forecasting negative economic growth for the Community as a whole in 1993. Nevertheless, huge trade deficits are looming, of 2 to 3 per cent of GDP for Germany and the UK (and perhaps 1 1/2 per cent for the EC as a whole). A major source of this imbalance is Japan, which is running a surplus of about 3 per cent of GDP; the appreciation of the yen is a logical consequence. But the growing competitiveness of developing countries around the world - especially China - also seems to be an important factor. The pattern of mature economies suffering a destabilising degree of import penetration is also, after all, seen in the US, where the trade deficit jumped to Dollars 10.2bn in March, giving another jolt to the dollar bulls. Europe is notably reluctant, however, to live without cheap imports: they may destroy jobs but they also hold down the cost of living. The Bundesbank has a duty to put the purchasing power of the D-Mark before other economic priorities, and in the UK similar concerns clearly emerged in this week's quarterly Inflation Report from the Bank of England. The 6 per cent rally in the sterling exchange rate since February, said the Bank, has improved the chances that the government's 4 per cent inflation ceiling will not be breached next year, but any decline in the value of the pound from here would put the target in peril. In the end, however, attempts to hold national living standards at levels which are not being earned are bound to end in failure. If it tries, Europe will be overwhelmed by a twin deficit problem, with both budget gaps and trade gaps. But at what point will this come to dominate the foreign exchange markets? In the short run, as we saw with the peseta last year, the markets barely look beyond interest rates. But in other circumstances, and quite suddenly, they might look at economic credibility instead. The deficits would have to be cured, not just financed. For the moment, however, the currency with perhaps the worst twin deficit problem of the lot, sterling, has actually been edging up. Yet it is possible to detect early signs of crisis in the surprising strength of those traditional safe havens, gold and the Swiss franc. And German bond yields have been rising, which could be an indication that foreign investors are getting restless. If you switched out of D-Marks into dollars at the end of last year at a rate of 1.62 you have yet to show a profit. But hold on a bit longer, the markets may see it your way soon.</p>

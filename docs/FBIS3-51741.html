			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nancy Zamora] </F>   [Text] Madrid, 14 Jan (PL) Isabel Allende, Cuban vice  minister of foreign relations, said today bilateral relations  between Spain and Cuba are good and constructive.    Allende, who is on an official visit to Spain, said the two  countries have different points of view on certain issues. She  told PRENSA LATINA that "the important thing is, however, the  attitude one takes to solve problems and overcome difficulties."    During her stay in Madrid, the deputy foreign minister held  meetings with high-ranking officials from the Spanish Foreign  Ministry, with whom she discussed issues such as progress at the  bilateral commissions on scientific and cultural exchange and  technical and industrial assistance.    Regarding an upcoming trip by Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina, following an invitation from his Spanish colleague,  Javier Solana, Allende said the visit will serve to develop  further the ties with Spain, one of the Caribbean island's main  commercial partners.    Allende said "we are working to strengthen our ties, and  there is nothing keeping us from doing so, based on, of course,  the principles of mutual respect and noninterference."    The diplomat addressed the importance the local press had  given her visit to the Iberian nation, which she sees as proof  of the interest there is in her country. She regretted,  however, the appearance of information she termed manipulative  in certain newspapers which she considers prestigious.    To illustrate her statement, she mentioned an article  published yesterday in an EL PAIS issue. The article reported a  meeting she held with a high-ranking Foreign Ministry official,  during which they discussed Spanish claims for the release of  several people imprisoned in Cuba.    Allende said "I am concerned that they highlighted [words  indistinct] minimal time and attention, which by no means  constitutes the essence of Spanish-Cuban relations."    She also criticized a report carried yesterday in the Madrid  daily EL MUNDO that listed recommendations Economy Minister  Carlos Solchaga allegedly made to the Cuban Government upon  returning from a trip to the Caribbean nation last year.    The Spanish Foreign Ministry flatly denied the reports  today,  stating that the newspaper's article "seriously twisted the  content and meaning of the original document."    According to EL MUNDO, Solchaga presented a "secret  document"  to authorities in Havana in which Spain listed several  recommendations for an economic solution to the island's  economic crisis.    In commenting on the possible economic formulas, Solchaga  said "Cuba receives visitors [word indistinct] recommendations  regarding measures to overcome the current economic crisis, but  it is the government--as the most interested party in resolving  the crisis--who must decide on which measures to adopt."    In answering a question from reporters during a news  conference in Madrid, Allende said the U.S. blockade against  Cuba is illegal. She added it violates international laws and  contradicts basic premises of a market economy, which depends on  the ability to trade, to establish a business and to navigate  freely.    She also admitted that since the beginning of Bill Clinton's  administration, Washington is using less aggressive language  toward the island but void of any indication of a change in U.S.  policy.</p>

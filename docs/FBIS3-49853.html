			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tihomir Vinkovic from Geneva] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Croatian standpoint with  regard to Bosnia-Herzegovina is clear. Negotiations can take  place on the basis of the European Council proposal dated 22  December and the Brussels conclusions. According to these,  Croatia should get at least 17.5 percent of the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Muslim proposal which was given to the  Croats yesterday goes below this -- only 13 percent. This is  unacceptable to the Croats, it has been learned from the  Croatian delegation. [passage omitted]</p>

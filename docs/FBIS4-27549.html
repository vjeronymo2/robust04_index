			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Japan called for China's  continued cooperation in solving the problems of North Korea's  alleged development of nuclear weapons, Foreign Ministry  officials said Wednesday.    In diplomatic consultations held at the Foreign Ministry,  Japanese officials told a Chinese delegation that China's role  is important in solving the problem, the officials said.    Beijing supports the denuclearization of the Korean  peninsula  and considers peace and stability on the peninsula important,  the Chinese side was quoted as saying.    They also told the Japanese side that now is the time for a  "calm and constructive" approach by all concerned parties.    China wants talks to be held between North Korea and the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and between  Washington and Pyongyang, the Chinese diplomats said.    Japanese diplomatic officials voiced deep concern over North  Korea's unmonitored removal of fuel rods from its nuclear  reactor in Yongbyon, and said North Korea's alleged nuclear  development concerns the future of the nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty (NPT) system, the officials said.    The UN Security Council issued a presidential statement  Monday "strongly" urging North Korea to cooperate in pulling  spent fuel rods from a nuclear reactor so IAEA inspectors can  determine if any material has been diverted for nuclear weapons.    The ministry officials declined to elaborate on the contents  of Wednesday's consultations with China, saying they were not  "negotiations."    Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda led the Japanese  delegation at the talks held at the Foreign Ministry, while  Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan headed the Chinese  side.    Japan and China have been holding diplomatic talks since  1980. The previous meeting was held in Beijing in March 1992.    Also during the talks, the Japanese side referred to  comments  by former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano denying Japan's  aggression during World War II and the 1937 Nanjing massacre,  and vowed to make continued efforts to develop bilateral  relations with China based on remorse for the past, the  officials said.    The Chinese side said China's basic stance is to develop  relations with Japan by not forgetting the past but by learning  from it and by looking toward the future.    Correctly dealing with the two nations' past is also an  important political base for promoting bilateral ties, Chinese  officials were quoted as saying.    Japan urged China to refrain from conducting underground  nuclear tests and expressed hope that Beijing would participate  in negotiations on the comprehensive test ban treaty in Geneva,  they said.    China replied that it is participating in the negotiations,  and reiterated that it supports complete abolition of nuclear  weapons and conducts fewer tests than other nuclear powers, they  said.    Tokyo also asked for Chinese support in its bid to become a  permanent member of the UN Security Council.    The Chinese side replied that the reorganization of the  council should be dealt with according to consensus and the  principles of balance, adding that it would consider Japan's bid  on this basis, they said.</p>

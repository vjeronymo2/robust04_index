			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Economic Watch: Fewer Dutch out of work Dutch unemployment fell for the third consecutive month in June, confirming a trend that emerged earlier in the second quarter after nearly two years of increase. The central statistical office said yesterday that an average of 461,000 people were registered as unemployed in April-June, down from an average 483,000 in the previous three-month rolling period of March-May and 500,000 in February-April. The figures, which are not corrected for seasonal factors and are based on a narrow definition of registered joblessness, are equivalent to an unemployment rate of 7.2 per cent. Despite the month-to-month decline, registered unemployment in April-June was still higher than a year earlier, when 394,000 people were unemployed and the jobless rate stood at 6.2 per cent. Norway's trade surplus widened to NKr5.54bn (Pounds 521m) in June from NKr4.88bn in May and NKr4.98bn in the same month last year, the central bureau of statistics said. German company insolvencies rose by 18.8 per cent in April against the same period last year. 1,234 companies became insolvent in April 1994, bringing the total to 4,894 in the first quarter. The figure for the first quarter rose by 22.4 per cent against last year.</p>

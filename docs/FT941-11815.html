			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Berisford shares soar to 232p as trading resumes Shares in Berisford International closed last night at 232p, 104p above the 128p price where trading was suspended before the announcement last month of the deal to buy the Magnet kitchen and joinery company. The Pounds 56m reverse takeover, which is to be financed by a 1-for-2 rights issue at 120p, was approved by Berisford shareholders at a special meeting on Monday. The volume oftrading was high at 33.1m of the existing shares and 12.5m of the rights shares. This included the placing of some shares held by the Pritzker's - Berisford directors and substantial shareholders - and the whole of the 3.6 per cent stake in the company held by Compagnie Noga, a Swiss group. The shares were placed by Hoare Govett, the broker, at 215p. It is understood that Associated British Foods, which held a 17.9 per cent stake, had sold some of its rights but was planning to take up most of its entitlement.</p>

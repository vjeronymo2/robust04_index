			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (e)(1) For all purposes of Federal law, a Native Corporation shall be considered to be a corporation owned and controlled by Natives and a minority and economically disadvantaged business enterprise if the Settlement Common Stock of the corporation and other stock of the corporation held by holders of Settlement Common Stock and by Natives and descendants of Natives, represents a majority of both the total equity of the corporation and the total voting power of the corporation for the purposes of electing directors. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This rule would merely put the substance of this statutory provision into SBA's 8(a) regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Redesignated paragraph 124.112(c)(2)(iv) and paragraph 124.321(h)(2) are both amended to increase from two to five the number of 8(a) joint venture opportunities that an 8(a) tribally-owned concern is authorized to enter into with large business concerns. These amendments implement the change made to the Small Business act by Section 205 of Public Law 101&hyph;574, 104 Stat. 2814, 2819. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph 124.305(f) is amended to reflect an extension of the surety bond exemption authority from October 1, 1992 to October 1, 1994. This change is statutorily authorized by Section 206 of Public Law 101&hyph;574, 104 Stat. 2820. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 124.307 is amended by adding a new paragraph (e) and Section 124.311 is amended by adding a new paragraph (i) to authorize SBA to award a competitive 8(a) contract to a concern whose program term has expired if the concern was an eligible Program Participant on the date specified in the contract solicitation for the receipt of offers. The change in &sect;124.307 recognizes the authority established in &sect;124.311(i) as an exception to the general requirement that an 8(a) contract can be awarded only to a concern that is still a current Program Participant on the date of contract award. These changes are necessary to take into account the statutory revisions made by Section 207 of Public Law 101&hyph;574, 104 Stat. 2820. Consistent with these changes, with current &sect;19.805&hyph;2(c) of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and with current SBA policy, &sect;124.311(f)(4) is also amended to state that eligibility in the competitive 8(a) context is to be determined as of the date of a Participant's submission of its initial offer which includes price. In other words, so long as a firm was eligible on the date that it submitted its initial offer which included price, it would remain eligible despite changes in circumstances prior to award. So long as the award of the contract would be within the Participant's approved support level on the date that it submits its initial offer which includes price, the receipt of additional 8(a) contract support after that date and prior to award would not affect the concern's support level eligibility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph 124.311(f)(4) also is amended to make SBA's regulations consistent with the FAR in connection with eligibility determinations for competitive 8(a) awards. While it is SBA's view that because SBA is the agency charged with the responsibility of implementing the Small Business Act, including the 8(a) program, its regulations take precedence over the FAR in all matters interpreting the Small Business act, SBA believes that the FAR's approach to eligibility determinations in the context of negotiated procurements is the better approach. The change to SBA's regulations is needed to clear up the confusion that exists with procuring agency contracting officers and SBA personnel that are attempting to implement conflicting provisions of the FAR and SBA's regulations. SBA's regulations had permitted a procuring agency to submit all offerors within the competitive range. Under the approach taken by the FAR, and adopted in this rule by SBA, in a negotiated competitive 8(a) procurement, the procuring agency would submit to SBA for an eligibility determination only the 8(a) offeror determined by the procuring agency to be the apparent successful offeror. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SBA believes that the revised rule is more consistent with the way size eligibility is determined in the small business set-aside context. In that area, when requested by the procuring agency contracting officer, SBA will determine the size eligibility only of the apparent successful offeror, not of some broader group of offerors. For 8(a) competitive requirements, if the apparent successful offeror is found to be ineligible, SBA then would go to the second highest ranked offeror, and so on, until an eligible 8(a) Participant was found. This rule would not preclude procuring agencies from sending a list of highest to lowest ranked Participants as determined by the procuring agency, but it would limit SBA's eligibility determination to one firm at a time until an eligible offeror was determined. Because this provision is a procedural rule, it is adopted as a final rule without the necessity of a proposed rule and an opportunity for public comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph 124.321(h)(3) is amended by changing the sunset date for authorizing 8(a) joint ventures between tribally-owned 8(a) concerns and large businesses from September 30, 1991 to September 30, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph 124.601(c) is amended by changing the reference to the procedures for size protests for the Department of Defense's Small Disadvantaged Business program from ``&sect;121.9'' to ``&sect;&sect;121.1601&hyph;121.1608.'' The reference to &sect;121.9 contained in &sect;124.601(c) is a reference to the procedures relating to size protests and requests for size determinations. At the time &sect;124.601(c) was added to SBA's regulations, &sect;121.9 was entitled ``Protest of small business status.'' 13 CFR 121.9 (1989). When SBA's size regulations were amended in December 1989, see 54 Fed. Reg. 52634 (Dec. 21, 1989), the reference in &sect;124.601(c) was not correspondingly changed. The substance of former &sect;121.9 is currently contained in &sect;&sect;121.1601 through 121.1608. These sections are now entitled ``Procedures for Size Protests and Requests for Formal Size Determinations.'' 13 CFR 121.1601&hyph;121.1608 (1993). Thus, this change merely updates the citation to SBA's size protest procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] President Yasir 'Arafat [Abu-'Ammar] today sent  a cable of support to the participants in the conference of the  International Union of Journalists [IUJ] convened since  yesterday at the National Hotel in occupied Jerusalem. [passage  omitted]    Brother President Abu-'Ammar said that the press has never  played such an important role in an international issue such as  the role it has played in the Palestinian cause and the Middle  East crisis over the last three decades. This was due to the  region's sensitivity and importance compared with other parts of  the world and the peoples of the world, a factor that explains  the need to deal with the peace process in objectivity and  justice, so as to reach a just solution guaranteeing our  people's inalienable rights, freedom and independence.    President 'Arafat called on the conferees to support the  peace process and our people's efforts to build their national  institutions, economic structure and infrastructure so that they  can feel and enjoy the fruits of peace and look forward to a  promising future in which stability, security and cooperation  prevails between all the countries and peoples of the Middle  East.    'Arafat stressed that the Palestinian National Authority,  which was formed a few days ago to manage our people's affairs  until free and open general elections are held, is committed to  its obligations regarding peace and the freedom of the  individual, the freedom of thought, the freedom of work and the  freedom of the press for the sake of a real interaction in the  open Palestinian society. [passage omitted]    It is worth mentioning that this conference, the first of  its  kind to be held in Jerusalem, will be held over three days at  the invitation of the League of Arab Journalists and the  International Journalists' Union to discuss the challenges  facing Palestinian journalists. A number of journalists are  unable to attend because of the closure of Jerusalem.  Journalists also suffer from imprisonment, beatings and bans as  occupation authorities still think with a mentality of  occupation and not one of neighborliness; the proof is the  closure of Jericho and Gaza and Jerusalem, brother Sai'd  'Uraykat said. Furthermore there are the increasing practices  of the settlers and the army against our people.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The barges used on inland waterways cannot be used on the open ocean. Hence ethanol destined for East Coast or West Coast markets must be transferred to ocean-going freighters or tankers. Nevertheless, based on conversations with New Orleans port officials, current shipping capacity should be more than adequate to supply the shipping requirements demanded by today's rule. Transportation from the Gulf to either Coast is expected to cost 5&hyph;7 cents per gallon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Not all the ethanol shipped from the Midwest to other markets would have to be shipped by ocean-going vessels, however, since some of the ethanol could be used in ether plants located in the Gulf area to produce ETBE, which then would be blended into gasoline and shipped by pipeline to markets in Texas, the Midwest, or the East Coast. Pipelines are considered the most economical method of transporting liquids, and the costs of shipping ETBE to RFG markets by pipeline would be comparable to the costs of shipping MTBE to such markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the averaging and trading provisions incorporated into today's action can be used to limit to some extent the amount of oxygenate transportation that is necessary. As much as 12 percentage points out of the total 30% renewable oxygenate requirement could theoretically be met with ethanol blended in the Midwest RFG markets where transportation constraints are limited, and the credits traded to refiners marketing RFG in more distant markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the foregoing analysis (which is discussed more fully in the RIA), EPA does not believe that transportation presents a bottleneck to implementation of today's rule, although there are cost implications. Furthermore, EPA did not receive any comments suggesting that transportation would present implementation problems for the renewable oxygenate rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 8. Storage and Blending Capacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Given sufficient production of ethanol and adequate transportation from the point of production to their final markets, the remaining lead-time issue is that associated with adequate ethanol storage and blending capacity at the terminals where it is blended with gasoline. When the ethanol is offloaded at its end-use market, it must be stored in large terminal storage tanks. The capacity of these tanks must be sufficient to offload the entire shipment. Once offloaded, the ethanol then must be blended with gasoline. Some terminals splash-blend ethanol with essentially no additional equipment or facilities, while others use more sophisticated blending equipment. EPA did not receive comments of a nature sufficient to evaluate the adequacy or inadequacy of current ethanol storage and blending facilities. In order to determine whether adequate storage and blending capacity to support the renewable oxygenates program exists, EPA estimated the storage and blending capacity being used to meet the current demand for ethanol in the RFG areas and compared that with the storage and blending capacity that would be necessary to meet the program requirements. In order to estimate the current storage and blending capacity, EPA examined the peak monthly ethanol blending rates reported by IRI for each RFG market during 1993. EPA extrapolated this peak blending rate over the entire non-VOC control season to estimate the current blending capacity available to support the renewable oxygenate program. The results of this analysis are shown in the following table.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

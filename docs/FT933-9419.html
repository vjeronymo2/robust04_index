			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / International Company News: Papermakers turn over a new leaf  -Gordon Cramb examines a Japanese industry which is attracting trade authority scrutiny as it consolidates OJI PAPER, the pre-war giant of Japanese papermaking, is having to shrink a bit in order to grow again. As a downturn in prices and demand prompts a consolidation in the industry, which like others was broken up during the US occupation, the country's paper market is attracting the attention of trade authorities in Washington and Tokyo. Oji and Jujo Paper, which was spun off from it in 1949 as part of the dismantling of the zaibatsu industrial groups, have in the past year embarked on mergers with other producers in an attempt to tackle overcapacity. In April, Jujo joined with Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp to become Nippon Paper Industries, and Oji is to unite in October with Kanzaki Paper to form New Oji Paper. The two combines will vie for leadership of the industry. Analysts see modest advantages in the moves. A larger group will be able to concentrate operations on the more efficient of its mills while being better able to shift production around the country to minimise transport costs, says Mr Masato Makiyama, of Salomon Bros in Tokyo. Significant job cuts, however, may be achievable only over time, if at all. Oji has recently announced several divestments, which it said were designed to avoid falling foul of the country's anti-trust law. New Oji will, within two to three years, reduce its stakes in Japan Pulp and Paper and Daiei Papers, two companies which trade in paper and which would each do more than one-third of their business with the merged group. The move comes at the behest of Japan's Fair Trade Commission (FTC). In the case of Japan Pulp and Paper, which has a first section Tokyo listing, a 5 per cent holding in the company would be sold - at the current market price it would yield some Y4.9bn (Dollars 47m). New Oji would still own more than 11 per cent of the company. Last month, Oji said it would divest production of certain quality coated papers to meet monopolies requirements before the merger. It is transferring production facilities and marketing rights for two types of specialist paper, used for magazine and book covers, to Chuetsu Pulp and Paper, in which Oji is the biggest shareholder with 7.6 per cent. A final sale to Chuetsu, the 12th biggest papermaker, would take place after three or four years. Kanzaki has specialised in coated papers, in which it has a larger market share than Oji. Together, they account for more than one-quarter of the domestic market in that sector, a level which would attract regulatory scrutiny. The FTC said a remaining issue was Oji's stake in Chuetsu, which should eventually be sold - in the market the value of the holding is about Y4bn. In the meantime, Oji had expressed willingness not to use its position to attempt to influence the smaller producer. Oji also said it planned no further disposals. Mr George Bush put the Japanese paper market on the agenda for the first time during his visit to Tokyo as US presidentlast year, maintaining that US producers faced barriers to market entry. One swift result was that foreign companies were given more than one-third of the orders for telephone directory paper placed by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the semi-privatised telecoms giant. Jujo, as a result, missed out on sales put by one estimate at Y5bn. The distribution companies also agreed to strengthen trading ties with foreign producers, which have hitherto accounted for less than 4 per cent of the Japanese market, with sales largely of low value-added products. Although transport costs and the just-in-time delivery requirements of Japanese printing companies are thought likely to continue to inhibit foreign companies some fear the Clinton administration may press for numerical targets on imports, as in some other industries. For domestic producers, such a move could hardly come at a worse time.</p>

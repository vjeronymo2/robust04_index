			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Arts: Today's Television Glancing through the television schedules, it looks like an excellent night for going to the cinema or theatre. If you are in London you could try for 'The Pocket Dream', a funnyish disaster drama with Mike McShane and Sandi Toksvig failing to present 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'. If elsewhere you could look for a cinema showing 'Basic Instinct' with Michael Douglas playing the police detective infatuated with a bisexual suspect played by Sharon Stone. The first two minutes are horrifically violent, but the rest is like good latterday Hitchcock, though sexier than he would have dared. If you are forced to stay at home, radio is your best bet. A relay of tonight's concert at the Barbican begins at 7.45 on Radio 3. The Chamber Orchestra Of Europe plays a Mozart overture and Schubert's fifth symphony, with Schumann's piano concerto in A minor between, soloist Andras Schiff. The panellists on Any Questions? (8.05 R4) include Peter Riddell, formerly political correspondent on the FT, now columnist for The Times. In the Radio 2 Arts Programme John Timpson looks at what is happening in East Anglia (10.00).</p>

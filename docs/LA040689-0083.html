			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  LET'S EAT OUT: SHARING STUDIO CITY'S CULINARY GOOD FORTUNE  </P> <P> "I think there's this print shop somewhere in New Jersey that makes up the  menus for Chinese restaurants all over the country," said a friend as she  perused the offerings at Fortune West in Studio City. True, the menu reads a  lot like umpteen others, but that provides a good basis for the reviewer to  make comparisons.  </P> <P> Take the pan-fried meat dumplings. Those at Fortune West have considerably more  filling than most I've encountered elsewhere. The same is true of the plump  little steamed shrimp shu mai, and both appetizers have well-flavored fillings.  </P> <P> So does another of the dim sum selections, the minced chicken with lettuce. It  typifies two of this restaurant's best features -- attractive presentation and  tableside service. Our waiter expertly tossed the chicken and rice noodle  filling tableside, then spooned it into the crisp lettuce cups and left hoisin  sauce for us to drizzle over before rolling them up.  </P> <P> On another visit we were impressed by how attractively the ingredients for  spring pancakes were arranged for presentation. Again our waitress tossed the  chicken, egg, carrot, cucumber, bean sprouts and cilantro tableside and deftly  rolled them inside the thin Chinese pancakes.  </P> <P> The chef's specialities portion of Fortune West's menu features their Hunan and  Sichuan cuisine. While the Sichuan hot sesame noodles are served cold, an ample  amount of chili sauce makes them a fiery accent to some of the milder menu  selections. The sizzling beef, sauteed in honey sauce, is another recommended  choice among the spicy dishes.  </P> <P> Good contrasting selections include the orange-flavored chicken salad, a nice  variation of the old favorite. The menu listed shrimp with mushrooms, snow peas  and broccoli as separate items, but when we requested a combination, they  gladly obliged with another mild-flavored winner.  </P> <P> Admittedly this is an Americanized Chinese restaurant, but I did find it  disappointing that you needed to request chopsticks. One friend, just back from  two weeks in Hong Kong, also pointed out our dinner-size plates. "You would  never see any larger than the size of American salad plates in a restaurant  over there," she commented.  </P> <P> Fortune West differs from many Chinese restaurants in that it offers a full bar  and a 25-selection wine list that includes four Champagnes and sparkling wines,  a dozen white, two blush and seven red wines. Prices range from $12 to $30.  There is also a selection of house wines by the glass; sake is available by the  jug, plum wine by the glass.  </P> <P> The bar, with 13 stools and four tiny tables, divides the restaurant's two  dining rooms. One dining area is designated no smoking, the other has four  smoking tables. The overall color scheme is mauve and gray, with black accents  and very subtle lighting in the evening. A large expanse of windows lets in  plenty of light during the day and the shrubs outside, decorated with white  twinkle lights, become a part of the evening charm.  </P> <P> No desserts are offered, but almond and fortune cookies are presented with the  check. I guess the plastic wrappers keep them fresh, but serving an unwrapped  version would seem more in keeping with the overall quality of this restaurant.  </P> <P> Finding Fortune West can be a bit of a challenge because a maze of buildings  block it from the view of anyone driving along Ventura Boulevard. But it's  worth the effort to seek it out at the back of Gaslight Alley shopping plaza  just east of Coldwater Canyon Boulevard.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fortune West, 12733 Ventura Blvd., Studio City, (818) 760-3867.

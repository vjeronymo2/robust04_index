Therefore, pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; the Council on Environmental Quality Final Regulations (40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508); and the U.S. Section's Operational Procedures for Implementing Section 102 of NEPA, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  September 2, 1981 (46 FR 44083&hyph;44094); the USIBWC hereby gives notice that an environmental impact statement will not be prepared for the proposed action. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Dr. Conrad G.

The gas well is proposed to be located on privately owned land within the Main Floodway of the USIBWC LRGFCP approximately 8 kilometers (5 miles) southeast of the town of Pharr. Access to the drilling site is by way of existing county and private roads. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives Considered <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three alternatives were considered in the Environmental Assessment (EA): <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Proposed Action Alternative is for Quisto to construct, operate, and maintain a gas well in a cultivated field within the Main Floodway of the USIBWC LRGFCP. This proposed action will require the USIBWC to issue a license to ensure that such works do not cause an obstruction to flood flows within the floodway or interfere with the operation and maintenance of the LRGFCP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The No Action Alternative is for Quisto to not construct, operate, and maintain a gas well within the Main Floodway of the LRGFCP. The no action alternative will not require the USIBWC to issue a license since no work will be done within the LRGFCP. The no action alternative will result in the denial of access to the mineral owner to rightfully owned minerals, loss of tax revenues to the State of Texas, and result in an unrecoverable clean energy source. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Directional Well Alternative is for Quisto to drill a well from outside the Main Floodway to a depth below the proposed surface location. The directional well alternative will not require the USIBWC to issue a license since no work will be done within the LRGFCP. The directional well alternative is considered not workable because of a lack of an available surface drillsite outside the Main Floodway and technical problems associated with a bottomhole location some 610 meters (2,000 feet) or more from the surface location. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

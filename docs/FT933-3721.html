			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Arts: Tippett goes West - New York City Opera BRITTEN'S operas are as much part of the repertory in New York as they are in London, but of Tippett's, none had been professionally staged here until last Thursday, when City Opera introduced 'The Midsummer Marriage' as the first new production of its 50th anniversary season. Instant impressions were gladdening. As the front curtain lifted, the music seemed at home here. Christopher Keene, the company's driving force as general director and conductor, had the orchestral introduction going with enthusiasm: the accelerating pulse and the fizzing lines, full of promise, gave us a Broadway Tippett - a valid slant on a composer for whom American music of all sorts has seemed vital and refreshing and democratic. This was going to be some show. Unfortunately the orchestra's excitedness remained its only virtue. That rough vigour offered some continuing hope when rhythms were smudged or coarsened, as they so often were; it wore a bit thin when the violins kept sounding strained in music that ought to be tense only with athletic achievement. A cruel, mocking fate it is that goes on placing supreme and difficult 20th-century scores - 'Moses und Aron' in 1990, 'Die Soldaten' in 1991, 'Doktor Faust' last year - in the hands of musicians so ill-equipped or ill-prepared to do them justice. The cast was dodgy too. Dennis McNeil had the springing tone necessary for Mark's lyrical effusions, but Nina Warren as Jenifer had vibrato problems, especially in high-flying passages. Jan Opalach was also below his best as King Fisher. He came through to a strong resolve at the end, but before that this capitalist-materialist had seemed a weedy sort of threat. Most effective - perhaps this has to be so - were the secondary pair: Elizabeth Futral was neatly in tune with Bella's line and demeanour, and Brad Cresswell was a gentle-voiced Jack. Francesca Zambello's production, designed by Kevin Rupnik, was much milder than one had been led to expect by other work of hers and by the advance publicity. We were promised a 'Midsummer Marriage' resituated in the American West, but all this meant was that the acting space was surrounded by drapes showing monochrome views of Monument Valley, that three Native American symbols (earth, sky, sun) arrived in neon lights, and that the Ancients looked like Mormon settlers. The chorus, in soft-shaded modern clothes, could have belonged anywhere at any time in the last half-century or so. One sensed budgetary constraint more than creative rethinking: the look was bald. There was not much magic. Where the musical images suggest a European tradition of the enchanted wood, here was a stark empty space. Dappled flutes, distant horn calls and paeans to the sun have little to do with the deserts of Arizona and New Mexico, and though of course those places have their own sacredness, it is a sacredness of space, and not aptly conveyed at all by a curtained-off square. There was no sense that the transformation of the central couple was coming about through an immersion in nature and ancientness. Rather it seemed to be engineered, in some obscure way, by the dancers. Zambello had Mark and Jenifer appear several times in the second act, led on like zombies as the ritual dances proceeded. The hunting narratives specified by the composer were suspended: Susan Marshall's choreography was a more abstract display of youth and beauty, centred not on a solo male dancer but on a male-female pair, surrogates for the dumb principals. Action overtook allegory. Instead of being another view, the dancing was part of the same story, a story that ended not with the union of Mark and Jenifer but with that of Mark and the dancer Strephon, seated together in the middle of the stage as the music ended. This felt imposed and mean-spirited: distrustful of the opera's metaphor of marriage as a stabilisation and fulfilment of personality. Tippett is not dealing with a Mark-Strephon whose two halves have to learn to admire one another, but with a Mark-Jenifer whose two halves must learn to understand one another. Still, the composer looked delighted to be on the New York stage at last, joining the cast for curtain-calls in a dapper but, for him, restrained outfit of pink bow tie, light blue jacket, mid-blue trousers and casual white shoes. There are three further performances during the next three weeks.</p>

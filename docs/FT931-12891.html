			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Council launches policy on racial equality COMPANIES supplying Newcastle upon Tyne City Council with goods or services will be barred from using informal recruitment methods and will have to advertise all vacancies under a scheme for racial equality in employment launched today. The policy, which the council insists will benefit companies by encouraging good management practice, will also oblige all its contractors to have a written racial equality policy statement and to monitor how many employees are from ethnic minorities. Those responsible for recruitment in businesses employing more than 25 people will have to undergo racial equality training at their company's expense. Those employing more than 250 people will be required to take positive action to encourage applications if detailed monitoring discloses under-representation of any ethnic group. The council, which spends more than Pounds 100m a year with contractors, believes the scheme is necessary to give equal chance of employment for all its residents. Newcastle's ethnic minorities total 4.1 per cent of the population. Council legal advisers are satisfied the scheme does not exceed powers available under the 1976 Race Relations Act and 1988 Local Government Act. The council says it is demanding no more than companies should already be doing under the law. Companies bidding for work, including the 600 on the standing list, will have to answer six questions satisfactorily, laid down by the environment secretary in 1988, on their racial equality policy and practice. Once awarded a contract, they must then satisfy the council's own more stringent conditions. Any which fail to do so cannot be forced to forfeit the contract, but will be barred from further tendering. The Association of Metro-politan Authorities and the Commission for Racial Equality believe the scheme is the first of its kind. Mr Bob Tilmouth, chief executive of the Tyne and Wear Chamber of Commerce, said: 'The basic principles of racial equality and fairness are not in dispute at all but there are aspects of the bureaucracy implied behind this which will cause companies some concern when they're under pressure from the recession.' The council has also floated proposals for the creation by the British Standards Institute of a standard for open employment principles.</p>

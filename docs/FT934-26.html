			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold and base metals higher but coffee tumbles The London gold and base metals markets moved towards 1994 in confident mood yesterday, but coffee futures tumbled. At the bullion market, follow-through from overnight strength in New York pushed the gold price to a 5-month high of Dollars 392.50 a troy ounce at one stage, before it closed at USDollars 390.50, up Dollars 3.80 on the day. Dealers told the Reuter news agency that the market was still on course to get through resistance at Dollars 392 and to re-establish a price above Dollars 400 an ounce, although that would have to wait till January. Christmas cheer was prolonged at the London Metal Exchange, meanwhile, as traders looked forward to an upturn in global economic activity and reductions in excess production capacity in the new year. The three months delivery copper price added Dollars 22.75 to Wednesday's Dollars 22.25-a-tonne advance before profit-taking trimmed it back to Dollars 1,828.50 a tonne, up Dollars 6, at the close. But lead held on to its gains, the three months price closing at a 13 1/2 -month high, just 50 cents short of the Dollars 500-a-tonne mark. Zinc, tin and nickel price changes were also securely in the plus column and the only LME contract to end down on the day was aluminium, the three months price surrendering Dollars 2 of Wednesday's Dollars 17.25 rise at Dollars 1,137.50 a tonne. The London Commodity Exchange's coffee futures market presented a very different picture. Taking their cue from the extremely weak overnight tone in New York, sellers were quickly on to the offensive and by the close the March futures position was quoted at Dollars 1,189 a tonne, down Dollars 43 on the day. 'This is just mirroring what happened in New York last night,' one trader told Reuter. 'It was purely a technical move.' Another suggested that the New York contract's failure to breach the 80 cents-a-pound barrier had 'left the market looking at the technicals. . . and they were starting to look less positive'. Most agreed, however, that background fundamentals remained positive.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] "The situation is worse than was thought.  Without a very wide-ranging commitment by a number of  governments, European and non-European, the Rwandan crisis will  widen." This was said by the Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs,  Franco Rocchetta, in Nairobi, where he was brought back by the  UN plane which was forced to return to the Kenyan capital from  Rwandan shelling in Kigali.    Rocchetta added that the Italian Government must remain  neutral with regard to both ethnic groups involved in the  fighting. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> HIT-RUN DRIVER KILLS PEDESTRIAN  </P> <P> A 39-year-old woman was killed Thursday when she was struck by a hit-and-run  driver as she crossed a street in Orange, police said.  </P> <P> Officers said they are seeking the public's help in finding the driver who sped  away after he ran his vehicle into Rosa Alvarez Calletano of Orange at about  6:15 a.m. while she was walking in the crosswalk on Tustin Street at Adams  Avenue.  </P> <P> Orange police Sgt. Art Romo said police do not have a description of the driver  or the car that struck the woman.  </P> <P> Calletano's death caused a major traffic tie-up as officers converged to  investigate the scene. Tustin Street, a major north-south thoroughfare near the  Mall of Orange and parallel to the Costa Mesa Freeway, was closed during  morning rush hours between Katella Avenue and Collins Avenue.  </P> <P> "Cars (were) being rerouted back onto the freeway or into the residential  streets around that section" of Tustin Street, Romo said.  </P> <P> Investigators were hoping to find a witness to the accident, Romo said. He  asked that anyone with information contact Detective Jim Pyne at (714) 532-0629  or the Orange Police Department desk at (714) 532-0365.  </P></p>

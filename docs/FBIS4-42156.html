			<p>BFN     [Text] The government of Silvio Berlusconi is facing the  bitterest criticism, as far as foreign policy is concerned, from  its partners in the European Union [EU] and from its neighbors  in the former Yugoslavia.    The veto imposed yesterday by Foreign Minister Antonio  Martino on the inclusion of Slovenia on the waiting list to join  the EU provoked a bitter reaction from Slovenian Foreign  Minister Lojze Peterle. He said it would be difficult to have  good relations with Italy. Croatian President Franjo Tudjman  was also harsh. He said Croatia was faced with a renewed  Italian imperialism.    France and, above all, Germany support Croatia and Slovenia.  However, the Italian Government prefers to concentrate on the  positive aspects of the meetings Martino had yesterday. The  minister stressed he had received an invitation to visit Croatia.    There is also the diffidence of the European partners  because  of the presence of members of the National Alliance in the  government. On 30 May the welcoming ceremony for the minister of  posts, Giuseppe Tatarella, will be boycotted by Belgian Deputy  Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo, who said he would not shake hands  with a neofascist.    Finally there is also great embarrassment in light of the  forthcoming visit to Rome by President Bill Clinton. Because of  his role as chairman of the Chamber of Deputies foreign affairs  committee, Mirko Tremaglia from the Italian Social Movement  could be invited to the luncheon scheduled to be held at the  Quirinale Palace on 3 June. This promises to be the most  delicate moment in the whole trip.</p>

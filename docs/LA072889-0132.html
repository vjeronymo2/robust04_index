			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PHILIP GLASS TO TEACH AT CAL STATE ARTS FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Composer Philip Glass will talk about his music and the collaborative elements  of text and musical composition this weekend at Humboldt State as part of  California State University's fourth annual Summer Arts Program.  </P> <P> Sponsored by the 20 Cal State campuses, the monthlong arts festival on the  Arcata campus features professional performances and instruction by artists in  the fields of theater, dance, music, visual arts, film/video, creative writing  and new technology.  </P> <P> The schedule includes workshops in chamber music, master classes in baroque  flute, and demonstrations in sculpture firing and environmental dance. Guest  artists include the Limon Dance Company, sculptor Italo Scanga, New York  Metropolitan soprano Marvis Martin and saxophonist John Sampen.  </P> <P> More than 100 guest artists, faculty members and as many as 550 students have  participated in this year's program.  </P> <P> "It has been extremely well received this year. We're now attracting students  from all over the country and the world," said Diane Vines, executive director  of CSU's Summer Program. When the festival started in 1986, 350 enrolled, she  said.  </P> <P> Vines points to the variety of disciplines offered and the small  teacher/student ratio as reasons behind their success: "Our program is quite  unusual. We offer something unique for people on the West Coast. We provide  what most people do in one year in only one month. The interaction is more  intense than a lecture or a workshop. Students also get a chance to study with  people they never could have studied with otherwise."  </P> <P> The Garth Fagan Bucket Dance group will perform Saturday and the Fine Arts  Brass Quintet will play Sunday. The festival ends Aug. 5. NICOLE ATKINSON  </P></p>

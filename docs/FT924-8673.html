			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Arts: Today's Television Channel 4's art and culture magazine programme Without Walls (9.00) looks into the origins of the Volkswagen Beetle which it describes as 'Hitler's baby' and 'a symbol of Nazism'. It seems that Hitler handed his own sketches for the car to Ferdinand Porsche, who is generally credited as its creator. Second half of the programme is devoted to the design of sports stadiums. Kinsey (9.30 BBC1) is another of those law series which is about marriage, children, drugs, almost anything but the law, really. In the title role Leigh Lawson has a wonderful time wearing a Clint Eastwood 'duster' coat while all sorts of women dance attendance upon him: ex-wife, doting secretary, new (spiffing redhead) partner. However, at the end of the last episode his daughter arrived at his office after being thrown out of school and the tables look ready for turning. Sir John Harvey-Jones begins Troubleshooter 2 by revisiting the firms which were the subjects of his first series (Morgan Cars, Churchill pottery, Tri-ang toys and so on). Later in this new series he will be offering his advice to six more businesses and organisations (9.45 BBC2).</p>

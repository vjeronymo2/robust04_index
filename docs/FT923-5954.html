			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / International Company News: Mayne Nickless reports 26% rise to ADollars 143.7m MAYNE Nickless, the Australian transport, security and health group, yesterday reported a 26 per cent increase in equity accounted net profit of ADollars 143.7m (USDollars 102.1m) for the year to the end of June. The result included abnormal profit of ADollars 54m before tax, largely reflecting the sale of its cross-shareholding in Amcor, the Australian packaging and paper group. Net operating profit after minority interests but before abnormal items was down 3.2 per cent to ADollars 99m on turnover down 4.4 per cent to ADollars 2.8bn, reflecting the Amcor disposal. Mayne Nickless described the result as 'steady' in the light of poorer trading conditions which had put pressure on prices and margins in spite of generally steady volumes. Revenue increased nearly 9 per cent by the acquisition of Metropol Security Services, Interlink Express, a UK parcels company, and full ownership of Hospital Corporation Australia . The board said reduced earnings from Australian express freight activities were offset by improved contributions from healthcare businesses, express freight in the UK and security services in the UK and Canada. European earnings jumped 150 per cent before interest and tax to ADollars 29m, sparking an increase of 80 per cent in non-Australian earnings to ADollars 46m. An unchanged final dividend of 17.5 cents per share, fully franked, was declared, making a total of 35 cents, equivalent to 34.7 cents adjusted for a one-for-five February rights issue.</p>

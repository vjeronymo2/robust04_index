			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Recovery 'slowed by European recession' THE ECONOMIC recovery will be 'patchy and anaemic' because of recession in continental Europe, says Oxford Economic Forecasting. Weakness in the financial and construction sectors is also holding back growth, the UK-based independent consultancy says in its latest review of industrial prospects, published today. Mr John Walker, the group's chief economist, said: 'The sectoral impact of the recession has been unusual, to say the least.' The group says that the construction sector, which normally leads recovery, is still suffering from falling output 'mainly because of the excesses of the 1980s'. In spite of those warnings, the report expects a 'sustained recovery' with GDP growth of 1.9 per cent this year and 3.2 per cent next year, following falls in the past two years. In contrast to the forecasts of some other economists, the group predicts that the government's proposal to impose value added tax on domestic fuel in stages over the next three years will have a big effect on demand for fuel. The output of the fuels and water sector will be nearly 2 per cent lower in 1996, it says. The latest set of economic forecasts from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy and consultancy group, agrees that the recovery will be sluggish and patchy. The report, which blames the weakness on high consumer debt among other factors, expects slower growth than the Oxford forecasts - only 1.5 per cent this year and 2 per cent next year. Ms Rosemary Radcliffe, Coopers' head of economics, said that in the next 10 to 15 years even if Continental prospects improved, the emerging Asian markets would be the key to high growth.</p>

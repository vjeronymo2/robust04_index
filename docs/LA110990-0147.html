			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PSYCHIATRIST CALLS RAPE SUSPECT UNFIT FOR TRIAL  </P> <P> A former Beverly Hills policeman accused of raping an 11-year-old Irvine girl  suffers from manic depression, which for years has caused erratic behavior and  delusions that he is being pursued by enemies, a psychiatrist testified  Thursday.  </P> <P> Based on examinations he performed in July, Dr. Stephen M. Petty said Steven  Rush McCoy, 36, is not able to stand trial because he cannot recall his  whereabouts during the March 26 incident or help his attorney prepare a  defense.  </P> <P> Petty's testimony came during a pretrial hearing in Municipal Court in Newport  Beach, where a jury will decide whether McCoy is competent to stand trial.  </P> <P> McCoy, who worked for two years in the Beverly Hills Police Department in the  late 1970s, has pleaded not guilty to the charges of rape, sexual assault and  burglary.  </P> <P> Petty told the jury that during visits at the Orange County Jail, McCoy was  showing signs of manic behavior.  </P> <P> "He said that if he could just be released from jail, he could prove his  innocence like something in a TV show," Petty said. "There wasn't much emotion.  He wasn't able to connect with it (criminal charges). His ability to work with  his attorney is significantly impaired; his memory is impaired; his perceptions  are impaired."  </P> <P> In responding to questions by Deputy Dist. Atty. Debbie Lloyd, Petty said it  was possible McCoy possessed the ability to seduce medical professionals into  thinking he was incompetent to stand trial.  </P> <P> When the hearing resumes Wednesday, Lloyd said, she will ask Dr. Kaushal K.  Sharma, a Newport Beach psychiatrist, to present results of his examination of  McCoy which reportedly will indicate that the defendant is competent to stand  trial.  </P> <P> Lloyd said Sharma's examination was conducted July 8, one day after Petty's  examination.  </P> <P> McCoy was experiencing hallucinations while under his care in January of last  year, Petty said.  </P> <P> "He was believing people were trying to harm him," Petty said, adding that  McCoy was hospitalized for a month during that time. "These were actual beliefs  that could not be shaken."  </P> <P> In a jail interview shortly after his arrest, McCoy proclaimed his innocence,  telling reporters that law officers should "be looking for the suspect over at  the San Diego Zoo in the orangutan section."  </P> <P> "Whoever did this," he said then, "was an animal."  </P></p>

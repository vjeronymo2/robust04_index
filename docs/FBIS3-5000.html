According to materials submitted to the National Assembly by  the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy, the government  plans to widen the scope of the move into China after forming  the foundation through technological trainings on and advisory  support in building and operating nuclear power plants, aiming  at the ultimate goal of plant exports to China.    To achieve this goal, the government has decided to hasten  the conclusion of an ROK-PRC nuclear energy treaty, which is now  being negotiated, and as well as make efforts to conclude the  "ROK-PRC Industrial Cooperation Treaty," which will practically  back domestic companies' move into building nuclear power plants  in China, before the end of this year.    The government also plans to unify channels for this and  make  a single one to prevent excessive competition among domestic  companies in building nuclear power plants in China and to build  a complementary cooperation system. It also decided to seek  methods of forming a consortium with foreign professional  companies, if necessary.    If negotiations with China are being held smoothly, with  President Kim Yong-sam's China visit as a momentum, it will  become possible to promote this by field, such as plant and  system design (The Technology and Atomic Energy Institute of the  Korea Electric Power Corporation [KEPOC]), manufacturing of  machines and materials (Korea Heavy Industries and private  enterprises), operation and maintenance (KEPOC), and  construction (private enterprises).</p>

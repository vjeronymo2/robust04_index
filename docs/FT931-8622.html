			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Rhone-Poulenc foresees full privatisation after election RHONE-POULENC, the chemical group in which the French government holds a 43 per cent stake, yesterday raised the possibility that it would be fully privatised soon after the elections in March when the Socialist government is expected to be defeated. Mr Jean-Pierre Tirouflet, finance director, said that if, as he expected, the new government sold its entire stake, the privatisation would be worth between FFr12bn and FFr15bn (Pounds 1.9bn). He also raised the possibility of a simultaneous rights issue to reduce the group's debts, currently FFr33.7bn. Announcing Rhone-Poulenc's full-year results, Mr Jean Rene Fourtou, group chairman, warned that the state of the European economy was worse than during the 1973 oil shock and would show no signs of improvement until next year at the earliest. Operating income rose 8.1 per cent to FFr6.7bn but sales dropped 2.5 per cent to FFr81.7bn, with all divisions apart from health registering falls. Mr Fourtou predicted the group's profitability would increase over the next three years. Net debt to equity, which Rhone-Poulenc had predicted last year would fall to 70 per cent, rose to about 80 per cent, or FFr33.7bn. The group benefited from a fall in net interest payments from FFr3.4bn to FFr3.2bn. Operating profits from health activities increased 16 per cent to FFr5bn. Turnover rose only 4.2 per cent to FFr30.5bn, because of disposals and adverse exchange rates. The agrochemicals division saw operating profits fall from FFr1.2bn to FFr900m. In volume terms, sales fell 8 per cent following farmers' concerns about reforms of the EC's common agricultural policy. Mr Fourtou said the reforms could cut the size of the European agrochemical market by up to 30 per cent. The speciality chemicals division reported operating profits up from FFr100m to FFr600m on turnover of FFr14.4bn (FFr14.8bn). The organic and inorganic intermediates division saw a 5 per cent fall in prices and operating profits fell from FFr800m to FFr500m. Operating profits at the fibres and polymers division fell from FFr700m to FFr500m. Net earnings per ordinary share rose 24.7 per cent to FFr25.6. The group is paying a dividend of FFr18 (FFr15.75).</p>

Antic: "`Trepca' on Temporary Leave"] </F>   [Text] Pristina -- Milenko Ilic, general manager of  Trepca, has extended the 10-day New Year and Christmas holiday  for all employees of the Trepca corporation until 24 January,  and proclaimed that this temporary leave is "the first part of  the annual holidays."    So, instead of the promise given in the electoral campaign  that "Trepca would get back on its feet," the agony of the  largest and wealthiest company in Serbia continues. Yesterday,  the workers, instead of returning to the mines, smeltery,  refineries, and factories, had to return home, because the  general manager had informed them that there were no raw  materials, spare parts, protective agents, or reagents necessary  for production. Until further notice, that is, according to the  manager's current assessment at least until 24 January, the  following Trepca mines will be closed: the mine in Stari Trg,  "Kisnica," "Novo Brdo," and "Kopaonik" in Leposavic. The lead  and zinc metallurgy plants, the entire chemical industry, and  the Center for Research and Development will also be closed.    The only employees still working are the clerks who draw up  inventories of property, calculate salaries, and sign annual  holiday requests. Also working are the work organizers  [organizatori posla].    Ilic, the general manager, did not elaborate on his  decision,  although everyone expected that Trepca would be the very one to  "get back on its feet" not only in Kosmet [Kosovo and Metohija]  but in the entire Serbian economy. Such promises were also  given by the Serbian Government, which spent a lot of time  thinking about Trepca. However, judging by everything, the aid  did not come because, according to Ilic, Trepca has no chance of  resuming production.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Republican Council of the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] held a session at Stara Lesna in the  High Tatras today. It discussed the current political  situation, preparation for the parliamentary elections, and  coalition cooperation. Our correspondent Pavol Sveton is on the  line to report from there:    [Sveton] [passage omitted] HZDS Deputy Chairman Sergej  Kozlik  said that the HZDS was at present stronger than in 1992.  Following an agreement with the Farmers Party of Slovakia  [Rolnicka Strana Slovenska--RSS] on election coalition  cooperation, the HZDS also counts on cooperation with the Slovak  National Party [SNS], provided it passes the election threshold,  as well as with the KDH [Christian Democratic Movement] and the  Party of the Democratic Left [SDL]. The HZDS is open to the  option of cooperating with the Association of the Workers of  Slovakia [Zdruzenie Robotnikov Slovenska], the Forum of Workers  [Forum Robotnikov], the Christian Social Union [KSU], and with  civic associations and interest groups in districts--such as the  Union of Antifascist Fighters. The HZDS also considers possible  cooperation with the New Slovakia movement.    At a news conference today, it was said that an election  program was currently being drafted. It should be ready in  three weeks' time and be capable of addressing every single  citizen and individual region of Slovakia. [passage omitted]</p>

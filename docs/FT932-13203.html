			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Mayhew hints at new Ulster talks A POLITICAL settlement in Northern Ireland should not be based on simple majority rule - and, if backed locally, needs to allow for future Irish unification, Sir Patrick Mayhew, secretary of state for the province, said yesterday. In the first hints of proposals aimed at kick-starting talks on the province, Sir Patrick also envisaged greater co-operation between political institutions in north and south Ireland. Speaking at Liverpool University, he included energy and transport policies and water management as possible areas for co-operation. Sir Patrick hopes to re-start formal talks with Unionists, nationalists and the Irish government after the province's May 19 local elections. He is drawing up outline proposals as a starting point for talks - ending a near silence by the government on specifics of Northern Ireland policy since the first set of round-table talks three years ago. Sir Patrick balanced Unionist and nationalist aspirations and hinted strongly that he supports a central demand of Ulster Unionist MPs - a Northern Ireland select committee at Westminster. He also ruled out Britain and Ireland having joint political authority in Northern Ireland. The speech underlined the shift in Conservative thinking away from an overtly Unionist stance, towards a 'neutral' role. But his plans may revive Unionist fears that they have more influence to lose than gain from re-entering talks. The Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, called the proposals 'a framework for the betrayal' of the province. But Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, said he was encouraged by the speech while Mr John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance party, said the proposals displayed a sense of realism. Sir Patrick said government systems based on simple majority rule 'were not successful before and they would not be sufficiently acceptable now. Such a system in a divided society could simply not be relied on to provide a fair deal for both sides of the community or to command the allegiance of each.' He said the current status of Northern Ireland as part of the UK would not change without the consent of the province's population. But he added: 'Correspondingly, there is no prospect of an agreement precluding a politically united Ireland if, at some future date, the public's view should change.' He added there was a new 'intensity' behind public calls for the resumption of talks.</p>

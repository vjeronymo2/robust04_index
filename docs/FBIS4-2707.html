			<p>BFN     [Text] Fuzhou, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Eastern China's Fujian  Province is trying to woo more investment from Hong Kong, Macao  and Taiwan through improving its infrastructure facilities.    Wang Jianshuang, deputy-governor of the coastal province,  told some delegates to the provincial people's congress and  members of the provincial committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference today that Fujian is to carry  out preferential policies and upgrade its basic facilities and  industries so that overseas investors can reap best economic  returns in the province.    Continuous efforts will be made in the construction of the  Xiamen special economic zone, the Fuzhou bonded zone and  economic and technological development zones among others.    Investment in infrastructure sectors, including airports,  railways, ports, electricity power plants, water supply and  telecommunications, will be increased to 26.2 billion yuan, up  20.4 percent compared with last year.    In addition, he said, the province will offer legal services  for overseas investors and inquiry services on other issues of  concern such as foreign exchange reforms and tax reforms in  China.    He said that key sectors needing overseas investment include  infrastructure construction projects, agriculture and the  transformation of state-owned enterprises and finance, commerce,  entertainment, information services and real estate.    The province is the home of many overseas Chinese. Figures  from the provincial government show that there are eight million  overseas Chinese who originally lived in the province. About 80  percent of Taiwanese originated from Fujian.    By the end of March, a total of 13,543 foreign-funded  enterprises were approved, with a contractual investment volume  of 24.4 billion U.S. dollars. Actual investment reached 6.6  billion U.S. dollars, about one-tenth of China's total overseas  investment.</p>

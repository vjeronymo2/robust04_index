Asked by  journalists at Warsaw military airport whether his "propaganda  offensive" has changed the position of western states, the  president replied: "I think that no more can be done after the  NATO summit in Brussels." The president added that world public  opinion "should exert greater pressure on politicians not to  repeat the same mistakes." "There are opportunities which have  to be taken, agreements which have to be kept," the president  said, adding that he hopes that in Prague "we do more for a more  secure and more human future."</p>

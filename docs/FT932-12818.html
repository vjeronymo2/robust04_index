			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Daf Vans sets turnover goal LEYLAND Daf Vans expects to achieve a turnover of about Pounds 150m in its first year of operation, Mr Allan Amey, chief executive, said yesterday. The company, which was acquired at the weekend through a management buy-out from the Leyland Daf administrative receivers, is forecasting annual output of about 12,000 vehicles compared with 20,099 last year. Mr Amey said the contraction of the van operations and the shedding of more than half of its workforce in receivership had reduced its break-even level to an output of less than 10,000 vans a year. The venture capital group 3i said yesterday that it had provided about Pounds 6.5m of equity finance for the buy-out with an additional Pounds 500,000 coming from management and employees. It emerged yesterday that the buy-out plan had run into serious difficulties last week, when at a late stage Lloyds Development Capital withdrew its offer to provide Pounds 1.5m in equity to the venture. The Lloyds share was provided by 3i, which plans to seek other partners to share part of its present risk. The other main elements of the Leyland Daf Vans financial package include: Working capital and a medium-term bank loan of more than Pounds 7m provided by Royal Bank of Scotland. Financing of up to Pounds 20m from United Dominions Trust, a subsidiary of TSB Bank. UK state aid of Pounds 9m. The Department of Trade and Industry is making regional selective assistance grants of Pounds 5m, while the Department of the Environment has funded the Pounds 4m purchase by the Birmingham Heartlands Development Corporation of 42 acres of surplus land at the van plant site.</p>

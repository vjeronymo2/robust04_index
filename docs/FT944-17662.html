			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Iraq monitoring starts in few days Monitoring systems and equipment for the long-term surveillance of Iraq's weapons industry are 'provisionally operational' and the UN monitoring programme will begin in a few days, Mr Rolf Ekeus, UN special envoy, said in Baghdad yesterday. Mr Ekeus' findings will be put formally to the UN Security Council on Monday. His report is likely to prompt debate and probable division among Security Council members over whether to give Iraq a definite timetable for a 'probationary' test of the system, at the end of which the Council would consider easing the four-year-old oil embargo. Iraqi officials warned after Mr Ekeus' departure that unless the Security Council meeting on October 10 directly led to an easing of sanctions, Baghdad would adopt a 'new attitude' towards the UN. A spokesman for the Revolutionary Command Council, Iraq's top political body, said that despite Iraq's compliance with UN Gulf war ceasefire resolutions, 'those of vicious purpose, among them the US, are bent on harming Iraq'. Adding that some UN countries wanted 'to continue the sanctions as long as possible, he said: 'We shall wait until the 10th of this month; after that every party will bear the consequences of its stand'. France, Russia, China and other members of the 15-strong Security Council favour giving Iraq a six-month trial period, arguing Iraq has made progress in meeting Gulf war ceasefire resolutions calling for control of its weapons industries. Britain and the US have said they would oppose just yet setting any criteria offering Iraq the prospect of lifting the oil sales ban.</p>

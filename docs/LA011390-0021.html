			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DECLINE OF DAN RATHER'S RATINGS AFTER THE BUSH INCIDENT  </P> <P> Rick Du Brow's Jan. 6 article on the decline of Dan Rather's ratings after his  1988 interview with then-candidate George Bush didn't quite tell it all: Rather  and his team of Bush haters such as Lesley Stahl and Bob Schieffer have carried  on the vendetta.  </P> <P> When Gen. Manuel Noriega was captured, Rather spent the last 10 minutes of his  show in a memorial to the dead in Panama, American and local, and a discussion  of all the bad things that occurred in Panama with not one statement of the  good things that came out of the U.S. action. This was the most biased,  dishonest type of reporting, and Rather was not criticized in the print medium  about doing it.  </P> <P> GEOFFREY POST, Santa Maria  </P></p>

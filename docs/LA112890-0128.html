			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY;  </P> <P> CARS FOR SALE CAN'T BE LEFT AT MALL, CITY SAYS  </P> <P> In an effort to keep parking lots from becoming used car lots on the weekends,  the City Council has adopted an ordinance prohibiting vehicles that are for  sale from being left on private property.  </P> <P> "The ordinance is geared to cars for sale that are parked in shopping centers,"  said Ray Kromer, assistant city manager.  </P> <P> "It's a big problem when there's 30 to 40 vehicles being left on the weekends,  making it look like a used car lot."  </P> <P> The police have been unable to get rid of the cars because until now, the  municipal code did not prohibit the practice.  </P> <P> The ordinance applies to vehicles parked without the property owner's  permission. Violators may be fined up to $1,000 and receive up to six months in  jail.  </P></p>

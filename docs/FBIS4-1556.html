			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhou Lixian (0719 4539 2009)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 3 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Ministry of Public  Security today held a news briefing on the "Regulations for  Security Protection of Computer information Systems" recently  promulgated by the State Council for implementation. The person  in charge of the Ministry's Computer Management and Supervision  Department said: The promulgation and implementation of these  regulations indicates that our work in security protection of  computer information systems is being institutionalized,  standardized, and modernized.    He said: Computerization has been introduced for both  economic development and social progress in China, as well as in  other countries. All trades and professions have successively  established a computer information system in a short time.  According to an incomplete statistics, more than 500,000  computer information systems [ji suan ji xin xi xi tong 6060  4615 2623 0207 1873 4762 4827] of various types have been in use  in various fields and departments of our country; and the trend  of sharp increase continues. Computer information systems have  become an important tool and means of scientific research,  production, business, and state administration.    He said: In the past, since there was no law or regulations  governing the security protection of computer information  systems, computer security was a very conspicuous problem. The  number of criminal cases involving the use of computers or  targeted at computer assets was rising. The largest amount of  money involved in a single computer crime was as high as 14  million yuan. Computer viruses were spreading widely, and they  were particularly serious in large and medium cities and in  regions open to the outside world. According to an investigation  conducted by the public security departments on some 40  computers across the country, 70 or 80 percent of them have been  infected by viruses in recent years. In some universities and  colleges, the computer virus infection rate was 100 percent. As  the computer virus attack has affected the work of many  departments and organizations, the security of computer  information systems is becoming more and more important.    He said: After these regulations came into force, the  Ministry of Public Security will, on the basis of past  experience, take a further step to raise its job skill level in  computer management and supervision, prevent violation of  regulations, and ensure impartiality in enforcing regulations.</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Lessons to learn in keeping the peace: The successful UN operation in Mozambique Over the next three months, UN peacekeeping operations will be drawing to a close in Mozambique and Somalia - the former a qualified success, the latter an unmitigated disaster. In Mozambique, 7,000 UN troops have overseen the implementation of a peace accord which ended a 17-year civil war, demobilised 75,000 combatants, and helped Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo) guerrillas organise themselves into a political party and contest peaceful elections. In Somalia, a much larger and costlier UN mission has been unable to restore peace to a nation shattered by clan warfare. The UN pullout from its fortified bunker in Mogadishu will be a dangerous and undignified affair. Attempts to make rival warlords talk peace have failed, and the UN has long since dropped the pretence of trying to control the armed factions battling for supremacy in the capital and its hinterland. But Mr Aldo Ajello, the tough Italian diplomat in charge of the UN's operation in Mozambique, does not believe in models. 'What worked in Mozambique will not necessarily work elsewhere,' he said in Maputo, as he prepared to leave for a well-earned rest. 'There was a real will to restore peace here. No-one can impose peace on a people who wish to continue fighting.' It was not as simple as that. Mr Ajello, who arrived in Mozambique two years ago, saw immediately that the agreement signed between Renamo and the Frelimo government would collapse under the pressure of the one-year timetable for demobilisation and elections. 'We had to introduce some flexibility into the calendar,' he recalls. 'The accord was too complex, there were not enough people to implement it, and the people were not good enough.' After 17 years of fighting, most Renamo leaders were not well versed in implementing peace, while the Frelimo government, in power since 1975, resented the loss of sovereignty implicit in the UN's tutelary role. 'We had to give time for both parties to overcome their distrust of each other, and we had to adapt the UN mission to the reality on the ground,' Mr Ajello says. The former enemies, however, dragged their feet over the demobilisation of their combatants. Mr Alfonso Dhlakama, the Renamo leader, kept his best men in the bush to strengthen his hand in political negotiations. The elections, rescheduled for October 1994, looked an unlikely prospect. Mr Ajello decided Mozambique could not survive another year of uncertainty, but he also realised that Renamo would not contest elections without the resources to fund its transformation from a military into a political machine. 'People were shocked that the UN was prepared to fund a former guerrilla movement,' Mr Ajello concedes, 'but the only way to make this mission a success was to forget conventional wisdom.' The imbalances were too great. To make Renamo function as an equal partner in the peace agreement, it needed houses in Maputo, telephones, faxes and cars; Mr Dhlakama needed to be given the trappings of a political leader. Mr Ajello believes Dollars 17m (Pounds 10.3m) - the cost of funding Renamo's election campaign - was a small insurance premium to add to the UN's Dollars 500m peacekeeping operation in Mozambique. 'We gave him enough to ensure he had too much to lose if he returned to war,' says Mr Ajello. The gamble almost failed. On the eve of the poll, Mr Dhlakama suddenly announced he was pulling Renamo out of the contest, convinced it would be fraudulent. Forty-eight hours of frantic negotiations finally brought him back into the fold. The election resulted in a Frelimo victory, but with a smaller margin than had been expected, and Mr Dhlakama accepted the outcome. Mr Ajello is cautious about drawing broader lessons from the UN's controversial funding of a guerrilla movement. He believes it worked in Mozambique because the guerrillas were so obviously tired of war. In Angola, Somalia and Rwanda, where armistice accords collapsed, Mr Ajello is not sure political funding would have helped turn the tide in favour of peace.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: Continental sees return to profit CONTINENTAL will make a profit again this year in spite of a 'miserable' first two months, and may be able to pay its first dividend since 1990, the chief executive of the German tyre company said yesterday. Mr Hubertus von Grunberg said group sales in the first quarter dropped by 10.3 per cent to DM2.2bn (Dollars 1.36bn). Profits fell by a similar amount, reflecting weak demand from carmakers and poor conditions in the market for replacement tyres. Sales of tyres for passenger vehicles fell by 6 per cent in Europe and the US. Mr von Grunberg's comments come shortly after Continental announced that it made net profits of DM133m for last year, after a loss of DM128.2m in 1991. This implied a sharp deterioration in the second half of last year, as the group made DM118m profit in the first half of 1992 alone. In spite of the profits recovery, Continental said that it would be premature to pay a dividend for 1992. The chief executive said that this year's figures would be boosted by the fact that General Tire, the group's US subsidiary, would return to the black after several years of heavy losses. This would offset poor market conditions in Europe. Business conditions had been 'miserable' in January and February but had improved in March and April, Mr von Grunberg said, noting that the quarter had not proved as bad as had been feared.</p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Spurred by concerns about cases of scientific misconduct, a prestigious medical  journal will require study authors to sign a pledge that they will let editors  examine their raw data if requested, the journal editor said. The journal also  will tighten its requirement on disclosing financial interests involved in the  research, said George Lundberg of the Journal of the American Medical Assn. The  steps are among requirements being imposed to protect the credibility of the  journal, Lundberg said. The requirements will take effect when they are  announced in next week's issue, he said at a science reporters conference in  Houston sponsored by the AMA.  </P></p>

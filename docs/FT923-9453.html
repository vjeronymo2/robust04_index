			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / International Company News: IEL to float leading Australian retailer INDUSTRIAL Equity (IEL), the Australian investment group which owns Woolworths, the country's second-largest retailer, ended months of speculation yesterday by announcing plans to float the store group by October. The flotation is expected to be Australia's largest, probably raising more than ADollars 2bn (USDollars 1.49bn), though no financial details were given yesterday. IEL is controlled jointly by David Jones, Tooth &amp; Co and Adelaide Steamship Company, all members of the former corporate empire of Mr John Spalvins, the Sydney-based entrepreneur. They are now operating under arrangements with their bankers. The latter three companies are entitled to 52 per cent of the issue, but said yesterday they would pass that entitlement on to their shareholders. Once cross-shareholdings are cancelled out, about 48 per cent of the issue will be offered as entitlements to the three companies' shareholders, with the remaining 52 per cent available for public subscription. Woolworths shares will be listed on the Australian and New York stock exchanges, with the flotation price determined by tenders from institutional investors. The flotation proceeds will be used to retire all IEL's debt and some of that of Adsteam, Tooth and David Jones. It is understood that IEL plans to make the issue widely available to the Australian public. The announcement follows Monday's disclosure by Woolworths of a 13 per cent rise in net profits to ADollars 247m for the year to June, on sales 11 per cent ahead at ADollars 9.18bn, defying the trend of a depressed Australian retail sector. State Government Insurance Office (SGIO), the Western Australia stated-owned general insurance business, is to be privatised through a public flotation, Reuter reports from Perth. Mr Carmen Lawrence, state premier, said legislation would be introduced this year to enable the sale to go ahead. The state government said in February it would sell all of SGIO and up to 49 per cent of the state-owned R&amp;I Bank of Western Australia. A statement gave no financial details or a timetable for the float. SGIO's parent, the State Government Insurance Commission, will remain government-owned but will be reconstituted as the Insurance Commission of Western Australia.</p>

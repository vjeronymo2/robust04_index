			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FOOTBALL '89;  </P> <P> ALPHA LEAGUE  </P> <P> L.A. Baptist  </P> <P> COACH: Mark Bates, 1st year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 4-6; 5th in league, 1-4  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Knights will pull a switch of sorts in their backfield  this year with senior Chris Robinson (5-10, 170) moving from tailback to  quarterback and Danny Stepper moving from quarterback to all-purpose back,  playing flanker and running back. The Knights will run an option offense, and  junior Colin Van Buren (6-0, 180), last year's fullback, will move to tailback.  Filling the fullback position will be either Jeff Hampston (6-2, 185) or Joel  Schlecht. Underlying these offensive changes is the fact that the Knights lost  most of their linemen to graduation. Returning offensive lineman Alan Vanek  (5-10, 175) will try to hold the fort. L.A. Baptist looks strong at receiver,  though, with returning senior Kurt Rayners (5-11, 170) and first-year senior  John Darby (6-3, 180). On defense, the prognosis is good. Hampston returns at  linebacker and will team with sophomore Jeff Faller (6-2, 170). In the  defensive backfield, Stepper and Robinson return.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: In a league with Montclair Prep, the best L.A. Baptist can hope for is  to be competitive. And that is what the coaching staff is hoping for. "We  should be able to compete," offensive coordinator Greg Frazier said. "We should  be in the middle somewhere."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Montclair Prep  </P> <P> COACH: George Giannini, 2nd year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 6-5; 1st in league, 4-1  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Mounties are, quite frankly, dripping with talent.  Starting with the obvious, there is last year's leading rusher in the Valley  and, according to Super Prep magazine, the 10th-ranked running back in the  nation -- Michael Jones (6-2, 205). Giannini calls him "the best player in  California." Jones alone would be enough to terrorize the Alpha League, but the  Mounties also will feature another top runner: junior transfer Derek Sparks  (6-2, 210). Sparks, a fullback, comes with healthy credentials: As a sophomore  at Banning, he was All-City and the state Sophomore Player of the Year. Add  another transfer to the backfield, junior option quarterback Leland Sparks  (5-10, 180) -- Derek's cousin who came from Texas -- and you have one of the  Valley's most explosive trios. At receiver, Shad Knighton returns from last  year and is joined by by Chatsworth transfer Jason Blatt (6-2, 225), who will  play tight end. Montclair Prep boasts a large offensive line led by junior  Donovan Roy (6-6, 260) and senior Bill Silletti (6-5, 250). Giannini feels that  junior inside linebacker Neimad Durham (6-2, 225) is one of the league's best.  Also on defense, look for Leland Sparks to shine at safety. OUTLOOK: The  Mounties are ranked No. 1 in Division IX in the Southern Section preseason  poll, so winning the Alpha League should be just one step in what looks like a  historic year for the school. "I really think that we have the possibility of  being one of the best teams in the Valley," Giannini said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Village Christian  </P> <P> COACH: Mike Plaisance, 10th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 8-2; 2nd in league, 3-2  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: While he is unsure about the Crusaders' strength at the skill  positions, Plaisance couldn't be more pleased with his team's situation on the  lines. With the entire line from an offense that netted more than 3,000 yards  last year returning, Plaisance will look for big things from senior guard Frank  Castellucci (5-11, 185), whom he calls a "human highlight film." Said Plaisance  about center Andy Kaminski (5-10, 252): "He is beyond the shadow of a doubt the  best center in the league." The Crusaders should also get help from senior  tackle Manny Albarca (5-10, 186). The skill positions suffer from lack of  experience, however. Plaisance feels safe he has a future star in sophomore  tailback Chad Everett (5-9, 150). The quarterback, senior Matt Bates, is  inexperienced as are his receivers. On his defensive line, though, Plaisance  touts senior Craig Fromel (6-2, 230) and Brett Wood (6-3, 272). At cornerback,  newcomer Miles Brown, a sophomore, is "the quickest kid in the school."  Plaisance says whatever his linebackers lack in strength they make up for in  brains. Jeff Agnor (5-11, 175) will be a mainstay at linebacker.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: While Plaisance concedes that Montclair Prep is a runaway on paper, he  still likes his team. "I'd like to think we have the ability," he said. "I have  20 question marks at the skill positions. Our bright spot is the lines. It  depends how well our skill positions -- especially the running backs -- come  along."  </P></p>

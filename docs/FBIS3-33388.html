			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Victor Godinez] </F>   [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, 21 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Four  of the nine parties registered in Mexico have sent  representatives to observe the development of the peace talks  which began today to seek a political solution to the conflict  in the southeastern State of Chiapas. The Mexican Democratic  Party (PDM), Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), Mexican  Green Ecologist Party (PVEM), and Cardenist Front for National  Reconstruction Party (PFCRN) sent delegates to San Cristobal,  PDM leader Marcelo Gaxiola stated.    The dialogue between Manuel Camacho Solis, peace  commissioner  for peace, and the armed group that appeared in Chiapas on 1  January began Monday morning at the Cathedral of San Cristobal,  1,200 km southeast of Mexico City.    In San Cristobal, Gaxiola announced a possible "private"  meeting between representatives of the four parties and the 19  delegates of the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN)  attending the negotiations to learn about the armed group's  demands. That meeting, Gaxiola added, would be attended only by  one representative of the four parties, under the promise of  respecting security instructions established for the meeting.    The four represented parties accepted an invitation made  last  week by the armed group to eight of the nine registered  political parties to send delegates to follow the development of  the peace talks. The PDM, excluded in the original invitation  made in one of the communiques sent by the armed group to the  press, was included in a later message, in which the EZLN  presented an apology for the "omission."    On 27 January, delegates from the four parties signed,  together with four other parties, a document entitled  "Commitment for Democracy, Peace, and Justice" to promote  democratic advancement and the reincorporation of the armed  group into the country's politics.    The progovernment Institutional Revolutionary Party reported  it expects to learn further details of the peace talks to issue  a statement about the invitation, which was turned down by five  political parties. The Popular Socialist Party, which did not  sign the commitment, the National Action Party, and the  Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution declined the  invitation because they think their struggle is political and  unrelated to the armed alternative. The Labor Party initially  expressed its support for the invitation, but it has abstained  from sending delegates to San Cristobal, where the dialogue is  being held, 51 days after the start of the conflict began with  the takeover of towns by the armed group.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Arts: Thomas Shadwell Thomas Shadwell, poet laureate and restoration dramatist, was much derided by John Dryden over 300 years ago and has had to wait a long time for a modern production. The Virtuoso opened at Stratford a year ago and arrives at The Pit in the Barbican this evening. Directed by Phyllida Lloyd, the piece is full of fun and some remarkably advanced science. There are also splendid parts all round, including Saskia Reeves and Barry Lynch, above. MR</p>

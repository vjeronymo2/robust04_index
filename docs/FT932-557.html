			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / International Company News: Orcofi aims to broaden its base ORCOFI, the French invest-ment company launched three years ago to form a luxury goods group, plans to concentrate on investments outside the luxury sector in an attempt to broaden the base of its business. Mr Henry Racamier, the veteran French businessman who founded Orcofi after his defeat in the bitter battle for control of the LVMH luxury goods group, said in an interview with Le Figaro newspaper that the company could not find any more suitable investments in the luxury sphere and was considering new areas of activity such as food and pharmaceuticals. The change in Orcofi's strategy comes at a turbulent time for the global luxury goods industry, which has been badly affected by the recession. LVMH recently warned of a fall in profits for the first half of 1993. Richemont, the South African group behind Dunhill, this week announced it was restructuring its luxury interests. Orcofi, which has stakes in the Ines de la Fressange fashion house and Daum crystal, has come under financial pressure. It made a net loss of FFr112.5m (Dollars 19.6m) in 1992 on turnover of FFr635m. Lanvin, the French fashion house that it owns jointly with the L'Oreal cosmetics group, recently reshuffled its senior management following an expensive relaunch last autumn. Mr Racamier announced this spring that he was retiring as executive chairman of Orcofi to be replaced by Mr Pierre Schmidt, chief executive. Mr Schmidt will orchestrate the company's diversification using its remaining investment funds of FFr3bn. He also plans to seek a stock market quotation so that some of the founding shareholders can realise their holdings.</p>

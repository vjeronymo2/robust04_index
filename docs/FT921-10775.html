			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / International Company News: CanPac fortunes hit new low CANADIAN Pacific, the transport, resource and industrial holding company, yesterday unveiled a record final loss of CDollars 913.8m (USDollars 780.9m), or CDollars 2.87 a share, for 1991 after heavy special charges. The group turned in a profit of CDollars 355.3m, or CDollars 1.11, a year earlier. The 1991 loss included about CDollars 900m in special charges, including a CDollars 290.8m writedown on an investment in Laidlaw, the waste management group, and its CDollars 101m share of Laidlaw's writedown of an investment in ADT. The group's total revenues for 1991 were CDollars 10bn, against CDollars 10.4bn a year earlier. In the fourth quarter, the final net loss was CDollars 887.6m, or CDollars 2.79, including the special charges. In 1990, there was a profit of CDollars 103.2m, or 32 cents. The company said the special charges had arisen from 'decisions to rationalise operations and reassess asset values'. The group was hard hit across the board by the North American recession. The special charges also included amounts to cover plant shutdowns, workforce reductions and severance agreements in the group's rail, pulp and paper, and property operations, and also in its oil and gas subsidiary. The only offsetting factor was CDollars 64.4m in gains from the sale of assets. Before the special items, the year showed a loss of CDollars 16.2m overall. The railway was hit by lower commodity movements, except for export grain. Property, waste management, hotels, ships, trucks and manufacturing all bore the brunt of the recession, but telecommunications did slightly better.</p>

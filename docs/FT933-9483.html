			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / North-south divide persists A STRONG north-south divide persists in England, says an analysis of data from all 366 English local authorities after the official census of 1991. The analysis by the Bristol-based School for Advanced Urban Studies and the city's Statistical Monitoring Group highlights changes in housing and population patterns in terms of age, family structure, employment and health. Every district experienced growth in home ownership and a decline in council housing, it says. Home ownership varied from almost 90 per cent in Castle Point near Basildon, Essex, to less than 25 per cent in Tower Hamlets, London. More than half the households in Surrey Heath had access to two or more cars, compared with fewer than one in 10 households in most inner-London districts and areas such as Liverpool, Manchester and Hull. In more than 100 districts, one in four households had at least one person suffering from a long-term illness, health problem or handicap which limited daily activity. There was a concentration of such illness in the north, in inner cities and in Cornwall. The highest proportions of lone parents were in inner London, northern cities such as Manchester and Liverpool and depressed industrial areas.</p>

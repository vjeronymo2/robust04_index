			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 11 Jan (NA) -- Deputy Foreign Minister  Eduardo Petrella today denied the existence of official  information on the presence of Argentine guerrillas in the  National Zapatist Liberation Army (EZLN) in the State of  Chiapas, Mexico.    He thus denied a report published today in a Buenos Aires  daily which states that "Argentine citizens, who formally  belonged to the People's Revolutionary Army, are in prominent  EZLN posts."    This information, the newspaper article states, "allegedly  became available last week in Buenos Aires though secret reports  prepared by the Mexican Government."    According to the article, President Carlos Menem allegedly  personally referred to the issue when he denounced the existence  of "subversive mercenaries" in the revolt in the State of  Chiapas.    In statements to a radio station, Petrella said: "We have no  information" about Argentine guerrillas in Chiapas.    The deputy foreign minister said: "Our embassy keeps us  permanently informed about these things," adding that the  Mexican problem cannot be "extrapolated" to Argentina.    He added that he knows nothing about a possible meeting at a  continental level to discuss the Mexican problem. The OAS has  not made any "collective suggestion" on the subject, he said .</p>

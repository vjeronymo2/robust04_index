			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Bi Zheng (3968 2398): "Jilin Government Holds </F> Trade and Investment Briefing in Seoul"]    [Text] The Jilin economic and trade fair held in the ROK  entered the third day on 9 May, and encouraging achievements  were made in economic relations and trade and in drawing in  investment. On the morning of 9 May, the provincial government  held a trade and investment briefing at the conference room of  the Korea Exhibition Center. Sun Yaoting, deputy secretary  general of the provincial government, chaired the briefing, and  Vice Governor Quan Zhezhu gave an introduction on Jilin's  natural resources, investment climate, foundations for  agriculture, industry, education, and science and technology,  current foreign economic relations and trade, and preferential  policies.    Vice Governor Quan Zhezhu said: Jilin Province welcomes more  foreign investors and Overseas Chinese to come to discuss trade  and develop industries. The Jilin Provincial government will  make utmost efforts to help promote all the projects of common  interest that are mutually beneficial and will, as always,  provide various preferential policies. On the basis of the  preferential policies stipulated by the state, we have also  drawn up 29 encouraging policies on import and export  management, production and operation, and tax levy. These  policies have four major characteristics. First, the areas in  which foreign investment can be made are relaxed even more, and  we encourage investment to be made chiefly in developing  enterprises producing export products, enterprises with advanced  technology, enterprises engaged in building infrastructural  facilities and exploiting resources, the pillar industries and  superior industries Jilin will develop on a priority basis,  fund- and technology-intensive industries, and the technical  transformation of the existing enterprises. Second, the  measures for attracting foreign investment will be more flexible  and varied. In addition to money and technology investment to  build joint ventures or exclusively foreign-funded enterprises,  we also allow some investors to invest with materials to buy the  property rights of our enterprises, develop Chinese-foreign  limited liability stock companies, or carry out land development  in large areas. Third, even more preferential policies will be  applied to the levies of taxes and fees from foreign-funded  enterprises. Foreign-funded enterprises which invested more  than $10 million in the areas we have encouraged will have their  taxes reduced and levied at the rate of 15 percent when their  tax reduction and exemption periods expire and when they have  obtained approval from tax organizations. When foreign firms  use the profits they have earned from the "three types of  foreign-funded enterprises" to reinvest in building the  enterprises in the fields we encourage, the income tax they have  paid for the profits which they use to reinvest will be  refunded. Fourth, the procedures for screening and approving the  establishment of foreign-funded enterprises will be simplified,  and the procedures will be handled by the foreign economic  relations bureau in a unified manner.    When Vice Governor Quan Zhezhu finished his introduction,  responsible persons of relevant provincial government  departments answered questions raised by pertinent ROK  personages. The briefing proceeded in a warm and friendly  atmosphere.    According to incomplete statistics compiled up to the  evening  of 9 May, transactions reached at the trade fair had totaled  $44.1 million, and agreement was reached on 81 foreign  investment projects involving $840 million, of which $521  million would be made by foreign firms. Of these projects, 51  were contracts involving $109.52 million, of which $79.77  million would be foreign funds.</p>

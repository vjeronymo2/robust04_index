			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Kim Hyon-ik] </F>   [Text] President Kim Yong-sam on 21 March called an urgent  meeting of security-related ministers and discussed the crisis  situation on the Korean peninsula created by the North Korean  threat of war and its rejection of nuclear inspection, and  decided an early deployment of Patriot missiles and the  resumption of the ROK-U.S. joint military exercise.    The meeting discussed the analyses of the present situation  by the Agency for National Security Planning [NSP], the National  Unification Board [NUB], the Foreign Ministry, and the Ministry  of National Defense [MND], and discussed measures to cope with  the situation. The meeting analyzed that there is little  likelihood of North Korea making actual armed provocation, but  decided to formulate preparatory measures for all the potential  developments, including the North Korean armed provocation  against the South.    At the meeting President Kim stressed that the ROK should  defend peace on the Korean peninsula and that the ROK is capable  of doing it, and requested the participants in the meeting to  take all necessary measures to establish the posture to cope  with any contingency.    The meeting assessed that North Korea will keep up even  steeper tensions on the Korean peninsula in the short run, and  decided to have an unidentified number of Patriot missiles  deployed soon and get the Team Spirit joint military exercise  resumed in April. The meeting also extensively discussed ways  to build up the ROK-U.S. combined defense capability.    Initially the meeting was supposed to decide the timing of  the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise watching North  Korea's attitude, but since "even tougher steps," such as the  withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] and  replacing fuel rods, can be taken by North Korea, the meeting  concluded that the Team Spirit exercise has to be conducted in  April.    The meeting concluded that in view of the North Korean  side's  attitude of rupturing the envoy exchange on 19 March, the inter-  Korean dialogue will have to be suspended for the time being,  and confirmed the principle that the ROK will intensify  international alliances by such means as participating in  international sanctions by the IAEA and the UN Security Council.    The meeting decided that the ROK will closely cooperate with  Japan and China to this end and that President Kim will take the  matter up intensively during his visit to Japan and China.    The meeting decided that the ROK will explain to  China--which  is persistently advocating its principled position that the  North Korean nuclear issue should be resolved peacefully--that  international sanctions are unavoidable for peace and security  in Northeast Asia. The meeting decided to request China to  persuade North Korea in this connection.    The meeting also agreed that international sanctions will be  reconsidered if North Korea admits its mistake, completely  permits the IAEA inspections, thereby ensuring the nuclear  transparency, and sincerely comes to the inter-Korean dialogue  for envoy exchange, before the UN Security Council decides  sanctions.    The meeting, however, on the basis of its reflection that  the  appeasement policy toward the North brought about the North  Korean insincerity and misjudgment, decided that the ROK will  maintain a resolute position.    President Kim noted that North Korea intends to take  advantage of the crisis atmosphere inspired by its raving about  not hesitating a war despite the extreme economic difficulty it  is suffering, and instructed the participants in the meeting to  establish a military posture of countermeasures and to intensify  public information activity for the people to prevent the people  from turning restless.    Participating in the security-related ministers meeting held  for the second time at Chongwadae [presidential residence] this  year were Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang; Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime  minister and minister of the NUB; Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu;  Minister of Home Affairs Choe Hyong-u; Defense Minister Yi  Pyong-tae; NSP Director Kim Tok; Chon Yong-taek, director of  contingency plans; Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff; Pak Kwan-yong, secretary general of the Presidential  Secretariat; Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for  foreign and national security affairs; and Chu Ton-sik,  presidential spokesman.</p>

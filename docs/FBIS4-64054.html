			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] If power engineering stops, all other industries  will stop. This was what Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk  told a conference of electric power engineering enterprises'  managers. Conditions are rife for this. The situation that has  come about in this basic industry of exceptional significance to  the national economy, is extremely complex and serious. There  are, in particular, quite a lot of problems in nuclear power  engineering that, to a considerable extent, ensured the work of  the national economic complex last winter.    Even now we are fulfilling our commitments to the state and  increasing the output of the cheapest kind of electric power,  said Mykhaylo Umanets, Ukraine's DerzhKomAtom [State Committee  for the Use of Nuclear Power] chairman. All our reserves have  unfortunately been extended. Some of the generating sets have  not been provided with fuel and will stop in the very near  future. [passage omitted]</p>

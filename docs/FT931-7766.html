			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / An ailing commercial property market starts to stir: Investors are returning to a sector shunned by institutions THERE are tentative signs of increased interest from investors in the UK commercial property market after three years of a ferocious downturn which has destroyed property values, bankrupted developers and left scores of unoccupied developments in the hands of bankers. Most institutions and large property companies are still shunning the market. But private buyers and foreign investors are increasing their role, encouraged by the devaluation of sterling, the decline of interest rates and the possibility of investing close to the bottom of the market. There has been a surge in foreign investment in central London offices. It has been encouraged by the fall in sterling and the high, secure income offered by UK property. Last year more than Pounds 1bn was invested by overseas buyers, over half of them German, largely after sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism in September. Private investors have been encouraged to put money into property by the reductions in interest rates. The auction rooms which deal with very small properties say there has been a strong increase in interest since the final quarter of last year. One of the largest private investors is Mr Jack Walker, a former steel magnate and vice-president of Blackburn Rovers football club, who is investing Pounds 150m in property using Pounds 100m of bank borrowings. Antler Investments, Mr Walker's Jersey-based property investment vehicle, last year bought a Pounds 22m portfolio of industrial properties from property group British Land; a Pounds 5m retail portfolio from Royal Life, the life assurance subsidiary of Royal Insurance; a Pounds 15.4m Bristol office building, a Pounds 6.15m Cheltenham office building and a Pounds 16m office building at the Haymarket in Edinburgh. Institutions appear to be reluctant to resume their traditional role as mainstay of the market. Annual net investment in the last couple of years has been around Pounds 700m, a third of the 1989 level. A recent Gallup survey found increased buying interest from insurance companies, but waning interest from pension funds. In the UK corporate sector, buyers are outweighed by would-be sellers. The large quoted property companies have generally been selling in the downturn as their balance sheets have come under increasing pressure. A notable exception is British Land, which has spent more than Pounds 900m on property since 1989. Otherwise, the most active corporate buyers have been a handful of entrepreneurial companies that have emerged over the past two years. For example, Eskmuir Properties, the investment company set up by the Laing family in 1990, has spent Pounds 80m and is looking to spend a further Pounds 50m this year on high-yielding and securely let property. Argent, run by Mr Peter Freeman and Mr Michael Freeman, both former lawyers, has invested more than Pounds 130m in the past 18 months and says it could spend the same again. 'We are buying at the bottom of one of the worst-ever markets in property,' says Mr Michael Freeman. Pillar, set up by Arlington Securities, General Electric Pension Fund and Electra, the UK fund, spent Pounds 70m last year and has a further Pounds 120m to spend. Rotch Property Group, owned by the Iranian Tchenguiz family, has also invested throughout the recession. The pattern of recent deals shows that investors have an appetite for every type of property in every part of the country, although overseas investors show a clear preference for central London offices. 'London is the only international city in the UK,' says Mr Klaus Hohmann, a director of DEGI, a large German fund that has bought three London buildings. There is particular interest in retail property, especially warehouses, while out-of-town offices and business parks are largely out of favour. Surveys also suggest that investors are showing increasing interest in the east Midlands and the north of England. While they display a catholic approach to location and type of property, investors are making stringent demands about the quality and security of income from buildings. Virtually all transactions over the past two years have featured high investment yields, good-quality covenants - reflecting tenants' ability to pay the rent - and long leases. 'The law of property used to be 'location, location, location'. It is now 'location, quality, covenant' - and not necessarily in that order,' says Mr Iain Ramsay of Antler. The rigid criteria imposed by investors - coupled with similar restrictions imposed by banks' lending policies - has limited demand to, at most, 15 per cent of available property. The result is a highly fragmented investment market. Unlet new developments and buildings with leases of less than 10 years are virtually unsellable. At the same time, there is growing competition for the few properties that are in demand; many potential investors are experiencing severe difficulties in spending the money they have earmarked for property. 'There is a shortage of product at the right price,' says Mr Andrew Strang, managing director of Allied Dunbar's property funds, which spent Pounds 100m on property last year. Potential investors are increasingly frustrated. Even the fall in interest rates, which enhances the attractions of property, has made investment more difficult as sellers are much more reluctant to dispose of their property. Although the upturn of interest in parts of the market has been welcomed, the industry is sceptical about its chances of being converted into a large surge of investment.</p>

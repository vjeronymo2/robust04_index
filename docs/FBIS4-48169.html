			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with UN General Assembly President Rudy Insanally </F> by announcer Freek Robinson; place and date not given; on the  "Agenda" program--recorded]    [Text] [Insanally] I am myself personally very optimistic  that the return of South Africa to the United Nations family  will be a very easy matter. This is a historic day for which  the world has long awaited and I dare say the path has well been  laid to welcome South Africa back to United Nations. Mr.  Mandela, when he visited New York and I had the pleasure of  speaking with him on that occasion, made it quite clear that the  United Nations will represent a cardinal feature of South  Africa's foreign policy and I think we there at United Nations  are very ready to welcome your country to the organization once  more.    [Robinson] Now those are very kind words, Mr. Insanally, but  the point that I am trying to make is this: It is a question of  South Africa being obliged to formally readmit credentials. Is  that the position or not?    [Insanally] I dare say South Africa will have to formally  express its desire to return and as I said I am pretty sure that  that request will be very spontaneously entertained. The other  matters, all the residual matters of financial standing, the  question of contributions, clearly are -- as in the case of all  countries -- there's a question of a assessment of  contributions. I imagine that this is a matter that will have  to be discussed with the South African Government. There is a  scale of assessment and I imagine this will have to be through a  dialogue between the government of South Africa and the United  Nations Secretariat.    [Robinson] As I understand it, South Africa is about $100  million in arrears. So what is going to happen as far as that is  concerned?    [Insanally] As I said, the primary criterion I imagine the  United Nations will use is to open its doors to South Africa, an  important member of the United Nations family. I do not believe  that the question of arrears will be a stumbling block to its  reentry into the organization. Clearly....    [Robinson, interrupting] But will South Africa have to pay  that amount?    [Insanally] I really can't say. I really would be  very...[pauses] I would be hazarding an answer there. It would  be for the committee on contributions to study the case. Let me  say that, you know, the United Nations is composed of a number  of bodies and South Africa has in fact not been entirely  excluded from participation in some of the agencies, so one has  to look at it in fine [as heard], and it would be very  presumptuous of me to give you a sort of blanket answer. As I  said, many countries are in arrears. I am sure that some  arrangement can be worked out which would facilitate South  Africa's entry as soon as it expresses a desire to return to the  international family.    [Robinson] The United Nations arms embargo against South  Africa is still in place. Are you going to take the initiative  to remove that?    [Insanally] That is a matter for the Security Council, and  again I do not wish to sort of tread on their prerogative. I  would think that in so far as it does not affect the general  purposes of the United Nations, such an embargo will be reviewed  with some...[pauses] with a new eye and in an attempt to respect  the sovereignty of South Africa. I am sure the Security Council  will take the necessary measures in that regard.    [Robinson] One of the bodies of the United Nations is the  Special Committee Against Apartheid. One might expect that the  duties of that particular committee will now lapse.    [Insanally] Oh yes, that I can say positively. I was,  myself, a vice president of the council for Namibia and that was  one body which I was very glad to see pass out of existence,  although it's left me without a particular job. The same will  occur for the Special Committee -- apartheid -- and as I said  we'll be very happy to see the end of it. It will take a little  time to dismantle, to redeploy, but that certainly will go now  that South Africa is now with us, fully, in the United Nations  family.    [Robinson] If South Africa reenters the United Nations, do  you see any specific or special role for South Africa in that  body?    [Insanally] Indeed I do. I see it as a sort of a two-way  street. I see, first of all, South Africa playing a very key  role in United Nations affairs, in all its aspects. South  Africa, indeed, is an important nation, not only within Africa,  and indeed I must say that we look upon South Africa as the  dynamo for development in the region, in all of Africa, and in  the political sense what South Africa has been able to  accomplish through excellent leadership, excellent vision for  the future, and the process of dialogue and reconciliation --  that can be a model for other countries in the region. At the  same time the United Nations, as I am sure the secretary general  may have mentioned to the president of South Africa, I think we  can look to South Africa also to making a contribution to  international affairs, in the areas of peace keeping, peace  making, technical cooperation. You are indeed, in this part of  the world, a very advanced country and, therefore, can play a  very preeminent role in the furtherance of peace and development  in the continent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>   [Text] Vladikavkaz June 26 TASS -- A meeting between North  Ossetian and Ingush Presidents Akhsarbek Galazov and Ruslan  Aushev, respectively, is taking place at the Vladikavkaz airport  on Sunday with mediation from head of the temporary  administration Vladimir Lozovoy.    The meeting is also attended by members of the two cabinets  and legislators of the two republics which are members of the  Russian Federation.    ITAR-TASS learnt from sources close to the North Ossetian  president that the sides are discussing a procedure for  returning and settling refugees and displaced persons at places  where they predominantly lived in the villages of Chermen,  Dongaron, Dachnoye and Kurtat in the Prigorodnyy district, North  Ossetia. The sides are to sign a document called upon to settle  the problem.    The document says that, in compliance with the decrees of  the  president of the Russian Federation and the Kislovodsk  agreement, the North Ossetian Government and the Ingush  Government will create, with direct participation of the  temporary administration, conditions for a comprehensive  solution of the problem of refugees and displaced persons, in  line with the principles of mutual respect, racial peace and  accord, territorial integrity of the republics and observance of  law.    The leaderships of the North Ossetian Republic and of the  Ingush Republic as well as the temporary administration proceed  from the premise that both residents in the four villages and  returning residents will take obligations to abide by the laws  of the Russian Federation and the North Ossetian Republic, to  refrain from kindling ethnic stife, to recognise the territorial  integrity of the North Ossetian republic in the existing  administrative territorial borders and to fulfill decisions of  legal bodies of power and administration.    The meeting is also attended by Ramazan Abdulatipov, deputy  speaker of the Russian Parliament upper chamber, and members of  the legislators' group of the upper chamber.</p>

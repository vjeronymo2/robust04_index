			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Bosko Santic] </F>   [Text] It is not enough to the Americans that they have  punished the Muslims and the Croats in the most brutal way  possible; they have now even started to mock them. How should  one otherwise interpret the words of Warren Christopher that the  agreement in the State Department shows how much can be  achieved, after bitter years of violence, when two sides sit  behind a negotiating table and decide to reach an agreement. By  running after the carrot, the leaders of the two peoples  deserved to get the stick, which they did, and any sort of  submissiveness ultimately deserves to be despised. However, it  nevertheless seems that the things have been pushed too far, be  it in the demonstration of power and in the manifestation of  weakness. The two peoples that have been bleeding and dying did  not deserve this, irrespective of their leaders.    It would certainly be better for the Croats to have  sanctions  imposed against them, and for the Muslims to be told once and  for all not to expect a single cent or bullet in aid, than to  sign an agreement to live together again. Had the Americans  really wanted peace, they would have condemned Granic,  Silajdzic, and Zubak to share the same bachelor pad until the  end of their lives, and build a China wall between the two  peoples.    Parallel to the realization of their political interests,  the  Americans also love to amuse themselves in the Bosnian arena and  that is why they are offering new bloodshed in the name of  peace. Just like a chess player after a lost match who is  analyzing the positions and wondering where he went wrong,  placing the figures on the same positions again, and demanding  an impossible victory, the Americans are again trying out an  option that has already flopped -- a coalition of the Croats and  the Muslims. However, it is incomparably more difficult on this  occasion as, in the meantime, much blood has been shed and the  hatred is enormous.    Forgetting that love cannot be administered or agreed on, as  opposed to hatred, which can be instigated, the Americans would  now like to mix up the Mostar Croats and Muslims just like chess  pieces on the board, exorcising memories, pain, and despair from  their heads and souls. Forget everything and love each other,  the Americans advise them and those in central Bosnia -- the  exiled, the displaced, and the mutilated. They should all  forget everything. It is not theirs to think and feel, as pawns  do not feel. There are no more grenades, but the most dangerous  weapon -- the door. This is the most poisonous weapon -- when,  at midnight or at four o'clock in the morning, uniformed people  come to the door and beat, tie-up, kill, and chase people away.  This weapon is also dangerous for the nervous system and is  used only when people live together. There will be no more of  this, love each other, the Americans recommend.    We should not worry. Live people are not pawns. There have  been rumors that, even after the signing of the agreement, the  clashes will not stop. Because of the fear of doors, the  grenade is being used as a weapon.</p>

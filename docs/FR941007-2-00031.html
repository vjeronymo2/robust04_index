The GDP provides a comprehensive framework for several related waste management projects which are proposed to be implemented in three phases over the course of several years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with the intent of 40 CFR 1500.4(i), the environmental impact statement (EIS) analysis for the GDP used a tiered approach to provide: (1) Programmatic consideration of the overall framework of the GDP; and, (2) detailed, project-specific analysis of the GDP-Phase I elements which are proposed for near-term implementation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This ROD addresses the Department of the Navy approval of the Preferred Alternative identified in Parts I and II of the Draft and Final EIS, with some refinements related to the phased implementation of specific elements. Alternatives to the overall GDP and alternatives to the Phase I project-specific elements were described in the EIS and are summarized below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> GDP Alternatives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed GDP encompasses a variety of projects including the relocation or modification of several existing facilities at the Miramar Landfill and the development of several new facilities. Relocated/modified facilities include: Recycling center, greens/woods recycling operation, landfill entrance fee booth, vehicle maintenance facility, fuel pipeline, and the landfill access road. New facilities include a sludge processing facility and related pipelines/utilities, a materials recovery facility, an access road to new facilities, an environmental complex, a cogeneration plant, a paper processing plant, a household hazardous waste processing station, a public tipping deck, landfill siltation basins, and a landscaping/revegetation nursery. The GDP also includes projects related to the mounding of grading overburden at three locations within the study area. The three mounding areas are proposed on the closed South Miramar Landfill and are referred to by their relative location on the landfill: North, West, and East Mounding Areas. Approximately six million cubic yards of overburden from excavation of the West Miramar Landfill is proposed to be placed at the three mounding areas. In addition, approximately 540,000 cubic yards of overburden from the grading of the proposed sludge processing facility will be mounded at the West Mounding Area. Use of the North Mounding Area will occur as described in the EIS. Use of the North Mounding Area will occur as described in the EIS. Use of the East and West Mounding Areas will occur according to project phasing modifications described below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Proposed GDP includes elements which are integral parts of a comprehensive program for the management of solid and liquid waste by the City of San Diego (City). The various elements of the GDP serve to meet specific waste management needs of the City and to comply with state and federal requirements for wastewater treatment standards, landfill operation standards, recycling, and hazardous waste collection. A key benefit and emphasis of the GDP relates to centralized collocation of the GDP elements. Examples of the efficiencies and benefits of the collocation aspect of the GDP were provided in Part I of the EIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

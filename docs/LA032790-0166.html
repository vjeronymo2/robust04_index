			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> TRI-CITY SUSPENSIONS TO REMAIN  </P> <P> Suspensions handed to Coach Rick Kozuback and two players on the Tri-City  Americans will continue indefinitely, the president of the Western Hockey  League said today.  </P> <P> Ed Chynoweth said a decision on further penalties against Kozuback, Terry  Virtue and Jeff Fancy might be made later in the day after league Vice  President Rick Doerksen meets with Kozuback in Kennewick, Wash.  </P> <P> "The three were suspended indefinitely, and the suspension is not going to end  before tonight's game, I'll tell you," Chynoweth said in a telephone interview  from the league's head office. "We feel Rick Kozuback should be entitled to  give his side of the story. Once that's been done, we'll have a decision. It  could come later today but (Wednesday) at the latest."  </P> <P> Kozuback, Virtue and Fancy were suspended after members of the Americans went  after fans in the stands during a West Division best-of-nine semifinal playoff  series in Seattle against the Thunderbirds.  </P></p>

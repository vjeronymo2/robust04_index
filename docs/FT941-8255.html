			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Super-highways sans frontieres: European Union plans for pan-continental networks to give the single market an infrastructure backbone If the European Commission has a big idea these days, it is trans-European networks. The bruising struggle to ratify the Maastricht treaty and the near-collapse of the exchange rate mechanism last year may have knocked monetary union off course. But across Brussels, dozens of Eurocrats are beavering away at the next ambitious programme for European integration: a plan to develop transport, energy and telecommunications networks spanning the continent. The initiative was launched with much fanfare last December by Commission president Jacques Delors. His white paper on Europe's competitiveness listed a large number of new railway, road, telecommunications, gas, electricity, airport and port projects that would knit Europe's far-flung regions with the core of the European Union, and provide an infrastructure backbone for the single market. The networks would also extend beyond the Union into European Free Trade Association countries and eastern Europe. The programme's total cost is put at Ecu400bn (Pounds 300bn) by the end of the century. Of this, Ecu220bn would be for transport projects, Ecu150bn for telecommunications and Ecu30bn for energy. Leaders at last December's Brussels summit gave the initiative a qualified go-ahead. They approved the overall thrust, but not specific details - in particular Commission plans for financing the programme. Now the Commission's challenge is to refine its plans and win over the doubters. A crucial role will be played by Mr Henning Christophersen, the economics commissioner, who will today chair the second meeting of a taskforce consisting of high-level officials from each member state. The group will hear new Commission ideas on how the initiative could be financed. It will also discuss which transport and energy projects should receive priority. A parallel taskforce, consisting of telecommunications users, operators and manufacturers, is being chaired by Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner. It will look at how an advanced telecommunications infrastructure - which would be needed if, say, 'teleworking' from home was to become much more common - can be developed. The Commission is anxious that Europe does not fall behind the US, where the Clinton administration is trying to encourage the construction of such 'information superhighways'. Meanwhile, officials from more than half a dozen Commission directorates are working on detailed aspects of the trans-European networks initiative. Both the Christophersen and Bangemann groups will present progress reports to the next European summit in Corfu in June. The reason the initiative was launched was belief in Brussels that European businesses and consumers are disadvantaged because networks have developed on national rather than transnational lines. 'Networks were designed to satisfy the European nation states of the 19th century,' says Mr Christophersen. There are many examples of what Commission officials see as anomalies: cross-border phone calls cost three times as much as domestic calls of a similar distance; air travellers can face long delays because poorly co-ordinated national air traffic control systems cannot handle as many flights as a single unified system; Italian lorries thunder through the Rhine Valley on their way to Rotterdam because Italy's ports are not modern enough; and there are as yet no high-speed rail links between national capitals. Enthusiasm in Brussels is one thing; winning the necessary support - and finance - from member states is quite another. The general idea that fragmented networks damage Europe's competitiveness has widespread acceptance. That was why an article was written into the Maastricht treaty giving the Commission authority to draw up proposals for trans-European networks and promote their development. But there is still much debate about three big questions. Are all the projects identified by the Commission really necessary? Will the Union need to subsidise the networks or can investment be left to member states and private companies? Will the networks develop faster and more efficiently if traditional national monopolies in telecommunications, energy and transport are abolished? Doubts over the list of projects stem largely from the way they have been chosen. The Commission asked member states to propose candidates and then collated the suggestions into master plans. But because favoured projects may qualify for EU subsidies, each government had an incentive to get as many of its national projects as possible included. The initiative is viewed in some quarters as the next European gravy train. 'It is about money,' admits a transport official in one member state. This explains why the programme's cost has reached a staggering Ecu400bn. It also explains why the list includes projects which appear to be of mainly national, rather than pan-European, benefit. For example, the master plan for trans-European roads - consisting of 55,000km of roads, 12,000km of them motorways - is largely an amalgamation of existing national road plans. Officials argue that, even when infrastructure is confined to a single member state, it may be of broader European interest for two reasons: Spill-over effects. For example, Ireland has an interest in motorways being built across England and Wales so its traffic can have easy access to the Channel tunnel. Equally, a planned railway from Rotterdam to the border with Germany will be more profitable if Germany continues the line into its industrial Ruhr region. Incompatible standards. For example, trains travelling from Sweden to Denmark have to switch to a different electricity system. Similarly, many advanced telecommunications services such as electronic mail systems do not interconnect smoothly across borders. The Commission believes it can play a useful role in co-ordinating investment plans across frontiers. One way of achieving this could be for the Commission to hold roundtable discussions for particular projects to identify what is stopping them moving ahead. The Commission would then knock heads together to remove the blockages. A prime candidate would be air-traffic control, says Mr Robert Coleman, head of the Commission's transport directorate. National air-traffic controllers have been discussing harmonising their systems for years without much progress. The new powers in the Maastricht treaty would allow aviation ministers to vote on a common approach and then make it stick. Mr Christophersen admits that not every project in the overall programme is equally important. But he says the Commission has already made a preliminary selection of priority projects which cost only Ecu160bn. His taskforce will further refine priorities. Examples of the priority projects include: high-speed rail links between London, Paris, Brussels, Cologne and Amsterdam at a total cost of Ecu8.5bn; a motorway from Berlin to Moscow via Warsaw costing Ecu3.2bn; and a new Athens airport costing Ecu2bn. Even if agreement is reached on priorities, the financing of the new networks will remain controversial. In his white paper, Mr Delors argued that the Union would need to provide Ecu20bn a year in subsidies and loans. Of this, Ecu5bn would come from the Union's cohesion and structural funds. These channel aid to Europe's poorest regions and countries: in particular, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland. This money has already been earmarked in the Union's budget. A further Ecu7bn, Mr Delors suggested, could be raised by loans from the European Investment Bank. The final Ecu8bn would be raised on the financial markets by the Commission and then lent to governments or private companies. This last proposal, for what were dubbed 'Union Bonds', caused particular controversy at the Brussels summit. Germany and the UK criticised it on the grounds that borrowing by the Commission would offer governments a back-door route to avoiding public expenditure disciplines. The critics were also concerned that the Commission's AAA credit rating in financial markets might be damaged if it made large loans to countries with poorer credit ratings, such as Greece and Italy. They said that, if more money for infrastructure investment was needed, it should come from the EIB which has a track record in project finance. These objections have caused the Commission to beat a tactical retreat. Mr Christophersen says Union Bonds are just one of several financial instruments that could boost infrastructure investment. Mr Enrico Cioffi, head of the Commission's investment directorate, suggests other possibilities: Bonds, issued by the Commission but linked to particular road, rail, air or maritime traffic projects. Coupons paid to investors might depend on the volume of traffic the project attracts. Loan guarantees by the Commission. These could be used for those parts of a network located outside the Union such as motorways or telecommunications lines extending into eastern Europe. Although the Commission is no longer pushing Union Bonds as the main option, the thinking behind the other ideas remains the same: the Commission could use its AAA status to cut borrowing costs for countries with lower credit ratings. The benefit for states such as Greece, Italy, Ireland and Denmark could be the equivalent of between half and one percentage point off interest rates, says Mr Cioffi. But such proposals could run into the same opposition from member states as Union Bonds. Part of the Ecu20bn envisaged by Mr Delors could be provided as direct subsidies to projects, though the Commission has yet to spell out how this might work. Subsidies would not necessarily be limited to regions that already qualify for structural and cohesion funds. Some member states, however, are worried that such handouts could be a waste of public money. They could merely lead to the construction of grandiose projects with little economic benefit. Whatever is decided on Union funding, there is a consensus that national budgets are so strapped that the bulk of the money for trans-European networks will have to come from the private sector. This raises the question of whether a bigger push is needed to privatise and liberalise monopoly sectors. There are sharp differences between member states over liberalisation. The UK has traditionally led the free-market group, while France has supported the continuation of public-sector monopolies. Within the Commission, there are similar, though less sharp, differences. Most officials agree that liberalisation would help the trans-European network initiative, but they differ over whether the Commission needs to do more than it is already doing. The liberal camp believes that national monopolies in transport, telecommunications and energy are the root cause of fragmented networks. Public-sector monopolies have little incentive to look beyond their national frontiers, while their monopoly status has prevented private operators building transnational links instead. Those who hold this view point to the US, where transcontinental networks and competitive markets go hand in hand. In particular, they say a lesson is to be learnt from the Clinton administration which is seeking to develop US information superhighways by liberalising the telecommunications and cable television industries, rather than pumping in government money. Abolishing monopolies would allow private investment to flow into infrastructure projects. Priorities would be chosen on economic criteria as companies sought out the most profitable opportunities. There would also be less need to co-ordinate investment as operators would be free to range across boundaries. 'The big issue is lifting the restrictions. That is the only way of mobilising the investment,' says Mr Herbert Ungerer, who runs the Commission's telecommunications policy unit. But others say that liberalisation is not the complete story. For a start, it is harder to apply the approach in loss-making sectors such as railways and roads than in profitable sectors such as telecommunications and energy. Moreover, even in a liberalised market there would be a need for co-ordinated investment and harmonised standards. Such issues will have to be addressed by EU member states in the next few months, if the foundations of trans-European networks are to be laid before the end of the century. With the future of European competitiveness at stake, there is already some impetus behind the plans. But if the trans-European network initiative is really to gather momentum, members will have to overcome any qualms they may have about a fresh commitment to working together on a pan-continental scale.</p>

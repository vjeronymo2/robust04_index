This document, he said, recognizes the right to  self-determination, equality, defense of sovereignty and  territorial integrity, and the single economic space. Tatarstan  exclusively owns and uses its land, bowels of the earth, and  movable and immovable property. Simultaneously an instrument of  the implementation of this treaty was adopted which represents  11 inter-governmental agreements.    The position of Tatarstan, Mintimer Shaymiyev noted, is  directed at the democratic formation of Russia. In the  concluding part of his speech Mintimer Shaymiyev thanked  President Boris Yeltsin for his "invariable and consistent  position shown to the very end -- up to the signing of the  treaty."</p>

Barkashov's Life. </F> Many Theories, Truth Hidden"]    [Text] SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA has already reported (4 January  1994) that an attempt was made on the life of Aleksandr  Barkashov, leader of Russian National Unity [RNU], 22 December.  He is currently in an MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]  hospital with a severe gunshot wound. In a statement issued  through ITAR-TASS the Russian MVD promised to publish the  official version of the circumstances surrounding this act of  terrorism by 4 January. But the facts that have reached the  editorial office so far are not only contradictory but sometimes  mutually exclusive.    According to one theory, friends took the wounded RNU leader  to an ordinary Zelenograd hospital under an assumed name. The  Russian special services tracked him down and moved him to the  MVD hospital, where Barkashov is allegedly being held under  arrest in connection with the events of 3-4 October.    But the General Prosecutor's Office investigations group  reported that Kazannik had long ago rescinded Barkashov's arrest  warrant for lack of evidence.    According to another theory, supporters of the RNU leader  had  themselves asked the MVD to move him to a militia hospital and  organize security, since they feared another terrorist attack on  Barkashov, who allegedly knows certain details of the Supreme  Soviet shooting that could be "deadly" for some people.    In this connection the following frank admission in  MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS (5 January 1994) strikes me as  interesting:    "A statement by the `fuehrer' (Barkashov -- S.T.) received  by  us but not yet published clearly states that this brigade (the  NATO 6th Brigade -- S.T.) under the command of Colonel Dzheyk  Kenti [name as transliterated] methodically shot people on both  sides at the White House in October so as to `make the conflict  more bloody.' Israel's `Jericho' 4th Special Forces Brigade and  the `Veytar' [name as transliterated] paramilitary organization  were particularly brutal in dealing with unarmed women and old  veterans. Moreover, in Barkashov's opinion, Yeltsin officially  ordered that two high-ranking CIA station chiefs be attached to  the Security Ministry and that all the security agents to  coordinate their operations with them."    I will not make any judgment as to the accuracy of this  report, but if it contains even a grain of truth, Barkashov's  life could indeed be in serious danger.</p>

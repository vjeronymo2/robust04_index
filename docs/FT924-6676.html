			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Patten's proposals face testing time: Alexander Nicoll and Simon Holberton look at HK's democratic aspirations SIX weeks after Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, unveiled his plans for broader democracy, the gulf between London and Beijing which they have opened shows little sign of being narrowed. A round of diplomatic activity in London this week saw Britain, China and Mr Patten himself spelling out their positions - and the governor winning strong backing from Mr John Major, the prime minister. But no further discussions with the Chinese are planned beyond regularly scheduled contacts between London, Beijing and Hong Kong. Though Mr Patten has called repeatedly for discussions and invited Beijing to produce alternative proposals, there appears to be a growing prospect that there will be little or no dialogue. That would leave Hong Kong to make arrangements for the 1995 Legislative Council (Legco) elections without knowing whether Beijing will, as it has threatened, reverse them when it assumes sovereignty over the territory in 1997. China's frustration at what it sees as Britain's duplicity, evident from vitriolic attacks on Mr Patten and snubs when he visited Beijing, was made even plainer during a visit to Britain by Zhu Rongji, a vice premier and Politburo member. Though he has no direct responsibility for Hong Kong, Zhu went out of his way to express the depth of Beijing's disgust and its belief that London has gone back on agreements. He indicated that China could allow the dispute to spread into other bilateral links, and caused alarm in Hong Kong when he said: 'People cannot help asking the question whether we still have to stick to the Sino-British Joint Declaration and whether the understanding reached between the Chinese and British sides is to be allowed to be scattered to the winds.' China is not alone in being rattled by Mr Patten's decision - backed by his former cabinet colleagues in London - to stop treating Beijing with kid gloves and attempt to deal with it in much the same way as with any other country. Some British officials who were involved in previous negotiations with Beijing are quietly shaking their heads at the abandonment of a non-confrontational approach. They fear that Mr Patten has precipitated a serious crisis. His supporters dismiss such worries as springing from what they see as the former tendency of the British government, under the influence of Sinologist academics, to view Hong Kong as a relatively small factor in an overall UK/China relationship. This was thought to have led London to give too much away to Beijing on Hong Kong. Instead, the governor's backers point to the importance of Hong Kong to China - it would represent 18 per cent of China's economy and economic ties with the mainland are constantly growing. Though there can be no certainty that Beijing would subordinate its political worries to its economic interests, they at least believe Hong Kong is dealing from a position of greater strength than was previously assumed. Mr Patten has repeatedly argued that he is seeking to implement the 1984 Joint Declaration on Hong Kong's future; that he had to produce proposals because the Basic Law, Hong Kong's Beijing-drafted post-1997 constitution, was silent on the 1995 elections; that they are modest and do not contravene the Basic Law or Joint Declaration; that a smooth transition to Chinese rule is the aim. However, though Britain insists that there has been no policy change on Hong Kong, Mr Patten clearly wants to meet popular aspirations to greater democracy as much as he can, and to a degree previously not thought possible in London. China's concern is to keep the development of democracy, and particularly the involvement of vocal liberals, to a minimum. Mr Patten has succeeded in bringing the democracy campaigners behind his plans, even though proposed arrangements fall well short both of what they wanted and of full democracy. The danger, however, is that support within Hong Kong - Mr Patten's trump card and the basis for his policy - will ebb as fears grow about the dangers of confrontation with Beijing. Some businessmen are already showing their concern. Opinion polls show the electorate supporting his plans, and LegCo last week broadly endorsed them. However, there will not be a final LegCo vote on them until the late spring of 1993. In the meantime, China can be expected to exert pressure on opinion makers. The stock market jitters resulting from Zhu's remarks strengthened the worries of Mr Patten's opponents in business and political circles about the effect of a stalemate in Sino-British relations on investment in Hong Kong. Yesterday's decision to push ahead with the platform contract for the colony's new airport may bolster confidence. Proceeding with the contract means the project remains on schedule for opening in 1997 even though China has yet to agree to financing plans. The government says it will prevent cost overruns. British officials told the Chinese that Hong Kong had no intention of pursuing a 'go it alone' policy on the airport and that it still seeks a comprehensive settlement to the financing of the HKDollars 175bn project. Yesterday, Hong Kong officials said there was no question of the government awarding contracts which require China's consent without Beijing's approval. However, some influential businessmen in Hong Kong doubt the wisdom of moving ahead with the airport platform contract at such a sensitive time. They feel it will only invite negative Chinese reaction - which has been promised - at a time when all efforts should be directed to mending fences with Beijing. The airport talks could be the main channel for negotiations with Beijing in the coming months. But there is a growing feeling in Hong Kong that Beijing will not produce counter-proposals on the electoral arrangements. Mr Patten has staked his governorship on his constitutional plans and has won the support of Australia, Canada and the US for them. But he may find that the wisdom of his 'have-a-go' approach will increasingly be questioned in Hong Kong if there is no sign of rapprochement with Beijing. The way remains open for an increasingly mature political community in Hong Kong to produce alternative suggestions if their concerns about Mr Patten's proposals mount. If he were to be forced to compromise, it could be with them - and this would eventually allow him an honourable way to give ground.</p>

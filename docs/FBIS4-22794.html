			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Androsenko (Yakutia): "In the North, </F> They Pan for Gold in the Summer and Spend the Rest of the Year  Stewing"]    [Text] Kular has provided the country with 153 tonnes  of the metal. It could provide dozens more. Will it get the  chance?    "We want normal living and working conditions. The  decision is yours: If Russia and the Sakha Republic want gold,  you have to give us a chance to mine it, provide us with all of  the financing for the 1994 program, and make adjustments in the  system of taxation. If you plan to continue ruining the gold  industry of the republic and Russia, if we and our labor are no  longer needed, give us a chance to leave Yakutia with dignity,  allocate money from centralized funds for this purpose, and give  us a friendly sendoff. We earned this by living in the severe  conditions of the polar region."    These blunt and resentful statements are taken from a  message  from the miners of the polar Kularzoloto Combine to the  president and Government of the Russian Federation and the  president and Government of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia). This  is a response to the local Ministry of Industry's decision to  close the combine. Suddenly the hottest topics of discussion are  the obliteration of the settlements of Kular, Severnyy, Vlasovo,  and Entuziastov, the placement of people in new jobs, and their  resettlement. The northerners are understandably infuriated by  these developments. Once again, without consulting anyone or  trying to find a compromise acceptable to all of the parties  concerned, officials are prepared to abandon the common laborers  to the whims of fate, leaving them defenseless against the  present state of bedlam in Russia.    Yes, it is true that gold mining is a costly undertaking in  this region, but it cannot cost more than money, as the saying  goes, and the yellow metal is the world equivalent of money--the  world equivalent, but not the Russian equivalent. In its efforts  to leap into the planetary market, our government is buying gold  from the miners at fixed prices based on the London exchange  rate, but the miners have to buy vehicles, mining equipment, and  fuel at domestic "floating" prices, which escaped the  government's control long ago and are now two or three times as  high as world prices. What kind of profit margin can they expect  under these conditions?    Furthermore, that is not the only problem. Gold can only be  panned in the summer in the Far North. The rest of the year is  spent in preparations--the dredging of gold-bearing sand, and so  forth. All of this work has to be done on credit. Enterprises  have no working capital of their own, and our market-based  government's tax rates have deprived the mining combines of any  chance of accumulating this capital. Meanwhile, the Ministry of  Finance and the Committee on Precious Metals have refused to  provide advance financing for mining operations. It is a vicious  circle.    Is there really no alternative to closing the mining  enterprise and stopping the extraction of the precious metal?  There probably is. One possible option would entail a lighter  tax burden or even total exemption from taxes. More than half of  the value of the gold mined by the combines is now appropriated  for the budget. If these funds could be left at the disposal of  the combines, they would have a chance to catch their breath and  consider ways of keeping the production capacities operating in  the future. The very idea of a differentiated approach to  taxation, however, sounds heretical to orthodox market advocates.    In addition, there is no money for the resettlement of the  Kular miners. The miners of Kular are indignant and are holding  rallies. Regrettably, they have no other means of protest. It  would be senseless to go on strike at an enterprise that is  being closed.    Will the presidents choose to listen to their plea?</p>

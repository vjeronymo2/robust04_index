			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Letter: Not amused Sir, I sympathised with your leader ('No FT, no comrades', May 3). The Institute of Directors also featured in that Wednesday night party political broadcast by the Labour party, with the implication that any criticism of government policy means support for the Labour party. It is perhaps no coincidence that in the speech of mine to which Labour referred in the broadcast, I too had quoted, with approval, Mr Samuel Brittan's remark: 'Unfortunately, it is still not possible for market economists to support Labour with a straight face.' The IoD can certainly see nothing to laugh at in socialist policies. Under socialism we are promised higher taxation, not lower taxation; public intervention, not private initiative, public capital, not private capital; renationalisation, not privatisation and regulation rather than deregulation. No one should think that the IoD supports socialism. Peter Morgan, director-general, Institute of Directors, 110 Pall Mall, SW1</p>

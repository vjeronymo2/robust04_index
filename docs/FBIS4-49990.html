			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chang Hong: "Qian Seeks Immediate Cease-Fire in Yemen"] </F>   [Text] Vice-premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen  yesterday called for an immediate cease-fire and peaceful  settlement to the civil strife in Yemen. "China is seriously  concerned with the worsening situation in Yemen and deeply  grieved by the huge loss in lives and property there," he said.  "We sincerely hope that both the South and the North can remain  cool-headed, exercise restraint, stop fighting immediately and  resolve their disputes through consultation and dialogue," he  said, adding that China hopes domestic stability is quickly  restored.    Qian made the remarks yesterday in Beijing during a meeting  with Fahim bin Sultan al-Qasimi, secretary-general of the Gulf  Cooperation Council (GCC).    Qian said China hopes to continue to strengthen ties with  the  GCC adding that increased exchanges in recent years have been  very beneficial. He also said the economies of China and Gulf  countries are complementary and there is a bright future for  cooperation.    In the Gulf, Qian said China appreciates the GCC's efforts  to  maintain regional peace and stability. "China believes that the  unsettled questions in the Gulf region have to be solved through  consultation and dialogue among the parties concerned on the  basis of the UN Security Council resolutions," he said.    This will help quickly restore peace and stability and allow  the war-torn countries to develop their national economies,  improve peoples' livelihoods and cultivate regional  co-operation, he said.    Qian also said China has done a great deal and will continue  to work with Gulf nations and the international community to  this end. Al-Qasimi said the Gulf countries want to develop  long-term and friendly relations with China, adding that the two  share similar views on many world and regional issues.    On Tuesday Qian met with former U.S. Secretary of State  Henry  Kissinger in Beijing.    The two exchanged views on regional and global issues and  Sino-US bilateral relations.    After the meeting, Qian hosted a dinner in honour of  Kissinger and his party.    Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu attended both  occasions.    Kissinger arrived in Beijing on Tuesday afternoon to  participate in the International Symposium on the Strategy of  China's Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation at the invitation  of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation.</p>

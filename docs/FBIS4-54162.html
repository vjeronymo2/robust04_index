			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Iwao Nakatani, Hitotsubashi University </F> professor: "Proclaim the Slogan of `Reducing the Price Gap  Between Japan and Other Countries by Half' and Make the  Bureaucracy Assume Responsibility"]    [Text] The three Administrative Reform Promotion  Headquarters [formed during the Hosokawa administration] working  groups, which were taken over by the Hata administration, have  been studying details of deregulation measures so that the final  draft can be released by the end of June.    This writer attended a "Working Group on Import Promotion,  Improvement of Market Access, and Distribution" meeting as a  member. Frankly speaking, under the present situation, I think  the group can hardly hammer out fundamental deregulation  measures that can meet expectations both at home and abroad. It  is almost impossible to alter the government offices' attitude  of defending regulations. They hardly understand the market  mechanism.    This time, like in the past, details of deregulation  measures have been basically decided on by government offices.  Regardless of whether the government offices are doing it  intentionally, they always choose areas where there is little  resistance from industries, where the government offices do not  lose their vested interests, and where they suffer little "pain"  for deregulation. This is the reason for the failure to hammer  out effective deregulation measures.    Although it was obvious that the result would turn out to be  this way, there was no other choice but to entrust government  offices with forming deregulation measures. This is because the  politicians themselves have become "Zoku-giin" [Dietmen who  lobby for business, industris, and particular government  ministries and agnecies], and they help the government offices  defend their vested interests. In addition, there is the fact  that politicians are not well informed about the actual state of  the regulations. Actually, it is impossible not only for  politicians but also for outsiders to understand the very  details of the extremely complicated regulations.    Moreover, in cases where the private sector urges  politicians  to abolish regulations, the private sector has its own motives.  As a matter of course, the private sector will refrain from  talking about benefits resulting from regulations. After all,  only the parties concerned can understand the actual situation  of regulations.    To resolve such a problem and achieve substantial results in  deregulation, it is necessary to create a "situation under which  bureaucrats will benefit by positively promoting deregulations."  In other words, a situation where heavy penalties will be  imposed on those government offices failing to promote  deregulation has to be created.    It is difficult to come up with brilliant ideas. In the  first place, I want to suggest that the basic principle for such  revision should first be clearly stated when reviewing existing  regulations. One of the principles I want to suggest in respect  to the spirit of the recommendations made by the Hiraiwa  Economic Reform Study Council is that "the economy should be  free of control in principle." Another is that "policies that  can be implemented in developed countries should also be applied  to Japan." In other words, it is the principle of not  permitting "Japan's special circumstances" to be used as an  excuse. These two principles should be clearly proclaimed,  government offices should be monitored on whether they proceed  with their tasks according to the principles, and then results  of monitoring should be published. (These tasks are expected to  be assigned to the planned third-party monitoring group,  "Administration Reform Commission").    It is also important to announce concrete targets as the  government's commitments to guarantee that these principles will  be carried out. For example, prices of products at home are now  40 percent higher than those in other developed countries. The  government should set the target of "reducing price differences  by half within five years" as the concrete target for  deregulation. I heard that the ruling coalition parties  discussed this matter during their policy consultations. I  would like the Hata Cabinet to resolutely announce this target  as its official commitment.    To be more precise, the government should announce these  principles and targets and make the government offices assume  the responsibility for carrying them out. If the Hata Cabinet  upholds the target of reducing the price gap by half within five  years, and the government offices assume responsibility for  achieving it, public opinion will enthusiastically support the  Hata Cabinet. The minority Hata Cabinet is ultimately supported  not by cheap tricks in steering Diet affairs but by strong  public support. Therefore, a drastic commitment like this will  be a strong boost to the Hata Cabinet.    Bureaucrats will surely argue that there is no clear  correlation between easing regulation and the price differences  between products sold at home and overseas. They are also  likely to strongly oppose making a commitment to evade assuming  responsibility for reducing the price gap. However, Japan's  economic situation is extremely tough. If the government fails  to diminish the price gap and to lower domestic commodity prices  to a level closer to the present foreign exchange rate, which is  100 yen against the dollar, the Japanese economy cannot survive.    To save the present Japanese economy, I think it is  essential  that the Hata Cabinet do something extraordinary, such as  issuing a "declaration on reducing the price gap between Japan  and other countries by half." While I oppose proclaiming  "numerical targets" as official commitments, I support issuing  this "declaration." I hope Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will  make a courageous decision.</p>

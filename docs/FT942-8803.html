			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Journalist in a class of his own: Obituary of Robert Mauthner Robert Mauthner, who died yesterday at the age of 65, would be proud to be remembered simply as a journalist. But journalists are ten a penny. What marked him out - as a foreign correspondent, diplomatic editor and deputy foreign editor for the Financial Times in a career spanning 25 years, and before that for Reuters - was that he belonged in that rare class of its own: he was the most professional of journalists. His countless colleagues, friends, peers and contacts all knew that he would get it right and write it properly. His stamina was legendary, his fairness and accuracy without equal, his knowledge and experience invaluable. From Prague to Paris, from Helsinki to Kuala Lumpur, he always delivered the goods meticulously, as a reporter, analyst and columnist. Those who worked with him also loved many other qualities. He was an incomparable counsellor and mentor, a role model who always gave his advice and time unstintingly to those below and above him. He was often the first into the office and invariably among the last to leave. Stories, he would say, could not be left to chance. He grieved more than most over mistakes or misinterpretations which he thought the newspaper should have avoided, but he would be as pleased as punch, and generous in his praise, whenever we beat the competition. And he knew when this had happened; he read every newspaper he could lay his hands on with a fine eye - in English, French, German, Dutch and probably a few other languages besides. He came to the FT almost casually. In 1968, having left Reuters in Brussels, he was asked to fill in for our vacationing Bonn correspondent. When Dubcek's Prague spring flowered and with FT foreign correspondents then much thinner on the ground, he was sent to Czechoslovakia, from which he reported with such distinction that when he finally left after the Soviet tanks had rolled in he was immediately recruited to the foreign staff. Three years later, he was chief correspondent in Paris, a post he held for more than 10 years. His affection for and knowledge of France was deep-rooted, but that never affected his detachment. He infused a succession of younger, junior correspondents in the bureau with his standards, to the point that all acknowledge their debt to him. After a stint running the London foreign desk, he picked up the diplomatic beat that was always close to his heart. But he was never content to confine this to coverage of the British foreign office, though he never neglected it. A European by conviction long before it was fashionable, he covered the interstices of the Community's and Nato's security affairs and the implications of the tearing down of the Berlin Wall. Summits were always grist to his mill, whether of the European, Commonwealth, G7, Nato or CSCE variety. At Maastricht in 1991, when so much was happening and when the FT had a large team of experts deployed, there was no other choice but Bob for the unenviable task of pulling it all together into a coherent front page story. Yet, as the map of Europe was changing, he also pulled more than the required weight as deputy foreign editor in London. His advice on whom to move where and when was always wise, as was his judgment of what was important. Successive foreign editors knew they could always leave their charge in his hands. He could be crusty and obstinate. But the more cantankerous he became the more it was apparent that he was standing on principle. If that made others uncomfortable it was a price worth paying for fighting for what he knew to be right. All the above made him exceptionally respected as the professional journalist, the heart, soul and mind of so much of our foreign coverage for a generation. But the sheer sense of loss now consuming his friends and colleagues attests to a much deeper affection extending well outside the newsroom. He was great company, preferably over a good meal and bottle, but also over a bad pub sandwich and a pint. He loved his sports and if rugby was his sneaking favourite, his tastes were catholic. He made us laugh, sometimes with a wonderful line in what might be called poetic doggerel-plus. Even though we all knew he would never really lay down his pen, there was a new flat waiting for him in Paris with his wife Anne for his notional retirement. No spare room would ever have been more permanently booked.                           *      *      *  ----------------------------------------------------------------                   ROBERT MAUTHNER 1929-1994  ---------------------------------------------------------------- 1929 Born in Amsterdam 1939 School in Isle of Wight 1949-52 Wadham College, Oxford 1952 Became British citizen 1952-54 Military service 1954-56 Early journalistic career Wakefield Express 1956-57 Reuters, London 1957-61 English language service, French radio, Paris 1961 Reuters bureau chief in Brussels 1967 Caused flurry in House of Commons with scoop on UK      entry into EEC 1968 FT European correspondent 1971 Paris correspondent 1981 Deputy foreign editor and foreign news editor 1983 Diplomatic correspondent 1992-94 Diplomatic editor  ----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATER BOARD VOTES TO SHUT CASMALIA DUMP  </P> <P> The state Regional Water Quality Control Board approved a proposal Friday that  will shut down the landfills next month at Casmalia Resources, one of two toxic  waste dumps in Southern California.  </P> <P> The state water board voted 6 to 2 at a meeting in Santa Maria to prohibit the  site from accepting regular toxic waste shipments after Nov. 26.  </P> <P> The closure vote was expected because legislation passed in 1984 ordered that  toxic landfills that did not meet new standards would be effectively prohibited  from accepting toxic materials in five years.  </P> <P> Casmalia still will be allowed to accept some waste for the specific purpose of  drying up seepage under the landfills. The water board will give Casmalia up to  one year to complete this process and then will not allow any more waste to be  brought into the site.  </P> <P> While the existing landfills will soon be closed, the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency recently announced a controversial decision to grant draft  permits for new toxic landfills at the site. Casmalia has applied to build two  new toxic landfills and five "evaporation" ponds. But Casmalia's proposal must  first complete the lengthy local, state and federal approval process.  </P></p>

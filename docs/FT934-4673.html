			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Survey of International Fund Management (4): EU failure to agree - Artificial barriers to pension investment Just over three years ago, the European Commission began work on a directive aimed at lifting the barriers to pension fund investment and pension rights mobility across Europe. The goal, in line with other EC directives, was to remove the artificial barriers which countries have constructed to keep their assets at home. But while great strides towards free movement in banking, insurance and investment services have passed the critical hurdles within the EU, free movement in pension investment remains an elusive goal. 'The insurance and banking directives were more far reaching than the pension directive,' said Mr Humbert Drabbe, of the Commission's DG-15, which has been shepherding the directive through the system. 'And those were achieved within one year.' Why liberalising pension fund investment is so thorny, when agreement is possible on banking and insurance, remains a vexing question. But the facts are that last June, the European Commission failed to agree on terms of the directive hammered out over a two-year period, and referred it back to the EU's Internal Market Council. Since then, several meetings of the council have been held to try to work out a compromise which will allow the directive to gain the approval of all member states. But fundamental differences in the style of pension fund provision throughout Europe and varying degrees of dependence on pension scheme assets to fund public sector deficits remain obstacles. The draft rejected by the full council contained three key elements. First, a rule barring countries from requiring minimum degrees of investment in any category or nationality of investment. Second a rule allowing countries to set a maximum investment in any category. And third, a rule barring countries from requiring that more than 60 per cent of liabilities be financed by assets in the same currency. This last rule, which applies to defined benefit final salary schemes, has proved to be perhaps the most controversial one of all. The directive does allow a higher ceiling of 80 per cent to apply to money-purchase defined contribution schemes. The European Federation of Retired People (EFRP), a Europe-wide body representing pension scheme sponsors, is deeply troubled by the directive. 'We would rather have no directive than a bad directive,' said Mr Koen de Ryck, permanent representative. In short, Mr de Ryck says, the directive falls far short of what is needed to help funded pension schemes achieve the kinds of returns they will need to meet retirement bills in the next century. Not only is there extensive academic research to show that currency diversification reduces risk and increases returns, but in some countries domestic markets are too small to absorb all the cash which could potentially be invested in them. Moreover, the directive is more restrictive than what is already allowed in many EC states, thus raising the possibility that some governments will wish to roll back their relatively liberal laws and adopt those in line with the directive. Figures from the EFRP show wide variations in the degree to which European pension schemes invest outside their home country. In the UK and Ireland, the figures are 29.98 and 35 per cent respectively, while Denmark has only 4 per cent of its assets outside the country. And while there are no investment requirements in the UK, Netherlands or Ireland, other countries do set limits both on categories of asset and non-domestic investment. In Germany, purchases of foreign securities are limited to 5 per cent of total assets, while the total equity exposure of a pension scheme is limited to 30 per cent. Switzerland limits total equity investment to 50 per cent of assets, but foreign purchases may be no more than 30 per cent of assets. Denmark, which relies heavily on pension schemes to purchase government debt and mortgage bonds, sets a ceiling on total equity exposure at 40 per cent and foreign purchases at 15 per cent of assets. Given these rules, it is easy to see why some EC states feel the directive goes too far. Several member states, France and Italy in particular, tried hard to raise the 60 per cent currency matching requirement to 80 per cent for all pension schemes. They point to the currency matching requirements of the EC Insurance directive and ask why more liberal investment rules should apply to pensions. Mr Emmanuel Reynaud, pensions researcher at Institute de Recherches Economiques et Sociales, the French labour think tank, said 'One problem with pensions at the European level is that people do not understand each other.' In France, which has almost no funded pension schemes anyway, there is no distinction between pension and insurance. Ironically, the member states which have raised the greatest objections to the liberalising moves are those with the smallest pools of pension scheme assets. France, for instance, relies almost entirely on so-called Pay As You Go financing, in which the current generation of workers pays for its parents' retirement and has almost nothing to invest. For the French, the terms of the EC pensions directive are still academic. With growing public sector deficits, many European governments have kept their eyes on the the potential for domestic pension pools to finance their debts. Among the factors leading to the withdrawal of the proposed directive in June was opposition from the Dutch government. While there are officially no restrictions on pension fund investment there, foreign investment for its huge public sector scheme, the ABP scheme, is limited to 5 per cent of assets. The Dutch tried - and failed - to have the APB scheme exempted from the legislation on the grounds that it is a social security system. Similarly, the French tried and failed to have their AGIRC and ARRCO schemes classified in the same manner. 'I do not believe that there will be a pensions directive,' Mr Reynaud said. Still, Mr Drabbe of DG 15 remains much more optimistic. The Belgians, currently holding the EU presidency, are determined to achieve a directive by the end of their term. But whether it is one which truly liberalises pension investment remains to be seen.</p>

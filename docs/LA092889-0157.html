			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BERMAN URGES IRS TO START TAXING ELKS  </P> <P> Saying the public should not be compelled to subsidize racial discrimination,  Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) has called on the Internal Revenue  Service to revoke the tax-exempt status of the Van Nuys Elks Lodge, which  rejected two black men for membership twice this month.  </P> <P> In a letter to the IRS this week, Berman said the Van Nuys lodge has "forfeited  the right to a tax exemption."  </P> <P> Earlier this month the lodge rejected Jules S. Bagneris III and Thomas J.  Montgomery on the same night two other black men were finally admitted to the  Lompoc lodge after months of controversy. Bagneris and Montgomery reapplied and  last week were rejected for a second time.  </P> <P> Elks officials have repeatedly denied charges of racism. "The men have a right  to vote the way they feel," said Robert Verte, secretary to the national  organization's grand exalted ruler.  </P> <P> Richard Vasquez, a Los Angeles-based IRS agent specializing in tax-exempt  organizations, said the IRS has investigated other fraternal organizations for  alleged civil rights violations in the past, but has never revoked any such  organization's tax-exempt status.  </P></p>

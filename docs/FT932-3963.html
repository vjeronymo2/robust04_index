			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Leading Article: The cost of fighting Aids WITH ITS 14,000 delegates, ranging from scientists and pharmaceutical salesmen to gay activists and Africans in tribal robes, this week's Ninth International Aids Conference in Berlin offers a fat target to critics of the travelling 'Aids circus'. It certainly encourages some to take the view that people who make a living out of Aids have exaggerated its threat to the world's health, in order to frighten governments into giving them more money. But the overwhelming view of the international scientific and medical communities, including those not directly involved in Aids research or care, is that too little is spent on the disease. Although HIV may not be infecting heterosexuals in developed countries as quickly as some epidemiologists predicted five years ago, the ingredients are still in place for an epidemic to spread slowly through Europe and north America over the next decade or two. There is already a full-scale Aids epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa (claims to the contrary are simply wrong) and soon there will probably be one in southern Asia. The world now spends roughly as much on Aids research as it does on cancer or heart disease - about Pounds 2bn a year. Of this about two-thirds comes from governments and the remainder from the pharmaceutical industry. Rigorous control and co-ordination of such rapidly mobilised programmes always presents difficulties. It may also seem a lot to spend on a disease that has so far infected 'only' 14m people worldwide and killed 2.5m altogether. Its toll is still much smaller than heart disease and cancer in industrialised countries or tuberculosis and malaria in the third world. But Aids requires a special effort because it is new and unpredictable and is increasing far more rapidly than established killer diseases. Conservative forecasts suggest a doubling of victims by the end of the decade. The nightmare scenario is that the fast-changing virus might mutate into a significantly more infectious strain. To those infected with HIV, research appears to make agonisingly slow progress. Sometimes it may even seem to move backwards, as for example when the Concorde clinical trial revealed the deficiencies of AZT. But the Berlin conference shows that real advances are being made. Eventually science should give doctors vaccines to prevent HIV infection and drugs to control the disease in those who are already infected. A valuable spin-off will be much new knowledge of virology and immunology that can be used to fight other diseases or even to understand basic processes such as ageing. Nor should it be forgotten that the world knows how to stop Aids spreading: to discourage unprotected sex between strangers and the sharing by drug users of needles, and to screen public blood supplies for HIV. Support for Aids prevention programmes in developing countries is another genuinely high priority.</p>

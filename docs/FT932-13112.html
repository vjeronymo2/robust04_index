			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Unitised plans, are savers getting a raw deal? - Millions are buying them but there are growing concerns over their complexity and how they are being marketed ON MONDAY, a select group of learned actuaries will gather in Staple Inn Hall to debate the subject of so-called unitised with-profits (UWP) contracts. These are not just of academic interest - they are being bought by millions of savers every year. Some fear that marketing men may have created unrealistic expectations among policyholders, and many believe UWP products should be designed more consistently. Actuaries are concerned because they are the professionals responsible primarily for the soundness of life assurance companies. Many of these life offices are now marketing UWP plans to supplement or replace the traditional with-profits contracts which have been around, in various forms, for over a century. Unitised plans have been marketed only since the mid-1980s, but are mushrooming. If you have bought any kind of with-profits bond - a form of single-premium life assurance savings contract - it falls into this category. Most of the personal pension plans taken out recently are also unitised. Under a unitised with profits policy, the investor buys units, on which bonuses are added each year rather than, as with a conventional with profits policy, to the sum assured. The idea is that the investor finds it easier to understand the policy and there is less of a strain on the insurance company's reserves in the early years. Regular-premium endowment plans continue more often to be traditional than unitised but Standard Life, the market leader, has switched all its mortgage endowments to the unitised structure. Actuaries want to be sure that these contracts are based soundly so that, where they offer investment guarantees, there is no risk that freak conditions could involve the company in big losses. The public probably need not worry about such matters, but there are more general worries. Chiefly, these concern the sheer complexity and unpredictability of UWP products. Even the companies which designed and introduced them may not be sure how all their features will be applied over the long term. Some time bombs may be ticking. The ultimate danger is that people will find they have bought a pig in a poke. A with-profits contract is designed to permit normal investment risks to be smoothed out, but the risks cannot be eliminated completely  - not unless they are borne, possibly unfairly, by other types of policyholder. Actuaries are committed to satisfy the 'reasonable expectations' of policyholders. But unless these unitised plans are knocked into some sort of consistent order, and are explained properly to investors, it will be hard - perhaps impossible - to define what a reasonable expectation might be. If millions of savers are disappointed because of some future stock market crash, the reputation of the life industry could be damaged seriously. Two separate documents will be discussed on Monday. The main attention will focus on a paper produced by John O'Neill and Howard Froggatt from Bacon &amp; Woodrow, an independent firm of consulting actuaries. (This is, incidentally, the same firm which upset the industry recently by saying that with-profits personal pension plans should not be touched with a bargepole at present because companies have been paying out too much in bonuses). Over the next few years, B &amp; W says, companies will have to rebuild their reserves and returns will be better on the alternative form of contract, the unit-linked plans which are invested directly in underlying portfolios. The other document is the report of a working party of the English and Scottish actuarial institutes. This will comment on the results of a survey of leading life offices. Unfortunately, it will not be published until Monday; but the chairman of the working party, David Purchase, said it had thrown up some interesting material in a largely uncharted field. Why has the life industry switched away from traditional with-profits contracts to the unitised form? There are several reasons, according to O'Neill and Froggatt, who say: A desire to apply the smoothed with-profits approach to single-premium (or lump sum) investments led to the introduction of with-profits bonds. Bonuses on traditional with-profits contracts are having to be cut. Unitised products have been seen by some offices as a way of starting again, with bonuses initially at a lower level. Traditional contracts were fine for constant premiums but were hard to adapt to personal pensions where premiums often vary substantially with earnings. Unitised plans were seen as the answer. Companies wish to offer policyholders the option of switching their unit-linked contracts into with-profit funds which can make sense, for instance, when pension plan-holders are approaching retirement age and need to reduce their investment risks. Some companies have been running short of capital, and unitised plans tie up fewer reserves than traditional with-profits contracts, at least in the early stages. Ultimately, though, there is no magic in UWP contracts. Volatile investment returns cannot be smoothed out completely, and there must from time to time be losers as well as winners among the policyholders (which is why B &amp; W has told its clients to avoid with-profits pensions). As for the marketing hype, the life assurance regulator, Lautro, has reprimanded several life offices selling with-profits bonds for not making it clear enough that bonuses and capital values can go down. Thus, controversy surrounds the notorious market value adjusters (sometimes called market value adjustment factors) which are part of the small print of UWP plans. Life offices have the right to apply an MVA in difficult investment conditions - jargon for saying that the cash-in unit value of with-profit bonds and other UWP products may be cut, so savers could get back less than they put in. Exactly when should MVAs be imposed, though? 'An office needs not only to use its MVA appropriately but also to make sure that its policyholders are aware of the use,' say O'Neill and Froggatt. Purchase also is concerned that market practice on MVAs is too vague for policyholders. 'This is an area where the actuarial profession should be giving some guidance,' he says. O'Neill and Froggatt say, somewhat surprisingly, that few offices have actually applied MVAs so far. Others suggest that write-downs have been comparatively common, although MVAs may be applied to different types of policy in different ways. Despite the doubts, however, O'Neill and Froggatt say that UWP contracts potentially are more transparent and open than traditional with-profits plans. Like it or not, UWP is here to stay.</p>

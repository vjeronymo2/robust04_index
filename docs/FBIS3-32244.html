According to a press  release from the crisis committee, the objectives of the 25  January resolution asking business people to close their doors  from 28 January to 9 February were reasserted during a meeting  between the crisis committee and members of the resigning  government. The press release adds that some progress has been  achieved. Additional meetings will be held on this topic on  Thursday, 3 February, with national and international guests.  The crisis committee of the Haitian private sector states that  cooperation with the protest movement is increasing, translating  the exasperation of a population facing arbitrary, inopportune  sanctions that are being imposed on the nation by certain  countries in the international community. Furthermore, this  committee invites all the media which do not regularly receive  press releases to contact the secretariat of the Chamber of  Commerce and Industry of Haiti as soon as possible.    It should be pointed out that the president of the Chamber  of  Commerce and Industry of Haiti, Raymond Roy, exchanged bitter  words with Mr. Schrager of the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince.  Chamber of Commerce President Roy, who is also a member of the  crisis committee, called Stanley Schrager's comments on the  Haitian employers' movement untimely and biased. The diplomat  had described the resolution of the Haitian employers, announced  on 25 January, involving the temporary suspension of commercial  and industrial activities in the country until 9 February as a  means of demanding a solution to the crisis and the lifting of  the embargo, as dramatic.    The president of the Chamber of Commerce, in a press release  issued on 2 February, pointed out that in the interest of  protecting the constructive, harmonious relations with the  United States while there is still time, the crisis committee of  the private sector had asked the diplomats accredited in Haiti  to avoid comments that could aggravate tensions.</p>

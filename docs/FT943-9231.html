			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Mysterious analysis of Italian bond performance Sir, We are flattered by the attention that the FT dedicates to the Italian bond market. One of your columnists, Barry Riley, seems to be particularly intrigued and amused by the Italian Treasury operations, especially with regard to our 30-year bond. For example, he defined last November's launch of this bond as a curious phenomenon. He implied that no investor with any good sense would hold this paper to maturity. In fact, he argued, even if the Italian government were to repay this bond in 2023, that the money would hardly be worth a cup of espresso ('Italy adds another dimension to debt', November 17 1993). Although we value a good cup of coffee highly in Italy, we did not take that as a compliment. Recently, while commenting on the French financial situation ('Airline cracks in the French financial facade', August 3), he reminded FT readers of how wise his judgment on the Italian 30-year bond had been. Reason: the yield of that bond had gone up from under 10 per cent (last November) to about 11 1/2 per cent (in early August). At this point we started wondering how Mr Riley values the success of a bond. Certainly he could not simply judge, as it appears from the article, on the basis of gross yields, taken out of context. Mr Riley must have some benchmark in mind against which to measure the performance of the Italian 30-year bond. We were puzzled. Could he be comparing the performance of 30-year Italian bonds with that of comparable bonds issued in other countries? No. Thirty-year bonds worldwide, like all other medium- and long-term bonds, have experienced a substantial increase in their yield since the beginning of the year. The Italian bond is not unique in this respect. Could he instead be looking at the performance of 30-year bonds relative to other Treasury bonds of different maturity? No. The spread between 30 and 10-year bonds in Italy moved well within the range displayed by the other major countries. We have run out of ideas: Riley's analysis must be much more sophisticated than our own simplistic way of thinking. Like several of my colleagues at the Treasury, I am about to go on holiday. We are all relieved to learn, however, that Riley's column will resume on September 14; well after we will be coming back from our vacanze. This way we will be sure not to miss any of his insights. One day we hope to understand them. M Masi, head of press office, Ministry of the Treasury, Rome, Italy</p>

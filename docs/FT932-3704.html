			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Payouts to terrorists no longer qualify for tax relief BRIBES or protection money paid to terrorists would no longer be tax deductible under draft rules announced by the government yesterday. Purchasers of stolen goods or importers of illegal drugs could also no longer expect Inland Revenue inspectors to offset their business expenses against their tax bill. Payments which themselves constitute the commission of a criminal offence would not be subsidised by the taxpayer, according to a proposed amendment to the finance bill put forward by the chief secretary to the Treasury. These include offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act (such as bribes) and the Prevention of Terrorism Act (which deals with the payment of protection money). At present, any expenses incurred 'wholly, necessarily and exclusively' for the purposes of a trade can in principle qualify for relief. The Inland Revenue, however, conceded yesterday that it had no qualms about accepting tax from shady enterprises. It said: 'Legality has not strictly been a deciding factor. 'We hope we have not been aiding and abetting these activities but it is possible that some have in the past been regarded as part of a lump sum figure of necessary expenditure.' Just this point was at issue in a High Court court action three years ago by Ms Lindi St Claire, who argued that the Inland Revenue would be living off immoral earnings if it taxed her income as a prostitute and brothel-keeper. She lost. Asked whether any equipment required by brothels would be allowable against tax, the Inland Revenue said: 'I don't think we've looked at it on that wide a scale.' One compensation remains for those involved in illicit activities who are honest enough to admit it to the tax authorities. The Inland Revenue stressed that it was bound by confidentiality and could not disclose to the police any details of illegal activities it unearthed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Abel Sardina] </F>   [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 4 Jun (PL) -- Directors of  scientific activities from 17 countries meeting here urged  Ibero-American rulers to reinforce investment to "consolidate  scientific and technological capacities."    Following three days of debate in this Colombian city,  participants think that scientific-technical consolidation is  essential "due to the impact it has on improving competitiveness  and employment in our economies, as well as the well-being of  our society."    The conference on sustained financing for technological  investigation and development in Ibero-America approved the  conclusions the previous day. These will be handed to the heads  of state and government of Spain, Portugal, and the 19 countries  of Iberic origin, which will meet here 14-15 June.    "Sustained growth in public investment in innovation must be  reinforced in order to consolidate the incipient modernization  processes of the productive apparatus and to induce businesses  to participate in the financing of these activities," the  recommendations state, according to what was learned today by  PRENSA LATINA.    The directors of scientific, technological, and  investigative  activities also think that "the decisive participation of the  three multilateral credit organizations is essential."  Likewise, they recommended persisting in investigative and  development efforts, "despite the macroeconomic limitations  imposed by pressing social priorities." To this end they argued  that, if this is not done, "the region's project to remain  competitive in world trade and to use science to improve the  people's conditions, can be seriously compromised."    A press communique on the talks recognized Cuba's effort in  training masses of professionals and investigators in basic  sectors as "a notable example of what is sought" in this field.    Cuba's Dr. Rosa Elena Simeon, minister of science,  technology, and environment, speaking with PRENSA LATINA, thinks  that Latin American countries do not have the  technical-scientific base required to enter the free competition  imposed by free trade and the GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade] agreements.    The meeting also had representatives from Argentina,  Bolivia,  Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Spain, Guatemala, Honduras,  Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Uruguay, Portugal, and  Venezuela.</p>

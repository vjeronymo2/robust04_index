			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Banesto sets out rights issue investor profile BANESTO, the Spanish commercial bank, wrongly identified one the main investors in the planned Dollars 457m rights issue it announced on Tuesday. Banesto's press release said 'General Electric, which has a Triple A rating, has undertaken to invest Dollars 25m' in the issue. It later confirmed that the US financial institution was, in fact, GE Capital. A statement issued yesterday by JP Morgan, the US bank co-ordinating Banesto's bid to raise a total of Dollars 1.2bn in fresh capital, said the actual investor was GE Pension Trust, GEPT, which manages as a fiduciary the pension funds of GE employees. GEPT, which has its own independent investment activity, is a passive participant in the so-called Corsair Fund, a portfolio managed by JP Morgan which is investing Dollars 200m in Banesto's rights issue.</p>

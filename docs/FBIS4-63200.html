			<p>BFN     [Text] "The Ukrainian leadership's decision to deploy a  group of national guards and specially trained troops in the  Crimea is fraught with serious consequences primarily for  Ukraine itself. It cannot fail to give rise to concern in  Moscow," a senior member of Russia's Foreign Ministry in charge  of Russian-Ukrainian relations told INTERFAX on Friday.    According to him, "now the danger of displaying extremism by  both Kiev and Simferopol, with all the ensuing consequences, is  greater than ever before."    "We do not back the Crimean radicals, of course.  Nevertheless Ukraine, which is, speaking figuratively, in  another weight division, should behave as it befits a big  power," the diplomat said.    So far the Crimean people have acted in the framework of  democratic procedures, without violating Ukrainian legislation,  he noted. "As regards Kiev, it is not quite clear how it  interprets democracy and contemporary international law. To  despatch troops is not a good way out of the situation," said  INTERFAX's interviewee.    According to him, "if events in the Crimea develop in the  same vein, this might grow into a long-term conflict." "The  experience of the former Yugoslavia shows that playing with fire  ends in a big blaze," he said.    Ukraine "can hardly find anything wrong in Russia's  behavior," the diplomat pointed out. "It's characteristic that  neither Russia's president and government nor parliament have  made any official statements or taken sharp steps so far," he  said.    Nevertheless, Kiev "has not abandoned its attempts to find a  foe from without," said INTERFAX's interviewee.    On Wednesday the press service of Ukraine's president  released a statement to the effect that "dangerous processes in  the Crimea are stimulated by some Russian politicians, whose  actions acquired the signs of open interference in Ukraine's  internal affairs of late." "We do not even want to comment on  such statements; Let them remain on Ukraine's conscience," the  Russian diplomat said.</p>

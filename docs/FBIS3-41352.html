			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lao </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] An international narcotics trafficker, Mr. Bue Xoua,  30, a U.S.citizen, was arrested by Lao police in Vientiane on 13  December. He had 1.5 kilograms of refined opium which he was  preparing to mail through the Lao postal system.    Following an investigation by the counternarcotics police,  he  confessed to officials that he had received money to buy opium  from Mr. (Yorker), an American citizen living in California.    After receiving the money, on 24 November, Bue Xoua entered  Laos under the pretext of visiting relatives for the Hmong New  Year. On arrival, he sought to buy opium from bad elements in  Laos. He refined it so as to decrease the volume for  convenience in shipment. Then he hid the opium inside stuffed  cat dolls. He then wrapped the dolls as if they were gifts,  sending them under the name of Mr. Thongtak in Hom District.  (This was an alias created by Bue Xoua himself.) He sent them  to Mrs. (Fervilameui) in California.</p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: British Sugar calls off talks to buy stake in San Francisco refiner British Sugar, the beet processing and marketing division of Associated British Foods, has called off talks to buy a stake in a San Francisco-based cane sugar refiner. The discussions with Californian and Hawaiian Sugar Refinery, which were disclosed in March last year, appear to have failed over the price British Sugar was prepared to pay. C&amp;H is a co-operative owned by the Hawaiian cane sugar growers who send their raw cane to the refinery for processing and distribution. It is the leading brand of sugar in the west of the US. However, C&amp;H's co-operative status meant that all the growers had to agree the deal and this seems to have proved impossible. C&amp;H would have been British Sugar's first non-UK investment apart from two factories it owns in Poland.</p>

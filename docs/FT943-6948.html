			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Siberian miners to be resettled Fifty thousand Russian coal miners and their families will be resettled by the government as their mines in northern Siberia are closed down, senior coal industry officials said yesterday. The miners live in settlements where the pits are the only source of employment, and have little possibility of finding alternative employment if the government resists pressure to bail out failing state enterprises with inflationary soft loans. Mr Yuri Malyshev, head of Rosugol, the state coal producers' association, said that 50,000 coal miners and their families from the mining settlement of Vorkuta and the northern region as a whole would be resettled over the next few years. However, so far only 500 families have been resettled in more hospitable southern areas of the country and to date Rosugol has acquired only 1,800 flats for the mining families. Russian coal production was down 12 per cent in the first half of this year compared with last year. Two thousand Russian farmers, members of the Agrarian party, and communists demonstrated yesterday against President Boris Yeltsin and his government, saying ill-conceived reforms were wrecking the nation's agriculture and rural life. Mr Mikhail Lapshin, head of the Agrarian Party, told the rally in Moscow that the farmers wanted fair prices for their produce, timely payment and freedom from debts. Agriculture ministry officials say promised funds for this year's purchases, due to be made at market prices after negotiations, have not been made available.</p>

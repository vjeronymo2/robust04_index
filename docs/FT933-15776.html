			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Sterling Publishing advances to Pounds 5.3m STERLING Publishing Group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.31m for the year to end-March as new accounting rules forced the company to restate last time's results as an Pounds 8.09m loss. Adopting FRS 3, the publisher of advertising-financed journals restated the 1992 figures from a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.05m by reclassifying extraordinary provisions as exceptional charges. The provisions allowed for disposals following an abortive diversification as well as a Pounds 1.7m write-down of intangible assets. Operating profits rose to Pounds 6.56m against a restated Pounds 1.52m as turnover rose to Pounds 42m (Pounds 41.6m), including Pounds 7.63m from discontinued operations. The company added 18 new titles in its core trading subsidiaries, Sterling Publications and Cornhill Publications. Ms Clare Whitley, finance director, said advertising rates had been maintained and there had been growth in the exhibitions business. Interest charges dropped to Pounds 1.25m (Pounds 1.89m), reflecting lower rates towards the end of the financial year and reduced borrowings. Net borrowings were Pounds 12.1m (Pounds 17.8m) at the year-end. Ms Whitley said gearing now stood at about 55 per cent. She said the balance sheet figure for fixed assets of Pounds 27.8m (Pounds 28.3m) did not include a value for internally generated titles which directors estimate at about Pounds 30m, giving gearing of some 25 per cent. Mr Ronald Cohen, chairman, said the company's telephone sales operations allowed it to target potential advertisers worldwide: 'This has been particularly important over the last year with the continuing weakness in the US and UK economies and the developing recession in western Europe.' Fully diluted earnings per share on continuing operations rose to 7.8p (1.5p). A proposed final dividend of 2.4p gives a total for the year of 3p (2.5p).</p>

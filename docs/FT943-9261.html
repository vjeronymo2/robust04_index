			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Growers chip away at potato board When Mr Andrew Cullen learnt that potato growers were to be balloted on whether to keep the Potato Marketing Board, he saw it as a chance to 'settle an old score'. He is voting to wind up the 60-year-old board after years of resentment about its system of quotas and intervention buying, which he believes penalised efficient growers and allowed imported potatoes to steal their markets. 'The Potato Marketing Board is a misnomer,' complained Mr Cullen, who grows 40 hectares of potatoes near Harwich, Essex. 'They don't market a single damn spud. The only thing they do is to be a fairly efficient gatherer of statistics. But anyone could do that. It doesn't need an army of bureaucrats.' The potato industry has been split since a group of 420 producers exercised its right to call a poll of the country's 15,000 growers last month on the future of the board and its potato marketing scheme. Voting closes today and the result should be known on August 23. If the vote goes against the board, the services it provides will be wound up overnight and its 170 staff will be given three months' notice. Government plans to replace the board in 1997 with a promotional and research body will end. Growers will have to set up their own 'industry council' if they want to develop and market a product which brings farmers Pounds 325m in annual sales. Twenty miles from Mr Cullen's farm, Mr Tony Evans grows 15 hectares of potatoes. He criticised the board as old-fashioned and slow to recognise 'that the consumer is king', but wants to keep it. He said: 'If you've got something, you should make it better rather than abandon it. If we let it go now, I don't think we'll have anything in three years' time.' The battle started last November when the government announced that the board would lose its statutory power to support prices by buying potatoes in a glut. The system of quotas which confined growers to a fixed output each year was loosened and the board was slimmed down. The potato marketing scheme was to be wound up over three years and producers would decide the functions of a successor body. But the government's action brought disenchantment to the surface. Once the main function of the board - intervention buying - disappeared, many growers were reluctant to continue paying high levies, even when these were cut by 44 per cent to Pounds 48 a hectare this year. Mr Graham Solari, the Shropshire grower who heads the 420 rebels under the banner of the Potato Producer Poll Campaign, said his supporters agreed that the potato industry needed research, promotion and market information. 'We do not believe, however, that those tasks should cost growers Pounds 7m a year via the PMB. The board was created, equip-ped and staffed for a bygone age. It is no longer relevant to modern potato production.' He said he had discussed with the government plans for a 'lean and efficient' successor body which would hire consultants as needed and should cost no more than Pounds 2m a year - about Pounds 15 a hectare. The board, backed by the National Farmers' Union, argues that this level of spending would be a waste of growers' money. Mr Alasdair Fairbairn, its chief executive, said: 'It would be impossible to fund effective programmes on such a flimsy, shoestring budget, therefore weakening growers' ability to compete in national and international markets.' He proposes a levy of Pounds 35 a hectare for the successor body. Mr Cullen is convinced that British growers can compete with Continental rivals without the board. But he is pessimistic about the outcome of the vote: 'I think they'll hang on by the skin of their teeth.'</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Letter: When a secretary deserves a manager's rate of pay Sir, I was interested in your article titled 'Secretaries are undervalued' (March 30). While I agree that this is the case, I have no objections to managers making use of the new technology and secretaries doing research etc. Surely, however, each should be paid different rates for the proportion of their time spent on the different tasks that they perform. The savings on the proportion of the time that managers are paid at the rate of a typist/secretary when doing basic tasks would enable the secretary's rate to be increased for the proportion of her/his time that is spent doing research etc. M Callender, 36 Broadlake, Willaston, South Wirral</p>

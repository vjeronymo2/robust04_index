			<p>BFN     [Text] Doha, 18 May (WAKH)--Yemeni Foreign Minister  Muhammad Salim Basindwah has set four conditions for beginning a  cease-fire, namely, recognizing legitimacy and the Constitution,  resorting to the Constitution, the merger of the Armed Forces'  units, and the surrender of the southern leaders to the  legitimate leadership.    At a news conference he gave in Doha today at the end of his  visit to the State of Qatar, the Yemeni minister said that the  southern leaders' failure to meet these conditions will mean  their inevitable end.    He asserted that secession is impossible, pointing out that  Yemen will never again return to partition.    He added that what is happening is that the Yemeni  leadership  is defending legitimacy and the Constitution, adding that the  legitimate leadership is eager to end the bloodshed, but that  fighting has been imposed on it.</p>

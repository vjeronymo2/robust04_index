			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (At A Glance): F&amp;C increases dividend Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust, the UK's largest trust, this week announced an 11.6 per cent increase in its final dividend, the 21st annual increase. Net assets per share rose 21.6 per cent in 1991. The graph shows how the trust has outperformed the All-Share during much of the 1980s, thanks in part to a narrowing of the discount to net assets. Since 1965, Foreign &amp; Colonial's share price has grown 2,133 per cent, while the All-Share has risen by 470 per cent.</p>

			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / 'Star Trek' scan for disease ready: British Association for the Advancement of Science similar to those depicted in science-fiction programmes such as Star Trek - already exist and some may eventually be available for home use, Professor Anthony Turner, head of biotechnology at Cranfield Institute of Technology, told the meeting. Prof Turner said sophisticated new biosensors and sensitive diagnostic tests were already being used to monitor glucose levels in diabetics and to detect pregnancy within a fortnight of conception. The future of biosensors - accurate detectors created by the linking of biology and electronics - looks assured. Medisense, the biotechnology company based in Abingdon, Buckinghamshire, has developed a kit which allows diabetics to monitor their blood glucose levels from a single drop of blood, giving accurate results in 20 seconds. Magazines aimed at women aged between 16 and 35 carry advertisements for products using biosensors, such as a home ovulation kit to determine their chance of pregnancy and a kit which can detect success within a minute. Both rely on the sensitivity of antibodies which latch on to substances produced by ovulating or pregnant women. Prof Turner said research was under way in Japan on ways of allowing tests carried out by biosensors in casualty departments to be used at home as a form of preventative medicine. However, he warned: 'I'm not sure it's completely worked through.'</p>

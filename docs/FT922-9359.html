			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Russia and India to end barter trade TRADE between Russia and India, seriously disrupted in the past year with the break-up of the Soviet Union, is expected to resume soon on a hard currency basis. 'Rupee' trade, the barter system used by the two countries for three decades will end. The two nations are to sign a memorandum of understanding this week. The payments will now be credited and debited to a central account with India's central bank. The bank hopes trade will be balanced so that there is no outflow of dollars. Mr Gennady Burbulis, the Russian secretary of state, who visited New Delhi this week, said his country stood by the trade protocol signed earlier this year. For India, the most important exports from Russia are crude oil and petroleum products worth Dollars 650m this year. India has agreed to provide a credit of Dollars 85m to enable Russia to buy four agricultural commodities - tea, coffee, tobacco and spices. Further credits will be made available as the flow of trade increases.</p>

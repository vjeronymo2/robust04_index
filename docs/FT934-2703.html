			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / EU Summit: Clarke's capers cut little ice - The UK chancellor's startling summit debut Mr Kenneth Clarke prides himself on being one of the British cabinet's good Europeans. He owns up to believing in a single European currency. He speaks of the post-Maastricht European Union without biting his lip. Mr John Major prefers still to refer to the European Community. But the chancellor of the exchequer's performance in Brussels over the past week has left more than a few of his European counterparts perplexed and not a little irritated. Mr Clarke himself appears characteristically unperturbed. Last week started with him denouncing Mr Jacques Delors' white paper on growth, competitiveness and unemployment even before he had seen the final version. By the end of the summit the new boy on the Brussels block was boasting that the finance ministers had successfully 'filleted' the document before it was incorporated in the conclusions of their leaders. Those conclusions would not require the British government to 'change any item of its policy'. In between Mr Clarke had denounced Mr Delors for trying to slip the document past the finance ministers. Overall, it was not a performance to endear him either to Mr Delors or to colleagues from other European capitals. 'Why does he behave like this?' asked one bemused Commission official. It is partly a question of style. Good Europeans are supposed to behave like the urbane Mr Dougals Hurd, the foreign secretary, fighting their national corner with softly spoken charm and sophistication. Mr Clarke, who hails from the street-corner school of politics so admired in the British House of Commons, has not learnt to speak the language of diplomacy. An instinctively rumbustious politician, he perhaps never will. So plans for the Community to raise an extra Ecu40bn (Pounds 30.5bn) for infrastructure projects through Union Bonds were not 'misguided' or even 'mistaken'. They were nonsense, nothing more than an attempt to catch an easy headline. Nor was he modest in his claims for British achievements at the summit. Europe's decision to back supply-side policies aimed at lowering employment costs, boosting competitiveness and deregulating markets had demonstrated the UK was firmly in the European mainstream. Understandably perhaps, he was more reticent about the fact that the central elements of Mr Delors' white paper had been endorsed by other governments. British officials are convinced that his European colleagues will get used to Mr Clarke's rougher edges - and will discern through the occasional bluster a genuine commitment to Europe. The chancellor's own assessment at the end of the week was typically uncompromising: 'My credentials are impeccably European.'</p>

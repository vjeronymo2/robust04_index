			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> WYOMING: 32-IN. SNOW; KANSAS: WINDS  </P> <P> A howling winter storm blanketed part of Wyoming with 32 inches of snow, then  plowed into the nation's midsection, where snowdrifts shut down roads and  schools in Wisconsin and 66 m.p.h. winds raked drought-stricken Kansas. The  National Weather Service said 32 inches of snow buried Burgess Junction, Wyo.,  since the storm began Monday afternoon and 18 inches hit Story, Wyo. Blowing  and drifting snow closed schools and highways in the northwestern corner of  Wisconsin, and the weather service said the storm dropped up to 10 inches of  snow in parts of the Dakotas and Minnesota. Forecasters posted winter storm  warnings and high wind advisories from the Dakotas into upper Michigan. More  than a foot of blowing, drifting snow was expected in several areas. The storm  was blamed for icy roads that caused the crash of a school bus and a garbage  truck in the Minneapolis suburb of Plymouth, shaking up a number of children.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Roman </F> Krasnicky in Prague; date not given: "The Regions' Jurisdiction  Could Be Like an Explosive"]    [Text] [Krasnicky] Is the Czech Republic ready to take  part in the Partnership for Peace plan and in regular military  exercises with NATO states?    [Klaus] Partnership for Peace, as a global concept, does not  say anything about the frequency of contacts between individual  countries and NATO. This will be a matter for the next stage --  the conclusion of specific treaties between NATO and the  individual countries that want to join the Partnership. Only  then will the scope and intensity of this cooperation be  specified. Undoubtedly, there will be major differences between  countries. Undoubtedly, the Czech Republic's interests will be  different than those of Kazakhstan. Therefore, let us not jump  the gun. Nevertheless, it is evident that the financial aspect  will play a role here. Of course, to assume that this will lead  to an increase in our expenditure on defense is unrealistic.    [Krasnicky] Have you seen the actual text of Partnership for  Peace?    [Klaus] I have seen it in the form of a xeroxed fax, but I  think that, at the moment, there is no need to hurry. The  Foreign Ministry will submit the appropriate material to the  government at the appropriate time and will also draft a  response to the North Atlantic Alliance.    [Krasnicky] There has been talk recently about citizenship  for the Volhynian Czechs and Czechs from Kazakhstan have shown  an interest in returning to the republic. What is the reason  behind the government's caution in dealing with these issues?    [Klaus] The main reason for the caution was -- and, to a  certain extent, still is -- our attempt not to complicate the  internal situation in the Czech Republic by unexpected and  excessive migration. This was a topical issue mainly during the  breakup of Czechoslovakia. At that time, we required  unambiguous and precise conditions so that, in the individual  human sphere, we could clearly determine who was a citizen of  the Czech Republic and who was a citizen of Slovakia. On the  other hand, a few individuals -- whether Volhynian Czechs or  anyone else -- are really extreme cases that do not cause any  major problems in our country. The principal caution was not  directed against them.    [Krasnicky] The government will draw up a concept for the  jurisdiction of the future regions or lands before the end of  January. Why do you think the law on this jurisdiction has to  be a constitutional law? In the opinion of some experts,  jurisdiction should be a variable and not something preserved by  a constitutional law....    [Klaus] Jurisdiction is a terribly important issue and -- as  we saw once within the framework of the Czechoslovak state --  was the explosive that constantly destabilized relations between  the partners. We do not want anything like this to happen in  the united and unitary Czech Republic; we do not want to  introduce any federalistic and autonomistic elements into it.  On the contrary, I would again say that a constitutional law is  not necessary to change the border, for example, between south  Bohemia and central Bohemia because of a single zigzagging  stream whose flow has changed.</p>

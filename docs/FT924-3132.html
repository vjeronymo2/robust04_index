			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / International Company News: S African mines in R3.5bn project SOUTH Africa's two mining giants - Anglo American and Gencor - have confirmed that they will be proceeding with their R3.5bn (Dollars 1.1bn) joint venture stainless steel project. It is the fourth large capital development to be announced by the two groups in the past two months. Construction of the plant, about 120km east of Johannesburg, will start in January. The project - an expansion of the existing Columbus plant - is a joint venture between Anglo and Gencor and the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) who will be equal one-third equity partners. It exemplifies the trend underway in South Africa to add value to mineral resources rather than export them in raw form. Columbus has ready access to ferrochrome and nickel, the main ingredients of stainless steel. Not only does South Africa have most of the world's chrome ore reserves, but Columbus will also be able to source all its nickel requirements locally. The expansion will quadruple South Africa's stainless steel capacity to 500,000 tonnes a year from the existing 125,000 tonnes. It will turn South Africa into the world's sixth-largest stainless steel producing country. Two factors made the project viable: the acquisition, in September 1991, by an Anglo-Gencor consortium of Middelburg Steel and Alloys (MS&amp;A) plus tax allowances. Mr Gilbertson declined to elaborate on the returns the project was expected to make. The project should increase value-added to raw materials by 40 to 50 per cent. It is expected to earn R16bn in foreign exchange in 1993 terms in the first 25 years of its life. Present world demand for stainless steel is about 11m tonnes a year, with demand presently increasing at about 3.5 to 5 per cent a year.</p>

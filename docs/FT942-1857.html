			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Sony The music industry will be relieved at Sony's court victory over pop star George Michael. Defeat could have led other grumpy pop stars to break their contracts. The rot could even have spread to other industries based on intellectual property such as book publishing or film production. Even so, Sony's victory is something of a hollow one. The Japanese electronics giant will not be able to force George Michael to produce a stream of smash hits between now and 2003. Sony's hard line may even deter other artists from signing up with its music arm. It is, of course, easy to understand how Sony got into a no-win situation. When music companies promote a particular album, they are marketing not just the particular songs but the artist. So it is natural to try to recoup their investment over a series of albums by signing long-term contracts. A similar phenomenon is increasingly apparent in the book world where some novelists receive multi-million dollar contracts for committing themselves to write a series of pot boilers for a single publisher. But the George Michael case shows that such contracts on their own contain little value. The lesson for all companies dealing in intellectual property is that a legally solid contract is a poor substitute for a good relationship.</p>

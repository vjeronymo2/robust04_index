			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  SUNDAY TIMES </H8>   IEC's `Monumental Incompetence' Viewed--"The elections were  declared free and fair on Friday [29 April] by Mr Justice  Kriegler...and his view was immediately endorsed by the leaders  of the two main political parties, Mr F W de Klerk and Mr  Mandela." So begins Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 1  May in a page-24 editorial. "However, in looking forward it is  necessary to hold in mind the lessons of the monumental  incompetence with which the Independent Electoral Commission  [IEC] conducted these elections. Those lessons, by no  coincidence, confirm the message transmitted by the breakdown of  the National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF]. In both cases, we  flirted with disaster. Both institutions sprang from a  suspicion, more prevalent among political elites than among the  people at large, that no institution of government can be  trusted if it seems to represent the old regime. Behind the  formation of the NPKF lay a naive belief that ill-trained and  ill-disciplined irregulars could be welded in a matter of weeks  into a professional army." "Similarly, the IEC was born of  distrust of the Department of Home Affairs, the only institution  in the country which -- with the backing of the SA Police and  the SADF [South African Defense Force] -- might have conducted  orderly, properly controlled elections. The attempt to create  an `independent' substitute organisation, as it turned out,  became more of a threat to the transition than a help." "As Mr  de Klerk is fond of saying, we only have one SADF, one police  force, and one civil service. We also have, more amorphously,  only one business class. Whether the government of national  unity is to have any hope of satisfying the reasonable  expectations of the people who, in their millions, have given it  a mandate, depends on these existing institutions. The callow  socialist ideologues who surround Mr Mandela have had two vivid  demonstrations of what happens when they, unlettered and  inexperienced, try to `organise' and `plan' the life of the  nation. They are incompetent to do so."  <H8>  BEELD </H8>   National Election Victory Urged -- Johannesburg BEELD in  Afrikaans on 25 April asks in a page-10 editorial: "Can our  country's largest so-called liberation movement be given the  mandate to govern the country for the next few years? Four  years ago we would have given an unconditional no. Since then  the ANC has changed in fundamental aspects. Policies and  reasonable statements give one courage for the future. The  negotiations also showed how sensible people could change  radical views and find one another. But in other ways,  unfortunately, the ANC remains unchanged. They remain in  coalition with the South African Communist Party... and the  virus of debilitating socialism thus remains part of the ANC."  The National Party has undergone a remarkable metamorphosis and  shown that it is representative of all groups in the country.  "The values for which this changed party stands are those with  which we can most easily identify. Its leader is a person of  integrity and vision who helped create a new South Africa of  justice and full participation. He deserves support in order  for him to complete his task, and therefore we recommend him and  his party," concludes BEELD.    Bombers Cannot Stop Change--BEELD on 26 April says in a  page-12 editorial that "those cowardly murderers who believe  they can stop the approach of democracy in South Africa with  their bombing campaign are busy unleashing a rage unknown among  the vast majority of South Africans. It is a rage which totally  counters what the bombers are trying to achieve. It is uniting  South Africans across all barriers as seldom seen before against  violence and bloodshed." "The bombings have cost valuable lives  and caused extensive damage to property, and that cannot be  tolerated." "One realizes that the security forces are  stretched very thinly on the ground at present," but "the  present situation demands drastic action. The country expects  the same decisive action to be taken as was the case in the  eighties when destabilization came from the other side of the  political spectrum. Activists and instigators were rounded up  then, regardless of who they were. The same medicine is needed  now."    CP Losing All Its Decent Leaders -- "The Conservative Party  [CP] is systematically losing all the reasonable, decent people  within its leadership," states a second editorial on the same  page of the 26 April BEELD. "The latest are Messrs Driew Bruwer  and Thomas Langley, who walked over to General Constand  Viljoen's Freedom Front [FF] after they were reassured about the  negotiations process through the accord signed at the weekend  between the front, the government, and the ANC. This accord,  which confirms the front's right to negotiate for a homeland,  does not guarantee that it will be achieved. That will depend  on the strength of the argument and its practicality." "The CP  leaders trickling over to the FF are apparently only the tip of  the iceberg. Beneath the surface there is no doubt a much  greater movement of reasonable people who wish to follow the  decent path. All that will remain then will be the diehard CP  members who are unable to negotiate anything for themselves."</p>

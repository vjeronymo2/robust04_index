			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / How to Spend it: Face a clear, wrinkle-free future - Science has transformed skin-care / A look at the latest products It is a melancholy truth that sags, bags and wrinkles are natural to the 40-something face. The skin becomes thinner as we age and thus more vulnerable. At the same time, we produce less supportive collagen and elastin so our skin tends to become slack and droopy. However, in the last few years extraordinary progress has been made in understanding ageing skin. Giving in gracefully used to be the only option. Now, says Dr Tim Cutler, consultant dermatologist at Ipswich Hospital, there are the means to prevent and sometimes even repair the ravages of time. It is possible to have clear, bright, healthy-looking skin in middle age. The fundamental cause of ageing is ultra violet light. Dermatologists say the key preventive measure is to wear sun block all the time, everywhere. Ultra violet rays disperse into the shade, pierce through clouds and haze, and intensify their attack when bounced off snow or water. It is also intense under fluorescent office lights so even indoors it helps to put on one of the new moisturisers with built-in filters. Dermatologists recommend no less than Sun Protection Factor 15 in normal conditions and SPF 25 or more for high risk activities such as skiing, sailing and sunbathing. Brands such as Piz Buin and Uvistat offer good protection. Prescription sunscreen products, available in both SPF 15 and 30 with filters, are excellent moisturisers as well as being oil and fragrance free. Sun damage was always thought to be irreversible, but sunscreen can help undo the damage of the past, according to Vogue Futures, a compendium of advice and information for the over 30s, 40s, and 50s by Deborah Hutton, Vogue Health Editor, (Conde Nast Books Pounds 16.99). When we expose our skin to the sun, surface cells form a protective shield by clustering together and thus thickening the skin. A food supplement called Imedeen is claimed to have a similar effect. Called the 'the first internal cosmetic' by its distributors it is said to thicken the skin without sun and increase levels of collagen and elastin. US scientific studies, although on fairly small numbers, have shown significant improvements in 'thickness, texture, tone and firmness'. British dermatologists are on the whole unimpressed. They cannot see how a concoction based on protein from fish bone and gristle, boosted by vitamin C, calcium and zinc can possibly work on the skin. When I tried the product there was no visible difference after the recommended initial 90-day course (expensive at Pounds 24.95 for a month's supply). However after persevering for another month, I noticed that my thin dry skin was definitely thicker and less dry. A new anti-ageing 'miracle' was unleashed recently in the form of alpha-hydroxy (or fruit) acids, or AHAs. Lower strength AHA creams, which remove the dead cells from the skin's surface, are available over the counter and have been a phenomenal success. They are a joy for those who demand instant gratification. You should see an improvement in your skin almost immediately. Lancaster's Skin Therapy moisturiser, which doubles as a night cream, though expensive at Pounds 39, is one of the best of such products. Over-the-counter creams act on the surface skin only. However, aesthetic plastic and cosmetic surgeons use gradually increasing concentrations of fruit acids as peels which can have a significant effect on lines, wrinkles and pigmentation. Beauty therapists also offer facials using lower strength glycolic acid. However any chemical peel inflicts a wound on the skin. Experts recommend that treatment should be supervised by a dermatologist or aesthetic plastic (or cosmetic) surgeon experienced in their use. The cost varies but is about Pounds 500 to Pounds 700 for a course of six facial peels, plus day and night creams, cleanser and facial spray. Contact the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (071-405 2254), Gly Derm Limited (071-528 8268) or MD Formulations (0268-725252). Beauty therapist Helen Sher believes fair British skins need a daily skincare regime formulated to combat the effects of pollution. She developed the Sher System which is increasingly recommended by dermatologists for different types of problem skins. The linchpin is warm water. 'It keeps skin really clean, is very detoxifying and prepares it for other products,' says Sher. Sher provides Normalising Crystals based on citric acid (another AHA) which transforms hard water into soft. Aficionadoes splash their faces 15 times each night and morning as part of a ritual which consists of four stages. Individual skincare routines which consist of four or so products, cost between Pounds 18 and Pounds 35. Sher says it takes one month (the turnover time for skin cells) to see a change, but several customers say they have seen improvements within a week. Sher also offers a small range of individually blended make-up. She is at 50 New Bond Street, London W1Y 9HD, 071-499 4022, fax: 071-629 7021. A lot of tension is stored in our faces. Facials, as well as deep cleansing our skin, are one of the most effective ways to disperse it. In London's Fulham Palace Road there is a small room behind a chiropody practice, holistic beauty therapist Grania Neagle (071-585 0554) soothes feet, hands, arms and then the face. A two-hour facial costs Pounds 45, one hour Pounds 25. For details of therapists and mail order products, contact Caradoc Ltd, Woodman Lane, Clen, Nr Stourbridge DY9 9PX, 0562-886858. If you are daunted by all the bother and expense, take heart from Joan Collins. In her book My Secrets (Boxtree Pounds 14.99) she says: 'It really doesn't take much money or time to take care of yourself.' Nivea cream is her favourite make-up remover. She recommends Vaseline, olive oil or coconut oil as moisturisers, with milk as a cleanser and toner for irritated skin. Her last tip, echoed by many therapists, is to drink as much pure cool water as you can.</p>

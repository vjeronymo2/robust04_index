			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow climbs in tandem with bonds Wall Street After a morning's pause, US stocks regained their stride yesterday afternoon in tandem with an improving bond market, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 18.45 higher at 3,917.30. It was the first time that the bellwether blue chip index had closed above the 3,900 mark since late February, the month when the Federal Reserve began its move to tighter credit conditions. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.50 ahead at 476.09. New York SE volume came to 294.5m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite rose 1.23 to 452.69. The Nasdaq composite, up 3.25 at 766.46, extended its winning streak to eight consecutive sessions. The day's economic news was mixed. The Commerce Department reported that July sales of new homes were up 8.3 per cent, a little more than analysts had expected. However, the Conference Board said its August index of consumer confidence was much weaker than forecast, suggesting a slowdown in spending in the second half of this year. The bond market chose to focus on the second of the two reports, bringing moderate improvement to the inflation-sensitive 30-year government issue. Equities, which had ignored a small decline in bonds in the previous session, tried to strike out on their own again yesterday morning. But a brief round of profit-taking petered out by midday, allowing share prices to move higher. The improvement came even though many investors were reluctant to make big moves until after Friday's August employment data, the most important economic reading of the month. Among the blue chips, suppliers of raw materials were the session's leaders, with recent high-flyers such as Caterpillar taking a breather. Alcoa climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 83 3/8 , Bethlehem Steel advanced Dollars 1 to Dollars 23 3/8 and International Paper rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 76 5/8 . A fresh tranche of acquisition news raised some fanfare during the morning. Investors piled into Lockheed after the announcement of its planned merger with Martin Marietta in a Dollars 10bn stock transaction. The defence contractor's share price rocketed 16.5 per cent, or Dollars 10 7/8 , to Dollars 76 3/4 , while the value of its partner's stock appreciated Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 48 3/4 . The news triggered buying throughout the defence sector. McDonnell Douglas rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 118 7/8 and Litton Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 39 1/4 . Elsewhere, Reliance Electric jumped Dollars 5, or 25 per cent, to Dollars 24 7/8 after announcing a decision to merge with General Signal. Investors in the latter were displeased by the move, leaving its share price down Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 35 1/2 . AMR, parent of American Airlines, gained Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 59 1/2 . The company said it was streamlining its management as the first step in a restructuring plan designed to save Dollars 1bn. On the Nasdaq, technology issues were mixed. Cyrix lost Dollars 3 1/4 at Dollars 40 3/4 but Microsoft added Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 58 3/8 . Canada Toronto finished narrowly mixed in busy trading after a modest rally late in the session lifted the market from earlier lows. Dealers expect trade to quieten as the Labour Day holiday weekend nears. The TSE 300 composite index gained 1.28 at 4,333.71, although declines outnumbered advances by 385 to 374. Volume totalled 89.7m shares, up from Monday's 57.2m. Seven of the 14 sub-indices closed higher, led by the golds group, up 1.5 per cent. In the sector, American Barrick put on CDollars  7/8 at CDollars 30 5/8 , while Lac Minerals rose CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 14 7/8 on volume of 14.6m shares, as Royal Oak Mines announced that it is dropping its takeover bid for Lac and will tender its Lac shareholding to Barrick's competing bid. Royal Oak firmed CDollars  1/8 to CDollars 5 7/8 . Financial services had the day's biggest fall, 1.3 per cent. Venezuela Caracas turned in its strongest performance for more than a week, in a technical recovery following falls in recent days and amid optimism about the government's new macroeconomic plan, due shortly. The Merinvest Composite index moved ahead 3.08, or 2.2 per cent, to 143.22.</p>

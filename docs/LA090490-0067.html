			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEUERLEIN RETURNS, BUT EVANS IS WAIVED;  </P> <P> RAIDERS: ROSTER CUTDOWN DAY CLAIMS FORMER USC QUARTERBACK. HUNLEY, DAVIS JOIN  LIST OF UNEMPLOYED.  </P> <P> Quarterback Steve Beuerlein returned and quarterback Vince Evans left Monday  along with 11 other players as the Raiders reduced their roster to 47.  </P> <P> Ending an acrimonious seven-week holdout, Beuerlein signed with the Raiders  Sunday and practiced Monday. No contract terms were disclosed but Beuerlein is  believed to have signed a one-year deal. Beuerlein, who earned $140,000 last  season, previously rejected a three-year deal worth an average of $500,000 per  season after the Raiders signed quarterback Jay Schroeder to a one-year,  $1-million contract.  </P> <P> Beuerlein, who put his fingers to his lips when approached by reporters, was  guarded in talking.  </P> <P> "I'm happy to be here and happy to be with my teammates," Beuerlein said. "And  that's about it.  </P> <P> "I wanted to come in here last week, but they said to wait until Sunday,"  Beuerlein said. "So I came in and I'm here."  </P> <P> Although he received a two-week roster exemption, Beuerlein wants to play this  week.  </P> <P> "It's not my decision," he said. "I feel like I'm in shape, but I have to get  out and practice and see what's going on. I don't know what their thinking is  or what's going to happen."  </P> <P> Quarterback Jeff Francis also was waived. Evans, a former USC quarterback, said  he expects to return Wednesday if he isn't claimed by another team.  </P> <P> If Evans doesn't clear waivers, the Raiders will enter Sunday's regular-season  opener against Denver at the Coliseum with Schroeder as the only quarterback  who played during the exhibition season.  </P> <P> "Steve knows the system," Coach Art Shell said. "You have to worry about not  having people in camp. That's the one unfortunate thing about it. But Marcus  Allen didn't have camp last year either, but he came in and played after five  days of work. So, who's to say what you need in order to play?"  </P> <P> Guard John Gesek, who started every game last season, was traded to the Dallas  Cowboys for an undisclosed draft pick.  </P> <P> A three-year veteran, Gesek became expendable when the Raiders signed free  agent Max Montoya from the Cincinnati Bengals last spring.  </P> <P> Though the Raiders are thin at quarterback, they're even thinner at middle  linebacker after waiving Ricky Hunley and Ron Burton. Riki Ellison, sidelined  by a pulled muscle last week, is the only middle linebacker on the roster. He  has missed two of the last three seasons because of arm injuries.  </P> <P> "We've got some young kids, and we've got to take a look at the young kids and  move people in there," Shell said.  </P> <P> If Hunley clears waivers he could return, or the Raiders could acquire another  linebacker.  </P> <P> Unseated by Ellison in the starting lineup during the exhibition season, Hunley  declined comment as he left the Raider training complex, brushing past  reporters.  </P> <P> A six-year veteran, Hunley was acquired by the Raiders from Phoenix as a free  agent last season. He played in 16 games, starting one.  </P> <P> The Raiders also released defensive backs Derrick Crudup and Elvis Patterson,  running back Kerry Porter, guard Bruce Davis, linebacker Darin Jordan, tight  end Trey Junkin and wide receiver Stefon Adams.  </P> <P> Crudup was converted from running back to safety during training camp.  Patterson was acquired as a Plan B free agent from the San Diego Chargers last  March. Francis spent last season on the Raiders' developmental squad. Porter  played on special teams last season.  </P> <P> A 12-year veteran, Davis was reacquired by the Raiders from Houston last month.  Jordan was signed as free agent from the Pittsburgh Steelers last February.  </P> <P> Junkin caught three passes for 32 yards last season and was the long snapper on  punts. Adams was moved to wide receiver from defensive back this season.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Raider Notes  </P> <P> As expected, rookie defensive end Anthony Smith, who underwent knee surgery  Friday, was placed on the injured reserve list, meaning that the Raiders' No. 1  draft pick is out for the season. . . . After sustaining a hairline fracture in  Saturday's game against San Diego, running back Napoleon McCallum's left wrist  was placed in a cast. "The trainer seems to think he can (play)" Sunday, Coach  Art Shell said. . . . Fullback Steve Smith, who sustained a bruised right hand,  also is expected to play against Denver. . . . Quarterback Jay Schroeder  declined to respond to comments made by former teammate Doug Williams, who  attacked Schroeder in his new book. Williams said Schroeder had a bad attitude  and a large ego when they were teammates on the Washington Redskins in 1986 and  1987. "You can write a book about whatever you want to write about," Schroeder  said. "I've got no comments on that. That's not my territory. He's got to sell  some books."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaker of the State Duma (the lower house of  Russian parliament) Ivan Rybkin has expressed support to his  counterpart from the upper house Vladimir Shumeyko's proposal to  extend the term in office of deputies and the president.    In an interview with Interfax, he said the idea was first  put  forward by member of the State Duma Mikhail Poltoranin two  months ago.    However, Rybkin thinks three main conditions must be met  before the proposal is implemented: the economy must show signs  of stabilization in the next two or three months; the country's  legislative network be arranged in a proper way; and the two  houses prove workable.    Rybkin said he would be happy to see the terms of office for  the parliament and head of state extended after those conditions  had been met.</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: A lure for equity capital - The Budget and You The chancellor's most significant innovation for small businesses was designed to entice equity capital into unquoted companies. The small business lobby has long argued that people are discouraged from taking the greater risk of investing in unquoted companies because of the tax system. The chancellor went some way towards redressing that imbalance. First, he extended capital gains tax re-investment relief to cover gains made from any source that are re-invested in unquoted companies. This means a private investor with publicly quoted shares, or a manager with share options, can sell his or her investment and pay no CGT if the capital gain is reinvested in an unquoted company. This measure goes much further than the roll-over relief introduced in the March budget. Secondly, the chancellor has replaced the business expansion scheme with an enterprise investment scheme, which will allow investment in unquoted trading companies from January 1. The maximum any company can raise has been increased from Pounds 750,000 to Pounds 1m and any individual's investment from Pounds 40,000 to Pounds 100,000. The companies have to be trading - assured tenancy property companies, which gave the BES such a bad name - are excluded. If the BES is anything to go by, the financial services industry will already be looking for loopholes. But the EIS seems better targeted, says Louglin Hickey of KPMG. By limiting the up-front tax relief to 20 per cent, it puts more pressure on the investee company to perform; with 40 per cent up-front relief under the BES, most of the return was secured by the low initial net-cost. Investors will also be able to write off losses on the sale of unquoted shares against either income or capital gains tax relief. This should make investors less risk averse. This measure has excited business angels, who could become a more important source not only of equity capital but of expertise. 'These are the most attractive and appropriate incentives given to business angels and entrepreneurs,' says Hamish Steven- son, director at Venture Capital Report, the UK's most established marriage bureau for businesses and business angels. 'Investors can now be paid directors and contribute their much needed expertise as well as hard cash.' Thirdly, the new venture capital trusts will allow private investors who may not want to invest in a single EIS to invest in a portfolio of unquoted trading companies. The government will issue a consultation paper in the new year and promises details in the 1995 finance bill.</p>

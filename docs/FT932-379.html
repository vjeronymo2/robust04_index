			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Brent Walker breaches agreement with bankers BRENT WALKER, the property, pubs and betting shop group, has breached and will continue to breach some of the terms of the refinancing which it agreed with its bankers in March last year. It is now finalising a new business plan to put to lenders, which are owed more than Pounds 1.3bn. Sir Keith Bright, who took over as chairman in January said it was 'essential that a solution to the company's financial problems be found' so that the core businesses could expand. The group, once headed by Mr George Walker, yesterday reported a Pounds 427.4m pre-tax loss for 1992, against a Pounds 407.3m loss in 1991. The 1992 accounts, showing a deficit on net assets of Pounds 557.9m, up from Pounds 455.9m at the end of 1991, have been qualified by the group's auditors on a going concern basis. Brent Walker is not performing in line with the business plan written before Mr Walker left the group in May 1991 and rejigged in October that year. As well as breaching covenants, Sir Keith said the group's disposal programme of non-core assets 'has not developed in the way anticipated'. He blamed weakness in the property market. Operating profits of Pounds 49.5m, up from Pounds 45.6m, were below the level agreed in the original plan. Mr John Leach, finance director, said an earlier end to the UK recession had been envisaged. The Pubmaster chain of pubs and the William Hill betting shops, the group's two core businesses, had performed well given the trading background and the uncertainty surrounding the company. Interest charges totalled Pounds 204.4m, down from Pounds 235.8m in 1991. However, only Pounds 65m of interest was paid in cash, with most of the rest being converted into preference shares. William Hill, which is ring-fenced from Brent Walker, is still suffering the burden of interest rates fixed at 17 per cent at the time of its acquisition for Pounds 685m in 1989. This will end when the William Hill bank syndicate is refinanced in March 1994. There were exceptional costs of Pounds 246m, largely relating to further property write downs, but also Pounds 4.5m of costs for the refinancing. The pub estate was written down by Pounds 210.1m, following similar reductions by other pub owners. Brent Walker said the William Hill properties, in the books at Pounds 701.1m would be worth 'significantly less' on an open market basis, but no provision had been made since the directors did not regard this as permanent.</p>

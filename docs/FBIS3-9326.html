			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, March 22 (BTA) -- "We won't have accusations  that the Turkish minority in this country is disloyal to the  state," the leadership of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights  and Freedoms (DPS) said in a declaration adopted today. It came  in response to yesterday's allegations by Krasimir Premyanov MP  of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), member of the BSP top  leadership, that Bulgarian Turks were arming themselves. The  DPS described Premyanov's allegations as a "provocation" and "a  flagrant anti-constitutional act aimed to stir up interethnic  hatred in the Bulgarian people."    The DPS leaders believe that certain elements in the BSP  want  to play the nationalistic card again, Yunal Lyutfi, spokesman  for the DPS parliamentary group, told the press. Such lies and  provocations could be of benefit only to those who do not care  about the country's future, Lyutfi said. The parliamentary  group of the DPS discussed a possible motion for stripping  Premyanov of immunity but no decision was taken. The matter  will be further debated tomorrow, Lyutfi said.    The Interior Ministry said today that police authorities  have  no information on organized arming of the population in areas  predominantly populated by ethnic Turks or elsewhere in the  country, nor have they discovered illegal arms caches. The  regional directorates of the interior in Shumen and Razgrad  (towns in a mixed-population region in northeastern Bulgaria)  also denied Premyanov's allegations. The Razgrad Regional  Directorate of the Interior has no information about stockpiling  of weapons in the area under its charge, Major Atanas Atanasov,  chief of the directorate, said today. The leaders of the Shumen  Directorate of the Interior were even more categorical in their  denial of the allegations.    "I spoke in a private capacity yesterday and what I said  does  not bind the parliamentary group of the BSP, its leadership and  the party leadership," Premyanov told a regular BSP news  conference today. He confirmed the credibility of the  information he disclosed yesterday as well as of the tip-offs,  some which had been addressed to him and some of which were  highly credible. Premyanov said he would wait for the competent  authorities to pronounce on some of the tip-offs.    Premyanov stressed that in his statement he had not  identified any political force or leader. "I daren't claim that  this is being done on an ethnic or a clear-cut political basis,"  Premyanov said. He said that on his initiative the BSP had  contacted the interior minister and the chief of the National  Security Service to give them the witnesses' whereabouts and the  exact locations. "I would very much like this undertaking to be  unconnected with the context of the Balkan region," Premyanov  said.</p>

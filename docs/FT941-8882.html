			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Great Western Resources seeking Pounds 15m investment Great Western Resources, the restructured energy group that almost collapsed in a fog of litigation more than two years ago, yesterday called on investors for support with a Pounds 15m placing and open offer. GWR is also planning to float in the US before the end of the year. The company was one of several US-based energy companies to float in the UK during the so-called 'gas bubble' of the 1980s. Existing investors are being offered one share at 38p for every four held. GWR is issuing a total of 40.9m shares, leaving an enlarged equity base of 126m. Some 72 per cent of the new shares have been placed with institutions. GWR said it was confident that it had 'effectively dealt with the immediate problems'. Funds were now needed to allow it to 'plan for the development of the company'. The group, under previous management, ran into difficulties when one of its largest customers suspended payments after a dispute over contracts. It was also the focus of unwelcome publicity over its controversial former chairman and founder, Mr Dan Pena. Mr Pena, whose financial transactions with the company prompted a rebellion by institutional shareholders and pressure for his departure, last year won a claim for unfair dismissal. Mr Gary Loveless, chief executive, said the proceeds of the placing and open offer would be used to develop GWR's oil and gas assets in the US and to invest in exploration in Peru. Last year, GWR was awarded an exploration agreement in the Manon Basin by Petroperu. Mr Loveless said the group intended to seek a partner to help develop the bloc. The exploration asset had been a particular attraction for institutions participating in the placing, Mr Loveless said. All of the placed funds had been raised through UK institutions, two of which were first-time investors in GWR. Some 10 per cent of the proceeds would be used to reduce debt, leaving borrowings at about Dollars 62m. A refinancing agreement negotiated in 1992, after the company breached several banking covenants, specifies that 10 per cent of any equity issue be used to reduce debt. Before the issue the group had gearing of about 65 per cent.</p>

Details follow.  <H5>  A. Netherlands </H5>   (i) Measures to lower the cost of R&amp;D personnel.  Authorities  intend to waive payment of a percentage of the income taxes and  other taxes employers normally have to pay to the state in the  case of research personnel or research institutes working on an  R&amp;D project for a company on the basis of a contract. For  basic  industrial research or applied research and development,  beneficiaries can deduct 25 percent of wage costs for salaries  below ECU50,000 and 12.5 percent of wage costs for salaries of  more than ECU50,000 (these percentages can vary). The maximum  amount a company can retain is ECU4.6 million annually. Dutch  authorities estimate that tax revenues will diminish by ECU161  million. This measure leads to a maximum intensity of 16 percent  calculated on the basis of the total R&amp;D project costs.  Cumulation with other aid measures is only possible up to the  allowable aid intensities.    (ii) Amendment of schemes subsidizing the use of energy  conservation and wind energy technologies. The amendment  regarding these subsidies granted for the purchase and  investment in energy saving equipment considerably lowers the  aid intensity and maximum amount of grant per firm (which were  quite high).  <H5>  B. Germany </H5>   (i) Aid program in the microelectronics research and  development field. With a budget of ECU31 million for 1994 to  2000, this scheme provides direct subsidies for basic industrial  research by enterprises and scientific institutions. The maximum  aid intensity is 50 percent with enhancements for projects  carried out by SMEs [small and medium-sized companies] (+10  percent), in the ex-GDR (+10 percent) or by SMEs in the ex-GDR  (+15 percent). Recipients are obliged to publish their results  in specialized magazines.    (ii) Amendment of schemes already authorized by the  Commission concerning the environment, energy conservation and  the use of renewable energy in Germany. The limit on  low-interest loans for enterprises located in eastern Germany  will be raised from 500,000 to ECU1 million. The intensity of 10  percent remains unchanged; the aid ceiling in eastern Germany  thus rises to ECU100,000.</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / US parts maker chooses Salford OMEGA Engineering, the Connecticut-based manufacturer of components that measure and control temperature, pressure, flow and humidity, is to set up its European headquarters in Salford, on the site of the Irlam steelworks by the Manchester Ship Canal. About 500 jobs will be created over 10 years, more than 300 of them by the mid-1990s. Trafford Park Development Corporation, the government agency which markets the site, is putting Pounds 3m of public money into the Pounds 25m project. It won the investment against intense competition from Germany, France, Italy and other parts of Britain. The site, which was derelict six years ago, already houses three US companies - Perkins, the diesel-engine company; Caterpillar, the earth-moving equipment-maker; and Varn, which makes specialised chemicals for the printing industry. Perkins will formally open a Pounds 12m parts distribution centre at the site next Tuesday. Mrs Betty Ruth Hollander, president of Omega, said yesterday that it would develop a 26-acre campus with offices, research, production and warehousing. The aim would be to attack European markets from Manchester. 'We looked all over Europe, but greater Manchester has the roadways we needed and its airport and plenty of hotels for accommodating visitors and training staff,' she said. Omega, which started in 1962, makes components which measure and control temperature, pressure, flow and humidity. It has plants in Connecticut, New Jersey and Montreal. Privately owned by Mr Milton Hollander and Mrs Hollander, Omega refuses to divulge turnover or profits. The present staff is under 1,000, but growing quickly. Some 225 defence and aviation jobs are to go in Scotland. GEC-Marconi Avionics, which employs more than 4,000 people in Edinburgh and Fife blamed the decline in defence orders. In Fife, 300 new jobs are to be created with Solectron Corporation taking over Philips Circuit Assemblies in Dunfermline.</p>

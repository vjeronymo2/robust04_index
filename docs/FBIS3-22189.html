			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: ``New Dimension to Poll Panel -- Assam Tussel''] </F>   [Text] Guwahati, Jan 13 -- Yet another battle is on the  cards in the prolonged war between the Election Commission and  the Government of Assam.    In its latest order issued on 11 January, the Election  Commission has directed the State Government to undertake  `special revision' of electoral rolls in respect of the 40  Assembly constituencies (out of the total 126) where their use  had been stayed pending `approval and clearance of the Election  Commission.'    This unusual intervention, withholding the publication of  electoral rolls of almost one-third of the total number of  constituencies in the State, was made between the publication of  the draft electoral rolls on 5 October 1993 and the eve of the  publication of the final electoral rolls on 27 December 1993.  This step clearly invested the popular perception among most  Assamese speaking people that the State had a very large number  of `illegal aliens' most of whom were seen as inhabiting the  very areas covered by these Assembly constituencies,  illustrative of the catholicity of the political choice of these  `suspected illegal aliens' is the fact that candidates from all  the major political parties in the State were returned from  these 40 constituencies in the last elections, though there was  a marked preference for the Congress whose nominees, won from 23  of these constituencies. The other parties representing the  remaining 17 of these `suspect' constituencies are: AGP (Asom  Gana Parishad (Assam People's Council)) (five, including  Barhampur, represented by the former Chief Minister, Mr.  Prafulla Kumar Mahanta), BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) (four),  Bodoland Legislature Party (three), CPI (Communist Party of  India) (two), SUCI (two) and Independent (one).    Basic document: The most interesting feature of  the `special revision' with 1 January 1994 as the `qualifying  date,' is that they will have as the basic document the draft  electoral rolls published on 5 October last year. In other  words, the Election Commission has taken exception to the  procedures and actual conduct followed in the preparation of the  final electoral rolls between that date and 27 December 1993,  and has directed the State authorities to go over the whole  process once again. All indications are that the impasse will  not be broken since the structures in the State (as well as the  political and other compulsions that presumably vitiated the  earlier process remain the same.    The Election Commission has also directed the State  authorities to take up a `summary revision' with respect to the  86 Assembly constituencies whose final electoral rolls it had  allowed to be published barely three weeks ago, with 1 January  as the fresh qualifying date.</p>

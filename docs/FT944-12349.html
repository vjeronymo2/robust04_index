			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Shift on taxation of life insurance Changes in the taxation of life insurance, to enable UK life insurers to compete more effectively in the rest of Europe, are to be introduced by the government in the next finance bill. The most important shift will affect taxation of 'services business' where the insurer does not have to have an office in the country in which the policyholder lives. This has been allowed only since the changes in European law on life insurance which took effect at the beginning of July. The UK taxes income to policyholders as it builds up in the funds. Most other European countries tax income when it is withdrawn from the fund and reaches the individual. Sir George Young, Treasury financial secretary, said the British tax system already took account of this difference between tax regimes in the way it treated business carried out through overseas branches of UK life insurers. The changes represent an extension of that arrangement. The new system will apply from the next new accounting period. For most life insurers this will mean it will affect business written in 1995. Another likely change, but one which has not been announced, is the closing of a loophole in the existing system to make sure that the investment element of offshore reinsurance does not slip through the tax net. While these alterations will be welcomed by life insurers, they have not resolved the wider debate within the UK life insurance industry on whether there should be more widespread changes to harmonise UK and European tax regimes. The Association of British Insurers is expected to start discussions soon with the Inland Revenue about the implication of any further fundamental shift in the tax arrangements towards the European model.</p>

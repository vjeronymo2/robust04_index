			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Labor Party MP Jan van Zijl: "There Is </F> Really Something To Choose on 3 May"]    [Text] In the coming cabinet period the PvdA [Labor Party]  intends to assess from year to year whether AOW [Law on Old Age  Pensions] and social security levels can develop in line with  salary levels. Just how far this is possible will be determined  by how employment develops.    This position can be found in our old and new election  program and has also been enshrined in law for some time. There  is no intention of changing it in any way. For this reason we  reject the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] position of  announcing in advance, regardless of economic developments, a  four-year freeze for the AOW, social security, and salaries of  civil servants, teachers, and health care workers.    In our election program we have not chosen the easiest way:  We promise no pots of gold, nor do we promise the maintenance  of purchasing power nor a permanent and full linkage between AOW  and wage levels. The PvdA only promises that the purchasing  power of AOW pensioners will not fall behind the purchasing  power of those earning (higher) incomes, regardless of whether  or not the link between AOW and wages is applied.  <H5>  Positive Message </H5>   Perhaps it would be easier to call for the AOW to follow  wage  levels in comings years (as the VVD [Union for Freedom and  Democracy] does). That suggests a positive message, which,  however, is not there. But by doing so we would disavow both  our own program and the law: They both state that the  relationship of the number of working people to the number of  AOW pensioners and people receiving benefit is an important  issue.    To translate it into popular terms: If employment increases  by more than 100,000 jobs, then there would be economic leeway  to allow AOW and social benefits to follow wages. Everyone must  understand that such leeway does not exist in a year when  unemployment increases by 100,000 people. But in such a year  the government should ensure that income ratios remain fair  using taxation and social bonuses.    This explanation alone proves that the PvdA is not seeking  to  win people over with empty promises. Voters do not believe in  "higher wages and lower prices." Furthermore the world economy  cannot be influenced from The Hague. Therefore, it is  irresponsible to promise in February 1994 that some two million  AOW pensioners plus several hundred thousand unemployed and  people who are unable to work can follow salary levels every  year until 1998.  <H5>  Even reduced </H5>   The fact that the VVD is saying this tells more about the  VVD  than the economy. When the VVD had some influence in the  government in the 1980's, the AOW never matched wage  developments. On the contrary: The AOW was even reduced. To  promise the opposite now -- while in the opposition -- of course  lacks complete credibility. But the opposite is also true: To  decide in advance on a four-year freeze, as the CDA has done,  provides no room for the annual assessment which the law  requires. Or does the CDA not believe that its election program  can have a positive influence on employment?    Working together on work: young and old, rich and poor.  Each contributing as he can afford. We are convinced that in  this way it is possible to create some 100,000 new jobs over the  next four years. The CDA has set the same goal, but says that a  four-year freeze is necessary. That is a clear choice, but it  differs from the PvdA's choice.    So in contrast to what is often claimed, the voters on 3 May  do have something to choose.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Once the guaranty agency receives the institution's appeal, it must provide the institution with the loan servicing or collection records for a representative sample of the loans insured by the guaranty agency and included in the institution's cohort default rate. The sample must be identified by the guaranty agency and the universe estimate derived from the sample results must be acceptable at a 95 percent confidence level with a plus or minus 5 percent confidence interval. In some cases, the result may be that servicing and collection records for all the loans guaranteed by the agency and included in the institution's default rate will be sent to the institution. Once the sample is identified, the guaranty agency must send the loan servicing and collection records to the institution within 15 working days of receiving the institution's request. The guaranty agency's response to the institution must also include a list of certain dates that will assist the institution in reviewing the records and the Department in resolving the appeal. An agency may charge the institution a reasonable fee for copying and production of the records, not to exceed $10 per borrower file. The Secretary will charge a similar fee in response to a request for records maintained by the Department on behalf of the Higher Education Assistance Foundation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After receiving the records from the guaranty agency, the institution has 30 calendar days to file its appeal with the Secretary. The regulations identify the material that must be submitted by the institution. The Secretary will review the appeal and issue a decision. The Secretary will assume that the records maintained by the guaranty agency in the normal course of business in the FFEL Program are correct unless the institution provides substantial evidence to the contrary. If the Secretary finds that the evidence submitted by the institution shows that some of the loans included in the sample of loans should be excluded from calculation of the cohort default rate, the Secretary will adjust the institution's cohort default rate to reflect the percentage of defaulted loans that should be excluded. The Secretary will use a statistically valid methodology to determine the estimate of the number of loans that should be excluded from the calculation of the cohort default rate and the confidence interval of the estimate. In determining the exact methodology, the Secretary will need to consider the number of loans in the sample, the number of guaranty agencies involved and other appropriate factors. The Secretary will notify the institution, in writing, of his decision on the appeal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 435(m)(1)(B) of the HEA includes two prerequisites for exclusion of a loan from the cohort default rate calculation. Under the law, the institution must prove both (1) that the loans were serviced or collected improperly and (2) that the improper loan servicing and collection caused the student loan default. If either of these two requirements is not proven, the loan will not be excluded from the cohort default rate calculation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Iran wants Turks to quit Iraq The foreign policy commission of Iran's parliament urged Turkey yesterday to withdraw its troops from northern Iraq, Reuter reports from Nicosia. The official Iranian news agency Irna quoted the committee as telling Ankara to stop 'the killings of innocent Kurdish civilians.' Turkey has sent more than 20,000 troops into northern Iraq to flush out more than 8,000 guerrillas of the separatist Kurdistan Workers' party (PKK) believed hiding there. It says its troops, backed by aircraft and tanks, have killed over 1,000 rebels in the area, which is under the control of Iraqi Kurds. At least 13 Turkish soldiers have also died.</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: The regulation insurance needs (1) Sir, Your leader, 'An end to foot-dragging' (January 12), proposes that I may underestimate the challenge facing the insurance industry. Your proposition astounds me. It is precisely because I recognise the need for the industry to eliminate bad sales and marketing practices - in the common interest of the consumer and reputable life offices - that I reject as unworkable the current proposals for reform on the basis of the Large report and Personal Investment Authority. For some 18 months now, the Prudential has argued that such is the wholly unsatisfactory state of retail financial services regulation that the experiment of 'self-regulation within a statutory framework' be admitted a failure by the appropriate authorities. We advocate the appointment of an independent committee of inquiry chaired by a senior judicial or legal figure with an unrestricted brief to redefine the objectives of saver protection and the statutory and institutional framework best suited to achieve that. Each day that passes confirms us in our view that the only likely way to achieve those acceptable standards of protection due to the nation's savers is by such a route, which implies single-tier statutory regulation with direct accountability to Parliament. M G Newmarch, chief executive, Prudential Corporation, 142 Holborn Bars, London EC1N 2NH</p>

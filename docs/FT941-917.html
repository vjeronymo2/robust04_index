			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Management: Remedies for absenteeism - Ways to cut one of UK business's biggest blights From the middle of this week the full burden of sick pay will fall on most big UK employers for the first time. The government claims that the reduction in National Insurance contributions will compensate for the overall cost - estimated at Pounds 700m - but within this there will be winners and losers. Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, said when he announced the changes that his intention was to encourage employers to work harder at controlling absenteeism. According to the Confederation of British Industry there remains plenty of scope for improvement. A CBI report carried out with Percom, a UK consultancy, last year suggested that absenteeism was one of the biggest blights on UK business, costing employers Pounds 13bn a year. Absence rates on average are running at about 4 to 5 per cent, according to most estimates, but managers are beginning to recognise that lower levels can be achieved. Some argue that often it is simply a matter of caring about people who work for you. Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK), the Sunderland-based car manufacturer, records absence figures of around 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent, less than five days an employee per year, in an industry that has been notorious for absenteeism. Peter Wickens, Nissan's personnel director says the plant's current absence levels are 1.8 per cent. He says: 'I always regard absence as having very little to do with sickness and a hell of a lot to do with lack of motivation.' Nissan pays everyone from day one of sickness. 'I think that people who are paid when off sick are less likely to be sick,' says Wickens, who argues that a system where people are not paid when they are off encourages employees to believe that no one loses when they are away. The company's sick pay agreement includes a penalty. If people abuse the system they are liable to be disqualified from sickness benefit or face disciplinary action. Workers are expected to telephone when they are sick and are asked about their sickness when they return. Andrew Sargent, managing director of Sargent Minton, employee relations consultants, says five days absence a year is sufficient to take care of most minor illnesses such as flu epidemics. 'The big problem is that grey area between those who are genuinely sick and people who are genuinely malingering. There are always people who will take companies for a ride,' he says. Leadswingers (skivers), he says, have become more accomplished at spreading their absences across the year. The answer is to treat absenteeism as a management problem. 'This will mean better record keeping, better communication and more attentive and enthusiastic acceptance that ultimately only management can provide the cure,' he says. Both the CBI and an earlier Industrial Society survey suggest that full-time manual workers lose on average twice as many days as full-time non-manual workers. The CBI calculated that eight days a year per employee were being lost in manufacturing, but this was topped by local government and National Health Service employees with 10 and 11 days lost respectively. The approach of Lewisham Borough Council is typical of the way the public sector is beginning to tackle the problem. Andreas Ghosh, the council's assistant chief personnel officer, says absence levels were 17 days a year for each employee when the authority embarked on an initiative to bring absence levels down two years ago. Today, absenteeism has fallen by 5.8 days a year, equivalent to Pounds 1.5m of services. Managers were trained to monitor absence using computer programmes which trigger on-screen messages when individuals reach certain absence rates. While effective monitoring can can reduce absenteeism to 2 per cent a year, according to some estimates, tackling absence in a piecemeal way is unlikely to get the sort of results achieved by Nissan. That, argues Wickens, results from the overall management approach to production, teamworking and motivation.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Unipart weathers the recession with 18% rise UNIPART, the vehicle comp-onents and accessories manufacturer and distributor, increased pre-tax profits by 17.5 per cent last year and is doubling its dividend. The results come against the background of one of the worst recessions to have hit the motor trade and industry since the Second World War. Mr John Neill, chief executive of the former Rover Group parts and accessories division, attributed the Cowley-headquartered group's sharply improved performance both to aggressive marketing activity and to investments in manufacturing, productivity and to employee motivation programmes beginning to pay off. Pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 1991 rose from Pounds 13.1m to Pounds 15.4m achieved on turnover 2.6 per cent lower at Pounds 567m against Pounds 582m. The figures were helped at the pre-tax level by Unipart eliminating some Pounds 20m in borrowings associated with a 1989 share buy-back scheme, and which had incurred Pounds 2.2m in interest charges in 1990. Unipart was privatised in an employee buy-out in 1987. It is now owned by its directors, employees and a small group of institutions, with Rover maintaining a minority stake. The company is to pay a dividend of 22.7p on each ordinary share, more than four times the 5p paid by most employees at the time of privatisation. About 2,000 of Unipart's 4,000 employees took up the original shares offer, spending an average of Pounds 500 each on a package which also included founder and preference shares, most of which have been redeemed. Since then, share ownership among the group's employ-ees has widened substantial-ly. The group's retained profit was Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 9.5m). Unipart's prospects have been boosted by the conclusion last year of 'lifetime' agreements for the worldwide distribution of parts for both Rover cars and Land Rover and Range Rover models. It is also moving to expand its components manufacturing operations as a result of forging closer ties with both Rover and Honda, which is to start car production at Swindon later this year. Next month, Unipart is formally to commission a new plant to supply catalytic converters and exhaust systems for the Synchro, the family car Honda will build at Swindon - a Rover version of which is also to be built at Longbridge.</p>

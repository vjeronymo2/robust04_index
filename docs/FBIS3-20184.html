			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["rmc"-signed report: "Test Pilot Weger Made History With </F> Eurofighter"]    [Text] Bonn -- Probably on 19 or 20 April, Dasa wants to  present the European combat fighter EF-2000 to the public in  Manching near Ingolstadt. Last Sunday [27 March], the first  prototype, DA-1, undertook a successful 70-minute maiden flight,  starting from Dasa's own airfield.    Dasa's chief test pilot, Peter Weger (51), gave an account  of  his flight in DA-1: "Extremely easy to fly, just as on the  simulator, much more stable than the Tornado." During the first  flight in what is currently the most modern combat aircraft in  the world, Weger already felt secure enough to extend and bring  back in the landing gear and to simulate a landing approach.    It was only after the first flight of DA-1 that Weger  realized he had made history: He is the first German to make a  maiden flight in a multinational military aircraft destined for  serial production after World War II. In the case of the  "Tornado," more than 20 years ago, the pilot was British.    At the "official" first flight of EF-2000 in Ingolstadt,  State Secretary Joerg Schoenbohm, in charge of armament in the  Defense Ministry, will stand in for Defense Minister Volker  Ruehe. Ruehe will not attend the official first flight of the  four nations (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain) in Warton,  England, on 4 May, either. When Ruehe became defense minister  some two years ago, he initially held the view that a new combat  aircraft was not necessary. Later, he changed his view, saying  "a new aircraft for a new time."    Yesterday [28 March], industry referred to this rather  skeptical view held by the German defense minister and to the  clear rejection of the Eurofighter by the Social Democratic  Party of Germany [SPD] (defense expert Kolbow: An SPD [Social  Democratic Party of Germany] government will not buy the  aircraft), adding: "We Germans still have great problems being  accepted as partners by the others."    The current situation is such that the DA-1 prototype will  only be tested in the air for 10 hours by Dasa in Ingolstadt;  after that, it will be transferred to England. Great Britain  has secured "the entire flight test program." This is a heavy  setback for Germany as a business location, an industrial expert  said. After the successful first flight, Dasa is "therefore,  beginning to rethink." It insists on the number of test flights  being increased.</p>

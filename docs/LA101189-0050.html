			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> STOCKBROKER ARRESTED IN FRAUD  </P> <P> A stockbroker was arrested in the offices of Shearson Lehman Hutton in San  Francisco on suspicion of defrauding one investor of more than $500,000 and  diverting $2 million in funds belonging to 20 other investors into his personal  account. Conrado Berenguer Topacio was accused in a federal complaint of bank  and wire fraud in his handling of the account. An attorney for Shearson, which  cooperated in the investigation of Topacio's alleged account tampering, told  the FBI that Topacio issued Shearson checks to his client accounts, but then  endorsed the checks to himself. Topacio, who denied diverting any funds from  investor accounts, told the FBI he recruited offshore investors to begin stock  trading accounts. According to the FBI affidavit, the investors asked for a 10%  to 13% return in their investment and allowed Topacio complete discretion to  invest the funds for one year.  </P></p>

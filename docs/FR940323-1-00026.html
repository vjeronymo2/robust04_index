			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A modified approach under this option would be to have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agency staff on site at qualified provider locations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to supervise or actually assist pregnant women in completing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the application form. In these cases, the application date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for regular Medicaid plan services would be the date the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> onsite State agency staff person receives the completed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> form. This would result in an earlier Medicaid filing date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, even though State agency staff who are working at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualified provider locations can receive and process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications for regular Medicaid, they cannot make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presumptive eligibility determinations unless they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> themselves meet the definition of ``qualified provider'' under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1920(b)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since we are considering pregnant women who apply only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for presumptive eligibility for ambulatory prenatal care as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requesting to receive services under a special status (that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is, not regular Medicaid eligibility), we propose not to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply to a decision on presumptive eligibility the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification requirements that a State must meet when it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> makes a decision on a regular Medicaid application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Existing regulations under &sect;&sect;435.911 and 435.912 and part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 431, subpart E, require Medicaid agencies to notify Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicants within a specified period of time of the agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision on a regular Medicaid application, the reasons for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the decision, and an explanation of rights to a hearing if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the application is denied. Although we propose not to apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the requirements of &sect;&sect;435.911 and 435.912 and part 431,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart E, to presumptive eligibility decisions, we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing to require that the qualified provider inform a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pregnant woman in writing of the presumptive eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision at the time of the determination. In the case of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> denial of presumptive eligibility, the qualified provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be required to inform the woman in writing of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reason for the denial of this special status and of her  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> right to apply to the State agency for an eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision for regular Medicaid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 1920 of the Act, we propose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to require the qualified provider to inform, in writing, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pregnant woman who is determined presumptively eligible that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> she is required to file a regular Medicaid application by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the last day of the month following the month in which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presumptive determination is made if she wishes to continue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to receive ambulatory prenatal care after that date. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualified provider must inform the pregnant woman in writing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that if she does not file her application for regular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid by the last day of the month following the month in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which she was determined presumptively eligible, her  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presumptive eligibility will end on that date. However, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> she files within the deadline, she will remain presumptively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible until she has a regular Medicaid determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the provisions of section 1920(c)(2), the qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider also must notify the State agency within 5 working  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days after the date on which the provider determines that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the pregnant woman is presumptively eligible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Kazakhstan is a foreign country now. However, on the  basis of an agreement, field training exercises are held here  just like during the past decades. General designers use these  exercises to perfect air defense systems. [video shows air  defense systems being fired]    Modern Russian air defense systems are superior to foreign  ones in terms of multiplicity of channels [kanalnost],  protection [zashchishchennost], mobility, and kill probability.  So for example, at a recent exercise, the Buk-M1 system scored  30 hits of the most modern air targets with 31 missiles. The  air defense men did not disappoint us on this occasion either.  Not a single missile missed its target. And that despite the  fact that the battery was manned by only two privates instead of  the statutory 16.

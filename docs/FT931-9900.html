			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / M and S to take more graduates MARKS and Spencer is to increase its graduate recruitment by almost 50 per cent this year because of the UK food and clothing retailer's confidence about its trading position in 1995. M and S said it had planned to take just 130 graduates in September 1993, but would now recruit 190 including 'a handful from the Continent'. The company added: 'Training takes a year to 18 months. We look at it as a sign of confidence of what our position will be in 1995.' M and S wants to increase its visibility in the European recruitment market. 'We believe competition will increase when the recession ends and we will need to source the best candidates Europe-wide,' it said.</p>

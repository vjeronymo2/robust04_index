			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Coca-Cola tops list of grocery brand sales Coca-Cola has become for the first time Britain's biggest-selling grocery brand, toppling Unilever's Persil detergent which has fallen to third place after arch rival Ariel, made by Procter &amp; Gamble, Guy de Jonquieres writes. Coca-Cola, which had UK supermarket sales of Pounds 247m in the year to August, topped an annual list of 100 grocery brands compiled by Nielsen, the market research firm, and Checkout magazine. The fastest-growing brand was Muller yoghurt, sales of which rose 32 per cent. Unilever had 13 of the top 100 brands, the most for any company, followed by P&amp;G with nine and Mars and Kellogg with six brands each. In spite of increased competition from private-label and discount products, sales of the top 100 brands rose 2.6 per cent in the year to Pounds 6.4bn.</p>

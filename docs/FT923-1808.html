			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Finance ministers ready to respond FINANCE MINISTERS from the world's leading industrial nations were last night preparing to restore calm in case of financial market turbulence following the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty. A weekend meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers agreed to take 'appropriate additional actions as needed' to achieve currency stability. European Community finance ministers said yesterday they were ready to bring Japan, the US and Canada (which together with Germany, France, the UK and Italy make up the G7) into their discussions if necessary, but said responsibility for reacting to the French vote lay primarily with the Europeans. Their remarks came after a meeting of finance ministers yesterday called by Mr Norman Lamont, the British chancellor of the exchequer, in his capacity as president of the EC finance ministers' council. It remained unclear what additional moves had been agreed. The G7 communique said the ministers and central bank governors expressed concern about the recent volatility in world markets and agreed on the importance of restoring stable relationships. They said they would 'continue to co-operate and to monitor closely economic and financial conditions in their countries' and act as needed 'to achieve sustained growth and greater currency stability'. The ministers' promise of additional action provoked scepticism among some bankers in Washington. Mr Wolfgang Roller, chief executive of Dresdner Bank, said it was difficult to imagine anything that could be effective, given the size of foreign exchange markets. With ministers aware that a public display of disagreement could further upset financial markets, the G7 meeting was unusually harmonious. 'No one was put in the dock,' said Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister. Mr Lamont went out of his way afterwards to say that he was not criticising Germany's monetary policy. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, said he did not come under pressure to cut interest rates. But there was no sign of any early changes in economic policies. As expected, Germany refused to promise any further interest rate cuts, and the US made no precise commitment to new efforts to curb its budget deficit. Mr Lamont said that Mr Waigel on Saturday had said he hoped conditions would be established, 'though not necessarily immediately' for interest rates in Germany to come down. 'I think everybody is of the view, including the Germans, that we would like in time to see lower interest rates.' Germany had not been criticised, he said, for its high interest rates 'but obviously there was a lot of discussion of the consequences of reunification for the world economy and for interest rates.' He said Germany had a 'uniquely difficult task to deal with'. Some of the tensions underlying economic relations among the industrialised countries surfaced away from the G7 meeting. It is understood that in bilateral talks with Mr Waigel, Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, repeated the US belief that Germany should cut its interest rates to promote growth in Europe. President George Bush was expected to take up this theme last night at a reception for ministers attending the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund. Mr Sapin said yesterday before the referendum result that he had given considerable thought to what needed to be done in the event of a Yes vote - including the provision of celebratory champagne; he had never considered the possibility of a No vote. 'I know all the ills it would bring, but I have never taken it into account,' he said. But Mr Piero Barucci, Italy's treasury minister, said he was not sure the lira could return to the exchange rate mechanism tomorrow as he had said earlier.</p>

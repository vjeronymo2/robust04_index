			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / ANC economic policy praised by government THE South African government yesterday described new economic policies adopted by the African National Congress last weekend as 'pragmatic'. The ANC concluded a conference on Sunday where a comprehensive set of policy guidelines was adopted, revising the organisation's economic stance for the first time since 1955. Mr Derek Keys, the minister of finance, said ANC economic policies represented a 'very material advance' on those of two years ago. He said they meant 'it should not be impossible to agree a growth strategy'. His comments raise the prospect for the first time of a constructive economic dialogue between the National Party and the ANC. It improves the chances of agreement being reached in the Economic Forum, set up last month to map out future strategy. The forum is made up of representatives from the business community, trade unions and the government. He said there were three economic problems the government was in a position to address. These were the high individual tax burden, high interest rates and inflation. Mr Keys said a lower level of government spending would help alleviate these problems and said he would begin his campaign 'to reduce in real terms the level of government spending' this month. On corporate taxes, Mr Keys said he would favour the dispensation that gives the best growth prospects. 'It may be the one with lower tax rates, but it may not be.' He argued that areas where co-operation was required to make progress were unemployment and investment. He warned that what he called the 'economic civil war' had to be stopped if the South African economy was going to recover. This involved stopping political wars being fought on economic terrain - such as over the issue of sanctions. He also called for 'sensible wage bargaining'. Mr Keys said South Africa needed to invest more than 25 per cent of its gross domestic product (compared to 18-19 per cent now) if the growth rate was to keep pace with the birth rate. Achieving this required greater investor confidence, he said. On foreign investment Mr Keys said: 'I don't think in practice it will be found possible to impose conditions on foreign investment that foreign investment doesn't want to have imposed on it.' The South African president, FW de Klerk, will face calls in Tokyo today formally to scrap the 'honorary white' status granted to Japanese more than 30 years ago, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Human rights groups want the prime minister, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, to discuss the 'shameful' issue with Mr De Klerk. Mr Akira Kusuhara, a human rights spokesman, said the status was introduced in the 1960s at a time when Japan was experiencing high growth which South Africa wanted to take advantage of.</p>

			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VH-1 MAKES HIM M-A-D  </P> <P> I have a lot of respect for the cable music channel VH-1. So I hope the channel  stops its disreputable practice of continuously plastering VH-1 over all the  videos. This is equivalent to a radio deejay whispering the call letters of his  or her station over and over during the songs.  </P> <P> Michael Storm, Santa Barbara  </P></p>

			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Legislation 'threat to equal pay' THE gap between men's and women's pay could widen because of the government's Employment Bill, the Equal Opportunities Commission says today in a critical review of the proposed legislation. Ms Joanna Foster, who chairs the commission, said: 'In our view, the employment bill has enormous implications for women at work.' She added that government consultation had been inadequate given the significance of the legislation. Ms Foster, who has had several public disagreements with Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment minister, will stand down as chair of the commission later this year. The commission said three clauses, including one providing for maternity rights and another abolishing wages councils, gave most cause for concern. It warned that the clause on maternity rights was inadequate and might not fully comply with European Community law, and that it would make a scheme which was already too complicated still more complex.</p>

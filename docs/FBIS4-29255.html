			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>   [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] on 15  June was informed by the United States of North Korea's notice  of withdrawal, and officially declared that North Korea was no  longer a member state.    The United States, the trustee of the IAEA ratification  treaty, delivered an official document to the IAEA Secretariat  on 15 June which stated that North Korea was withdrawing from  the IAEA. The official document received by the IAEA clearly  points out that North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam  officially notified the U.S. Government of the North Korean  authorities' decision to withdraw from the IAEA as of 13 June.    With the receipt of the official document, the IAEA, as  authorized by the United States which is the trustee country,  declared that North Korea has given up its membership as of 13  June and informed the 35 board of governor states and other  member states. The IAEA reaffirmed, however, that North Korea's  withdrawal of its member state status does not at all effect the  nuclear security agreement signed between North Korea and the  IAEA in 1991.</p>

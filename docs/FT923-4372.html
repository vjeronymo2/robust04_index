			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / International Company News: Countrywide Bank takeover near THE BANK of Scotland's takeover of Countrywide Bank, the fifth largest bank in New Zealand, moved a step nearer after two institutions, which had opposed the bid, reluctantly sold out last week. But the largest outside shareholder said it would mount a legal challenge. Both Norwich Union and CML, which between them hold 3 per cent of Countrywide's capital, agreed to sell, apparently clearing the way for the Scottish bank's offer to become final. On their acceptance the Bank of Scotland said it had 91.2 per cent of Countrywide's capital and intended to acquire the rest compulsorily. However, the National Mutual, the pension fund, with 5 per cent of Countrywide, said it would challenge the takeover. A spokesman said it would not sell because the offer was 'too mean'. It was disappointing that all the institutions fighting the bid had not stuck together. A Norwich Union spokesman criticised the way the Bank of Scotland had treated minority holders. In deciding to sell, he had weighed up the risks of remaining a minority shareholder, and the small likelihood of the Scottish bank increasing its NZDollars 2.05 a share offer. He said there had been unnecessarily harsh treatments in the company's accounts, and that these and other actions showed the substantial level of control the Bank of Scotland used within the company. The CML, which held out until well after the Stock Exchange had closed, said it was reluctantly accepting. 'There comes a time when you feel you've made the best possible fight for minorities, and it is time to get on to the next thing,' a spokesman stated. The Bank of Scotland said it intends to compulsorily acquire the remaining 8.8 per cent of the capital. Companies listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange will face tougher reporting standards from October 1, to bring them into line with Australian regulations. The stock exchange said that the new rules would ensure that more comprehensive financial reporting on public companies was available to investors. Under the changed reporting format for half and full-year results, companies must provide: a full statement of assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity; a full statement of cash flows; full details of equity accounted associated companies and other material interests; and reports for industry and geographical segments. Previously, only stocks listed on both the Australian and New Zealand exchanges had to provide such information for both reporting periods.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Nigerian military offers role to parties NIGERIA'S military government yesterday offered the two civilian political parties a role in an interim national government in a deal that would involve dissolving all democratic institutions. President Ibrahim Babangida proposed the deal as an alternative to holding fresh elections at the end of July. This apparent attempt to meet the deadline for ending military rule on August 27 without confirming the victory of Mr Moshood Abiola of the Social Democratic party in the June polls may exacerbate the civilian protest movement which has paralysed most economic activity in Lagos so far this week. Furthermore, it would not meet conditions for restoring aid suspended by donor countries last week. Gen Babangida said he found the two army-created parties, the SDP and the National Republican Convention (NRC),'polls apart' when they met on Monday night. The SDP stood by its rejection of fresh elections by the end of July with new candidates, which the NRC would support. The senior candidates who were banned during the previous presidential campaign last October have also refused to stand again. The president has given the two parties until tomorrow to consider the options. If they accept the national government proposal, all the elected civilian arms of government are likely to be dissolved, including local councils, state governors and the House of Assembly and the two parties could also be scrapped. According to a state radio broadcast yesterday Gen Babangida said the proposed national government would not include him and he urged the parties to adopt the plan in the national interest, which was 'to achieve a termination of the military regime by August 27'. A presidential spokesman said that the armed forces would have no role in in the government. The first organised civilian protest against the military government's manipulation of the electoral system is finding strong support in Lagos.</p>

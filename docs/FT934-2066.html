			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / The Russian Elections: Kohl tries to calm German nerves Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday warned against any 'over-dramatisation' of the election results in Russia. In an interview to be published in today's issue of Bild, the mass circulation popular newspaper, he expressed his confidence that 'President Yeltsin and the forces which support him will continue along the path of reforms'. He insisted that Germany would continue to support the Russian president, and praised his success in winning electoral backing for his new constitution. The chancellor's words contrasted with a weak performance on the Frankfurt stock exchange, as shares and bonds fell in afternoon trading over concern about events in Russia. Germany is the largest western investor in Russia, and the country's largest trading partner, in spite of a sharp reduction in trade levels over the past 18 months. Dealers reported a particular flurry of activity after an interview recorded by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the far-right Liberal Democratic Party in Moscow, was broadcast on German radio. In the interview, given well before Sunday's election, but first aired yesterday, he threatened a nuclear disaster in Germany if it sought to interfere in Russia's affairs. 'The Germans are interfering in Russia now, but if a German looks at Russia the wrong way when I am in the Kremlin, you Germans will pay for all that we Russians have built up in Germany,' he said. He would not hesitate to create a 'Chernobyl in Germany' to prevent any interference. Mr Kohl was, in contrast, as phlegmatic as possible. 'In spite of all our concern at the developments, there is still no cause for over-dramatisation,' he said. 'We want a democratic, a stable, and an economically healthy Russia, which is a predictable partner. Whatever we can contribute to that we will continue to do in the future.' German industry is also maintaining an attitude of calm in the face of the election results. Mr Michael Fuchs, president of the Federation of German Wholesalers and Exporters, said the outcome would not cause any 'dramatic influence on western economic activities in Russia'. He said that approval of the new constitution would provide 'greater long-term clarity', and the tendency of voters to support extremists would diminish 'once the people can experience the success of a market economy'. The German foreign ministry announced that Mr Klaus Kinkel, the Foreign Minister, will fly to Moscow on Friday for two days of informal talks with his counterpart, Mr Andrei Kozyrev.</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU fisheries ministers revise plans European Union member states will present counter-plans within two weeks to prevent Spanish vessels overfishing after they gain access to EU western waters in 1996, EU officials said on Wednesday, Reuters reports from Brussels. Britain and Ireland led attacks by nearly all EU fisheries ministers against European Commission proposals, notably the allocation of 'standard vessel days' for fishing, as complex and unworkable. 'It's not a runner . . . We have seen off that particular proposal,' British fisheries minister Michael Jack said after a meeting of EU fisheries ministers. Jack said Britain would present special controls to protect fish stocks in sensitive zones. British fishermen are concerned that the Spanish fishing fleet, the largest in the EU, will destroy fragile stocks in waters off western Britain. Germany, which holds the rotating EU presidency, said it was clear many countries had problems with the approach and details of the proposals from the commission, the EU's executive agency. Spain has warned it will block Norway, Sweden, Finland and Austria joining the EU if terms for Spanish fishermen are not agreed by the end of the year.</p>

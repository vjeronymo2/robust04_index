			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Cayone; from the "Union Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] The Chamber of Deputies has agreed to condemn  unanimously any U.S. military intervention in Haiti. In addition  to condemning any unilateral or multilateral military  intervention, through the agreement approved by the Chamber, the  lawmakers also decided to reject pressure from the United States  to receive quotas of Haitian refugees. The lawmakers also  demanded an end to the economic blockade on Haiti because they  believe it affects the innocent population instead of the  government.    Deputy Herman Monzon, chairman of the Lower Chamber Foreign  Policy Commission, gives more details about this decision:    [Begin Monzon recording, broadcast in progress] ...to  condemn  the possibility of an intervention in Haiti by the U.S. An  intervention of this nature would be a costly operation and it  would involve the possibility of loss of human lives and  material losses.    I would recommend this money be used to develop Haiti. This  is an historic juncture. Venezuela must once more assume  leadership in Latin American to restore legitimacy in Haiti and  to support the Haitian people. The Haitian people need the help  of the entire international community. [end recording]    In addition, Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas  reiterated that so far our country has not received an asylum  request from Haitian refugees. The foreign minister made these  statements when leaving Congress after a summons by the Foreign  Policy Commission regarding Haitian refugees. When asked about  the number of Haitians who would enter the country, the foreign  minister, who was visibly disturbed, said the following:    [Begin Burelli recording] You want me to say no flatly.  Obviously, a country that received assistance from Haiti at a  historical moment cannot say no. But we will only receive those  we deem convenient. The three, four, or five Haitians who will  help us investigate specific nuclear problems in Haiti will  come, just like Manigat and his wife did.    But for heaven's sake, stop speculating that 150,000  Haitians  will come in planeloads or shiploads. Such speculations are  ill-intended. I said here many times that only 35 Haitians have  reached the U.S. ships off the coast of Jamaica. Of these, only  six Haitians qualified for asylum and 29 others were returned.  Just imagine, we will assess these cases in our embassy in  Washington, and the ambassador will call here or send us a note  when a Haitian who wants to go to Venezuela gets to the embassy.  [end recording]    Finally, the foreign minister reiterated that the United  States has not pressured our country to accept Haitian refugees.</p>

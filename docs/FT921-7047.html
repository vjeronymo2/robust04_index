			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: Petro-Canada pushed to CDollars 598m record deficit HEAVY writedowns pushed Petro-Canada, the partially-privatised Canadian energy group, to a record CDollars 598m (USDollars 502.5m) loss in its first year as a publicly-traded company. The Calgary-based group suffered an operating loss last year of CDollars 143m, compared with earnings of CDollars 176m in 1990. However, the 1991 bottom line was further dented by writedowns totalling CDollars 455m. The writedowns stem mainly from the restructuring of the fuel products division, including the planned closure of about 1,000 service stations. Petro-Canada also cut the carrying value of its shareholding in Syncrude, the oilsands plant in northern Alberta, by CDollars 95m after tax. Cash-flow slumped to CDollars 292m from CDollars 621m. The bulk of the operating loss was suffered by the products division, mainly because of an inability to recover the high cost of crude oil held in inventory at the beginning of the year. The problem was exacerbated by weak demand and fiercely competitive pricing. The federal government sold 20 per cent of its stake in Petrocan to the public last July. The shares have been trading at CDollars 10.13, substantially below the CDollars 13 issue price.</p>

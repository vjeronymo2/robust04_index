"We hope that the Estonian side thought over the results of  the 17th round and came to the conclusion that we have to find  ways to compromise to solve some of the deadlocks," he said.    On Thursday, Estonian Decolonization Initiative Centre will  hold a picket in front of the building of Estonian Foreign  Ministry to support and encourage Estonian delegation before the  18th round. "Estonian delegation should not choose the Latvian  way on the issue of the retired Russian military, but has to  lift up its chin," Juri Estam from the Center told ETA.</p>

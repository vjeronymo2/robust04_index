			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Bouygues in rail link for Sydney The French construction group Bouygues is to partner Australia's Transfield and CRI, a local project management company, in building a ADollars 600m (USDollars 445m) underground rail link between Sydney's centre and its international airport, to the south on Botany Bay. The go-ahead for the project was announced yesterday after all-night negotiations between the New South Wales state government and the private sector interests. The state will contribute more than ADollars 470m for the construction of the 10km line, while Bouygues and Transfield, the joint venture partners, will shoulder about ADollars 125m of construction and operating expenses for the four stations on the line. Bouygues/Transfield/CRI will be responsible for the tunnelling, line and station construction work, and for running the stations at first: the time-frame for that contract has not been decided but is likely to be anything from 15 to 30 years. The Bouygues involvement was not mentioned in the formal announcement but Transfield - a prominent but privately owned Australian group - confirmed it had signed a separate 50:50 joint venture agreement with the French group. There is no rail connection at present between Sydney's airport, the largest in Australia, and the city centre. The state denies that the choice of Sydney to host the Olympic Games in 2000 was the catalyst for the project, but acknowledges that this makes the need for efficient transport more urgent. Work is due to start next February and the line is to open by September 1999.</p>

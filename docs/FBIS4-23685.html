			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nina Verhaeghe in Bujumbura] </F>   [Text] Bujumbura--Tension remains high in the Burundian  capital due to the political impasse round the appointment of a  new president. A text circulated political circles this week,  said to come from the intelligence service. It spoke of the  preparation of a coup d'etat.    The text gave the names of some 25 people who attended a  clandestine meeting presided by the former president, Colonel  Bagaza. In addition to seven members of the military, the  meeting included representatives from the Uprona [Unity and  National Progress], Raddes, Abasa, and Annade [expansions  unknown] opposition parties. The text said there was a list of  300 people who were to be eliminated, mainly from the top layers  of Frodebu [Burundi Democratic Front]. The first attempt to  eliminate them was normally to have started on Wednesday (8  June). But the leaking of the information is reported to have  prevented the attempt. It has been confirmed that there was  panic on Wednesday among Frodebu members.    The text indicated 28 June as the latest possible date for  the coup. Given its destabilizing effect, it is unlikely that  Frodebu would itself deliberately spread false rumors.    In recent months there have been various rumors doing the  rounds in Bujumbura about an imminent coup and above all about  secret opposition meetings. They are taking place in a general  atmosphere of considerable political insecurity. This week some  people died in shooting incidents between armed civilians and  soldiers, just to the north of the city.</p>

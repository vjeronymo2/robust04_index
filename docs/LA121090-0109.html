			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANGELUS LEAGUE;  </P> <P> SANTA MARGARITA PLANS FOR STRESS TESTS;  </P> <P> BOYS: EAGLES WILL TRY TO KEEP UP AGAINST THE LIKES OF MATER DEI AND SERVITE,  BOTH DEFENDING STATE CHAMPIONS.  </P> <P> After a couple of stress-free years in the Olympic League, the Santa Margarita  High School basketball team now dances with wolves.  </P> <P> The Eagles are now in the Angelus League, where basketball is serious business.  It had not one but two state champions in 1990 (Mater Dei in Division I and  Servite in Division III). And Mater Dei has won six Southern Section and seven  league titles in the past eight seasons.  </P> <P> Also joining the league are Loyola (1990 5-A runner-up) and St. John Bosco,  both from the Del Rey League.  </P> <P> "We're looking at 10 real intense games when we get into league," said Roger  Holmes, a first-year coach at Santa Margarita. "Up and down the line, there are  tough teams. This is probably the best league in the Southern Section."  </P> <P> The Eagles, who have their first senior class, finished tied for fourth in the  Olympic League last season. And there is one coach -- Mater Dei's Gary McKnight  -- who thinks they'll win the Angelus title.  </P> <P> Of course every other league coach picks the Monarchs.  </P> <P> "How could you not pick Mater Dei?" Bishop Amat Coach Alex Acosta said. "It's  like a tradition."  </P> <P> Here's a closer look:  </P> <P> </P> <P> BISHOP AMAT  </P> <P> Coach: Alex Acosta (fifth year).  </P> <P> 1989-90 record: 17-11, 1-7 in league.  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: Five.  </P> <P> Returning starters: None.  </P> <P> Top returnees: Randy Edwards (G, 6-2, Jr.); Scott Fields (F, 6-4, Jr.); David  Ng (C, 6-8, Jr.); Rashid Strode (G, 5-10, Jr.); Kareem Webb (G, 6-4, Jr.).  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Jelani Gardner (G, 6-4, Fr); Brandon Lee (F, 6-5, Jr.).  </P> <P> Outlook: The Lancers reached the quarterfinals of the 4-AA playoffs and have a  good core of returning players. Acosta said Gardner could end up the best in  the school's history. He is a big guard who can play point guard or off guard.  The key is the development of the front-line players, especially Ng. Through  the first few games, Lee has been the team's top player.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LOYOLA  </P> <P> Coach: Bill Thomason (15th year).  </P> <P> 1989-90 record: 23-5, 8-0 in Del Rey League.  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: One.  </P> <P> Returning starters: None.  </P> <P> Top returnee: Andrew Doran (F, 6-2, Sr.).  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Toby Bailey (F, 6-4, Fr.); Scott Kinlock (G, 5-11, Jr.); Matt  McMahon (F, 6-4, Jr.); Kenny Simpson (F, 6-3, Jr.).  </P> <P> Outlook: The Cubs lost their nucleus as center Ryan Jaminson (California),  forward Jamal Adams (Columbia) and guard Eric Jones (Cal Poly Pomona)  graduated. Still, Loyola is off to a 3-0 start and has a good group of  underclassmen. "I guess we're a little better off than I thought," Thomason  said. "I can't point out why we've had success so far, except that everyone on  the team is playing hard."  </P> <P> </P> <P> MATER DEI  </P> <P> Coach: Gary McKnight (ninth year).  </P> <P> 1989-90 record: 34-1, 8-0 in league.  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: Four.  </P> <P> Returning starters: None.  </P> <P> Top returnees: J.J. Ballesteros (G, 6-1, Sr.); Reggie Geary (G, 6-2, Sr.); Mark  Moneypenny (C, 6-11, Sr.); Kamran Sufi (G, 5-10, So.).  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Jason Janeski (F/C, 6-7, Sr.); DeJuan Matthews (G, 6-0, So.).  </P> <P> Outlook: True, the Monarchs lack experience, but they have talent. Geary has  plenty of ability and can be counted on to score. Janeski is a solid inside  player, and Ballesteros could be the best point guard in the school's history.  Moneypenny is the question mark. "He has to start playing like he's 6-11,"  McKnight said. "I think this will be a very good team in February."  </P> <P> </P> <P> ST. JOHN BOSCO  </P> <P> Coach: Tim Haley (fifth year).  </P> <P> 1989-90 record: 9-16, 3-5 in Del Rey League.  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: Four.  </P> <P> Returning starters: Four.  </P> <P> Top returnees: Eric Nelson (F, 6-2, Sr.); Dashon Quiette (G, 5-11, Sr.);  Fiedencio Saldana (C, 6-4, Sr.); Mario Saucedo (F, 6-3, Sr).  </P> <P> Top newcomer: Michael Stephens (G, 6-2, Sr.).  </P> <P> Outlook: With the four starters back, the Braves have more experience than any  other team in the league. However, it's the same group that finished third in  league play and was routed by Dominguez in the first-round of the 4-AA  playoffs. Quiette is the best of the bunch. He is a third-year starter and was  a first-team all-Del Rey League selection last season.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SANTA MARGARITA  </P> <P> Coach: Roger Holmes (first year).  </P> <P> 1989-90 record: 13-13, 8-6 in Olympic League.  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: Eight.  </P> <P> Returning starters: Five.  </P> <P> Top returnees: Dan Bathey (G, 6-4, Jr.); Mike Carpenter (G, 6-0, Jr.); Hayes  Ferry (F, 6-0, F); Mike Guevara (G, 6-0, Sr.); Chris Hacker (C, 6-8, Sr.); Jeff  Layne (C, 6-8, Sr.); Sean Stevenson (F, 6-5, Sr.); Chris Stone (F, 6-2, Sr.).  </P> <P> Top newcomers: None.  </P> <P> Outlook: The Eagles reached the quarterfinals of the 2-AA playoffs and have  everyone back. Bathey is a great shooter and is averaging 20 points so far.  Hacker and Layne give the Eagles plenty of size. "We don't have a lot of true  basketball players, but we have a lot of guys who love to play," Holmes said.  "I think our biggest asset is that we play as a team. We're going to need  that."  </P> <P> </P> <P> SERVITE  </P> <P> Coach: Richard Smith (second year).  </P> <P> 1989-90 record: 21-11, 4-4 in league.  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: Four.  </P> <P> Returning starters: One.  </P> <P> Top returnees: Adam Anderson (F, 6-4 1/2, Jr.); Dan Coady (C, 6-6, Sr.); Eric  Osterhues (F, 6-4, Sr.); Eddie Rubio (G, 6-2, Sr.).  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Ryan Dodd (F, 6-3, Jr.); Mark Grassman (C, 6-6, So.); Matt  Kenney (G, 6-0, Jr.); Garrett Moran (G, 6-1, Sr.); Tony Tapan (G, 5-9, So.).  </P> <P> Outlook: Servite has Anderson, who may be among the top five players in the  league. Last season, he averaged 12 points and was a tough defender. Coady and  Rubio were the sixth and seventh men most of last season. Osterhues saw  considerable playing time early in the season, but was hampered by injuries the  second half.  </P> <P> Tomorrow -- Century League.  </P></p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Unemployment in the UK: The man fighting to survive in Sussex 'I'M 48, married, I have three children at school, a mortgage and a profession I cannot use. At my age I sometimes wonder whether I will ever work again.' Sitting in the back room of his home, the old toll cottage on the Lewes to Uckfield Road, Mr Christopher Coomber reflects. Three years ago he was senior architect at McCarthy and Stone in Eastbourne; one day between jobs in the 1960s was the extent of his experience of unemployment. He is not alone. Lewes, the county town of East Sussex, has bustled its way through previous economic slowdowns, cushioned by jobs in local government, Sussex University, and the affluence that naturally gravitates towards the pretty market town. But this time it has suffered along with the rest of the country. 'I suppose it's a better-quality unemployment you get here,' shrugs Mr John Crawford, chief executive of Lewes District Council, peering over an aerial view of the South Downs which shows the town clumped in the middle. 'When I came to Lewes I thought nothing would ever touch its economy. I thought it was so strong with the law courts, County Hall, and the fact that the retailers enjoyed a very established market. But I would revise that opinion now.' The town has not been the victim of headline-grabbing redundancies. Instead it has suffered from the gradual attrition of a once stable employment base, resulting in one in 10 people out of work. 'It has been a few here and a few there,' says Ms Madeleine Mayhew, a reporter on the Sussex Express. Unemployment hit Christopher Coomber hard; first the dog and then the family felt the brunt of his quickening temper. Money, he says, was one reason. 'The subs for the my children's scouts are Pounds 10 a term - and when I look at the Scoutmaster smiling and asking if I can pay next week, it really hurts.' At times even now the pressure gets too much. Then Christopher is to be found walking out across the fields behind his house, smoking cigarettes he can't afford. 'I think back to what I was earning, and how I thought that wasn't enough. And now I have nothing.' Meanwhile he has lost touch with his profession. 'I have lost interest in what is happening, and the gossip. I used to be in contact with what other people were doing, but I have dropped out and don't really care any more.' East Sussex County Council's figures show that unemployment in the Lewes district - which includes Newhaven and Seaford - rose by 37.6 per cent last year, while Ms Mayhew reports that Stena, the ferry operators in Newhaven, received more than 400 applications for one recently advertised clerical post. Wealthy commuters living in Lewes's surrounding villages have lost jobs, and virtually all have seen the value of their homes tumble. This has put pressure on local retailers. 'The high street is all charity shops, banks and building societies - the kiss of death,' says Mr Rudi Simmonds, president of the Lewes Chamber of Commerce. 'Lewes is fed by its hinterland, by the people who make their money in London. But they are drawing in their horns.' The quiet crisis has compelled the district council to produce an economic development strategy. But the council knows its limitations and is aware that it cannot compete against other areas in East Sussex for increasingly tight government funds. 'We are trying to break through the perception that everything must be all right because it is the south-east, says Mr Robin Beechey, chief executive of the county council. Already the county has the lowest average wages in the south-east. The fact that more than 75 per cent of companies in East Sussex employ 10 people or fewer has made the region particularly vulnerable to this recession. Mr Brian Renville at the Lewes Jobcentre says he has seen everyone from accountants, systems analysts and engineers, as well as unskilled workers join the ranks of people like Mr Coomber, who at the age of 48 is considering retraining even though the prospect is daunting. 'I am thinking of doing anything at all, because in another 10 years I am going to go nowhere,' he says. Ms Sarah Jay, 36, did decide to retrain. She enrolled on a degree course in urban planning at Sussex University before redundancy hit her post as a financial supervisor at Clothkits Lewes headquarters. But seven months since graduation and 15 job applications later she has had no luck. 'The probability of finding a job in local government did not seem unrealistic when I started the degree,' she says. Even when the national economy picks up some fear that Lewes will lag behind the rest of the country. An export-led recovery would make little impact on a county where only 14 per cent of the workforce is in manufacturing - the lowest percentage for any county in England. For Lewes's unemployed there can be poignant moments. Mr Coomber's father-in-law was so concerned that the family was cold that he bought them a hundredweight of coal for Christmas. 'You say 'Thank you, God', because you know you just can't afford it.'</p>

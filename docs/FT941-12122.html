			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: BSN Branded consumer products companies face two chief challenges - to fight off hostile retailers and private label imitators in mature markets and to exploit growth opportunities in the developing world. On both fronts, BSN is making only patchy progress, as its 1993 results make clear. In Europe, which still accounts for more than 90 per cent of sales, BSN has been hit hard by recession. Operating margins have slid by almost one percentage point as BSN cut prices and increased promotional spending to defend market share. But the Paris bourse has been seduced by BSN's recovery appeal, pushing its shares 16 per cent higher over the past two months. BSN's restructuring efforts should bear fruit this year and consumer spending can only recover. Like many other French companies, BSN has swallowed big provisions which will help the earnings upturn when it comes. In the longer term, BSN aims to milk strong positions in EU markets to fund expansion in central Europe and the Far East. BSN's visionary chairman, Mr Antoine Riboud, promises to double its business in emerging markets every five years. But BSN is starting the game late from a comparatively low base and has its work cut out meshing its European acquisitions. Besides, there remain considerable doubts about who can succeed Mr Riboud and fulfil his dreams. At current ratings, both Nestle and Unilever look more certain bets.</p>

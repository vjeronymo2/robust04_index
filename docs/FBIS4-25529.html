			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on "exclusive" interview with Chinese President </F> Jiang Zemin by NHK chief commentator Hatsuhisa Takashima at  Zhongnanhai in Beijing on 10 June; from the "NHK News 7" program  -- Jiang and Takashima remarks recorded; Jiang speaks in Chinese  with Japanese subtitles accompanying his remarks]    [Text] Chinese President Jiang Zemin gave an exclusive  interview to NHK in Beijing on 10 June and touched on North  Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons, saying that  China is against imposing sanctions. In this way, he explained  a stand of seeking a settlement through dialogue between the  countries concerned.    The interview took place this morning at Beijing's  Zhongnanhai, where the main government and the Communist Party  offices are located.    [Takashima] I would like to ask you some questions  concerning  the issue that is now of primary concern to the world. The  international community, with China as a central figure, is  currently discussing North Korea's development of nuclear  weapons. First, would you explain how China wants to resolve  this problem?    [Jiang] We appeal to all parties concerned to exercise  restraint and act prudently. In solving the problem, the  ultimate objectives should be to safeguard peace and stability  on the peninsula and to achieve denuclearization there. As long  as we do not deviate from these two basic objectives, there is  always the possibility of finding a correct way to solve the  problem, no matter what temporary difficulties might arise. We  should see that the door to negotiations has not yet been  closed, and that room for and the possibility of dialogue still  exist. All parties concerned should take active measures to  avoid an intensification of the crisis. Do not let the efforts  made by all parties over the last year and more go to waste.    China does not approve of sanctions. This is because  sanctions do not help to solve the problem. On the contrary,  they will escalate the situation and have consequences which  none of the parties are eager to see. I believe that only  dialogue and consultations are the effective way to solve the  problem, as well as the fundamental way out. We have always  hoped that the four parties and three sides [si fang san bian]  will hold very good consultations.    [Announcer] President Jiang stressed the stand that the  DPRK,  the ROK, the United States, and the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] should continue discussing the matter. Moreover,  President Jiang also spoke about the health of Chinese supreme  leader Deng Xiaoping. He said that Deng Xiaoping is in good  health and that there is no need to worry about his health.    [Takashima] Today, President Jiang Zemin said that China  cannot agree with the idea of imposing sanctions on North Korea.  This is entirely consistent with China's position up to this  point, but, the timing and forum of his statement appear to be  significant. It comes as the IAEA and the UN Security Council  are actually talking about adopting a resolution on sanctions.  Moreover, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher is reported to  have said that UN sanctions will be approved. President Jiang  reportedly said that if they are introduced at the UN Security  Council, China will not veto them but rather will abstain from  voting.    Under such circumstances, President Jiang, in an interview  with a foreign television network, ventured to express China's  opposition to sanctions. All of this indicates that President  Jiang wants to restrain the growing international pressure for  sanctions and wants to take the initiative in negotiations.    In particular, President Jiang held long talks with Choi  Kwang, the North Korean chief of staff, at [place-name  indistinct] in Zhongnanhai four days ago, thus indicating at  home and abroad that ties are still close between China and the  DPRK. President Jiang's remarks today reflect his own desire to  settle the issue through talks. At the same time, it seems that  they can also be taken as a message to North Korea.    President Jiang stressed once again the need for peace and  stability on the Korean peninsula and the importance of removing  nuclear weapons from it. This indicates that China is worried  that if sanctions are imposed, the resulting confusion and  conflict will spread into China, which borders North Korea.  Moreover, it is inevitable that refugees will cross the border,  that China's political situation will be destabilized, and that  it will have to step up its military readiness. This is  apparently the last thing that China wants now while it is  placing its top priority on economic growth.    Given this situation, it appears unlikely that sanctions  will  be imposed on the DPRK in the near future over its suspected  development of nuclear weapons.</p>

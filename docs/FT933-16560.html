			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: Surprise German rate cuts prompt profit-taking SURPRISE cuts in Germany's key interest rates yesterday signalled a wave of rate reductions throughout Europe and prompted profit-taking in government bond markets. The Bundesbank had been under intense pressure to ease rates for some time both within the market and also from the international community. The central bank's perceived desire to double bluff the markets and its will to maintain its independence from French pressure were seen as cogent reasons why it might delay any changes until the next meeting on July 15. But when the Swiss National Bank cut its discount rate by half a point to 4.5 per cent, the market was fully prepared for a German move. The Bundesbank's reduction of its key discount lending rate by half a point, to 6.75 per cent, and of its Lombard rate by a quarter of a point, to 8.25 per cent, was seen as bowing to the inevitable. The Bundesbank also cut its repo rate by 28 basis points to 7.3 per cent. The central bank gave a favourable exchange rate as the rational for cutting, but most economists felt this was disingenuous and argued that the broadcasting of the government's spending cut proposals provided the main impetus. Mr Neil MacKinnon, economist with Citibank, said the government's proposed DM25bn in spending cuts were not big enough. 'I think we will see further rate cuts in the months ahead. Much depends on money supply growth and inflation but I forecast a discount rate of 5 per cent by the end of the year,' Mr MacKinnon added. Bund futures for September were sold down half a point to 95.36. Meanwhile, it was announced in Frankfurt that Treuhand, the agency charged with the privatisation of former east German assets, would launch a new 10-year bond on Tuesday. THE GERMAN move could give France an opportunity to reduce its own rates next week, but the immediate reaction in the French government bond market was sharp profit-taking. September futures on the Matif fell just under half a point to 119.38, with dealers saying a French easing was already priced into the market. One economist said that investors had heavy positions in French OATs and were looking for the next rising market. There are various comparable benchmarks for short-term benchmarks, but a number of investment houses are looking at the French intervention rate, which sets the floor for French money market rates, and the German discount rates. Ten days ago, the intervention rate fell the below the discount for the first time in 26 years. To sustain that position, the Banque de France would need to ease by half a point, but most analysts feel it will do so in two stages rather than make a dramatic point when it conducts its money market operations on Monday. IN LONDON, gilts traded lower, partly because the appetite for stock was taken up with the latest tap. Buying of the Bank of England's Pounds 800m issue of 9 per cent stock dated 2008 began yesterday morning. The first tranche of the partly-paid stock was sold at 30 and the second tranche at 30.04. The issue was not fully cleared by the close of trading. The market was also digesting Tuesday's auction of Pounds 3.25bn of 8 per cent stock due 2003. At Wednesday's auction, the average accepted price was 101.29 to give an average yield of 7.72 per cent. ELSEWHERE in Europe, a number of central banks cut rates. Denmark lowered its discount rate to 7.25 per cent from 7.75 per cent, effective today. Austria cut its discount, Gomex and Lombard rates by 25 basis points effective today. The new discount rate will be 6 per cent, the Gomex money market intervention rate will be 6.75 per cent and the Lombard rate will be 7.25 per cent. Ireland cut its short-term rates by 0.25 per cent to 7.5 per cent. In Sweden, the Riksbank announced an expected cut in the key marginal lending rate to 8.5 per cent from 8.75 per cent effective July 5. Belgium and the Netherlands, cut their discount rates to 6 per cent from 6.25 per cent and their emergency lending rates by the same margin to 8.50 per cent effective today. US TREASURY prices were mixed in light trading yesterday, with activity subdued ahead of today's employment report. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/8 at 105 5/8 , yielding 6.683 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up  1/16 at 100 1/4 , to yield 3.977 per cent. The day's economic news - a larger-than-expected 11,000 drop in weekly jobless claims, and a decline in the National Association of Purchasing Managers' index from 51.1 in May to 48.3 in June - had mixed implications for bonds. The NAPM figure, which was weaker than expected, lifted prices slightly, buoying hopes that today's employment report for June would display continued weakness in the labour market. Later in the day, however, longer-dated Treasuries fell back following a surge in commodities prices. The only other feature of the day was some early speculative buying on rumours that the Federal Reserve had called an emergency meeting for today. It did not take long, however, for the Fed to explain that there was no emergency, and that its routine Monday meeting had simply been brought forward because of the Independence Day holiday.</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / International Company News: BNP issue rationed after strong public demand THE PRIVATISATION of Banque Nationale de Paris was yesterday hailed as a 'remarkable success,' by Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister. He confirmed that some 2.8m private investors had applied for shares and the public part of the issue was five times subscribed. The strong public response has prompted the government to reduce the allocation of shares to institutional investors and to ration the number given to individuals from 40 to 15 each. The institutional part of the BNP issue was so heavily over-subscribed that it was closed after only two days. One of the main reasons for the popularity of the BNP issue was the share price which, at FFr240, was far lower than the Paris market had expected. BNP's new shares yesterday traded in the grey, or unofficial market, at FFr277 (Dollars 48). Analysts expect them to rise to at least that level when official trading starts on Monday. Mr Alphandery will early next week disclose the name of the next company to be privatised. An economy ministry official said a final decision had not yet been taken, but that the second candidate would be 'either Elf Aquitaine or Rhone-Poulenc'. Rhone-Poulenc, the flagship French chemicals company, was initially intended to be the second privatisation but has since come under pressure in the intensely competitive European chemicals market. Analysts suspect that Elf, one of Europe's largest oil and gas groups, will be the next contender for sale. Mr Alphandery yesterday described the strong response to the BNP issue as 'testimony to the French public's enthusiasm for privatisations'. The government had originally allocated 37.5m shares at FFr240 each, or 52 per cent of the issue, to the public and expected to attract 1m investors. Instead, it received applications worth FFr46.4bn for 193.5m shares. It has increased the allocation of shares to the public to 46.9m by reducing the number given to institutional investors. The institutions will be left with 27.7m shares (35 per cent of which are earmarked for French investors). The allocation of shares to BNP's noyaux durs, or 'hard core' investors, which include both Elf and Rhone-Poulenc, has also been reduced from the original 15 per cent to 10 per cent.</p>

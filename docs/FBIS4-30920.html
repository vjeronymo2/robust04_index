			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 27 (CTK) -- In passing today a law  enabling ethnic minorities to use Christian names and surnames  in their original form, the Slovak parliament met one of the  main demands by the Hungarian minority and the Council of Europe.    Seventy-two deputies of the 124 present voted in favor of  the  law, 48 were against it, two abstained from the vote and two did  not vote. Immediately after the passage of the law, deputies  from the opposition Slovak National Party (SNS) walked out of  parliament for a symbolic five minutes, in protest against the  decision.    "Although the law does not exactly correspond to our wishes,  it is in line with them," Arpad Duka Zolyomi, a deputy from the  ethnic Hungarian Egyutteles movement, told CTK. He welcomed the  fact that from now on Hungarian women would be allowed to use  their surnames without the "Slovak" suffix of -ova, and  Christian names registered in their Slovak forms may be  rewritten into Hungarian, for example Bela instead of Vojtech.    Chairman of the SNS group of deputies Miloslav Kona said  that  it was an advantage of Slav languages to be able to clearly  indicate a feminine surname. "Now I register the effort to wipe  out this advantage. It is unacceptable," Kona said. "I do not  think anybody is disqualified for using his (her) surname in  line with Slovak language rules," he added.</p>

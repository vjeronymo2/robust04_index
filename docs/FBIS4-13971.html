			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 26, IRNA -- Majlis Vice-Speaker Hojjat  ol-Eslam Hasan Rowhani said here Monday [25 April] that 10,000  Iranian volunteer forces are presently awaiting the U.N.  approval for being dispatched to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Speaking  at the two-day seminar on policies of the world arrogance in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and other Islamic states, he remarked that  despite Iran's readiness, the Iranian forces had not yet been  allowed to be dispatched to that region.    The vice-speaker said that the west was using Russia as an  excuse to withhold help to Muslims adding that the west was now  pretending that it was Russia which, as a member of the Security  Council, would veto decisions of other members made in favor of  the Muslims.    He further said that if the U.S., Britain and France had not  shown the green light to Russia, the latter would not have been  in a position to stand against western powers.    Stressing that over 200,000 Bosnian Muslims were ready to  struggle and sacrifice their lives, Rowhani concluded by saying  that although the U.N. has confirmed that Bosnian Muslims are  under Serbian aggressions, it has so far failed to provide them  with defensive means.</p>

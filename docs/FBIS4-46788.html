			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandra Parakhonya and Nikolay Chernenko, </F> NEZAVISIMOST parliamentary correspondents: "Is Communism Once  Again As Close As It Was in 1919?"]    [Text] Oleksandr Moroz has been elected chairman of  the Supreme Council of Ukraine. Democrats counting on centrist  Vasiliy Durdinets lost the election of speaker by just a couple  of points.    History teaches us that its lessons are never learned... We  will not take it upon ourselves to pass judgment on the state of  memory in other countries, but, for us who live in Ukraine,  memory is quite short. It is as though the four years separating  us from the May days of 1990 did not transpire. Why such a  historical digression? Well, the events of 18 May of this year  in the Ukrainian parliament are painfully reminiscent of that  scenario.    True, four years ago everything was decided beforehand. The  "leading and guiding" party resolved at its plenum to elect  Vladimir Ivashko, first secretary of the Central Committee of  the Ukrainian Communist Party, as chairman of the Supreme  Council of the Ukrainian SSR. Though reduced at that time  basically to a declaration of political pluralism, the  nomination of aspirants from our young democracy to this  position was still of some use to society. For the first time, a  call to reject hegemonism and refrain from electing yet another  party leader as speaker resounded under the arches of the  parliament. A neutral, centrist figure could bring accord to  society. But the Communist majority in the hall shouted and  stamped, listening to itself and deciding things its own way.  How did it all wind up? In August of 1991. It is a blessing that  Ukraine managed to avoid more serious upheaval.    A similar situation was observed last Wednesday--with the  one  difference that almost all those seeking the position of Supreme  Council chairman declared their centrist orientation. But when  the time came for former First Deputy Speaker Vasiliy Durdinets  and leader of the Socialists Oleksandr Moroz to present their  programs, it became clear that it was between them that the  fight for the post of chairman would ensue. The former, not  formally connected with party factions in the parliament,  appeared to be the most centrist figure among the contenders.  While the leftist portion of the parliament immediately sided  with the latter. The Communists also resolved at their plenum to  support Moroz--the chairman of the Political Council of the  Socialist Party. A promising unification of leftist forces,  correct?    The uninterrupted string of conferences of deputy groups and  factions only served to add the finishing touches. On behalf of  future accord and rejecting party ambitions, the leaders of Rukh  [Ukrainian People's Movement for Perestroyka] and the Democratic  Party, Vyacheslav Chornovil and Vladimir Yavorivskyy, withdrew  their candidacies. Mikhail Pavlovskyy, representative of the  Republicans, followed their example. Just a little more, it  would seem, and good judgment would fall upon the hall of  parliament. Just a bit more, and Ukraine would get its first  nonparty speaker. But loyal to Bolshevist traditions, the  Communists, Socialists, and like-minded people were not about to  begin acting on principle--the interests of the party above all  else!    Yuriy Tima and Oleksandr Karpov, the deputy from Kharkov,  decided they too would stay the course along with Oleksandr  Moroz and Vasiliy Durdinets. But Tima and Karpov were just  extras. Discussion of the four candidacies turned into a sham.  Now and again there resounded in the hall fiery appeals to the  leader of the Socialists--"remain loyal to your banner,"  "maintain conviction in the rightness of the cause," "loyalty to  the charted course." Then the uninterrupted ovations. How  familiar it all was! Too late, all too late did Vyacheslav  Chornovil suddenly remember, perceiving the malevolent ruse in  formation of the list of speakers, drawn up contrary to  regulations not by the Rada system, but in the secretariat of  the parliament. The result of the secret voting was  predetermined. Oleksandr Moroz was elected chairman of the  Supreme Council, receiving 171 votes--169 were necessary.    It still remains for Ukraine to interpret what took place in  the parliament last Wednesday. Triumph for some, frustration for  others. So it would seem once again that accord was just an  alluring apparition to our legislators.    But what exactly took place? Figures of familiar hue will  continue to rule us. It would be naive at the very least to  perceive the Ukrainian socialists as true centrists. This is not  France, Sweden, or Austria... We do not doubt the wisdom of  politician Oleksandr Moroz, or his desire to introduce accord  both in society and in the parliament. But will he be  successful? Or will he slide over to the leftmost fringe of  politics, assisted by his friends and comrades-in-arms in the  Communist and Socialist Parties? This is what is alarming. In  addition to everything else, the election of the speaker has  revealed a noticeable striving on the part of a significant  portion of our legislators to begin once again to build a bright  Communist future. This time--in an as yet independent Ukraine.  But if this does not turn out--and there are such feelings in  the parliament--we can again move to the Union.    Of course, today is not 1990. A great deal will depend on  the  actions of the Democrats. Will they join the structures of  authority, or will they be forced to form a distant opposition?  In the first case, they run the risk of turning into hostages of  that same old system; and, in the second--of being regarded as a  destructive force.    One thing is clear--that the time has not yet arrived for  true reformers in Ukraine. The coming presidential elections  will change little here. That scenario is akin to the  parliamentary one. The roles were assigned long, long ago. But  now the fate of independent and democratic Ukraine--is not  clear...    The day of 19 May began in the parliament with consultations  and discussions in deputy groups and factions of the possible  nominations for deputy chairmanship of the Supreme Council and  the chairmanships of committees and commissions.</p>

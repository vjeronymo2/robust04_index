			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Vontobel link to Swiss bank VONTOBEL Holding, the Zurich-based private banking group, has taken an agreed one-third stake in Tardy, de Watteville &amp; Cie, a small Geneva private bank. It plans to raise its share to two-thirds within two years. The price paid - in cash and shares - was not disclosed. The move represents a first step along the path mapped out last May by Mr Hans-Dieter Vontobel, chairman of Vontobel Holding, to ensure an independent future for the family-controlled group. The three existing partners of Tardy, de Watteville will continue to run the Geneva bank, which employs 55 people and had a balance sheet of SFr94m (Dollars 64.9m) at the end of July. One partner, Mr Bernard de Watteville, is to be proposed to the Vontobel board. Mr Vontobel said the transaction fitted in with plans to reduce the family shareholding, while ensuring the group remained independent. He hopes to do this by enlarging the group of shareholders actively involved in management, as well as by increasing the proportion of shares held by the public from the present one-third to over a half. The partnership with Tardy, de Watteville gives Vontobel a presence in Geneva, a leading private banking centre, and access to new francophone markets. Vontobel, a quoted company with 540 employees, had an end-1992 balance sheet of SFr1.49bn, and posted group net profits of SFr24.5m last year.</p>

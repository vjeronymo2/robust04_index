			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- A statement demanding  early normalization of Japan-DPRK diplomatic relations was  adopted at an inaugural meeting of the National Interchange  Society of Listeners to Radio Pyongyang, which was held in Osaka  on April 17.    The statement demanded that the Japanese Government rectify  the external policy, with which it, following the U.S. Korea  policy, has been hostile to the DPRK and joined in freezing the  division of the Korean peninsula.    For Japan to normalize diplomatic relations with the DPRK is  to put an end to the past hostile relations and make a true  international contribution, the statement said, and stressed:    The Japanese Government should normalize Japan-Korea  diplomatic relations, not clamouring for "sanctions" against the  DPRK.    The statement urged the Japanese Government to respect the  spirit of the joint declaration published by the Liberal  Democratic Party and Social Democratic Party of Japan and the  Workers' Party of Korea on September 28, 1990, and propel  negotiations for the normalization of Japan-Korea diplomatic  relations in this spirit.    "The members of the National Interchange Society of  Listeners  to Radio Pyongyang will conduct a more energetic movement to  realize negotiations for the normalization of Japan-Korea  diplomatic relations," it declared.</p>

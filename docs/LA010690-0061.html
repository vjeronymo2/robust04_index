			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ACTOR UNHURT AFTER PLANE CRASHES, CATCHES ON FIRE;  </P> <P> AVIATION: A GUST OF WIND BLEW PLANE PILOTED BY JAMES BROLIN OFF RUNWAY.  </P> <P> Actor James Brolin, Emmy Award-winning star of the television series "Marcus  Welby, M.D.," walked away unhurt from his overturned single-engine plane Friday  seconds before it burst into flames after a crash on takeoff at Agua Dulce  Airport, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies reported.  </P> <P> The 49-year-old actor was alone in the 1978 Cessna 182 when a gust of wind from  behind forced the plane off the runway about 4:20 p.m., authorities said.  </P> <P> The plane flipped down an embankment and the impact apparently ruptured a fuel  line, starting a fire in the engine compartment, Los Angeles County Fire  Department Capt. Ted Lindaman said.  </P> <P> Firefighters allowed the fire to burn out because no structures were  threatened, Lindaman said. The $25,000 plane, owned by Brolin, was destroyed.  </P> <P> The wreckage remained beside the pavement Friday night, awaiting inspection by  federal aviation investigators, authorities said. The airport is about 14 miles  northeast of Saugus.  </P> <P> It was not known if the plane was based at Agua Dulce Airport or had flown in  from elsewhere. Lindaman said Brolin told authorities he lives in Ojai.  </P> <P> In addition to "Marcus Welby, M.D.," Brolin starred in the television series  "Hotel" and has appeared in at least 13 motion pictures, including "The  Amityville Horror" and "Gable and Lombard." He played Dr. Steven Kiley on  "Marcus Welby, M.D."  </P></p>

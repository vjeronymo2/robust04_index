			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Mixed reaction to Renault offer The partial privatisation of Renault, the French motor group, enjoyed strong demand from the company's workforce and institutional investors, but was less enthusiastically received by the public. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, announced yesterday that the public offer drew 1.09m private investors and was 1.4 times subscribed. The number of investors was less than previous issues in the French government's privatisation programme, which have attracted between 1.9m and 3m subscribers. The partial privatisation is part of the government's plan to sell 21 publicly-owned companies. Renault's flotation will bring in just under FFr8bn (Dollars 1.5bn), taking proceeds from the sale of public sector assets to FFr60bn for the year, compared with a target of FFr55bn. 'Our mission is accomplished,' said Mr Alphandery. Mr Alphandery said comparisons with previous issues were misleading because the state was retaining control of Renault with a stake of just over 50 per cent. 'It was a partial privatisation, which tends to limit investors' interest,' he said. Industry analysts added that demand from private investors was limited by the weakness of the Paris stock market and the fact that most privatisation stocks have fallen below their issue price. Given such considerations, Mr Alphandery said that the operation was 'particularly satisfying'. He said the institutional tranche of the issue was 15.5 times subscribed and Renault's employees had shown strong demand for shares. The offer for employees closed last night, but about 60 per cent of the workforce have applied for shares. Mr Alphandery declined to be drawn on whether there would be more asset sales this year. Assurances Generales de France, the insurer, is prepared for privatisation, but the operation is awaiting improved stock market conditions. The government is to invite offers from industrial groups seeking to participate in the privatisation of Groupe Bull, the loss-making computer manufacturer. Renault shares, which will be listed on the Paris stock market today, saw healthy demand on the grey market yesterday, trading at more than FFr10 above the FFr165 paid by private investors.</p>

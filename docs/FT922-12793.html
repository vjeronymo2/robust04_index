The bank intends to construct three office buildings totalling 230,000 sq ft, 22 shops, a restaurant and a wine bar on the triangular site which spans 40 to 53 Threadneedle Street and 1 to 18 Old Broad Street. The site, which at present contains 10 buildings, six of which are listed, is in the Bank Conservation Area covering the financial and commercial core of the City.

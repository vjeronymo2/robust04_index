He was referring to the issue of human rights and added that  China will hold dialogue about any of these issues on an equal  footing with any other nation.    At a general debate about the political, economic and social  situation of the world, Zhu said that any statement or action  which interferes in another country's internal affairs should be  condemned.    He pointed out that the Chinese Government has advocated on  many occasions the establishment of a just and reasonable new  international political and economic order with peace and  stability. "Such an order is based on the five principles of  peaceful co-existence and recognition of the diversity of the  world's nations," he added.    He said China maintains that in the new international  political order, countries should respect one another, cooperate  on an equal footing, oppose hegemonism and power politics,  settle their problems through peaceful negotiation, dialogue and  consultation and refrain from the use or threat of use of force.    Zhu said with the world ushering in a transition towards  multipolarity, conflicts and problems hidden in the previous  bipolar structure have become aggravated and hegemonism and  power politics in international relations are on the increase.    He warned that the world is still turbulent and beset with  many destabilizing factors.    Zhu stated that China maintains that all countries, big or  small, rich or poor, should respect one another, participate in  handling international economic affairs as equal members of the  international community and develop their economic relations and  trade in accordance with the principle of equality and mutual  benefit.    He also said China will never seek hegemonism or become a  super power and it does not, and will not, station a single  soldier in any other country, adding that China will be a  lasting force in keeping world peace instead of posing a threat  to other countries.    Zhu stressed that no matter what changes take place in the  world, China will adhere to its current foreign policy and  continue to develop friendly cooperation with other countries on  the basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence.    The meeting, which began on March 21 and is scheduled to end  on Saturday, focuses on preventing conflicts, peace-keeping,  protecting the international environment and the international  political, economic and social situation.</p>

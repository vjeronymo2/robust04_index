			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MCMAHON'S RIB INJURY KEEPS HIM ON SIDELINE  </P> <P> There was evidence on Wednesday that Jim McMahon's rib injury is more severe  than was originally believed.  </P> <P> Backup quarterback David Archer took all of the snaps in the Chargers' workout,  and Coach Dan Henning said McMahon's ribs were too sore for the quarterback to  call signals.  </P> <P> McMahon threw the ball without difficulty, but only watched as Archer ran the  offense through preparations for Sunday's game against the Houston Oilers at  San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.  </P> <P> After practice, McMahon who earlier in the day had failed to keep an  appointment for a conference call with the Houston media, was in no mood to  discuss the situation. When McMahon saw reporters near his locker, he addressed  them briefly, then turned around and said as he walked away, "I felt great. I  just wanted to take the day off."  </P> <P> Henning said of McMahon, "He didn't practice with the team at all because he  wasn't able to bark signals. It's like when you scream. That's what's painful  to him."  </P> <P> After McMahon left Sunday's game against the Raiders with seven minutes left in  the third quarter, Henning denied that McMahon was injured. Later, it turned  out the Charger quarterback had suffered strained rib muscles.  </P> <P> Still, Henning said on Monday that he was certain McMahon would play Sunday.  Wednesday, Henning seemed to have a particle of doubt. "If he feels like he can  call signals tomorrow, he'll get most of the work," Henning said. "If he  doesn't, we'll get somebody to call signals for him, and by Friday he should be  better. Maybe I'll do it myself.  </P> <P> "I'm led to believe it's an open-ended situation. The doctors say he's OK to  play, and he says he's OK, but if he can't call signals, he'll have a tough  time playing."  </P> <P> Henning made it obvious that he doesn't list Oiler Coach Jerry Glanville among  his closest friends.  </P> <P> Early in the day, Glanville said in a conference call from Houston that after  Henning was named coach at Atlanta, he had broken a promise to interview  Glanville, who had been on the Falcons' staff, for the defensive coordinator's  job. Asked about this, Henning said he had interviewed Glanville in February,  1983.  </P> <P> Their quotes:  </P> <P> Glanville: "We were going to find a secluded place to talk, but we never got  together. It was just as well. If I'd stayed in Atlanta, I'd probably be  selling Toyotas in Marietta (Ga.) Instead, I shuffled off to Buffalo."  </P> <P> Henning: "I interviewed Jerry in my office when he was on the staff that was  let go. It's verifiable, so check it out. I don't know why Jerry would even  bring up anything concerning that matter. Maybe just because he didn't get the  job."  </P> <P> This is the second week in a row that Henning has closed practice to the media,  and Glanville doesn't agree with him on that, either.  </P> <P> Said Glanville: "I try to keep my practices open. I may be passing out free  hats to the media today. I hope to get bumper stickers that say, 'Hug a  reporter today.' The bottom line is that the media has never lost a game."  </P> <P> Told of this, Henning said simply, "That's interesting."  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Cornerback Johnny Thomas, who was among the last players cut last week, was  re-signed and defensive end Gerald Robinson was placed on injured reserve  because of a sore left knee. . . . Henning said wide receiver Darryl Usher,  another player cut last week who was re-signed Tuesday, would return kickoffs  on Sunday. "I would think he'll probably take (Victor) Floyd's place," Henning  said.  </P> <P> "But I'm not happy with the other guy (Jamie Holland) dropping the ball,  either."  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Antonia Radi: "The Unemployment Rate Is 12.6 </F> Percent"]    [Text] The number of registered unemployed persons  declined in February: The local labor affairs offices jointly  recorded a total of 630,000 registered unemployed persons,  10,000 fewer than a month earlier. That brought the unemployment  rate down from 12.8 to 12.6 percent. All this came to light from  the report of the National Labor Affairs Center (OMK).    The OMK data reveal that with the present decline, which  appears to be stable, unemployment has entered a new phase. For  there were 74,000 fewer unemployed at the end of February of  this year than a year earlier.    Although the number of registered unemployed persons  continues to vary by regions, the extreme regional differences  appear to have narrowed. The biggest decline in the number of  registered unemployed occurred mostly in Bacs-Kiskun and  Borsod-Abauj-Zemplen Counties. The situation remains the worst  in Szabolcs County. In metropolitan Budapest as well as in Pest,  Gyor-Moson-Sopron, Vas, and Zala counties the situation is  better than the national average.    The number of unemployed new entrants into the job market  also declined, albeit more moderately. Their closing total at  the end of the month eased from 61,000 to 60,000, and their  proportion within the total number of unemployed dropped from  9.6 to 9.5 percent. OMK experts claim that all this can be  attributed to the programs for retraining.    We also learned that, among the unemployed other than new  entrants into the job market, there are respectively fewer  former agricultural workers and construction workers. On the  other hand there are more unemployed persons who previously had  worked in industry or in nonmaterial services.    During February, nearly 44,000 persons left the system of  provisions for the unemployed. The average length of time an  unemployed persons remains within this system continued to  shorten.    According to the economic players who are obliged to file  notice of their intentions to lay off workers, 26,000 workers  can be expected to be laid off in the near future.</p>

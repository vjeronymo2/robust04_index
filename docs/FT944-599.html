			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Food and Drink: Food fit for another curtain call - Cookery Entertainments work up the appetite. Circus and pantomime matinees are easy to cater for. You lunch beforehand and when you spill out on to the streets after the performance it is time for a slap-up tea. Gunters, in London's Curzon Street, was the favoured venue when I was a child. Warm and brightly lit with a Christmas tree, it brimmed with jovial uncles. The sort of uncles who told silly jokes, who understood full well that sandwiches were of little interest to girls and boys, and who pressed half-crowns into the hands of their nephews and nieces at the end of the day. When such uncles were in charge, second helpings - even thirds - of ice cream were a distinct possibility, and plates of desirably sticky buns, biscuits and cakes were replenished as fast as they were devoured: meringues, chocolate eclairs and walnut cake among them. An amazing succession of treats when you consider that sweets were still on ration at the time. Grown-up theatre parties are more vexed gastronomically, as the timing nearly always cuts across the hour at which one wants to dine. You can of course grab a bite during the interval to spare you the embarrassment of tummy rumblings during the third act. But in that case the crush of the crush bar and the rush of eating quickly is liable to replace hunger pangs with terrible indigestion. Much more civilised, surely, is the old-fashioned habit of tucking into an unhurried bonne bouche before the curtain goes up and returning home afterwards for the main course and dessert. The alternative is to patronise a restaurant close to the theatre that allows you to split your meal in this way. Traditional bonne bouches include smoked salmon sandwiches, potted shrimps, oysters, oeufs en cocotte and scotch woodcock. More contemporary choices include grilled aubergine with pesto, chicken liver crostini and roasted red peppers with rocket and squid. The post-theatre part of the supper, if taken at home, should be simple, special and fast work - I mean capable of being brought to table within 10 minutes of opening the front door. And I can think of nothing more appropriate to follow an evening at the opera than sumptuous little tournedos Rossini. Rossini was as passionate about food as music. As Harry Luke points out in The Tenth Muse, he composed both The Barber of Seville and La Cenerentola before he was 25 and he did not write another opera after he was 35. 'Become rich and idle and concentrating thenceforth on good living, he settled in France . . . and devoted the last 40 years of his life to culinary rather than musical composition.' Tournedos Rossini is arguably one of his finest works. It is a dish that demands little time and no special cooking skills. It calls for few ingredients - but the finest. Escoffier gives the recipe in his Guide to Modern Cookery. 'Fry some tournedos in butter. Dish them on crusts of fried bread. On each tournedos lay a round slice of foie gras just a little smaller than the former; the slices should be seasoned, dredged and turned in butter. On each slice of foie gras, set a fine slice of truffle.' The 1961 edition of Larousse Gastronomique offers a greedier interpretation, specifying 'three good slices of truffle for each tournedos' and it instructs the cook at the end 'to dilute the pan juices with Madeira and demi-glace'. Take your pick. Now, some of you may have gained the impression from my recent columns that I do not consider foie gras and truffles good companions. Far from it. It is true that cooking and preserving the two ingredients together strikes me as a terrible waste, for most of the flavour and fragrance of a truffle is lost when cooked. As Elizabeth Rostaing, of Gourmet Foods from France, puts it: 'Truffles substantially enhance the price but not the flavour of preserved foie gras.' But combining foie gras and truffles at the point of serving is a very different matter - it is a marriage made in heaven. Fresh white truffles from northern Italy, the most expensive and best, are usually in season until just after Christmas. The season for black truffles from France runs until March. Rostaing is thinking of bringing some over from Provence when they are harvested there in late January and February. Interested parties should contact her in good time (tel: 081-788 6908 and fax: 081-789 2732). If tournedos Rossini seem a mite too extravagant even for the festive season, or if some of your guests do not eat meat, an attractive alternative choice for a theatre supper would be a fish soup-cum-stew served with aioli. This is more work for the cook but most of it can be done ahead, leaving you only to reheat the broth (rich fish stock spiked with saffron, wine, chunks of fennel, potato, leek and red pepper) and to add the fishy morsels (monkfish, cod, scallops, squid, prawns, mussels or what you will) on your return home. I suggest following either dish effortlessly with salad and cheese, and offering Elvas plums with coffee as a final curtain call.</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: MADONNA GETS IT 'ALTOGETHER' FOR VANITY FAIR  </P> <P> "I SLEEP a certain number of hours every night, then I like to get up and get  on with it. I set aside the hours I have to exercise. Then I set aside the  hours for creativity. Yes, I can summon my creativity!" says Madonna to Kevin  Sessums in the sizzling new Vanity Fair.  </P> <P> This April issue hits it big with Madonna on the cover and on nine pages  inside, photographed seductively by Helmut Newton (who else?). Of course, there  is an obligatory Newton-type picture of Madonna baring one breast. This is the  first look at a part of Madonna's "altogether" since those early nude shots  (made when she was little more than a young girl) surfaced in the skin  magazines.  </P> <P> But there is a lot more to Madonna's interview than tantalizing glimpses of her  famous flesh. The star talks candidly about her fame: "Listen -- how can you  say I'm a private person if I'm in show business? Just because I conduct myself  in a particular way, you couldn't straight-facedly call me a private person."  On Warren Beatty, her "Dick Tracy" co-star: "He's been an icon for years . . .  obviously, somebody who hasn't experienced it would be more threatened by my  fame than he is. . . . We're just perfect together." Madonna breaks into tears  while discussing her ex-husband, Sean Penn. She says the divorce was "like a  death to deal with. It's very, very difficult." And, of course, Madonna  addresses the Sandra Bernhard did-they-or-didn't-they question. They didn't,  says Madonna. It was all in fun, a hoot, but, "It got out of hand and then I  didn't want to do it anymore."  </P> <P> But typically, Madonna's most potent remarks concern AIDS and the Catholic  church. "I want to do anything I can to promote AIDS education. . . . Aside  from Hitler, AIDS is the worst thing to happen in the 20th Century. The sad  thing is that it makes people even more bigoted. It gives people a reason to  vent their true feelings about homosexuality." And how does the Catholic  superstar view the Catholic church's stand on homosexuality? "I think it's  disgusting. I think it's hypocritical. And unloving. It's not what God and  Christianity are all about."  </P> <P> MADONNA ASIDE, the most fascinating article to me in this particular issue is  Gerri Hirshey's interview with Judith Campbell Exner. It is the heart-wrenching  story of how Judith has been reunited with the son she gave away at birth (an  effort to protect the child from all the FBI surveillance, torment and media  furor that came about after she was revealed to be a John F. Kennedy mistress  and a messenger between the President and mobster Sam Giancana).  </P> <P> This is the first story ever to do justice to the miseries of Exner, who has  been painted as a kind of scarlet woman because she dared to sleep with a  married man. To make matters worse, many were scandalized that Judith resembled  Jacqueline Kennedy.  </P> <P> About the son -- his father is a well-known movie executive. He has been  advised of the boy's existence but wants nothing to do with him. Exner's child,  when he became an adult, sought her out and recently found her. She is mortally  ill with cancer, but he visits her frequently and is devoted. The Judith Exner  story is not a pretty one but, at least, it has the glimmer of a happy ending.  </P></p>

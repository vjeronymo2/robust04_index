			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Navy job cuts and closures attacked UNION LEADERS and Labour politicians yesterday attacked closures and cuts at Royal Navy support facilities involving 2,500 civilian jobs. South-west Wales will be seriously affected. The Trecwn armaments depot near Fishguard is to close with the loss of 500 jobs and the ending of jet pilot training at Brawdy near Haverfordwest will mean 80 civilian redundancies. However, overall job losses in naval support have been reduced by more than 300 compared with plans announced last July and discussed with unions. The jobs saved are at the Rosyth base on the Firth of Forth - where 800 employees are still due to go - and at a stores depot at Copenacre in Wiltshire. The latter will not now be closed, but 550 jobs are to be cut. The navy will go ahead with shedding 380 jobs at the Ernesettle armaments depot near Plymouth and closing the naval air station HMS Daedalus at Lee-on-Solent, employing 200 people. The MoD said the cuts should save Pounds 300m over 10 years. It hoped staff would transfer to other areas, but some redundancies would be unavoidable. Mr Tom King, defence secretary, accused opposition parties of 'a blatant attempt at gross deceit' in pretending their proposals would be less harsh. Mr Allan Rogers, a Labour defence spokesman, said the measures would be 'absolutely devastating' for south-west Wales. He dismissed charges that cuts would be worse under Labour as 'another Tory lie'. The Ministry of Defence is to assist the Welsh Office in setting up a 'task force' to study possibilities for new industries. Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, announced Pounds 2.2m in emergency short-term aid for rural west Wales. About Pounds 40m is to be spent at RAF St Athan, near Cardiff, which is due to take on maintenance work from other RAF stations.</p>

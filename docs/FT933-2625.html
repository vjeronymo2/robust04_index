			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Moorfield Pounds 13m buy as losses fall MOORFIELD Estates, the USM-quoted property trader and investor, yesterday unveiled a package comprising a Pounds 13m acquisition, a placing and open offer and additional banking facilities. It also reported a cut in pre-tax losses from Pounds 774,000 to Pounds 244,000 for the six months to end-June. The acquisition is a portfolio of 10 properties from British Land for a cash consideration of Pounds 12.84m. The properties have been valued by Chesterton at Pounds 13.3m. The placing and open offer of 21.62m new ordinary shares at 37p will raise about Pounds 8m before expenses. Some Pounds 3.9m will be used to finance part of the acquisition, a further Pounds 800,000 will repay short term loans and Pounds 2.9m will provide funds for further property purchases and working capital. There is a clawback for existing shareholders on a 2-for-1 basis. The shares closed 4p higher at 45p. Moorfield has also entered into a new five-year loan agreement with the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in connection with the acquisition which will provide a further Pounds 10.9m. Of this, about Pounds 9.1m will be used to fund the remainder of the acquisition. The balance will be used to refinance certain existing short term loans. At least Pounds 1m of the loan is to repaid by October 1995 from the proceeds of property sales. The portfolio being acquired has a current rental income of Pounds 1.31m, giving a yield of 10.2 per cent on the purchase price. The new shares have been conditionally placed by NatWest Wood Mackenzie, the company's brokers. An extraordinary meeting to seek shareholder approval of the acquisition and placing and open offer has been convened for October 11. The reduction in interim losses was mainly attributable to an increase in rental income to Pounds 881,000 (Pounds 774,000), a cut in interest payable to Pounds 751,000 (Pounds 945,000) and lower administration expenses of Pounds 224,000 (Pounds 365,000). Losses per share were cut to 2.23p (9.01p). Subject to approval being received for the acquisition, placing and open offer a dividend totalling not less than 1p will be paid for 1994 with 0.5p being paid as an interim in September of that year. The last dividend payment was 0.1p for the 1991 year.</p>

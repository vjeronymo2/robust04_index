			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Susan Moss bases her "Pond/Frond" paintings on the idea that 20th-Century man  is too busy to appreciate the details in nature. "We haven't time for deep  emotional introspection," she says in a statment about the work, going on to  explain that her "out-of-phase landscapes are a guide to a sublime and  spiritual place." Moss is assuming an awful lot here. While one doesn't take  issue with her opinions on the harried pace of modern life or the healing  properties of art and nature, exactly how these hysterical paintings function  as a tonic to those ills remains a mystery. Moss has the shrill sense of color  of a graffiti artist and favors Pollock's philosophy of technique; just make  your way to a canvas and emote. While this troglodyte approach may suffice for  the rare truly gifted genius, in lesser hands it results in run-of-the-mill  rantings of misguided individuals harboring the illusion that their Angst is of  interest. While one could spin Abstract Expressionist castles in the air about  the surface tension, spatial depth and energized brush strokes in Moss'  paintings, the best that can honestly be said about them is that they're highly  decorative.

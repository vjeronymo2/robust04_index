			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Union Pacific improves 22% Record traffic levels helped produce a 22 per cent increase in fourth-quarter net profits to Dollars 235m for Union Pacific, the US rail and natural resources group reported yesterday. However, CSX, another of the biggest rail operators, turned in a slight decline to Dollars 151m from Dollars 152m for the same period because of the effects on coal loadings of weak export demand and the US miners' strike. For Union Pacific, the traffic growth came from four main sectors. Car and truck deliveries were up by 12 per cent, coal carryings rose by 14 per cent, chemicals were up by 4 per cent, and intermodal traffic rose by 6 per cent. The group saw strong growth at Union Pacific Resources, its oil and gas subsidiary, which increased earnings by 36 per cent on the back of higher volumes and an increase in gas prices. Earnings per share for the quarter were 21 per cent up at Dollars 1.14. Full-year figures, reflecting losses caused by the Midwest floods, showed a decline in net income to Dollars 530m from Dollars 728m, but Union Pacific said the latest figure would have been Dollars 705m without the effect of non-recurring charges for accounting adjustments totalling Dollars 175m. At CSX, depressed coal loadings were mostly offset by gains in the company's other transport activities in the fourth quarter, and earnings per share were little changed at Dollars 1.46, compared with Dollars 1.47. For the year, net income rose to Dollars 359m from Dollars 20m because the previous year included a restructuring charge. Full-year earnings per share were Dollars 3.46 compared with 19 cents.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: Chase Manhattan to spin off HK credit-card unit CHASE Manhattan, the big New York bank engaged in a wide-ranging restructuring programme, is to spin off its Hong Kong credit-card operation. Mr James Brew, senior vice-president of Chase Manhattan Bank, said yesterday that an application had been filed with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. He did not say how much would be raised through an initial public offering. The money raised would be used, he said, to feed the bank's expanding Visa Cards and Mastercards operation, which has grown by more than 30 per cent annually for the past two years. Chase had more than 300,000 cards in use in Hong Kong in December, Mr Brew said. This accounted for 14 per cent of the local market share. In terms of accounts receivable, the bank had an 18 per cent share. In an attempt to step up the expansion of its credit-card operations, he said the bank was in talks with potential partners which might take a stake in the division in a pre-listing placement. The bank is also arranging a Dollars 220m syndication loan, which will be used as funding for the card operation as a result of a separation of assets and liabilities with the bank after the listing. The flotation will be jointly sponsored by Chase Manhattan Asia, its merchant banking arm, and SG Warburg (Securities). Peregrine Brokerage will act an an underwriter. For 1992, the Hong Kong operation reported a rise of more than 33 per cent in profits in excess of HKDollars 100m (USDollars 12.9m) on turnover of HKDollars 450m. Last month Chase group as a whole reported higher first-quarter earnings and announced plans to raise Dollars 750m of new equity capital while also writing off Dollars 1bn of commercial property loans.</p>

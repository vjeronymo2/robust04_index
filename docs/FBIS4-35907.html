			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Arye Egozi] </F>   [Text] Israel Aircraft Industries [IAI] is operating  special production lines to produce artillery shells for use by  Eastern European armies. This fact was revealed yesterday at  the opening of the Israeli pavilion at the military fair in Brno  in the Czech Republic. Procurement backorders from Eastern  Europe currently total approximately $100 million.    IAI has marked Eastern Europe as a major target for the  export of military systems. On the basis of orders submitted by  several Eastern European armies, IAI has begun to produce  artillery and tank shells in order to replace the ammunition  that was supplied to these countries in the past by the former  Soviet Union. Among other steps, IAI has developed an  accelerated production line for 100 mm shells for T-55 tanks and  125 mm shells for T-72 models. Artillery shells have also been  developed, including state-of-the-art cluster shells, both 130  mm and 152 mm in diameter.    IAI is also selling machine guns, assault rifles, and  handguns to Eastern Europe. Contacts are underway for  additional deals.    Eleven Israeli companies are exhibiting their wares at the  Brno military fair, including the IAI, REFA'EL [Armament  Development Authority], Tadiran, El-Op, Elbit, and Elisra, which  produces electronic systems and sophisticated weapon systems.    Senior Czech Army officials and senior representatives of  other Eastern European armies are expected to visit the fair  during the four days it is held.</p>

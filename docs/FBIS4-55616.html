			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ryszard Zabinski: "Grzegorz Kolodko, or </F> Production and Investment"]    [Text] Poland Anno Domini 1990 was the first historical  example of a country moving from socialism to capitalism. We  became a quite unique experimental laboratory for a variety of  advisers like Jeffrey Sachs. But there was too high a price to  pay for some of those experiments--in the form of the collapse  of many state enterprises, extensive unemployment, and so on.    That is, more or less, the line of reasoning adopted by  Grzegorz Kolodko, the new "father" of our economy. Does it  signify a departure from the liberalism represented by the  Gdansk school--that is, the policy we have attempted to put in  practice for the past four years?    Grzegorz Kolodko has a long-term concept of our future  economic development. As a fertile publicist and author, he  often presented and interpreted his vision for the public's  benefit. It must be admitted that, despite the passage of  years, his program has remained almost unchanged and is still  very good.    However, we still have many legitimate doubts as to whether  he will be able to translate it into practical terms. The  foundation of his idea is rapid production growth, which should  in turn cause an increase in the national income. In the next  four years, production should grow by as much as 26 percent and  national income by 23 percent (that is, approximately 5.6  percent annually).    We should be able to achieve this through exports, the  development of the economic infrastructure (transport and  communications), and an inexpensive housing-construction  program. At the same time, as we carry out major capital  investment projects, we should achieve a reduction of  unemployment figures.    Exports should be the number-one priority. They are the  principal economic growth tool of any state that wants to become  an economic tiger. The state must support exports through  credit guarantees, export tax and tariff concessions, the  development of free trade zones, and so on.    The development of the infrastructure is achieved primarily  through building superhighways and investing in the growth of  telecommunications networks. As regards the first of these  goals, Poland would find its chief opportunity by joining in the  EEC Growth Initiative Scheme. I will deliberately avoid  discussing the question of housing construction here because  this sector was supposed to serve as the main "flywheel" of the  Polish economy ever since the Gierek era.    There is no doubt that a program that places such strong  emphasis on capital investment and production is bound to be  very expensive. Who is going to pay for it? Any major budget  deficit will be made good through the issuance of special State  Treasury bonds. It is envisaged that a system of incentives  (based on special tax allowances) will be introduced here to  encourage the public to buy these bonds.    Another method, the simplest, would be to increase taxation  rates. However, Grzegorz Kolodko proposes an alternative  solution here: to increase the number of taxpayers in the  country by, among other things, bringing the economic "gray  zone" into the open and subjecting it to the normal fiscal  regulations and obligations. Consequently, we can expect to see  the introduction of many radical measures in this area. I must  admit that this element of Kolodko's program raises the greatest  doubts in observers' minds. If it does not succeed, which could  happen very easily, we will have to review that section of the  whole program quite radically and burden honest taxpayers with  the obligation to help with the budget deficit.    The expected deepening of the budget deficit will not be  the result of more money having been pumped into the so-called  budget-funded sectors of the economy (administration, education,  health service, and so on), so the latter will not benefit from  it at all. Instead of linking their pay increases to the  inflation rate and reviewing their pay structure, they will be  offered alternative compensatory pay in the form of  "zero-interest" State Treasury bonds, which, however, will be  index-linked to the movement of production prices.    An additional source of budget revenues should come from,  among other things, increased excise charges, the introduction  of border duty (approximately $10-15 per person for crossing the  state border), and the introduction of stock market tax for all  investors.    This last idea entails a particular risk because the  proposed  stock market tax would not be charged on individual transactions  but on stock market investment gains. Such an unfortunate move  would doubtless scare investors away from the stock market and  induce them to place their money in, say, the bonds and  securities market. I strongly suspect that that is what the new  deputy prime minister is after: to get people to make good--at  least partly--the budget deficit by buying State Treasury  securities.    Kolodko's concepts are not presented in the form of an  official document. Nothing has yet been decided beyond the  possibility of change. They are simply the new prime minister's  views on the state economy, but he will doubtless set about  putting them into practice.    The economic reforms of the past four years have been  implemented under the motto of liberalization of the market; the  next four years are supposed to be devoted to the goals of  production and investment. However, it is quite likely that  this program will prove too hard on employees and workers of the  budget-funded sectors of the economy. The populists will still  have a good chance of acceding to positions of power on the  pretext of creating the mythical "third way."</p>

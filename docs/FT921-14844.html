			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: Domtar anticipates recovery by year-end DOMTAR, the Canadian pulp and paper and building materials group, believes a US economic recovery spurred by cheap money will restore its profitability by the year-end. Domtar, owned 40 per cent by two Quebec government agencies, is Canada's biggest producer of commodity and speciality fine papers, mainly for export to the US, and is North America's number three producer of gypsum wallboard. It also makes packaging products. The company is one of the first Canadian forest products groups to be hit by recession, but, after 1982-83, it was one of the first to recover as US interest rates tumbled. 'This time recovery probably will be slower,' said Mr Halford Wilson, the company's treasurer. 'But, if everything comes together, we'll be moving firmly towards profits by the end of 1992,' he added. He said Domtar's fourth-quarter loss would be in line with the third - then it reported a deficit of CDollars 39m (USDollars 33.9m), or 44 cents a share, on sales of CDollars 454m. The nine-month loss was CDollars 104m, or CDollars 1.26, a share on sales of CDollars 1.4bn. Domtar will continue in the red for most of 1992, said Mr Wilson, but cash-flow will strengthen as North American timber, pulp, packaging and finally, newsprint markets pick up. Pulp has gained around USDollars 20 per tonne since early December and list prices move to USDollars 540 a tonne on February 1. Wallboard's outlook is uncertain, he said, because the two leading US producers were in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection proceedings and were pricing for market share. Since US commercial building has virtually dried up, only an upsurge in the residential sector, spurred by low interest rates, can turn the market around. Domtar, in good years, has shown CDollars 100m in operating profit from its building materials business. The company cut CDollars 150m from its cost base in 1991 and plans further reductions totalling CDollars 100m in 1992. 'The potential for a bounceback is strong, once demand begins to catch up with supply,' said Mr Wilson. About CDollars 100m will be spent on capital projects this year, which is the same as in 1991. Improvement will bring capacity at its CDollars 1bn fine paper mill near Montreal by 1993 to 500,000 tonnes yearly from 350,000 tonnes. Domtar's domestic plants, after the heavy restructuring and manpower cuts of the past two years, can now compete with the Canadian dollar trading around 88 cents US, said Mr Wilson. 'As a major exporter, we want the Canadian dollar in the low eighties, because each one-cent movement affects our profitability by about CDollars 11m a year pre-tax. But anybody thinking of 75 cents US is living in a dream world of exchange profits.' The Quebec government plans to sell its Domtar control during the next industry upturn, or merge the company into a bigger group.</p>

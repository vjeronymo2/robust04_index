			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Isetan ahead sharply despite drop in sales Isetan, a leading Japanese department store, posted a sharp rise in interim recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - as a result of cost-cutting, including a reduction of advertising and transportation spending. Recurring profits for the first six months to September rose 43 per cent to Y935m (Dollars 9.5m). Sales, however, fell 2.6 per cent to Y195.4bn, and Isetan officials said purchase value per customer continued to decline. After-tax profits jumped 103.8 per cent to Y463m. Sales of clothing fell 2.3 per cent to Y90bn while food sales declined 2.4 per cent to Y35.5bn. Sales to corporate customers fell 7 per cent from the previous year. For the full year to next March, Isetan expects current profits to rise 26.8 per cent to Y5.5bn, the first increase in four years. Sales are expected to fall 1.9 per cent to Y413bn and after-tax profits are seen declining 52.2 per cent to Y2.4bn.</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Rabin and Arafat in accord on poll talks Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman Yassir Arafat held a remarkably good natured meeting yesterday, agreeing that negotiators from each side would meet in Cairo next week to plan the details of Palestinian elections. In marked contrast to the tense, ill-natured atmosphere that has characterised previous talks between them, Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat emerged from their meeting at the Erez crossing point between Israel and Gaza smiling and conversing easily with each other, and then held a joint press conference in which they both played down the differences that are delaying implementation of the next stages of the Palestinian autonomy accord. The main conflict is over proposals for elections throughout the occupied territories, with Israel insisting that only a cabinet-style administrative body be voted into office to run the Palestinian self rule areas, and the PLO demanding that a legislative parliament be elected, with about 100 members. Mr Arafat says he wants to hold the vote on November 1. Mr Rabin says so early a date is unrealistic. Negotiators will try to resolve the issue when they meet in Cairo next week. Separate teams of negotiators, the two men agreed yesterday, will also meet in Cairo to discuss various security issues. The key to the unusually pleasant atmosphere at yesterday's meeting probably lies in Mr Arafat's ready agreement 'to take all measures' to prevent attacks on Israeli targets by Palestinian extremists opposed to the autonomy process. Israel's Central Bank yesterday raised interest rates by 1.5 percentage points to 15.5 per cent in a renewed effort to curb inflation, writes David Horovitz. The governor of the Bank of Israel, Professor Jacob Frenkel, said the sharp rise was designed to rein in a boom in personal consumption, which is driving up imports and contributing to a worsening balance of payments deficit. Combined with a package of anti-inflationary measures agreed by the cabinet this month, Prof Frenkel said the rise should help the government meet its 8-11 per cent target for inflation in 1995. Inflation for 1994 is currently running at 14.5 per cent, double the government's original target.</p>

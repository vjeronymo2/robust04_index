The talks, originally scheduled for Jan. 18-19, were  postponed at Russia's request after the Russian delegation  leader Vasiliy Svirin was reported to have fallen ill.    The two parties reached agreement on the new date of the  talks on Jan. 20, said Ago Tiiman, secretary of the Estonian  delegation. Russia has said it will this time present a detailed  timetable for the withdrawal of its troops from Estonia.    Russia in the last round of talks suggested Aug. 31, 1994,  as  the final deadline for the pullout. Estonia has agreed in  principle with the deadline but says Russia still must present a  timetable showing the terms for the withdrawal of each major  unit.    The head of the Estonian delegation, Vaino Reinart, has  earlier said the presenting of the timetable won't affect the  final deadline.</p>

			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KABC-AM TALKS A GOOD GAME BEFORE COURT  </P> <P> In the latest round of radio moniker wars, a federal court judge has ruled that  talk radio is not a generic term and that KABC-AM (790) has a right to use it  as an identifying slogan while rival talk station KFI-AM (640) does not.  </P> <P> In an order handed down late Friday but not received by the stations' attorneys  until Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Richard A. Gadbois ruled against talk  station KFI-AM (640), which had claimed that the term was generic. The judge's  decision upheld a May ruling that enjoined KFI from using the term talk radio  in conjunction with its call letters and dial position.  </P> <P> "KABC has offered evidence that listeners in the Los Angeles AM radio market  primarily associate talk radio with KABC, not with a program format," Gadbois  wrote. "This evidence is sufficient such that a reasonable fact finder could  find that talk radio is not a generic term."  </P> <P> "All of us are delighted with the decision," KABC attorney Steven M. Perry said  Monday. "This concludes the litigation at the trial court level."  </P> <P> KFI attorneys said they probably will appeal the decision.  </P> <P> KABC filed a trademark infringement suit against KFI in April, saying that it  had the sole right to use the talk radio label in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> In court papers, KABC said it adopted its all-talk format in 1960 and, in 1972,  "invented and adopted the trademark and trade name 'KABC Talk Radio.' " The  suit said KABC was the only station to use the term for 17 years until KFI  began using the slogan in March, 1989.  </P> <P> The two stations argued in federal court Sept. 28 before Gadbois.  </P></p>

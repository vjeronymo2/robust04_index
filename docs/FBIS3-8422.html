High Commission for  Refugees (UNHCR) to do everything in its power to prevent the  forceful expulsion of Yugoslav citizens from Germany and that  their status is determined before that.    The permanent Yugoslav mission at the Geneva U.N.  headquarters sent a letter to U.N. High Commissioner for  Refugees Sadako Ogata saying that Germany has not officially  informed the Yugoslav authorities about its intention for the  mass expulsion of Yugoslav citizens -- Serbs, Montenegrins and  Albanians, who are being denied refugee status.    In question are 200,000 people whose requests for asylum in  Germany were rejected, the letter said.    It underscored that Yugoslavia will not prevent the return  of  its citizens who have the correct documents, but warned that  those persons who do not fulfill the requirements of the  Yugoslav law, will not be able to enter Yugoslav territory.    If Germany expels such persons, UNHCR should prepare camps  for them in Romania, the letter said.    If Germany carries out its threats, UNHCR should also act in  Yugoslav territory to prevent the deterioration of the already  grave situation regarding the refugees.    In Yugoslavia there are some 600,000 registered refugees  from  the breakaway ex-Yugoslav republics, and estimates are that  there are at least 200,000 unregistered refugees living with  relatives and friends.    Yugoslavia believes that UNHCR should insist that the German  authorities strictly respect the 1951 Convention on the  protection of refugees, the 1967 Protocol and other relevant  international documents, and thus prevent yet another  humanitarian catastrophe, the letter said.    Bonn's decision to expel Yugoslav citizens is clearly aimed  to exert political pressure on Yugoslavia. It is simultaneous  with the persecution and arrests of Serbs in Germany on charges  of alleged war crimes in ex-Yugoslavia.    At the same time, Bosnian Serb military sources claim that  Moslem refugees are being rounded up in Germany and dispatched  to the Moslem Army in the civil war-torn ex-Yugoslav Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

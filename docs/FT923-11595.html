			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Investment in Venezuela still strong FOREIGN investment in Venezuela has remained strong this year, according to government estimates, despite continuing political problems following February's unsuccessful coup attempt, writes Joe Mann in Caracas. The Ministry of Development estimated that direct foreign investment for the first half of this year reached about Dollars 550m, sharply higher than in the same period last year. New investment was concentrated in industry, with a big share going to petrochemicals. Investments included fresh capital from overseas, reinvestment of retained earnings by foreign companies, and debt-equity swaps.</p>

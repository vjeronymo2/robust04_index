			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Leading Article: Lessons for bank lemmings IS THE worst over for hard-hit banks in the debt-laden English-speaking economies? Certainly there is room for guarded optimism in the US, though less on the basis of this week's buoyant first quarter earnings figures than the improving state of the economy and the longer-term trend in credit ratings. The restoration of bank profitability has long been an implicit goal of Federal Reserve policy and the Fed has already reaped a partial reward in the sense that the ratings of most big commercial banks have not deteriorated further over the past year. Citicorp, admittedly, continues to give the rating agencies the odd twinge. But the overall trend is healthy. The outlook is far more cloudy in Britain, where membership of the exchange rate mechanism means that monetary policy is singularly insensitive to the problems of the banking system. The clearing banks have the advantage over their US counterparts in a stronger initial capital position. But their problems in property lending pose a growing threat - witness the troubles of Olympia &amp; York, Heron International and Speyhawk, which emerged immediately after provisions and write-offs had been struck for 1991. Nor is it likely to end there. In the recessions of the mid-1970s and early 1980s, interest rates on property company debt were negative. This time they are positive, which means that interest is often rolling up on debts that now exceed depressed asset values. It thus becomes harder to bridge the gap between debt and asset values over time. So the banks will be under far greater pressure to foreclose; and the pressure will be further increased by the knowledge that the big investment institutions are very reluctant buyers, in contrast to the position in the second half of the 1970s. Debt overhang The overhang of Pounds 40bn of bank debt in property has been turning progressively into equity over the past two years. Acknowledging that fact implies a more substantial write-off, in a period of disinflation, than would have been necessary in the two preceding recessions. Mr John Reed, chairman of Citicorp, once described bank lending as 'information on the move'. The experience of banks across the globe in real estate looks more like a case of lemmings on the move, despite all the information. A more charitable explanation is a familiar one that bears repeating. The rush into real estate was really the natural response of a banking system that was required to become more competitive because of deregulation at precisely the moment that its credit rating collapsed, after the Mexican default of 1982. Risky adventures The banking system's best customers found that they could by-pass the banks by raising money directly from the markets. Consequently the banks found themselves short of good borrowers. They turned to real estate, leveraged buy-outs and other high-risk adventures to plug that gap. The disastrous outcome raises important questions about the nature of banking and of banking regulation. It is striking, for example, that the damage was far worse in those countries with sophisticated financial systems. Clever risk pricing and asset management strategies provided little protection against loss. Nor did the supervisory efforts of central bankers. Nor, again, did capital. Dozens of New England savings and loans that turned to the stock market for equity capital in the 1980s acquired equity-asset ratios of more than 20 per cent. It did not protect them from disaster in the real estate bubble. And the Anglo-Saxon countries that supposedly have far greater accountability to shareholders appear to have suffered more than those in continental Europe where such accountability is minimal. That underlines the inherent tension within banking systems that are required both to satisfy the demands of profit-maximisation and to play a wider role in monetary policy and payments services. It also points to the pressing need for more research into the problem of reconciling stability with efficiency in the banking system. The English-speaking economies may have felt the biggest shocks of deregulation, but that underlying conundrum is a long way from being resolved.</p>

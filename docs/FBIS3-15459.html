One Should Be Happy  About This"]    [Text] Any politician in a civilized country is happy if  his political weight (as reflected in particular in public  opinion polls and expert surveys) grows. And it is only in the  perverted Soviet (currently Russian) politics, more back-stage  than open and fair, that this is feared. Moreover, attempts are  even being made to cast a shadow on those who conduct and  publish such polls.    In his speech the day before yesterday Viktor Chernomyrdin  said among other things the following:    "I cannot but touch upon a problem that is extremely  important both for myself in person and for the government I  head. The fact is that recently a noisy campaign has been  launched in certain news media aimed to `catch' the government  chairman in allegedly concentrating power, taking too much on  himself, and generally doing little short of hatching  conspiracies to get to the presidential chair. They have even  begun to build some rating charts on this score."    We know that there were words inserted into the report  following the publication of the February NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA-VP  "100 Politicians" rating. We venture to assure the prime  minister that our survey, conduced for the last 14 months now,  was not launched to set him against the president by February  1994. Especially given that the two above mentioned statesmen  have plenty of cause for such a quarrel without our NEZAVISIMAYA  GAZETA. This cause in particular is successfully being  furthered by some pro-government and pro-presidential  publications. Fortunately, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA does not belong  to either. It is independent. This is printed in large-size  letters on top of its first page.</p>

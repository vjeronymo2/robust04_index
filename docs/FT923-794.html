			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / V2 celebrations in Germany criticised A ROW broke out yesterday over German plans to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the first launch of Hitler's 'wonder weapon', the V2 rocket that was supposed to humble Britain, Reuter reports from Berlin. Critics say the celebration on October 3 in the former rocket base of Peenemunde is in poor taste, because the supersonic V2 killed thousands of British civilians, while 20,000 concentration camp inmates died making it. The organisers of the event say the V2 launch represents 'the first step into space'. After the war the V2's inventor, Werner von Braun, was put in charge of the US space programme that put the first man on the moon in 1969. 'Werner von Braun's achievements are fantastic but you have to relate them to Nazi crimes,' said Mr Gunther Gottmann, director of Berlin's Museum of Transport and Technology. The reception in Peenemunde is funded by Germany's aerospace industry and will be attended by senior company and government officials. The organisers say there is no reason to feel ashamed of von Braun's achievements, even though the engineer ignored inhuman conditions in an underground factory in the Nazi concentration camp Dora. 'One shouldn't poke around in these old wounds,' said Mr Peter Profe, who runs the V2 museum in Peenemunde. The row over Peenemunde could revive tension between Britain and Germany over the war. German officials protested in May when Britain erected a statue to General Arthur 'Bomber' Harris, who initiated the carpet bombing which destroyed Dresden and many other cities.</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Own up to school fee troubles HEADS OF some of the top fee-paying schools in the UK this week took a cue from banks and building societies and urged hard-pressed parents to bring to their attention any financial difficulties before they became acute. They said that schools would often be able to help, though boys might receive more assistance than girls. The Independent Schools Information Service says that the number of pupils receiving financial help from schools has doubled since 1982. 'If parents come to schools and explain, there can often be some accommodation,' said Enid Castle, principal of Cheltenham Ladies College, 'We don't have the sort of endowment that enables us to help as much as some boys' schools, but we do, from fee income, help where we can. If parents fall into difficulties we assist.' Castle said that at present 106 girls receive help in the form of scholarships, bursaries or grants given by the College. About half of these are actually on scholarships while the rest are being helped in cases of financial need. Although she did not have an exact comparative figure, Castle said her impression was that cases of financial need were about 25 per cent up on last year. Geoffrey Parker, high master of Manchester Grammar School, said that the school had a policy of taking suitably qualified boys regardless of ability to pay the fees. About one quarter of his pupils are receiving assistance. 'Usually we are helping people in difficulty to the tune of about five or six a year,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Middle East -- </F> Details on Joint Action Decided by Council of Union in Support  of Peace Process"]    [Text] As briefly announced in yesterday's EUROPE, the  General Affairs Council adopted a joint action in support of the  Middle East peace process, after recalling that:    (i) the EU has supported the breakthrough in negotiations  between Israel and the PLO through the immediate provision of  increased assistance and has announced its intention to provide  ECU500 million in aid for the development of the Occupied  Territories in the years 1994-1998;    (ii) the European Union supports the development of the  countries of the region under the Redirected Mediterranean  Policy (ECU4.5 billion for 1992 to 1996);    (iii) some Member States have already been asked to  participate in the temporary international presence in Hebron.    The following are the main points of the joint action agreed  on Tuesday [19 April]. In order to work for the conclusion of a  comprehensive peace in the Middle East, the EU will:    (a) participate in international arrangements agreed by the  parties to guarantee peace and contribute to defining the future  shape of relations between the regional parties in the context  of the Arms Control and Regional Security Working Group;    (b) develop its role in the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee  responsible for the coordination of international aid to the  Occupied Territories, maintain its leading role in the Regional  Economic Development Working Group and develop its participation  in other multilateral groups, consider additional ways in which  it might contribute to the development of the region;    (c) pursue confidence building measures which it has  submitted to the parties, pursue demarches to the Arab states  with the aim of securing an end to the boycott of Israel and  closely follow the future of Israeli settlements throughout the  Occupied Territories and pursue demarches to Israel about this  issue. Further, the Council will examine proposals the  Commission will make:    (i) for the rapid implementation of programmes of assistance  for the development of the Occupied Territories and a  Palestinian operating budget;    (ii) to provide aid in the framework of existing guidelines  to the other parties to the bilateral negotiations as they  progress substantially towards peace. In order to contribute  actively and urgently to the creation of a Palestinian Police  Force, the EU will provide assistance: Funds for ECU10 million  will be made available from the Community budget as a matter of  urgency. At the request of the parties, the European Union will  participate in the protection of the Palestinian people through  a temporary international presence in the Occupied Territories  (Security Council Resolution 904).    Operational arrangements and financing arising from this  decision will be the subject of a separate and specific Council  decision. Also at the request of the parties, the EU will  implement a coordinated programme of assistance in preparing for  and observing the elections in the Occupied Territories.  Arrangements will be the subject of a separate Council decision  once Israel and the PLO have reached agreement on arrangements  for the elections. The EP [European Parliament] will be invited  to participate in those arrangements. Lastly, the European  Union confirms its willingness to take further operational  decisions in the field of this joint action, in accordance with  developments in the peace process.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Tallinn, Jan 25, BNS -- The Commission for State  Defense in the Estonian parliament today ruled to reject a draft  bill calling for dismissal of the country's commander in chief,  Major General Aleksander Einseln. The bill was submitted by  opposition MP Katrin Linde.    Peeter Lorents, chairman of the defense commission, said the  bill was turned down because it contained contradictions with  the Constitution. Lorents said it was possible that Linde would  bring the draft in line with legal standards and submit it to  the parliament for a second time.    Lorents added that discussion of the draft had taken place  in  a peaceful parliamentary atmosphere.    Linde's suggestions were met with irony ranging to taunt at  Monday's meeting of the parliament. [sentence as received]    The draft suggested the dismissal of Aleksander Einseln and  revoking the earlier law on his appointment to office. [passage  omitted]</p>

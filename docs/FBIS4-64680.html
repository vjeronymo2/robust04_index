			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Michel De Muelenaere commentary: "A Year To Save the </F> Union"]    [Text] Following the approval given by the European  Parliament (EP) to the expansion of the European Union [EU], an  examination of conscience is necessary. The debates of recent  months have left their mark within the Twelve. It is now for  the advocates of a stronger Europe to resume the initiative.    By imposing expansion on their partners, disregarding  serious  guarantees for the EU's future, the Germans have seriously  endangered the unity of the club, and its very existence. For  Bonn, the membership of Scandinavia and Austria is merely an  episode determining the future expansion to the East European  countries, the only expansion which matters. However, the  survival of a federal Europe will only be assured if a radical  reform of its functioning is rapidly implemented. Choosing  urgency, under the impetus of a Germany which is a prey to a  kind of obsessional delirium, the Twelve have postponed this  discussion until later, at a time when the unanimity of the  Sixteen will be even more difficult to achieve. This is a point  in favor of those who reject a supranational Europe.    With his term as European presidency starting on 1 July,  Helmut Kohl has a golden opportunity to be forgiven for his  dangerous leap in the dark. After crushing any resistance, and  vigorously, he must lift his former adversaries up again, the  advocates of a more integrated Europe and the EP. The latter,  which is weak, has been humiliated by the governments. It only  had one choice: To bow and repudiate its beliefs or jeopardize  expansion. Faced with the states, the EP is a progressive  protagonist. It must be given the opportunity to influence the  EU future which will be drawn up at the future  "intergovernmental conference" in 1996.    To the European federalists, Germany must guarantee that a  16-member Europe can still make progress. It must do so even if  the future is gloomy, because the forces of stagnation already  seem to have so much control without it seeming to be possible  to oust them.    In this trial of strength, France has a role to play.  Divided between the Elysee [president's office] and the Hotel  Matignon [prime minister's office], too content to see  Parliament receive a snub, affected by the anti-European  sentiments of a section of its majority, the French Government  has backed down completely in face of its German partner.    Henceforth, the duo holds the Union's future in its hands.  It must adjust its aim. The Germans, forced to do so out of a  guilty conscience, are thinking of this. Paris must support  them. The German and French presidencies will follow each  other: This is a year for saving the Union.    The third big absentee from the debate was Belgium. A  traditional rampart against the EU going off-course, it was not  able to make Germany see reason. Did it really try to do so?  Why did Belgium agree to open the negotiations on expansion  without having obtained minimal assurances on the Union's  future? How were the Belgians able to accept that the 1996  intergovernmental conference should take place in such  inauspicious circumstances?    The desire to defend the position of the small countries  does  not explain everything. It is a rearguard battle: Sooner or  later the balance between big and small countries will have to  be reviewed at the latter's expense. Fearing that it would lose  out, Belgium did not insist on reform. A strategic error.    Of course the pragmatism of Dehaene and Claes did wonders in  establishing the seats of the European institutions, concluding  the GATT negotiations, and so forth. But in the debate on  expansion, a more decisive presence was needed. Belgium failed.  It must express its ideas!</p>

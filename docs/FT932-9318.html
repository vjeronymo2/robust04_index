			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Doubt cast on red-tape review COMPANY directors are highly sceptical about government efforts to reduce the burden of red tape on businesses. Nearly 70 per cent of directors believe the campaign will make little or no difference to the level of regulation, an Institute of Directors' survey shows today. The campaign against red tape, initiated by Mr John Major, the prime minister, involves a review of regulations by every government department. Seven taskforces made up of businesspeople are drawing up priorities for de-regulation. While more than 80 per cent of directors questioned by the institute said it was important for the government to reduce bureaucracy, only 30 per cent believed the exercise would be successful. The institute said the finding emphasised the need for the government to 'achieve early, concrete results to convince firms that it means business'. Top of the directors' list of most troublesome burdens are value added tax, health and safety regulations, employment-protection laws, and planning rules. VAT rules cause problems for 27 per cent of directors, and for 33 per cent of directors in companies employing fewer than 100 people. The institute is suggesting a number of reforms, including extending the flat-rate VAT scheme available to farmers. Health and safety has become more of an issue because of the implementation of six European Community directives at the beginning of this year, the institute said.</p>

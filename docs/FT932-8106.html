			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Observer: Summed up Mark Boleat has been an extremely effective point man for Britain's building societies and he stands as good a chance as anyone of making a success of his new job as director general of the much larger Association of British Insurers. But one little known rule for this year's annual conference of the Building Societies Association suggests that Boleat and his troops may not be quite as concerned about the freedom of the press, which they have so carefully cultivated over the years. When the BSA got wind of the news that the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, Britain's sixth biggest society, had invited four journalists to join its table of eight at next month's annual dinner in Brighton, the balloon went up at Boleat's Savile Row headquarters. C&amp;G, which was paying for its guests, was ordered to withdraw the invites. The official reason was that the 'seating plan may seem a little unbalanced if so many journalists are concentrated on one table'. Observer can't wait to hear the reaction of Mick Newmarch of the Pru if Boleat's officials try to vet his seating plan.</p>

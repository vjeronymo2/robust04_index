			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [RENMIN RIBAO 1 May editorial: "The Working Class Are the </F> Main Force for Reform, Development and Stability -- Celebrating  1 May International Labor Day"]    [Text] Beijing, 30 Apr (XINHUA) -- In the days of spring  full of vitality and in the struggle to seize the opportunity,  deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, and maintain  stability, the common festival of the laboring people of the  whole world -- 1 May International Labor Day -- has come. We  wish to extend our festival greetings to workers, peasants,  intellectuals and all laboring people of various nationalities  in the whole country!    This year will be a crucial year for accelerating the  establishment of the socialist market economic structure. We  have to carry out the reform of the economic structure under the  premise of maintaining a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic  development and also have to realize a sustained, rapid, and  healthy economic development under the situation of speeding up  the reform of the economic structure. Therefore, we are  required to do a lot of work and must correctly handle the  relations between reform, development and stability, because  those efforts are extremely important to having a good control  of the overall situation and to doing a good job in this year's  work. We must firmly rely on the working class and give full  play to the role of the working class as the main force in  deepening reform, promoting development, and maintaining  stability.    In order to give full play to the role of the working class  as the main force in the course of reform, we must widely and  penetratingly publicize the guidelines of the 14th CPC National  Congress and the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee, and encourage the broad masses of  staff members and workers to understand, support, participate  in, and promote reform. The working class was, is, and will be,  the advanced productive force. The change of enterprises'  operational mechanism and the establishment of a modern  enterprise system are important links in the change of the  economic structure. They are closely related to the personal  interests of staff members and workers of enterprises, and they  cannot achieve success without the understanding and support of  the broad masses of staff members and workers. Reform will not  change the staff members' and workers' position of being the  masters of the country. Moreover, reform is to better whip up  and develop the enthusiasm of staff members and workers, and to  strengthen enterprises' vitality and vigor in the increasingly  fierce competition of the market. In the course of carrying out  reform by enterprises, we should actively explore new forms of  democratic management and democratic supervision, protect the  position of staff members and workers as the masters of the  country, guarantee their power of using their due rights, and  ensure that they will fulfill their own obligations.    To give full play to the role of the working class as the  main force in the development, we must turn the enthusiasm,  initiative, and creativity of the broad masses of staff members  and workers into increasing production, practicing economy,  raising quality, adding variety, increasing economic efficiency  and carrying out technological innovation and also into running  well enterprises and promoting the development of the productive  force. Statistical data have shown that the work of staff  members and workers of the whole country accounts for  approximately 70 percent of the gross domestic product, or more  than 90 percent of state revenues. Over the past decade and  more, our country's economic power and combined national  strength has increased significantly and we have made  achievements which have attracted worldwide attention. The hard  work of the working class is, in particular, inseparable to the  consecutive high speed of economic growth in the past two years.  In the future, the working class will also continuously make  new contributions to the revitalization of the Chinese nation.    To bring into play the role of the working class as the  main force in maintaining stability, we should thoroughly  guarantee the working class' lawful rights and interests as  stipulated in the constitution and other laws. China is a  socialist state under the people's democratic dictatorship led  by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and  peasants; hence, the working class shoulders an important  responsibility toward the country's long-term stability, order,  and prosperity. Workers should pay attention to ideals,  discipline, unity, and overall interests; should conscientiously  subordinate individual to collective interests, local to  national interests, and immediate to long-range interests; and  should strive to maintain social stability and to safeguard the  political situation characterized by stability and unity.    To carry out the great historic mission during the great  social transformation, Chinese workers should step up the effort  at study in order to comprehensively improve their quality.  They should diligently study Volume 3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping, arm their minds with Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, enhance their awareness and steadfastness in  implementing the party's basic line, and play an active role in  building material and spiritual civilizations. They should  study some rudimentary knowledge, basic theory, and legal  knowledge on socialist market economy so that they can keep a  clear head during the change of economic structure and be  clearly aware of their position and role in reform. They should  also study knowledge on management and operation, as well as  science and technology, so that they can improve their skills in  the socialist modernization drive.    To show concern for workers' livelihood and solve their  practical problems is an important guarantee for bringing into  better play the working class' role as the main force. Due to  various reasons, some workers' living standards have improved  slowly, and some have even encountered passing difficulties.  Party committees, governments, and trade union organizations at  all levels should, with a profound sense of responsibility, show  concern for workers' livelihood and do everything possible to  help them overcome difficulties. The fundamental way of solving  problems lies in deepening reform and developing the economy.  While solving problems, it is necessary to explain to workers  why some problems are difficult to be solved immediately or  completely. The party Central Committee has time and again  instructed party organizations and leading cadres at all level  to serve the people wholeheartedly, to forge close ties with the  masses, and to show concern for their everyday life. Trade  union organizations at all levels should listen attentively to  the views of the masses, promptly and accurately reflect them to  party and government departments, and try their utmost to help  the masses. Recently the All-China Federation of Trade Unions  launched a "show-compassion project" nationwide in a bid to  mobilize various quarters of society to help solve problems for  workers and enterprises plagued with difficulties. The project  is essential and timely for enhancing the confidence and courage  of enterprises and workers to tide over difficulties. Party  committees and governments at all levels, as well as the whole  society, should actively support this project to show the  compassion of the party and the government for workers in  distress.    Led by the party Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin  as the nucleus, the large numbers of workers, peasants,  intellectuals, and other working people throughout the country  should unite more closely and work hard and adroitly with an  indomitable spirit to create a bright future for our country and  hundreds of millions of workers through reform and construction.</p>

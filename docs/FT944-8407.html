			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Books: Inside the Forbidden City's walls - Only now is the truth emerging about Mao, the Monkey King who sowed chaos THE PRIVATE LIFE OF CHAIRMAN MAO: THE INSIDE STORY OF THE MAN WHO MADE MODERN CHINA by Zhisui Li Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 20, 682 pages CHINA WAKES: THE STRUGGLE FOR THE SOUL OF A RISING POWER by Nicholas D. Kristoff and Sheryl W. Dunn Nicholas Brealey Pounds 16.99, 502 pages Grub Street hacks prying into the affairs of the royal family painted a pretty idyllic picture of their lives until recent years. That they got things so wrong within a democracy provides some indirect excuse for the China watchers who for so long failed to penetrate the labyrinthine secrets of China's palace politics. A full portrait, warts and all, of China's Chairman Mao Zedong is only now emerging, almost two decades after his death behind the high walls of Peking's Zhongnanhai compound in the Forbidden City. While he was alive, Mao's hagiographers dominated the field, partly because so many wanted him to succeed. Cynical observers laboured away, piecing together clues to Mao's towering failures from official propaganda. Today's China watchers have an easier time of it, as evidenced by China Wakes, the latest in a series of book-memoirs by American correspondents who have done a stint in Peking. But although energetic and questioning, this husband-and-wife team are still foreign devil reporters peering through cracks in the wall, with the grace to admit that 'China Watching is the only profession that makes meteorology look accurate and precise.' But we need no longer rely on the China watchers. Zhisui Li, Mao's personal physician for 22 years, takes us inside the walls of Zhongnanhai and into the Chairman's personal swimming pool pavilion. There he lies on his huge bed, sweating after one of his innumerable sessions with a willing female attendant (preferably a peasant girl) and a run-down with hot towels (he refused to bathe - 'I wash myself in the bodies of my women,' he said), brushing aside traditional Chinese remedies for his latest ailment but washing out his green, plaque-covered teeth in tea and then chewing up the leaves, swallowing too many sleeping pills and then turning to a novel about intrigue at the court of the Mings. But this absorbing book provides much more than tittle-tattle. Dr Li was a confidant, at Mao's elbow as the Great Helmsman voiced neurotic suspicions of plots against him and twisted Marxist vocabulary to destroy those who hinted that he bore some responsibility for disasters. He watched as Mao slowly undercut the power of his imagined rivals, manipulated those who surrounded him by monstrous demands on their loyalty, blackmail and fear. The book's most convincing feature (raising it above Harrison Salisbury's recent anti-Mao broadside The New Emperors: Mao and Deng, which largely depended on Dengist sources anxious to distance the present strongman from his predecessor) is Dr Li's refusal to pretend greater access than he had. He scrupulously differentiates between what he saw and heard, what he learned later and what he surmised. 'Il n'y a point de heros pour mon valet de chambre' may have been true in the 18th century but today no man is a hero to his doctor (even Churchill had his Lord Moran). Nevertheless, Dr Li progresses very gradually from the young would-be surgeon who hero-worshipped Mao to the doctor who felt nothing but relief when he died. He expresses disgust at his morals, distaste for some of his personal habits and shock at his superstition and ignorance about science but leaves the reader to deduce Mao's massive stupidity in claiming that 'spirit' would accomplish his hopelessly unrealistic economic goals, in ordaining the commune (and thus a great famine), in wasting untold resources in millions of useless backyard furnaces, in loosing anarchy on China and in choosing first a traitor and then a nonentity (Lin Biao and Hua Guofeng) as his successors. Mao, like Churchill, was a brilliantly charismatic war leader but, in the piping time of peace, became an isolated monomaniac, feeding his paranoia with old tales of intrigue, scrawling comments on endless streams of state papers, asking 'Any news?' from all visitors, insulated by his scheming courtiers from the outside world, like the most ruthless Emperors he emulated. Only action could cure his depressions and his obsessive need to make decisions - any decision - lay at the root of his most tragic mistakes. Mao was the Monkey King who sowed chaos (luan) in heaven, the antithesis of the neo-Confucianist leader which the region's dictators of today tell us is the Asian ideal. Jung Chang's magnificent Wild Swans rendered her and her parents into paradigms of the betrayal of Chinese idealists' worship of the revolutionary who enabled China to 'stand up'. Dr Li shows us the other side of the walls which surrounded the man who inspired such hopes only to sacrifice them on the altar of his own ego. Dr Li, sitting in exile in Chicago today, contemplating his dead, heart-broken wife and his own wasted life, is just another of China's millions of wild swans.</p>

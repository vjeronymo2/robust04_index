			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Japanese steel groups predict return to red in first half JAPANESE steel companies expect to slip into loss again this year, a decade after they launched restructuring and diversification programmes intended to strengthen the industry in the face of falling steel demand. Nippon Steel, the world's largest steel maker, reported a 71.2 per cent plunge to Y28.9bn (Pounds 170m) in pre-tax profit for year ended in March, and forecast a first-half loss of Y5bn this year. It is hoping an eventual economic recovery will produce a full-year profit of about Y20bn. Other leading makers, including Kawasaki Steel, Kobe Steel, and Sumitomo Metal Industries, also predicted first-half losses of about Y5bn, but suggested a change in economic conditions in the second half would return them to the black. NKK would have reported a loss last year but for a Y17.4bn gain on sales of securities holdings. Pre-tax profit fell 89 per cent to Y4.1bn, while net profit plunged 99 per cent to Y255m. It expects a first-half pre-tax loss of Y15bn this year. Pre-tax profits at Kobe were down 69.6 per cent, at Kawasaki by 82.5 per cent and Sumitomo Metal by 86.9 per cent. Each of the companies is attempting to cut costs and reduce staff after much heralded diversification programmes failed to add to profitability during another downturn in demand. Crude steel production at Nippon Steel was down almost 10 per cent to 25,320 tons and would have fallen further had import orders from China not tripled during the year.</p>

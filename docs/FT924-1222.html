			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Share prices surge despite lending fall LENDING by Britain's banks and building societies to the private sector unexpectedly fell by Pounds 600m last month, reversing a Pounds 5.1bn increase in October and adding to uncertainty about UK recovery. The drop, which was worse than the most pessimistic City expectations, was shrugged off by the stock market and seemed not to worry Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. The FT-SE 100 index closed yesterday at 2,789.7, up 49.4 on the day and 73.5 on the week, while the FT-SE Mid 250 index of medium-sized stocks added 54.8 on the day to 2,783.6. Prices rose on strong institutional buying which appeared to anticipate a new year rally and economic recovery. Mr Lamont, told foreign newspaper correspondents in London that he was looking forward to a 'more prosperous year' and said the UK's 'may be one of the more buoyant economies next year'. The drop in lending, disclosed in provisional, seasonally adjusted figures from the Bank of England, briefly triggered hopes of a cut in bank base rates from 7 per cent. Shortly before the figures were released, however, Mr Lamont made clear that he was not in a hurry to ease monetary policy further. The 3 percentage point cut in bank base rates since September had been 'substantial', he said, 'so I think it would be wrong to rush into easing policy further without firm evidence that this was necessary.' The Bank also disclosed that growth of broad money in the UK was weaker than expected in November. It said that M4, which includes bank and building society deposits as well as notes and coins in circulation, fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.2 per cent last month and increased by 4.7 per cent in the 12 months to November. The M4 figure was at the lower end of the Treasury's 4-8 per cent monitoring range announced in November. It was well below City expectations of 0.4 per cent growth on the month and a 5.4 per cent expansion against November last year. The Treasury and the Bank were unable to provide a specific reason for the poor figures. The Treasury suggested that the weak growth in M4 could reflect lower inflation and a delay in the effect of recent interest rate cuts. Figures from the British Bankers' Association and the Building Societies Association confirmed the depressed picture given by the Bank's lending figures. The BBA said the nine biggest UK clearing banks increased their lending to the private sector by a seasonally adjusted Pounds 572m last month after an increase of Pounds 3.05bn in October. 'November saw demand for bank finance fade away again,' said Lord Inchyra, BBA director general. The only bright spot was in mortgage lending because of low-interest, fixed-rate offers, Lord Inchyra said. But this rise may have been at the expense of building societies which saw a decrease in net new commitments to Pounds 1.85bn in November from Pounds 2.17bn in October.

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Emerging Markets In spite of a setback in the performance of the world's emerging markets earlier this year there has been a pick-up during the last three months, which has left the IFC composite price index up some 5 per cent from the start of the year in dollar terms, writes John Pitt. Latin America has been the star region, by far outperforming Asia which has fallen into negative territory. Kuala Lumpur set a new eight-month high on Wednesday and it looks set to continue to pull ahead. Kleinwort Benson in London has recently picked the market as one to watch, suggesting that a gain of some 20 per cent by the end of the year cannot be ruled out. Kleinwort's favours Malaysia as one of its 'most favoured markets', although currently it is 4 per cent down in dollar terms from the start of the year. Sri Lanka is picked by Lehman Brothers, following the parliamentary elections there last month and ahead of November's presidential election. Lehman's forecasts economic growth of 6.3 per cent this year, reinforced mainly by a 20 per cent gain in total investment, and funded by 'sustained expansion in national savings and capital flows'. In spite of the likelihood of short-term instability post-elections, Lehman's expects the economic fundamentals to attract investors 'and compel the new government to hew fairly closely to the reform path, in spite of its polulist electioneering'.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By a JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>   [Text] Amman--Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi  Fukuda arrived here Sunday [9 January] on a four-day visit as  part of a Middle East tour aimed at exchanging views with the  region's leaders on the peace process.    Mr. Fukuda, who travelled overland to Jordan from Israel  through the West Bank across the King Husayn Bridge, is  scheduled to be received by Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam  al-Majali on Monday.    A diplomatic source said Mr. Fukuda's visit was prompted by  "rapid developments in the Middle East peace process."    Describing the visit as very important, the source said:  "Japan is closely following up all events in the peace process  and likes to have a regular exchange of views of all parties  involved in the peace negotiations."    Mr. Fukuda, who leaves Jordan on Jan. 13, already met with  Israeli officials in occupied Jerusalem, where he began his  visit.    He will also visit Syria and Egypt.    The Japanese minister, who is paying his first visit to the  Middle East after assuming office, is closely involved in his  country's role in the multilateral phase of the peace process.    Japan chairs the multilateral working group on the  environment and is an active member of the working group on  water.    Mr. Fukuda's visit to the region follows a recent meeting in  Tokyo of the steering committee of the multilateral groups.    The Japanese minister will also be discussing  Jordanian-Japanese relations and follow up on the recent visit  to Japan by Prime Minister al-Majali.    During the visit, Japanese leaders, including Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa, voiced appreciation of Jordan's active  participation in the peace process and reaffirmed their  government's commitment to helping the Kingdom address its  economic concerns.    Also expected to be reviewed during Mr. Fukuda's visit is an  $80 million Japanese loan to help develop Jordan's energy sector.    The loan, which will match a similar loan from the World  Bank  that Jordan has already received, could be merged into a $150  million soft-credit for Jordan under consideration by the Tokyo  government. The credit will finance the expansion of the  al-Aqabah Thermal Power Plant.    Japan, which holds around $900 million of Jordan's foreign  debts of $6.88 million, has promised to help Jordan alleviate  its external debt burden through rescheduling arrangements.    In principle, Japan opposes debt write-off and advocates  "help for those who help themselves." Japanese officials have  expressed appreciation of the measures adopted by Jordan and say  that such policies are behind the continued Japanese interest in  extending aid to the Kingdom.    Jordan is expected to receive between $30 million and $40  million in Japanese aid during 1994, officials said shortly  after Dr. al-Majali's visit to Japan last month.    Japan, which grew from the ashes of its economy after the  war  to become one of the top international aid donors, insists that  aid recipients depend on themselves to develop their economies  and repay foreign debts in the long term rather than seeking  debt relief in the form of write-off.    The bulk of Jordan's dues to Japan (up to $800 million) is  in  the form of soft loans with one per cent annual interest and  repayable in 30 years. The loans were mostly extended shortly  after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 and aimed at  helping Jordan absorb its economic losses from the crisis  sparked by the invasion.    Jordan does not qualify for outright Japanese grants since  Tokyo continues to follow an international convention which  allows assistance to be given to countries with less than $800  per capita income. Jordan's per capita income was $1.020 in  1992.</p>

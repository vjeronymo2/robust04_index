			<p>BFN     [Text] A military statement issued by the Ministry of  Defense mentioned that the assassin 'Ali 'Abdullah Salih plunged  the day before yesterday big numbers of barbaric forces and  quantities of his miltiary equipment in a desperate attempt to  break through the fortified defense lines of our Armed Forces,  standing with the masses of our people against the freedom and  dignity [as heard]. This was preceded by false statements, such  as the statements of al- Ansi and al-Iryani. And in front of  these barbarous forces, from the helpless they presented human  shields to the cemetery of death. The statement mentioned that  our Armed Forces have come forward against taking shelter by the  fighters in the cities and villages and making the citizens from  the sons of our people human shields facing the weapons of  destruction and killing.    We, in the name of the Yemeni people in every place, demand  the immediate stopping of this foolish fighting, and we remind  all that we are in the month of war-prohibition in the Hijriyyah  [Islamic] calendar, in which almighty God prohibited fighting in  them. We are even in the first 10 days of the month of  Dhu'l-hijjah. What law except the law of the jungle allows  this, and where are those insisting on fighting from Islam. It  is rejected teaching and in Shari'ah, we in the name of the  Yemeni people appeal to all Arab and Islamic countries and  organizations to stand with us in calling on the fighters to  cease fire, especially during the days of pilgrimage and the  blessed 'Id al-Adha.</p>

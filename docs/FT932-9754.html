			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: Domestic side hits French bank CREDIT Lyonnais, the troubled French banking group which is a candidate for privatisation, experienced problems in France during the first quarter of this year, according to Mr Jean Yves Haberer, chairman, although its international operations fared well. Mr Haberer, who has been criticised for his aggressive expansion and lending strategy, said the group, which fell into the red last year, had a bad first quarter in its domestic market due to the economic recession and rise in business failures. However, Credit Lyonnais's commercial banking interests outside France produced a good performance, according to the chairman, with BfG, the German bank in which it recently acquired a controlling stake, performing satisfactorily. Credit Lyonnais, one of France's largest commercial banks, has been in trouble for some time, mainly because of its exposure to a series of corporate collapses, notably the late Mr Robert Maxwell's media empire and MGM, the crippled Hollywood film studio. Last year, these problems were aggravated by the economic squeeze in France which left Credit Lyonnais very vulnerable to property and small companies, two of the weakest areas of the economy. It swung from net profits of FFr3.2bn (Dollars 592.6m) in 1991 to a net loss (the first since 1974 and the third in its history) of FFr1.8bn, on net banking income of FFr48.9bn. The announcement of Credit Lyonnais's first-quarter problems in France comes at a time when the new centre-right government is finalising plans to privatise a number of state-controlled companies. Credit Lyonnais is believed to be a candidate, although analysts suspect that its financial problems may force the government to delay the sale until after Banque Nationale de Paris.</p>

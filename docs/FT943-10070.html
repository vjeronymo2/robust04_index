			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Bosnian Serbs prepare to stand alone Bosnian Serbs have begun mobilising their resources to withstand increasing isolation, maintaining a defiant stand against international pressure to make peace in Bosnia. But they averted the threat of further Nato air strikes by returning heavy weapons, including a tank, taken from a United Nations compound. The Nato air strike on Friday, the first for four months, coincided with signs that the Serbian government in Belgrade may be serious about enforcing an economic blockade against ties with its intransigent kinsmen in Bosnia. The Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, at the weekend ordered all able-bodied adults to report to compulsory work brigades, as the territory - which has been completely dependent on aid from Belgrade - appeared in danger of becoming paralysed. 'It seems to us that we have to grow up to be separate from our mother and to be older and adult, and we have to fight,' Mr Karadzic told Reuters news agency. Bosnian Serbs are now 'totally, totally alone', he said. Mr Karadzic spoke after Belgrade government officials stopped hundreds of trucks from crossing from Serbia into Bosnia. He acknowledged that he must do without Belgrade's lifeline of arms, fuel and other supplies. Another high-ranking official also signalled determination to defy the tightening cord around them. Bosnian Serbs were ready to endure indefinite isolation, said Mr Aleksa Buha. 'We don't have any choice. We have to survive even in this isolation.' But Mr Buha, foreign minister of the self-declared Bosnian Serb state, hoped Belgrade's embargo against its kinsmen in Bosnia would not last. 'Fuel is a problem but we will have to deal with it in various ways,' he said. 'I would think the pressure from Belgrade will not be a long-term pressure.' He reaffirmed the Bosnian Serbs' rejection of the peace plan sponsored by the five-nation contact group of the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany. The plan, which would amount to effective partition of Bosnia, would require the Bosnia Serbs to give up a large area of land they at present occupy. In Belgrade, an efficient propaganda machine has swung into action, designed to convey the impression that Serbia is united in its support for President Slobodan Milosevic over Bosnia. Tough border controls were still being enforced yesterday at crossing points along the river Drina, but little was being shown of it on state-controlled television. Mr Milosevic is apparently intent on bringing Mr Karadzic to his knees, but does not want to run the risk of generating sympathy for the Bosnian Serbs through TV or press portrayal of Bosnian Serb hardship. Internal Serbian politics are murky and complicated. Mr Milosevic's move to isolate Serb kinsmen across the River Drina may anger the right, led by the hardline nationalist and former ally Mr Vojisl Seselj. The Yugoslav army - whose leadership has been purged several times by Mr Milosevic - is also an unknown quantity. Gen Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb army leader, opposes the international peace plan, but has not been seen during recent meetings of the Bosnian Serb leadership. His role is crucial - particularly the question of where he stands on the dispute between Mr Milosevic and Mr Karadzic. The crisis within the Serbian camp has been brewing for months. For Mr Milosevic the looming fear was that stricter financial sanctions by the west would endanger the new super dinar currency - the backbone of rump Yugoslavia's fragile economic stabilisation plan. Mr Dragoslav Avramovic, national bank governor, said last week that if UN sanctions against Serbia were not lifted soon 'it's all over for us in three weeks.' To that end, Serbia yesterday was maintaining its tough policy of strict controls at the border and of keeping phone links cut. Mr Milosevic has made no secret of his desire to get Mr Karadzic out of power. But Mr Karadzic sounds more accommodating towards the man who originally put him in power. 'We do understand that Yugoslavia cannot support us any longer,' he said. The Bosnian Serb cabinet also said it was still ready to hold further talks - but repeated its determination to 'preserve the vital interests of the Serb people'. Russia at the weekend endorsed the Nato air strike against the Bosnian Serbs on Friday and called on them to give a final answer to the western-brokered peace plan.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by Jerome </F> Cochlaine in Geneva on 2 February; published "by special  arrangement with WNL," acronym not further expanded]    [Text] [Cochlaine] You have ended several days of talks  with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and it seems that  final agreement on self-rule in Gaza and Jericho is now  imminent. Can you explain to us the progress that has been  achieved so far?    ['Arafat] True, we have almost reached a final agreement  during my meeting with Mr. Peres in Davos and we are very close  to signing an agreement which can be called the Davos agreement.  The Israelis, however, need a few more days before ratifying  the agreement. I will meet again with Mr. Peres and [Israeli  Prime Minister] Mr. Rabin in Cairo.    [Cochlaine] What about control over the border crossing  points with Jordan and access to the Dead Sea?    ['Arafat] We discussed these topics at length and we are now  discussing the details. I cannot say anything further at this  point.    [Cochlaine] You made concessions, for instance, over the  size of the self-rule area around Jericho--from 340 square km to  55 square km. Are you willing to make further concessions?    ['Arafat] I reject the term "concessions" because the  achievement of peace is more important than anything else. That  is why I speak about "the peace of the brave." We will  implement everything that was agreed upon with the Israelis.  Similar negotiations were held between Algeria and France in  the early 1960's and between South Africa's President Frederick  de Klerk and my friend, Nelson Mandela.    [Cochlaine] Do you think the Israelis will withdraw from  Gaza and Jericho on 13 April as agreed in the timetable of the  peace agreement that was signed in 13 September 1993?    ['Arafat] I hope the Israelis will respect the agreement and  redeploy their forces in the territories according to plan.    [Cochlaine] Will there be elections in July?    ['Arafat] I hope the Israelis will not postpone them. Rabin  had stated that there are no sacred dates, but our position is  that the agreements which were signed must be respected and  implemented.    [Cochlaine] What role will the elected council play in  comparison with that of the Palestinian National Authority?  Will there be two government agencies competing with each other?    ['Arafat] The Palestinian National Authority is a permanent  body that was set up by a Palestine National Council [PNC]  resolution in 1974, while the council will be convened for  legislative elections.    [Cochlaine] Does that mean that the council will comprise  PNC members living in the occupied territories?    ['Arafat] Certainly.    [Cochlaine] Late last year, a delegation of 118 PLO members  came to Tunis and handed you a letter, criticizing the PLO's  undemocratic practices and your single-handedness. What is your  comment on this?    ['Arafat] The mere fact that these people were allowed to  level these accusations and criticisms shows that the PLO is a  democratic institution. Would they cling to democracy in any  other organization? We are proud of the fact that we have  established democracy within the PLO, even when our struggle was  in full swing. This accomplishment is unprecedented.    [Cochlaine] Presidents Bill Clinton and Hafiz al-Asad met in  Geneva on 16 January. Do you believe that Israel can conduct  peace negotiations on two tracks; that is, with you and with the  Syrians, at the same time?    ['Arafat] Why not? Israel headed for the Madrid and  Washington negotiations, fully aware that there is no  alternative to a peace agreement between the Arabs and Israelis  in the Middle East. The negotiations on both tracks are heading  in the same direction. At any rate, the PLO's ties with Syria  are good. Only 10 days ago, I took part in the funeral of  Basil, President Hafiz al-Asad's eldest son, who died in a  tragic incident. I also keep in mind the Arab meetings held in  Washington, which will bring us closer to Arab unity.    [Cochlaine] You have recently met with King Fahd in Saudi  Arabia. You have described your meeting with the Saudi monarch  as cordial. Is that all there is to this meeting?    ['Arafat] Our talks were cordial and constructive. I am  grateful to King Fahd for the efforts he has made to achieve  peace in the Middle East. I am also grateful to him for the  support he is extending to the Palestinian people, the Palestine  question, and Arab Jerusalem.    [Cochlaine] What role do you envisage for Switzerland as a  mediator in the Middle East conflict?    ['Arafat] We appreciate the constructive role being  undertaken by Switzerland, which is maintaining good relations  with the Palestinians and Israelis alike, with the Arabs in  general, with the United States, with Russia, and with the  Western European Union. Although Norway was active in the Middle  East peace negotiations last year, the Swiss Confederation has  always played a distinctive role in Middle East affairs.    [Cochlaine] Do you think that you can benefit from the  so-called Swiss model with regard to political cooperation once  federal ties are established between Jordan and the Palestinians?    ['Arafat] You cannot export your unique model of coexistence  among various linguistic and ethnic groups. I wish this was  possible. Nonetheless, the Swiss model of coexistence will be  helpful to us in the Middle East.</p>

He told Interfax in an exclusive interview that the  forthcoming unification of the two monetary systems should not  be viewed as a political-economic union. "Neither is it true  that Belarus and Russia have betrayed the idea of creating a  single economic system within the CIS," he said. "On the  contrary, by uniting our monetary systems we are giving a real  content to this idea, and strengthen and broaden the common  economic system," he added.    He said that the recent reshuffling in the government will  not tell on the Belarusian policies. "As to the monetary union  with Russia, it will allow Belarus to advance towards market  relations more rapidly," said Kebich. He admitted that the  resignation of Shushkevich had not made the prime minister's  work any easier, but gave to understand that Shushkevich's  resignation from the post of parliament speaker had opened the  door on the ratification of the CIS agreement on collective  security by the Belarusian parliament.    Speaking about cuts in the Belarusian offensive weapons,  Kebich said that if Belarus was not given financial assistance  in disarmament, it would not be able to eliminate tanks and  aircraft at the old rate according to international agreements.  He said that Belarus bore all of the related expenses on its  own.    The economic problems complicate the financing of the  disarmament program, said Kebich. He also pointed out that  Belarus was honestly and consistently implementing its  commitments to cut down armaments and would continue to do so in  the future.</p>

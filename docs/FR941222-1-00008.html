			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c) (1) Persons who are interested in participating in Express Mail Market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response Rate Request cases may register at any time with the Secretary of the Postal Rate Commission, who shall maintain a publicly available list of the names and business addresses of all such Express Mail Market Response Registrants. Persons whose names appear on this list will automatically become parties to each Express Mail Market Response rate proceeding. Other interested persons may intervene pursuant to &sect;3001.20 within 28 days of the filing of a formal request made under the provisions of &sect;&sect;3001.57 through 3001.57c. Parties may withdraw from the register or a case by filing a notice with the Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) When the Postal Service files a request under the provisions of &sect;&sect;3001.57 through 3001.57c it shall on that same day effect service by hand delivery of the complete filing to each Express Mail Market Response Registrant who maintains an address for service within the Washington metropolitan area and serve the complete filing by Express Mail service on all other Registrants. Each Registrant is responsible for insuring that his or her address remains current.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) When the Postal Service files a request under the provisions of &sect;&sect;3001.57 through 3001.57c, it shall on that same day send by Express Mail service to all participants in the most recent omnibus rate case a notice which briefly describes its proposal. Such notice shall indicate on its first page that it is a notice of an Express Mail Market Response Rate Request to be considered under &sect;&sect;3001.57 through 3001.57c, and identify the last day for filing a notice of intervention with the Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) In the absence of a compelling showing of good cause, the Postal Service and parties shall calculate Express Mail costs in accordance with the methodologies used by the Commission in the most recent omnibus rate case. In the analysis of customers' reactions to the change in the market for expedited delivery services which prompts the request, the Postal Service and parties may estimate the demand for segments of the expedited delivery market and for types of customers which were not separately considered when estimating volumes in the most recent omnibus rate case.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) (1) In the event that a party wishes to dispute as an issue of fact whether the Postal Service properly has calculated Express Mail costs or volumes (either before or after its proposed changes), or wishes to dispute whether the change in the market for expedited delivery services cited by the Postal Service has actually occurred, or wishes to dispute whether the rates proposed by the Postal Service are a reasonable response to the change in the market for expedited delivery services or are consistent with the policies of the Postal Reorganization Act, that party shall file with the Commission a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request for a hearing within 28 days of the date that the Postal Service files its request. The request for hearing shall state with specificity the fact or facts set forth in the Postal Service's filing that the party disputes, and when possible, what the party believes to be the true fact or facts and the evidence it intends to provide in support of its position.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Commission will not hold hearings on a request made pursuant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to &sect;&sect;3001.57 through 3001.57c unless it determines that there is a genuine issue of material fact to be resolved, and that a hearing is needed to resolve this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Whether or not a hearing is held, the Commission may request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> briefs and/or argument on an expedited schedule, but in any circumstance it will issue its recommended decision as promptly as is consistent with its statutory responsibilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) In order to assist in the rapid development of an adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidentiary record, all participants may file appropriate discovery requests on other participants as soon as an Express Mail Market Response Rate Request is filed. Answers to such discovery requests will be due within 10 days. Objections to such discovery requests must be made within 10 days in the form of a Motion to Excuse from Answering, with service on the questioning participant made by hand, facsimile, or expedited delivery. Responses to Motions to Excuse from Answering must be submitted within seven days, and should such a motion be denied, the answers to the discovery in question are due within seven days of the denial thereof. It is the Commission's intention that parties resolve discovery disputes informally between themselves whenever  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible. The Commission, therefore, encourages the party receiving discovery requests considered to be unclear or objectionable to contact counsel for the party filing the discovery requests whenever further explanation is needed, or a potential discovery dispute might be resolved by means of such communication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) If, either on its own motion, or after having received a request for a hearing, the Commission concludes that there exist one or more genuine issues of material fact and that a hearing is needed, the Commission shall expedite the conduct of such record evidentiary hearings to meet both the need to respond promptly to changed circumstances in the market and the standards of 5 U.S.C. &sect;556 and 557. The procedural schedule, subject to change as described in paragraph (e) (6) of this section, is as follows: Hearings on the Postal Service case will begin 35 days after the filing of an Express Mail Market Response Rate Request; parties may file evidence either in support of or in opposition to the Postal Service proposal 49 days after the filing; hearings on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties' evidence will begin 56 days after the filing; briefs will be due 70 days after the filing; and reply briefs will be due 77 days after the filing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The Presiding Officer may adjust any of the schedule dates prescribed in paragraph (e)(5) of this section in the interests of fairness, or to assist in the development of an adequate evidentiary record. Requests for the opportunity to present evidence to rebut a submission by a participant other than the Postal Service should be filed within three working days of the receipt of that material into the evidentiary record, and should include a description of the evidence to be offered and the amount of time needed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepare and present it. Requests for additional time will be reviewed with consideration as to whether the requesting participant has exercised due diligence, and whether the requesting participant has been unreasonably delayed from fully understanding the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;3001.57c  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Express Mail Market Response_``rule for decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission will issue a recommended decision in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policies of 39 U.S.C., and which it determines would be a reasonable response to the change in the market for expedited delivery services. The purpose of &sect;&sect;3001.57 through 3001.57c is to allow for consideration of Express Mail Market Response Rate Requests within 90 days, consistent with the procedural due process rights of interested persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued by the Commission on December 14, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Charles L.

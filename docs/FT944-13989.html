			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Clean-up costs take toll on Asarco result Asarco, the US copper mining company, reported a Dollars 16.1m net loss in the third quarter, in spite of rising metals prices, writes Laurie Morse. The loss, which amounted to 39 cents a share, was the result of a previously announced charge of Dollars 45.5m to clean up a closed smelter site in Tacoma, Washington. Without the charge, Asarco would have earned Dollars 14.6m, or 35 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 513m, compared with last year's third-quarter loss of Dollars 3m, or 8 cents, on sales of Dollars 425m. For the first nine months of the year, Asarco reported net earnings of Dollars 15.8m, or 38 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 1.4bn. This compares with last year's loss of Dollars 58m, or Dollars 1.40 a share, on sales of Dollars 1.3bn.</p>

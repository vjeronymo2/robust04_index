Greetings  on the coming new year 1994! Today is the Day of Solidarity of  Azeris throughout the world. I greet the Azeris throughout the  world on this momentous day and wish for them to cooperate even  more closely in the future!    The year 1993, which is drawing to an end, has been a  difficult one for the Azeri people, for our republic. Complex  sociopolitical processes have evolved in the life of the  Republic of Azerbaijan this year; certain changes have occurred.  The war that has resulted from aggression by the Armenian Armed  Forces has continued; some of our lands have been occupied; many  citizens of Azerbaijan have been forced to leave the locations  of their permanent residence and become refugees. This year, the  Republic of Azerbaijan has been going through a profound  economic and social crisis. We may say with complete confidence  and a feeling of tremendous pride that our people and our  republic have come out of these difficulties and trials  worthily, and are looking to the year 1994 with confidence.    The year 1993 has been marked by complex collisions in the  socioeconomic life of the republic. A confrontation between  various groups and the striving of separatist forces to  dismember Azerbaijan have disrupted sociopolitical stability in  the republic, which by the middle of the year ended up on the  very brink--at the threshold of a civil war. We might say that a  civil war has already started, that the blood of brethren has  been shed in some regions of Azerbaijan, which has worsened  tensions within the republic. However, the people have once  again displayed their wisdom, and prevented a civil war. The  confrontation has been eliminated, and the separatist forces  endeavoring to dismember Azerbaijan have been neutralized. By  now, our republic is already solving its problems under stable  and quiet conditions.    This year, our republic has tried to stop the onslaught of  the Armenian Armed Forces. Unfortunately, we have suffered  defeats, and some territories have been lost. Our citizens who  have become refugees as a result of the occupation of  Azerbaijani lands by the Armenian Armed Forces have been  resettled in other regions of the republic. At present, there  are more than 1 million refugees in Azerbaijan. This has  produced extreme tensions in the position of Azerbaijan as a  whole, and in particular in the situation within the republic.    However, it should be noted that the situation has now  changed. In recent months, we have witnessed major changes,  which have resulted from the efforts made to raise an army in  the republic, strengthen discipline in it, and securely protect  our lands. The units of the Army of Azerbaijan, our heroic  warriors are now securely protecting our territories, displaying  exemplary heroism, worthily responding to attacks by the  Armenian Armed Forces, and striking blows at that. We can say  with a feeling of satisfaction that in recent months, all  attempts by Armenian Armed Forces have been defeated; their  offensives have been turned back. The Armed Forces of our  republic are securely defending the positions taken by them and  are proving to the Armenian Armed Forces the degree to which the  force and might of the Republic of Azerbaijan have increased.    At present, heavy fighting is under way on all fronts,  through the fault of the Armenian Armed Forces. We have said  repeatedly, and I will repeat again, that our state comes out in  favor of a peaceful withdrawal from this war, from the woes that  have befallen Azerbaijan. We have taken several steps in this  direction, and today we are proclaiming our position again. I  think that these steps of ours should produce results. At the  same time, the Republic of Azerbaijan has already been able to  boost its military might, and our people may be completely  confident that the Army of Azerbaijan will be able to take the  necessary measures to ensure the secure defense of the republic  and to regain the occupied lands in the future, too.    War goes on, fighting goes on, and our people suffer losses.  This is natural. Today, just as in the beginning of the year,  the valiant sons of the Azeri people become martyrs and die as  they defend our lands in front-line regions. Today, on the eve  of this holiday, I express my condolences to the families,  relatives, and loved ones of the fallen. I admire the courage of  the heroic sons of Azerbaijan. May Allah bless all those who  have sacrificed themselves, and may their graves be filled with  light [the previous sentence is rendered in Azeri in the  original]. May Allah grant patience to their families.    I think that our people are capable of enduring these severe  trials. At present, on this holiday, I send my holiday greetings  to soldiers and officers and all our citizens who are  steadfastly and heroically fighting at the front; I greet them  on the occasion of New Year's day. I wish them health and  success in doing their sacred duty.    The war has borne bitter fruits, and it is still bearing  them. The number of refugees has increased as a result of the  aggression of the Armenian Armed Forces. As I address the  refugees, the esteemed citizens of Azerbaijan, I send my  greetings on the occasion of New Year's day. Indeed, it is the  tradition of our people for each citizen to mark the New Year  holiday in his own home, at the native hearth. Unfortunately, a  majority of our citizens have lost warm shelter, houses, and  hearths, and have been put up in various rayons. However, the  refugees, wherever they might be, should know that our people  care for them deeply, and the state looks after them. No matter  how sad they are and what hardships they are experiencing, I  wish them to be in a holiday mood today.    Our republic is going through a difficult crisis. The  socioeconomic crisis is associated, on one hand, with the war  that has been going on for about six years, and on the other  hand, it has been due to certain objective and subjective  causes. All of these were the reasons for a decline in the  welfare of our people, who are now in a difficult situation.  However, we know that our people are patient, and that they will  endure these difficulties, too. The distressing year 1993 will  end, and in 1994 a turnaround will occur in the development of  our economy; the welfare of the people will improve with every  passing day.    Today, on the Day of Solidarity of Azeris throughout the  world, I wish all Azeris to have unity and solidarity. The  solidarity of Azeris on the territory of the independent  Republic of Azerbaijan is needed to this end first of all. The  second year of independence of the Republic of Azerbaijan is now  ending. This is not too long a period of time. These two years  have been a difficult time for our republic. We are proceeding  toward a third anniversary of our independence. We are facing  great tasks, to accomplish which our people and the Republic of  Azerbaijan will need unity and solidarity of all citizens. If  all of our citizens, all Azeris residing in our republic, manage  to create a genuine atmosphere of accord, we will be able to  achieve unity among Azeris throughout the world.    This is why I appeal to our people for solidarity, I appeal  for patience. I would like to assure you that the coming year  1994 will be a year of great changes and great accomplishments  for the Republic of Azerbaijan. I repeat: We are now securely  protecting our Motherland, our lands. We strive to lead  Azerbaijan out of the state of war, to put an end to this war,  withdraw from it in a peaceful manner. We have taken a multitude  of steps to this end, and we will take them in the future. On 20  December, in Paris, I signed the Paris Charter on behalf of the  Azeri people. We have thus demonstrated yet again to the entire  world the adherence of the Republic of Azerbaijan to peace,  tranquility, and security.    We are supporters of peace. However, along with this we  reinforce our defense forces and strive, and will continue to  strive, to ensure the recovery of the occupied lands of  Azerbaijan. Our people can be sure that all measures will be  taken to ensure the territorial integrity of the Republic of  Azerbaijan and the inviolability of our borders.    You, dear citizens, dear brothers and sisters, may be  certain  that in 1994 our occupied lands will be recovered at any price.  The refugees will return to their homes, to their dwellings. The  territorial integrity and state sovereignty of the Republic of  Azerbaijan will be fully upheld.    Once again, I greet all of you on the occasion of New Year's  day. I wish all citizens of Azerbaijan to have peace,  tranquility, prosperity, happiness in personal life, and success  in all of your endeavors.    Good bye! Happy New Year!</p>

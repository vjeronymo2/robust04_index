			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Spending 'set to rise sharply' CONSUMER SPENDING is set to rise sharply over the next few months following a run-down of interest-bearing savings accounts, according to a 'weighted' measure of the broad money supply. The 'divisia' measure is being considered by the Bank of England as an alternative indicator of future inflat-ion. This measure of the money supply weights its components - cash, bank and building society deposits - according to the extent to which they represent money for spending rather than saving. Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist at Kleinwort Benson, says such an index shows that people have depleted bank and building society deposit accounts accumulated during the late 1980s when interest rates were high. Some of the money has been channeled into government bonds and equities, but much of it, says Mr Spencer, is going into current accounts and cash. 'Such a switch would normally be seen as a prelude to spending,' says Mr Spencer. The sharp growth in the divisia measure of money has worrying implications for inflation. The story it tells stands in sharp contrast to that of M4, the conventional measure of broad money, which has registered only sluggish growth in recent months. M4 simply adds cash and the different types of deposits together, treating them as perfect substitutes for one another. It thus fails to capture the movement between different types of accounts and what this might mean for output and inflation. Conventional measures of the money supply have been criticised for failing to provide a reliable indicator of the relationship between the level of money in the economy and future inflation. Mr Spencer says in a recent paper: 'Because they do not earn interest, cash and sight bank deposits are more likely to be held for making transactions rather than as a home for savings and investment funds. So their behaviour reflects spending plans and the pace of economic activity as well as fluctuations in interest rates'. Mr Spencer's divisia index, which he has been running since 1986, shows that in the first quarter, compared with the fourth quarter, money supply grew at an annualised rate of 12.2 per cent. On the same basis, M4 grew by 5.3 per cent. The discrepancy between divisia and M4 occurs not only because a shift from high-interest to lower interest accounts has no impact on M4, but also because part of the funds until recently held in high-interest bearing accounts are being shifted into gilts and equities, which removes them from the M4 measure of the money supply altogether. This has a more depressing effect on M4 than on the divisia measure. The Bank's divisia index did not grow as strongly as Mr Spencer's in the first quarter. The Bank pointed out that this was because of differences in the construction of the indices. Some independent economists have urged the government to adopt divisia as a target for controlling inflation. In the Bank's quarterly bulletin, published today, economists say that treating cash in the same way as interest-bearing deposits is 'probably misleading'. It concludes that a divisia index, with weighted components, might have a closer relationship with total expenditure in the economy than conventional monetary aggregates.</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Appeal Court makes Kevin Maxwell wait a week over right to silence Mr Kevin Maxwell will have to wait at least a week to find out if the Appeal Court will allow him the right to silence over millions of pounds missing from pension funds controlled by Mr Robert Maxwell, his late father. Lord Justice Dillon reserved judgment yesterday after hearing five days of legal argument. He told the court that, because of the urgency of the issue, the judgment would be given as soon as he and his co-judges had 'clarified the issues in our minds'. But the battle may not end in the Appeal Court. Lawyers think that, because of the fundamental legal implications, the case could continue to the UK's highest court, the House of Lords.</p>

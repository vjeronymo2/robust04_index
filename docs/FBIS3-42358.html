			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Good Morning Peru" newscast] </F>   [Text] Policemen and Special Services Unit agents are still  at the site of the explosion evaluating the situation, trying to  determine the exact amount of explosives that were used for the  car bomb and assessing the resultant damage.    The bodies of the two newspaper and magazine distributors  who  were killed are still at Air Force Headquarters. They were in a  light blue Datsun which bore license plates SG-6691.    I am going to speak with individuals who live across from  the  Air Force installations to see the condition of their homes, to  ask them what they observed and how it was possible for a car  bomb to explode at the headquarters. Certain residents have  already informed us the explosion was possible, because at  exactly 0600 the Air Force opens the street to allow vehicles to  circulate freely in the area, and the subversives took advantage  of that opportunity to place the car bomb.    [Madrid EFE in Spanish at 1314 GMT on 7 February carries a  150-word report on the incident which adds: "The explosion took  place on `8 July' Avenue, Santa Beatriz District. Broken glass  injured an undisclosed number of pedestrians as well as  individuals who were inside their homes. The explosion also  damaged a bank, the Peruvian Telephone Company, and several  homes. The police have made no disclosures regarding the  possible perpetrators of the attack. The vehicle used for the  car bomb has been described only as a Datsun."]</p>

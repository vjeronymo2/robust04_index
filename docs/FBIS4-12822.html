			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Iranian Speaker's Address -- Where Do We </F> Stand?"]    [Text] Iranian Parliament Speaker 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri  addressed the Pakistan National Assembly and has fully and  strongly supported Pakistan on its nuclear program and the  Kashmir issue. He warned that attempts by any foreign power to  influence events in the region will go against the security  interests of the neighboring Islamic countries. Iran has  established close friendly relations with Pakistan after the  Islamic revolution and has always sympathized with Islamabad  whenever it faced problems.    The manner in which Nateq-Nuri, in his National Assembly  speech, has openly assured Iran's support on the serious  problems facing Pakistan will further strengthen the spirit of  Islamic brotherhood in this region. In fact, the nuclear issue  or the Kashmir dispute does not affect Pakistan alone, but they  also have a direct impact on the neighboring Islamic states. If  Pakistan is made weak, God forbid, in the nuclear field, then it  will lead to the weakening of the entire Muslim community. If,  under the alleged conspiracies, a third option [preceding two  words in English] is adopted to settle the Kashmir dispute, then  it is feared the United States and anti-Islamic forces might  turn Kashmir into a base for international machination and from  there orchestrate their conspiracies to weaken the Muslim  countries of the region. Iran is also facing U.S. pressure on  the nuclear issue, and, hence, it can fully realize Pakistan's  difficulties in this regard. Nateq-Nuri's remarks help us to  assess to what extent Iran desires to see Pakistan militarily  become strong.    Coincidentally, the Iranian speaker arrived in Islamabad the  same day the U.S. delegation was departing from Pakistan. On  that occasion, Pakistan and the United States issued a joint  statement expressing their resolve to continue to strive to  strengthen bilateral relations. The U.S. delegation was led by  Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who had come to  Pakistan after visiting India. The main purpose of his visit  was nothing but to help eliminate the nuclear arms race in the  Indian subcontinent. However, it is ironic that while in India  nobody listened to what Mr. Talbott had to say, in Pakistan his  delegation was welcomed and heard very enthusiastically. Even  though the Government of Pakistan asserts that no national  interest was compromised, the wording of the joint statement and  the expression of happiness on the face of Talbott during his  meetings with the president and the prime minister and at the  news briefing rightly lead one to suspect what success led the  U.S. representative to display such a sense of happiness. The  use of vague language in the joint statement itself reflects the  success of the U.S. stand. The foreign media is also giving the  same impression. Even though the supply of F-16's has not been  tied to the capping of the nuclear program, Pakistan has also  not openly showed a red signal to the U.S. moves; it is worth  noting that the two countries will adopt the path of "quiet  diplomacy" to resolve the nuclear issue. This method is  definitely useful for the United States, but it is also  tantamount to openly deceiving the Pakistani people. The  Government of Pakistan, therefore, must remain cognizant of the  fact that the people will never accept any compromise -- open or  secret -- on their independence, security, and sovereignty! The  government must not commit even the slightest mistake in  understanding the feelings of the nation. Similar are the  sentiments of the neighboring Islamic states and further  progress in the nuclear program is essential for enhancing the  strength of both Pakistan and the Islamic community.</p>

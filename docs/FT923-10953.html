			<p>920728 FT  28 JUL 92 / Observer: Tasty morsels Fancy eating a Mel Gibson? Or munching a Madonna? No, not some form of perverse mastication but the latest in a trend so old it has mould on it: the use of Hollywood as a means of inducing consumers to part with cash. 'Celebrity Sandwiches', a lunchtime venue just opened in London's West End, has cottoned onto the idea that the star-struck just can't get close enough to their heroes and heroines; so why not eat them? For Pounds 3.95 you can tuck into the Ivana Trump: 'A luxury you can't divorce, double decker caviar and smoked salmon special.' Surely writs will soon begin to fly, transatlantic-wise?</p>

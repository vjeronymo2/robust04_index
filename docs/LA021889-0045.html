			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOMELESS CHILDREN'S SCHOOLING IS LACKING  </P> <P> More than 65,000 homeless children fail to regularly attend school because they  do not have transportation, clothes or the proper motivation, the Education  Department reported Friday.  </P> <P> "Our fears are confirmed," Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos said in sending  the report to Congress. "Each school day thousands of young people are losing  their best opportunity for a better life -- education."  </P> <P> Cavazos said the statistics should be "viewed with caution" because of  difficulties by state educational agencies in gathering the data.  </P> <P> The report estimated that there were 220,000 school-age homeless children in  America last year and that about 65,000 of them were not attending school  regularly. Reasons given included a preoccupation by parents with finding  housing, food and employment, lack of money for clothes and school supplies and  lack of motivation.  </P></p>

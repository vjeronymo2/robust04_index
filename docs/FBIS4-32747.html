			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hana Lesenarova: "Klaus Slammed for Changing </F> Law"]    [Text] Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus came under sharp  criticism in early May for submitting a bill to Parliament that  was allegedly different from the one the full Cabinet had  approved.    Josef Jezek, an independent member of Parliament who quit  Klaus' Civic Democratic Party (ODS) in March, accused Klaus May  12 of making his own amendments to a bill on Senate and  Parliament elections and then submitting it to Parliament as the  officially recommended government version.    Since the split of Czechoslovakia Jan. 1, 1993, the Czech  Republic has been operating with a unicameral legislature. The  current Chamber of Deputies is the descendant of the Czech  National Council, which served as the legislative body of the  Czech Republic in the Czechoslovak federation. The bill now  under dispute would establish the Senate as the country's new  upper house.    According to Jezek, the version of the bill presented to  Parliament differed from the government-approved one in the  sizes and borders of the districts it set for elections to the  Senate. "Someone has fundamentally changed the demarcation of  the 81 electoral districts," he told RUDE PRAVO.    Vladimir Koronthaly, a deputy for the coalition Christian  Democratic Party (KDS), laid the blame on Ministry of Interior  officials who re-drafted the bill. Their version amounts to a  substantive addition, made without the government's approval, he  said, and therefore cannot be considered the official proposal.  "And the next question is the responsibility of the person who  signed it, and that is Premier Klaus," Koronthaly told MLADA  FRONTA DNES.    According to press reports, the talk in the corridors of  Parliament was more pointed: Many suspected that the changes to  the districts reflected ODS interests, as the slight changes in  boundaries and district sizes cleverly manipulated areas of ODS  strength and weakness in order to bolster the party's election  chances.    Klaus rejected all of the accusations, calling the  controversy "useless hysteria."    "You know well enough it is nonsense. Nothing of the sort  happened. It's an invention of deputy Jezek," Klaus told  journalists.    ODS has been arguing with its coalition partners about the  Senate elections for several months. While ODS demands that  there be 81 electoral districts in the upcoming fall Senate  elections, with one senator from each district, the other three  parties in the ruling coalition--the KDS, the Christian  Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) and the  Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA)--want instead 27 districts, each  with three senators.    The three smaller parties worry that if only one senator  were  elected from each electoral district, the outcome would be a  Senate dominated by one party. And the ODS, as the party with  the highest voter support (although its popularity has dropped  from 32 percent of voters to 26 percent, according to a mid-May  poll), stands to win a vast majority of the winner-take-all  races provided for by its version of the Senate election law.    Klaus, meanwhile, has threatened that unless the ODS gets  its  way on the number of electoral districts, it will oppose the  formation of the Senate.    On March 7, the Cabinet finally agreed to support the ODS  version of the bill, and the Ministry of the Interior was  charged with making the final adjustments agreed on by the  government.    According to Klaus, "A couple of officials from the Interior  Ministry redrew the maps...according to the consensus demand of  the government." The Cabinet had agreed to "redo the maps to  follow the current [administrative] district borders," he  explained.    Klaus said he did not consider the change substantial enough  to warrant the charge that the bill submitted to Parliament was  a different version than the one agreed on by the Cabinet. He  added that the disputes about the validity of the bill had  "exceeded all limits, and my patience has really reached its  end."    According to Jezek, however, the government-approved version  of the legislation stipulated that the number of voters could  not differ from one electoral district to the next by more than  15 percent, whereas the version submitted by Klaus and Interior  Minister Jan Ruml allows a difference of as much as 27 percent.    In one instance, press reports said, the actual difference  between two districts could be as great as 34 percent. And that,  Jezek argued, would disturb the balance of votes.    ODA's Radim Spacek agreed, saying the bill's lists of the  administrative districts comprising each electoral district  wiped from the map five administrative districts:  Praha-Zbraslav, Praha-Troja, Brno-Komin, Brno-Jundrov, and the  former military region of Libava. If the bill were signed as is,  he said, voters in those districts would not be able to cast  ballots.    Igor Nemec (ODS), director of the Office of the Government,  described the dispute as a "misunderstanding." But he confirmed  to Parliament that "The government neither discussed nor voted  on the change [in the allowed difference in number of voters  between districts] and therefore it was not recorded in the  minutes," RUDE PRAVO reported.    "[But] not all changes are always in the government's  decision," Nemec told the daily.    Nemec said two options were considered in the Cabinet's  discussion of criteria for creating the electoral districts:  Either they could correspond strictly to population, or they  could follow the borders of current administrative districts.    The government opted for the second, thus requiring a change  in the maximum permissible difference between electoral district  populations, according to Nemec.    Representatives of the four coalition parties agreed at a  May  20 meeting that the bills were different, and laid the blame on  Interior Ministry officials. But they said there was no need to  search out a guilty party.    Meanwhile, the bill is moving through Parliament's  committees, leaving a trail of bitter disputes in its wake. The  Constitutional Committee, for instance, supported an ODA  proposal for 27 three-senator districts, a fundamental break  with the Cabinet's recommendation.    The full Chamber of Deputies is expected to vote on the bill  during its next session, which starts May 31.</p>

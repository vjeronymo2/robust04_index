			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Josef Joffe: "Russia -- Partner and Risk"] </F>   [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev was not an  easy visitor for NATO but a dilemma personified. Russia is the  joker in the European balance of forces. Formerly, in the Cold  War, it was Russia's power that burdened Europe; now it is its  weakness and inner conflicts. However, no matter whether it is  strong or weak -- Russia was and remains a factor of uncertainty.    Ironically, the West had an easier time in the past. No  matter whether politics was marked by containment or detente --  its huge military potential made the Soviet Union the enemy, and  every alliance planning was oriented by it. In the course of  its history, NATO has wracked its brain over many other problems  -- the pranks played by Charles de Gaulle or the dictatorship of  the Greek colonels. However, what remained at the end of the  day was always the same -- the classical problem of the balance.  How to deter the Soviet Union or how to defend oneself against  it if deterrence were to fail?    The problem now is that the Soviet Union has committed  suicide and abandoned communism, is experimenting with the  market economy and democracy, withdraws its troops from Germany  1,500 km to the East, and removes approximately 2,000 warheads  from its nuclear arsenals every year? Every reasonable person  must want to see this process completed smoothly and end happily.    However, the harvest is not yet saved; there are still a lot  of ill weeds in the furrows. One problem is the chauvinists who  believe the country is surrounded by old and new enemies  intending to trouble and humiliate the country. Another problem  is the classical symptoms of a society that is caught between  the past and the future -- attempted coups and the growing gap  between profiteers and losers of the change. One seed that is  not bearing fruit is the economic reform. The production  decrease of 25 percent that was reported recently shows a  declining economic sector. "Weimar-Russia"? The idea no longer  is as absurd as it was two or three years ago.    The West does not have the power and ability to modernize  Russia from outside. In foreign policy, a dilemma has developed  for the West that was dramatized by Grachev's appearance at the  NATO meeting. Russia has insisted on a special role on the  European stage, which, at a closer look, shows fatal parallels  with the attitude of the old Soviet Union. During the Cold War,  Moscow always claimed a veto on the West's security policy. At  first, Moscow did not want the West Germans to be rearmed, then  it did not want NATO to be equipped with intermediate-range  missiles. Today, the alliance cannot bomb Bosnia without  specific permission from Moscow or take those Eastern European  countries under its wings that wish to associate with NATO.    "Special status" is the magic formula used by Grachev and  Yeltsin when they talk with NATO. Even if Grachev after an  unexpected turn suddenly accepts the "Partnership for Peace"  program "without any condition," Moscow wants to be "more equal"  than the Eastern Europeans, and behind this is the old claim to  the guaranteed role of big power. NATO will have to consider  this carefully if it wants to remain a functioning alliance and  does not want to leave the new democracies on the other side of  the Elbe river in a drafty "Central Europe."    Cooperate with Russia, protect Yeltsin against his  troublemakers at home? Yes, in any case. Open the door for  Russia to the G-7 club of the rich industrial nations? Logic  seems to forbid this because it would be tantamount to taking in  the bankrupt into the group of creditors. Channel Moscow into  NATO past the Poles, Czechs, and Hungarians? That would mean  degrading those who are worthy of protection and privileging the  country they fear.    What basically holds true is this: Diplomacy can and even  must cover up dilemmas by all sorts of compromise formulas; its  principle is the "both...and" formula. But in the end, there is  still the threatening "either...or" principle. If Russia does  in fact become a NATO member, this will be the end of the  alliance. It may still be called "NATO," but it would be  nothing but a mini-CSCE, a rather noncommittal association open  to all sides and incapable of making tough decisions.    In Brussels, the Americans and the British have apparently  held their own against the Germans and Spaniards who wanted to  give the Russians ("a big power," according to German Defense  Minister Volker Ruehe) more shining epaulets. This is better  for NATO and better for the Eastern Central Europeans who are  Germany's direct neighbors and do not need any discrimination  for the benefit of Moscow. There are other means to satisfy  Russia's status requirements, and the alliance does not have to  give up its old identity. There are enough problems for Russia  to demonstrate its role as a responsible big power -- in Bosnia  or in the struggle against the spreading of weapons of mass  destruction. Binding Russia by all sorts of measures is a  long-term dictate of every Western policy. However, Russia's  unpredictability and potential strength make the country not  only a partner but also a certain risk in the wake of the Cold  War.</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Canadian air carriers clash over foreign equity issue A HEATED row with strong political overtones is brewing over the future of Canada's two main airlines. While Canadian Airlines International is seeking a foreign equity partner as a possible solution to its financial problems, its arch-rival Air Canada has launched a public campaign against increased foreign involvement in the airline industry. Air Canada, also deep in the red, would prefer a merger of the two airlines. It has hired one of Canada's most highly regarded lobbyists to press its case in Ottawa. The carrier this week released a public opinion poll showing that the vast majority of Canadians would prefer a domestic merger to greater involvement by a US carrier in the industry. Canadian Airlines is believed to be negotiating the sale of a 49 per cent interest to Dallas-based American Airlines. Such a deal would require a relaxation of foreign ownership rules, which restrict foreigners to a 25 per cent equity stake in any domestic airline. The one point of agreement is that the two airlines will not survive in their present form. Mr Ted Larkin, analyst at Bunting Warburg in Toronto, estimates Air Canada will suffer a CDollars 30m (USDollars 25m) loss this year, while Canadian will lose about CDollars 60m. Their combined 1991 loss is estimated at CDollars 350m. Critics of a deal between the Canadian carrier and a US airline are concerned that even a minority stake would give the much larger foreign carrier effective operational control over Canadian Airlines. Air Canada would have little choice but to follow a similar route, thus marking the end of an independent Canadian airline industry. On the other hand, a merger would create a cumbersome domestic monopoly which might be forced to lay off thousands of workers.</p>

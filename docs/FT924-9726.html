			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / People: Steve Bullock elected to chair ALA Steve Bullock, leader of Lewisham Council, has been elected to succeed Margaret Hodge as chair of the Labour-dominated Association of London Authorities. Bullock, 39, hit stardom as the friendly face of local government in the BBC's serial 'Town Hall' broadcast earlier this year. The Council made a less than glamorous show - for all its 'we-got-to-the-Citizen's-Charter first' rhetoric. But Bullock's no-nonsense bluntness scored high, for all his penchant for floral ties. Leader of Lewisham for four years, Bullock has spent most of his life in local government. He worked for the Greater London Council in the 1970s, was elected to Lewisham in the early 1980s, and was deputy leader by 1985. Bullock, who was married last week in New York, has a hard act to follow. Margaret Hodge consigned the loony left to the dustbin and achieved the unthinkable - making the case for an elected Greater London authority respectable after Ken Livingstone. 'My priority will be to ensure that London's voice is heard loud and clear in centres of power,' Bullock said yesterday. 'The absence of a strategic authority for the capital has left the capital falling behind in Europe and we need to restore it to world-class status again.' If he is serious about the voice, his first job will be to get all London's Labour and Tory councils into one association; such was the bitterness of the 1980s that the capital's Tory councils have their own. Alas, he might find it easier to resurrect the GLC - or to follow Margaret Hodge into the lucrative private sector, advising consultants on local government.</p>

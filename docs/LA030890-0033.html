			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PAINTER GOES TO THE MAT OVER CHANGES IN HIS ARTWORK;  </P> <P> RIGHTS: BRIAN URA IS USING A CALIFORNIA LAW THAT ALLOWS A VISUAL ARTIST TO  COLLECT DAMAGES AND ATTORNEYS' FEES FROM SOMEONE WHO ALTERS, MUTILATES OR  DESTROYS ONE OF HIS ARTWORKS.  </P> <P> Artist Brian Ura often worked late into the night trying to get the colors just  right on the seven still lifes of fruits and vegetables he was painting for a  posh new San Diego-area hotel.  </P> <P> The $12,300 commission was the biggest ever for Ura, a struggling artist.  Eagerly, he traveled to Coronado for Le Meridien Hotel's grand opening in June,  1988. He was shocked to find his paintings covered with a dark, blotchy coating  of stain or varnish that Ura said was applied so crudely that "it looked like  shoe polish."  </P> <P> "It was like someone had slapped me across the face. I was numb," said Ura, 42.  "The subtle color nuances were totally destroyed. I feel the paintings are not  mine anymore. I'm embarrassed to have people see my name on them."  </P> <P> Until 10 years ago, Ura would have had no legal recourse unless he had  expressly reserved his rights in advance by contract. Even today, he would have  few options in most parts of the country.  </P> <P> But Ura took advantage of a pioneering California law that allows a visual  artist to collect damages and attorneys' fees from someone who alters,  mutilates or destroys one of his original artworks -- even if the artist no  longer owns it.  </P> <P> Ura filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court last July seeking $1 million  in actual and punitive damages from Neal Menzies, the art consultant who hired  him to do the paintings; the hotel's art designer, Cynthia Forchielli and her  company, Intra Designs and the framer, Jerry Solomon, all of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Forchielli and Solomon did not return several phone calls from The Times.  Menzies' attorney, Jonathan Chodos, said his client had nothing to do with the  alterations and called Ura's lawsuit "totally without legal and moral  justification."  </P> <P> The hotel was dropped from the lawsuit after Ura's attorney, Jeffrey Karpel,  concluded that hotel officials did not authorize or know about the changes to  the paintings, which still hang in the hotel restaurant. The paintings  apparently had been considered too bright for the restaurant's subdued  atmosphere.  </P> <P> The 10-year-old California law on which Ura based his lawsuit, the California  Art Preservation Act, is the first of its kind in the nation. Authored by  former State Sen. Alan Sieroty (D-Los Angeles), it prohibits unauthorized  changes to works of "fine art," which the law defines as "original paintings,  sculptures, drawings or artworks in glass." The law does not protect artwork  created for commercial uses in "advertising, magazines, newspapers or other  print and electronic media."  </P> <P> The law is based on the doctrine of droit moral, or moral right, which holds  that a work of art is an expression of the artist's creative personality,  giving the artist an interest in his art even after its sale.  </P> <P> "If you were an artist who had invested five years of your life in creating  something that you thought was extraordinarily wonderful but because the only  way artists can live is to sell their work, you had to part with it, how would  you feel about someone destroying it?," asked Stephen E. Weil, deputy director  of the Hirshhorn Museum, the modern art branch of the Smithsonian Institution  in Washington and co-author of two books on art law.  </P> <P> An artist's reputation depends on his artwork; if it is destroyed, he can't use  it to attract potential clients, mount it in a retrospective show of his works,  or reproduce it in exercise of his copyrights, said La Jolla arts lawyer Peter  Karlen, who perhaps has handled more artists rights cases than any other lawyer  in the state.  </P> <P> The doctrine also holds that changing or destroying original works of art  deprives the public of a part of its culture, said Greg Victoroff, co-chairman  of the Beverly Hills Bar Assn.'s Committee for the Arts. The doctrine says that  original artworks need special protection because they are unique and  irreplaceable.  </P> <P> "Records and books are virtually indestructible because they exist in  multiples," Weil said. "You could not destroy Beethoven's Fifth Symphony no  matter how hard you tried. But destroy a work of art and it's gone forever."  </P> <P> The doctrine originated around the turn of the century in France. The concept  is alien to American precepts of property rights, which generally permit people  to do whatever they want with what they own, experts said.  </P> <P> There was no legal recourse, therefore, for artist Alfred D. Crimi, who devoted  years of painstaking work to a large fresco commissioned for a wall of Rutgers  Presbyterian Church in New York City. In 1946, eight years after he finished  it, the congregation's leaders decided that Christ's bare chest looked too  worldly and, without consulting Crimi, painted over the fresco.  </P> <P> Devastated, the artist unsuccessfully sued seeking to have the paint removed or  the fresco detached and given to him.  </P> <P> Alexander Calder also was frustrated by the lack of moral rights protections  after a private collector donated his mobile "Pittsburgh," to that city's  municipal airport in 1958. Without Calder's permission, the city repainted the  black and white mobile in the county colors, green and gold, and motorized it  to turn steadily.  </P> <P> Calder spent the last 18 years of his life trying to get the mobile restored to  its original state. It was finally done after his death.  </P> <P> The late artist Isamu Noguchi realized he might as well not even bother to sue  when a New York branch of the Bank of Tokyo decided to remove his sculpture  "Shinto" from its lobby in 1980. Customers had complained that the 1,600-pound  sculpture of a 17-foot-long rhomboid hanging point-downward, suspended by steel  cables, was like a big guillotine poised overhead.  </P> <P> Because it wouldn't fit through the doors or windows, the sculpture was cut  into pieces and stuck in a warehouse. The artist called it vandalism but had no  legal recourse.  </P> <P> Today, artists' moral rights are recognized in more than 70 countries,  including almost all of Western Europe except the Communist bloc, and parts of  Latin America and Africa. Great Britain last year enacted moral rights  legislation for the first time.  </P> <P> Moral rights still are not recognized in the United States, with the exception  of California and nine other states -- Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maine, New  York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, New Mexico and Connecticut --  that followed California's lead by passing various forms of moral rights  legislation. Artists occasionally have used legal arguments rooted in libel,  defamation and unfair trade practice law to protect their artistic rights.  </P> <P> Although the United States last year became one of 89 nations to sign the Berne  Convention on international copyright law, which contains artists' moral rights  protections, those protections are largely symbolic, Weil said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Sen. Edward Kennedy, (D-Mass.) has introduced national moral rights  legislation and a similar bill has been introduced in the House. Hearings have  been held and the bills are in committee.  </P> <P> The California law, like most in this country, protects only works of  "recognized quality," a proviso designed in part to make sure a doting mother  doesn't sue her child's kindergarten teacher for throwing out her child's  finger-painting, Weil said.  </P> <P> The subjective decision of what constitutes quality is to be determined by the  trial court after testimony from dealers, gallery owners, art historians,  museum curators and other art experts. Under the law, an artist can insist that  his name be put on or taken off his artwork, said Edward J. Damich, associate  professor at George Mason University School of Law in Virginia.  </P> <P> The California law also allows the awarding of punitive damages, not to the  artist, but to a nonprofit arts organization selected by the court. The law  also permits an artist or nonprofit arts organization acting on the public's  behalf to seek an injunction to prevent damage to an artwork.  </P> <P> The law extends rights to artists and their heirs only for 50 years beyond the  life of the artist, meaning privately owned paintings by the Old Masters can be  altered with impunity. In addition, you can buy a work of fine art in  California, move to one of the 40 states without moral rights laws, and do  whatever you want with it.  </P> <P> "You can still play darts with your Rembrandt," Weil said. "You can take your  painting to Wyoming and destroy the hell out of it to your heart's content."  </P> <P> Even in those 10 states with laws, permissible conduct varies widely. New York,  for instance, allows a work to be altered if it isn't publicly displayed, said  Damich. Thus, you can mutilate a painting in New York and show it in California  without violating either state's moral rights laws.  </P> <P> Theoretically the laws of some states could even affect the average citizen who  tires of a painting and throws it out. But experts say even in the unlikely  event the artist sued, the work would have to be "of recognized quality" for  the artist to recover damages.  </P> <P> It is impossible to say how many lawsuits have been brought under the  California act. Most cases are settled out of court, in part because it is  usually easy to prove an artwork was destroyed intentionally and it is not  worth the expense of a protracted legal battle, Karlen said. Settlements  generally run between seven and 10 times the artwork's original purchase price,  he added.  </P> <P> The only California case that has been reviewed at the appellate court level  was an unsuccessful attempt by an architect to seek the act's protections,  experts said.  </P> <P> Some of the California cases support a stereotypical notion of California as  the home of the bizarre and eccentric. For instance, in the early 1980s, a Los  Angeles art dealer got it into his head that some bronze sculptures of nudes in  strange contorted postures in his gallery were evil. The dealer staged an  artistic exorcism of sorts in which he and his friends danced around the  sculptures, etching crosses into them. The artist contemplated suing but didn't  have to; the gallery owner voluntarily paid for the damage, Karlen said.  </P> <P> Another San Diego artist sued under the moral rights law after his  ex-girlfriend took a painting he had given her before their relationship  soured, ripped it up, scribbled profanities on the pieces and mailed it to him.  He received a small judgment, Karlen said.  </P> <P> In another case in the 1980s, an artist sued and received an out of court  settlement from a collector who removed 50 dollar bills from the artist's  avant-garde conceptual painting and, apparently, spent them, said Karlen.  </P> <P> Although artists have also used the law to recover damages for mutilated  murals, it's still a gray area that experts say will undoubtedly be decided  upon by the appellate courts.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Harvey A. Schneider ruled last month that the  state law does not protect murals because the law does not specify murals as  works of fine art. But Schneider urged the muralists to appeal the ruling,  which came in a case involving a mural commissioned by Shell Oil Co. for a wall  adjoining a Boyle Heights gas station that later was remodeled by new owners.  </P> <P> French moral rights go much farther than those in the United States, giving an  artist the right to decide whether a work of art shall be made public, the  right to remain anonymous or use a pseudonym and the right to receive royalties  when the work is resold. (California is the only state in this country to allow  royalties. The controversial Resale Royalties Act, also authored by Sieroty and  passed in 1977, requires payment of a 5% royalty fee to an artist whose work is  resold for more than $1,000 profit.)  </P> <P> Whereas moral rights exist only in the visual arts in this country, the French  recognize it in all artistic forms -- including architecture. For instance,  poet Paul Claudell was able to prevent his play from being performed with one  act omitted in France, whereas playwright Samuel Beckett had no legal recourse  to stop a production in Boston four years ago that he said misrepresented one  of his works, Weil said.  </P> <P> France gives moral rights protections to a film's screenwriters, directors and  composers after the final print is released, which has been used in France to  prevent the showing of colorized films. Currently, the issue of colorizing  films is on appeal with the French Supreme Court. When "The Asphalt Jungle" was  broadcast on TV in a test case, it was shown in color and in black and white.  Legal attempts to prevent the showing of colorized films in this country have  failed, Damich said.  </P> <P> The moral rights laws of Massachusetts and New Mexico extend to motion pictures  in limited cases.  </P> <P> The French even allow an artist the right to buy back a work if the artist  decides it no longer represents him, Weil said. For instance, Anatole France in  1882 sold a historical book to a publisher who waited 25 years -- until France  was famous -- to publish it. France sued and was able to prevent publication by  reimbursing the publisher for the cost of his contract, Karlen said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, back in Studio City, Ura said the lawsuit has taken time and energy  from his artwork and may also have hurt him professionally. It's something the  artist, who rolls up the living room carpet of his tiny rented home for studio  space, can ill afford.  </P> <P> He thinks at least one gallery has dropped his work because of the suit. His  earnings have dropped and his girlfriend is supporting him, he said. But he  said he felt he had an obligation to sue.  </P> <P> "I know that what they did was illegal but above that, it was immoral," said  Ura, a 1971 honors graduate of the San Francisco Art Institute who prides  himself on his skill with color. Not to do anything "would have been  contributing to the wrongness of it," he said.  </P> <P> But Chodos said his client and the others had the right to change Ura's work  because "he was simply doing a painting to their specifications. It was not a  creative work on his part. It's as if they told him, 'Could you come in and  paint my car?' "  </P></p>

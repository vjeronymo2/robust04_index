			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 30 May (XINHUA) -- According to the  Ministry of Internal Trade, owing to larger rapeseed acreage  this year, rapeseed output is expected to be higher than that of  last year; and owing to arriving shipments of cooking oil  imported with the State Council's approval, the cooking oil  supply and demand are calming down in the market, and the price  is quite stable.    As the supply of summer rapeseed will continue to increase  in  the market, the Ministry of Internal Trade and the State  Administration of Grain Reserves yesterday issued a "Notice on  Intensifying the Market Management of Cooking Oil and Doing a  Good Job in Summer Rapeseed Purchasing." The notice says:  While various localities are doing a good job and making quick  progress in rapeseed purchasing, certain localities appear to be  ready to fight a "big purchasing war" [shougou dazhan 2392 6356  1129 2069] for rapeseed.    The notice urges state-operated grain departments to take  effective measures to fulfill state-set quotas of purchasing 70  to 80 percent of rapeseed needed for processing into cooking  oil. It says: In each and every county, which should be  treated as one unit, state-operated grain departments there must  purchase rapeseed strictly in accordance with the collective  plan and price. By no means should they compete with one  another in purchasing rapeseed by offering a higher price, much  less should they compete with buyers in other provinces by  offering a higher price. Whoever has been found to do so in  violation of regulations will have their grain and oil operating  license revoked, their illegal profits confisticated, and the  rapeseed they have purchased will be turned over to  state-operated grain departments at a set price. Control in all  channels must be intensified, and responsbilities must be  prescribed and fulfilled. Under local governments' leadership,  grain departments should work in close coordination with  business, price, public security, and taxation departments; and  share responsibilities with them in exercising stronger  supervision over rapeseed purchasing and law enforcement so that  normal market order can be maintained. To stabilize the cooking  oil market, there should be effective measures for guarding  against competitive rapeseed purchasing through various  channels, and earnest efforts must be made to prevent a big war  [da zhan 1129 2069] in rapeseed purchasing.</p>

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Books: 'Uncle Joe' accommodated - Policies which survived from Stalin to today DOCUMENTS ON BRITISH POLICY OVERSEAS: SERIES 1, VOL V1. EASTERN EUROPE, AUGUST 1945-APRIL 1946 HMSO Pounds 47, 395 pages THIS VOLUME covers the post war months between the Potsdam Big Three Conference and the Council of Foreign Ministers, including France, in Paris. Truman and Byrnes Washington retained Roosevelt's objective of co-operation with Stalin's Soviet Union. The new Labour government in London gave general support with fewer misgivings than would probably have been forthcoming from Churchill, already highly suspicious of Stalin in the closing months of the war. It was, however, a period during which the evidence accumulated of Stalin's very different objectives and working with him became increasingly difficult. The wartime hopes of Roosevelt and Churchill that, if treated as a member of their club 'Uncle Joe' might one day behave as such, were not realised. But Stalin wanted peace to restore the Soviet economy and he had committed himself at Yalta and Potsdam to machinery of consultation and co-operation, above all in Germany and Austria, even in Eastern Europe and in the United Nations. The major issue of Germany, on which the wartime alliance finally broke down in 1948 with the Berlin Blockade, to be followed by the Cold War, is not the theme of this volume. But its first chapter covers the consolidation of Soviet hegemony, based upon the victories of the Red Army and the introduction of Communist Party leadership in Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary. It also records the successful, although at times seemingly desperate, struggle of the UK, again involving armed forces, this time British, to preserve Greek independence. The second and much shorter, although to to my mind more important chapter, deals with bilateral Anglo-Soviet relations, above all with the reassessment in the Moscow Embassy and in Whitehall of Soviet policies and of the character of the Soviet regime, together with recommendations for future British policies. These studies were carried out in parallel with a similar American exercise. I here declare an interest, since a considerable proportion of the published documents were from the Moscow Embassy, of which I was then in charge, working closely with American opposite number George Kennan and later with the new American Ambassador, General Bedell-Smith. Germany was a central concern for the UK and US alike, as were Iran and Turkey. The Americans naturally gave more attention to Japan, China, Korea and the Pacific, while the UK concentrated upon the Middle East and also upon potential Soviet influence in the forthcoming transformation of the British Empire into the Commonwealth. Returning to the first chapter, British interests lay mainly in Greece and with Poland, our ally since 1939. It became increasingly clear that we could do little to prevent the Russians from abusing their position in the Tripartite Control Commissions in Romania, Bulgaria and even Hungary to ensure that the minority Communist parties dominated their governments. Tito's Yugoslavia, with whom our wartime relations had been so close, had become openly hostile, threatening the Italians in Trieste and the Austrians in Carinthia and above all supporting the Communists in Greece, where Stalin preferred to remain in the background. The documents show how burdensome a task Bevin had taken over from Churchill in Greece, one indeed which before long had to be passed on to the Americans. There remained Poland, where our only weapon was diplomatic pressure, in trying, as it eventually proved in vain, to hold Stalin and his Communist puppets in Warsaw to his Yalta commitments. This meant discreet support for Mikolaczyk, who had some success at first, efforts to ensure the return to Poland in safety of those in the Polish forces wishing to return, and concern for the manner in which Poland took over the administration of its new and formerly German territories. But Soviet control, military, political and economic, was growing ever stronger. While Soviet hegemony over Eastern Europe came as no surprise, Stalin's ruthlessness and disregard of his western allies were important factors in the reassessment of Anglo-Soviet relations recorded in Chapter II. However, the old priority of seeking to work with the Soviet Union was not lightly abandoned. As late as the spring of 1946 Bevin was still trying in vain to interest Stalin in a new Anglo-Soviet 50 years Treaty. It was not until the autumn of 1946 that decisions were taken on Anglo-American policies in Germany without the Soviet Union, and then only because there was no prospect of Soviet co-operation in the restoration of the German economy as an essential part of the European Recovery Programme. There were were obviously differences of emphasis between the Foreign Office and the Moscow Embassy and indeed between the diplomatic and military assessments in Whitehall. But there was basic agreement on the main thrust of future policy. The essential feature was to regard Stalin's approach as adversarial, but not necessarily leading to military confrontation, provided a working relationship could be maintained on a basis of Western strength and unity and tough realism. Working with the Soviet Union, wherever possible, remained desirable since there were issues where Soviet and Western interests were not divergent. It was thus in the spring of 1946 that the basis was laid in London and Washington for policies towards the Soviet Union, to be pursued later in NATO and elsewhere, firm enough to deter or defeat dangerous Soviet initiatives but flexible enough to react to changes for the better in Moscow under Khrushchev, even under Brezhnev and finally under Gorbachev. Nearly 50 years later the result has been the unification of Germany and the end of Communism in Central and Eastern Europe and now in the Soviet Union itself. These documents have been well selected and are, as usual in this series, presented with objectivity and scholarship.</p>

"His visit to the U.S. for a lecture meeting has been  canceled, but I think he will eventually be able to make the  trip," Kuriyama said at a press conference.    Ozawa, a key strategist in the ruling coalition, was  expected  to travel to Washington next week ostensibly to deliver a speech  at the National Press Club.    He was also expected to act as a trouble-shooting envoy for  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in a bid to mend bilateral ties  frayed by the breakdown of trade talks last month.    Ozawa told reporters in Tokyo on Tuesday that it would be  difficult to make the trip because he has not made any  preparations.    He said he would consider making the visit after the intense  media speculation over the trip dies down.    In Washington on Tuesday, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor said he would like to meet Ozawa if he receives such a  request.    Kantor reportedly told lawmakers that the U.S.-Japan  economic  relationship "is in serious disrepair," but on reports of an  imminent trade war, said "this is not going to happen."</p>

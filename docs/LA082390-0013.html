			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> CITY MAY QUALIFY FOR TAX INCENTIVE PLAN  </P> <P> Oxnard officials believe that their city qualifies for a state Department of  Commerce program that provides tax incentives for businesses in an economically  depressed area.  </P> <P> In a memo to City Manager Vernon G. Hazen, Economic Development Officer Linda  Guillis said that "based on preliminary information from the state, Oxnard  meets the major eligibility criteria for the establishment of a zone."  </P> <P> Oxnard's qualifications include its commitment to promoting new business and  industry, and its high unemployment rate and low median income level in certain  neighborhoods near downtown, she said.  </P> <P> In the memo released last week, Guillis said the program would attract  businesses and help create jobs that bring additional revenues to the city.  </P> <P> However, she warned that the city would probably compete with as many as 100  other cities for inclusion in the program. Eight cities will be chosen to be in  the program, the memo said.  </P> <P> The City Council is scheduled to consider an application for the program Sept.  4. HUGO MARTIN  </P></p>

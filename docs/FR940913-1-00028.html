			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, at present, &sect;582.5 states that to determine the actual premium that a consumer will be charged for insuring a particular vehicle or for complete information about insurance premiums, the consumer should contact insurance companies directly. In this proposed rule, NHTSA proposes that &sect;582.5 be revised to advise the consumer to contact insurance company  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> agents  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> directly. Amending the text to advise the consumer to contact the insurance company agents directly, reflects the fact that the consumer's first point of contact with insurance companies is the insurance company agent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice has not been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action and has determined the action not to be ``significant'' under the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. The agency has determined that the economic effects of the proposed amendments are minimal, so that a full regulatory evaluation is not required. This NPRM proposes minor amendments to the insurance cost information regulation, so that the information to be provided to potential motor vehicle purchasers is more accurate. Assuming these proposals are adopted, any extra text that must be included in the information booklet would be minuscule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, NHTSA has evaluated the effects of this notice of proposed rulemaking on small entities. NHTSA estimates there are about 24,000 dealers of new passenger motor vehicles. Many of the dealers would be considered small entities, that may be affected by this proposed rule. However, NHTSA believes that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of these small dealers. The rationale is that this rulemaking proposes minor editorial changes, resulting in a small amount of extra text in the insurance cost information booklet. The potential cost increments associated with this proposed rule should have negligible effects on the purchase price of new passenger motor vehicles. For these reasons, I certify that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. National Environmental Policy Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the agency has considered the environmental impacts of this proposed rule and determined that if made final, it will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Federalism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12623, and it has been determined that the rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Civil Justice Reform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule would not have any retroactive effect, and it does not preempt any State law. Chapter 323_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Consumer Information <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of 49 U.S.C. does not provide for judicial review of rules issued pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 32302. The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , provides generally for judicial review of final agency action, which in certain circumstances may include this proposed rule. The Administrative Procedure Act does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Procedures for Filing Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA solicits public comments on the issues presented in this notice. It is requested, but not required, that 10 copies be submitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 553.21.) Necessary attachments may be appended to these submissions without regard to the 15 page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primary arguments in a concise fashion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a claim of confidentiality, three copies of the complete submission, including purportedly confidential business information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel, NHTSA, at the street address given above, and seven copies from which the purportedly confidential information has been deleted should be submitted to the Docket Section. A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a cover letter setting forth the information specified in the agency's confidential business information regulation. 49 CFR part 512.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above for this notice will be considered, and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address both before and after that date. To the extent possible, comments filed after the closing date will also be considered. Comments received too late for consideration in regard to the final rule will be considered as suggestions for further rulemaking action. Comments on this notice will be available for inspection in the docket. NHTSA will continue to file relevant information as it becomes available for inspection in the docket after the closing date, and it is recommended that interested persons continue to examine the docket for new material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS STAY OF EXECUTION FOR HARRIS  </P> <P> It's time to repeal the death penalty -- not because it's unjust or immoral but  because it's unworkable.  </P> <P> Under our system of justice, murderers sentenced to die have become the most  protected of felons, guaranteed years of review, appeals and delays at public  expense.  </P> <P> Their plight attracts a multitude of apologists and supporters, including those  opposed to capital punishment under any circumstances. If murderers are members  of a minority, they can be portrayed as victims of prejudice and their defense  often becomes a political obligation. If not, their defenders can blame their  parents, associates or society in general for their antisocial conduct.  </P> <P> Murder is an abnormal act. It's, therefore, not surprising that defense  attorneys will uncover histories of deviant behavior in their clients' past. If  this behavior can be traced to physical, mental or emotional impairment, the  defense can move for exoneration on the grounds that the defendants, through no  fault of their own, fail to recognize constraints governing the conduct of  normal people.  </P> <P> According to polls, most of us favor the death penalty and abhor the media  circus which has made an international celebrity out of a brutal and amoral  killer like Harris. But we must recognize the limitations of our legal system  and society that permit only one murderer out of a hundred to be executed. Why  continue a law with that kind of track record which also inspires widespread  frustration and cynicism, not to mention the expenditure of millions?  </P> <P> It's time to face up to reality.  </P> <P> BRYCE F. DENNO  </P> <P> Coronado  </P></p>

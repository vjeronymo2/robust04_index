			<p>BFN     [Text] On 18 June it was revealed that, Washington  unofficially sounded Tokyo out about the possibility of jointly  developing a Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system, by  specifically presenting areas of cooperation including  downsizing of a mobile launching device.    The United States has shown strong interest in developing  the  system using Japan's civilian-product technology. The recent  revelation makes it clear that Washington gives importance to  "realizing technical cooperation" in the Japan-U.S. TMD system  talks. Defending the nation from ballistic missile attacks has  been argued about in the current Diet session in connection with  the tense situation in North Korea. Thus, how the TMD talks  develop from now on will draw the attention of various sectors.    The TMD system was devised to counter ballistic missile  attacks. It is composed of Theater High Altitude Area Defense  (THAAD) missiles, a control system, a space-based censor, and  other devices. Talks on the TMD system have been promoted by a  working-level task force established by Japan and the United  States. As "an example of Japan-U.S. cooperation," Washington  unofficially proposed joint development of a compact, mobile  launching device by using Japan's civilian-product technology  and parts.    Washington also referred to the possibility of using  Japanese- made composite materials to reduce the weight of  missiles so their range will be improved. Moreover, it sounded  Tokyo out about the possibility of exchanging techniques in such  areas as optical electronics technology, which is needed for  developing a guidance system, and technology for the production  of electronic equipment and radar circuits.    At the ministerial-level talks on Japan-U.S. security  (called  the 2+2 meeting) held in March, then Defense Director General  Kazuo Aichi commented on Japan's cooperation in developing the  TMD system, saying: "I am thinking about clearly stating that  the government will study this when it reviews the national  defense program guidelines."    There are growing voices within the government that while  keeping an eye on North Korea, Japan should actively work to  establish an air defense system against missile attacks, which  is a "blind spot" in Japan's defense buildup.</p>

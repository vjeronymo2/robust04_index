According to official statistics, a total of some 2.48  billion yuan (about 285 million U.S. dollars) was earned by  postal and telecommunication service last year, 73 percent more  than in 1992.    Over the past year, the province has expanded its microwave  and optical fibre cable lines by 1,837 kilometers and 946  kilometers, respectively.    In addition, international satellite communication has been  put into service between Weihai city of Shandong to Seoul of  Korea.    Some 15,000 long-distance telephone lines have been opened,  increasing the number of such lines in the province to 33,000,  81 percent of which are automatically controlled.    All cities and 67 counties in the province have established  program-controlled telephone systems, and program-controlled  switchboards with 395,000 lines were opened last year.    Consequently, the number of telephone users in the province  has risen to about 1.37 million.    Officials from the provincial posts and telecommunications  department said that now more than 50 percent of the towns and  villages have opened automatically-controlled telephone lines.    Some 81 post offices had been computerized by the end of  last  year.    The postal and telecommunication services have been expanded  greatly, with mobile telephones, digital communication, radio  tracking and credit card phones available in most areas in the  province.    According to official statistics, the postal savings of the  province hit a record of more than 5.3 billion yuan (about 609  million U.S. dollars) last year, ranking second in China's  postal service.    Officials said that more than 3.1 billion yuan (about 356  million U.S. dollars) have been invested in the construction of  postal services over the past year, four times the 1992 sum.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 15 (AA) -- A report prepared by a  parliamentary commission in charge of detecting the existing  problems and formulating measures on the southeast said that  after the terrorism of the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] is  stopped, declaring a general amnesty is a must, to accomplish  domestic peace.    The report also called for the restriction of the practice  of  regional governorates and the village guard systems.    The commission's chairman, Omur Lutfu Coskun, of the  coalition member True Path Party (DYP), told a press conference  today that, to prevent terror in the southeast, sensitivity is  necessary so as not to regard all the region's people as  potential criminals.    `The region should not be a place of exile for civil  servants  and the administrators should be loving and understanding in  their relations with the region's people,' Coskun said.    Coskun cited other measures foreseen by their report as the  formulation of urgent and lasting solutions to the problems of  the region by local administrations, continuation of investments  planned beforehand, encouragement of agriculture and animal  breeding, opening new jobs.    The report stressed that practices based on using force  would  not facilitate the resolving of the problem and the tolerant  attitude of the state would facilitate a solution sooner.</p>

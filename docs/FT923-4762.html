			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / International Company News: Santos offers ADollars 560m for Sagasco SANTOS, the Australian oil and gas group, yesterday offered ADollars 560m (USDollars 402.4m) in cash for Sagasco, a quoted oil and gas group controlled by the state government of South Australia. The offer follows the government's decision to sell a 56 per cent holding in Sagasco to help finance about ADollars 3bn in taxpayer support for the loss-making State Bank of South Australia. The offer values Sagasco shares at ADollars 2.63, a premium of nine cents over the share price before the government's announcement in July. Sagasco shares have been trading at about ADollars 2.75 recently. Mr Malcolm Kinnaird, Sagasco's chairman, said the offer seriously undervalued the company, and claimed it breached the federal Trade Practices Act, which regulates competition. However, analysts said the bid had a good chance of success, partly because Santos plans to retain Sagasco's workforce and float shares in its gas subsidiary, probably through a preferential allocation to South Australian residents. The proposals were welcomed by South Australian trade union, consumer and business interests, which feared the state government's decision to sell its holding would mean a transfer of control outside the state. There was no comment from the Trade Practices Commission, the federal competition watchdog, which had ex-pressed concern about the level of competition in the South Australian energy market. Mr Ross Adler, Santos managing director, said the bid would allow Sagasco to remain part of the 'commercial fabric' of South Australia. 'We think the price is fair and I think (that) from the community's point of view it's a worthwhile initiative,' he said. Control of Sagasco would significantly increase Santos's oil and gas interests in the Cooper and Eromanga basins in South Australia, which form the cornerstone of both companies' operations. Santos believes the basins hold sufficient reserves to sustain production at existing levels into the next century. Oil production from the region is in decline, but Santos said there was 'considerable potential' for further discoveries. It is to fund the acquisition through debt and said its strong cash flow would allow 'a substantial reduction' in gearing over the medium term.</p>

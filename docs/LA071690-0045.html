			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN ALBUM: IN THE ARIZONA DESERT, U.S. CUSTOMS' SECRET WEAPON AGAINST DRUG  TRAFFIC IS AN INDIAN TRACKER ON A HORSE;  </P> <P> STANLEY LISTON HAS SEEN EVERY SMUGGLER'S TRICK, AND USES A FEW METHODS OF HIS  OWN.  </P> <P> The desert sun is hot enough to bend spoons, but it's cool and dark inside the  adobe tack hut. Seven saddles hang from steel hooks on a ceiling crossbeam.  U.S. Customs Service Agent Stanley Liston hauls one down and throws it over the  back of a rust-colored horse.  </P> <P> "This is the one I ride if I think I'll have to chase somebody down," says  Liston, tugging on the cinch. "Coco's the fastest."  </P> <P> It's early afternoon on the Tohono O'odham Indian Reservation, 60 miles west of  Tucson. Today, like all days, the odds are good that drug smugglers are out  there somewhere in this rattlesnake-infested borderland. Liston's job is to  find them.  </P> <P> He is a Tohono O'odham Indian and a tracker. He grew up out here and knows  every village and wash. He spends his days on horseback or in a big,  four-wheel-drive truck.  </P> <P> His boss, Tom McDermott, special agent in charge in Arizona, says that Liston  is the best tracker in the Southwest. "His father did it and his grandfather  did it," McDermott observes. "How good is he? Let me put it this way: If one of  my children were lost in the desert, I'd want Stanley to be the one to find my  child."  </P> <P> The vast desert around here has become a drug-smuggling frontier. Packs of up  to 14 smugglers -- some on horseback, some on foot -- haul marijuana and  sometimes cocaine in bales bound with hemp-type ropes that double as shoulder  straps. The gangs move at night and sleep during the day.  </P> <P> As Liston bounces along a zigzagging trail that is a well-known smuggling  route, he studies the ground for signs that a gang has passed. He is six feet  tall and heavyset, with a strong build. He has a square face, a flat nose, cool  brown eyes, and dark skin that is leathery from a life in the sun. His thin  mustache is silver like his hair. After years in the saddle, his big legs bend  out at the knees. On his belt he carries a .45-caliber pistol.  </P> <P> Liston was born on a ranch three miles south of the Mexican border. His father  taught him tracking. "I can remember my dad taking me into the desert when I  was a little kid, teaching me what to look for," Liston says.  </P> <P> In 16 years with Customs, Liston has seen every trick the smuggling gangs use.  To shake a tail they sometimes rig their shoes with strips of carpeting and  walk backwards. They may walk barefoot over a dirt road or brush out their  tracks with broken branches.  </P> <P> Liston uses tricks of his own. When he finds a set of prints, he rides over  them on his horse or in his truck, then comes back the next day. If more tracks  have been laid over his, then he has a time frame. Depending on whether the  tracks are footprints or from horses, he can estimate how far a group has  traveled in the last 24 hours.  </P> <P> He memorizes the sole patterns of different makes of shoes. He puts a broken  greasewood branch in the cab of his truck and checks it after a day, then two,  then three, each time remembering the way it looks and feels. If he comes  across a greasewood branch on the trail, he knows how long it has been there.  </P> <P> And he keeps a log, marking the day and time that tracks were made, how many  horses passed, whether they were shod and the imprint of their hooves. By the  depth of its tracks Liston can estimate how much dope a horse was hauling.  </P> <P> In fact, Liston has been in on countless arrests.  </P> <P> Once he was trotting down a wash following a track and spotted three smugglers  sleeping. Two of them heard him coming and bolted. The third, a heavy sleeper,  didn't awaken until Liston was practically on him. The smuggler ran. Liston  galloped after him, twirled a rope over his head and lassoed him. "He stopped  when I got the rope round him," Liston says matter-of-factly. "If he didn't he  would've been jerked off the ground."  </P> <P> Liston, who has three daughters, views his work as more than a job. "The last  thing I'd want is for one of my kids to get involved in drugs," says Liston,  51. "It's a real problem here on the reservation, especially in the schools. In  the last three years it's gotten a lot worse."  </P> <P> In spite of all the sophisticated radar and other equipment law enforcement  uses to slow drug trafficking here, Customs agents say that one of the most  effective deterrents is a man on a horse, eyeballing the ground.  </P></p>

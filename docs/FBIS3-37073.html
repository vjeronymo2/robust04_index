			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ivan Hladki on speech by Prime Minister </F> Vyacheslav Kebich on 11 February; place not given -- Kebich's  remarks recorded]    [Text] [Hladki] Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich  delivered a speech to journalists today to clarify the statement  of the Belarusian Government on the recent events in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. These events concern every honest person,  the prime minister emphasized. Therefore, the Belarusian  Government decided to issue this statement, he stressed.    [Kebich] The Republic of Belarus is extremely concerned with  the latest explosion in Sarajevo on 5 February, which increases  the aggressiveness and escalates the tension of the conflict.  The Republic of Belarus, as well as all mankind, condemns the  forces who carried out this extremely cruel operation. Belarus  thinks that such actions cannot be currently tolerated,  especially as the issue of settling this crisis is the focus of  attention of the United Nations, the EC, and other regional  organizations as they look for political ways of settling the  dispute. Under these conditions, Belarus was and is  consistently and decisively adhering to nonforceful methods of  alleviating the crisis. The resolution of this conflict can  only be based on a thorough investigation and analysis of the  events that occurred, on joint consultations under UN Security  Council guidance and that of other regional international  organizations. Under the increased tension, the involved  parties should demonstrate extreme caution, political wisdom,  and, to the greatest degree possible, restrain from military  action. This policy will be the best option for the interests  of all the states of Europe and the world.    [Hladki] Then Vyacheslav Frantsevich added:    [Kebich] We proceed from the thought that if the air strikes  are carried out, this could actually divide not only Europe but  the entire world as well. Moreover, we had a sour experience  when World War I began with a similar conflict in the same  region. Therefore, the Republic of Belarus considers that this  conflict could be settled by peaceful methods. Even if these  events have not been excited by someone else, they would not  have happened at all. [sentence as heard]    [Hladki] Participants in this meeting also discussed a  political strike which is being prepared by certain political  circles in Belarus. Though the Cabinet of Ministers has already  published a statement on this issue, Vyacheslav Kebich stated:    [Kebich] The strike, which is scheduled for 15 February, is  of a purely political character. Its aim is to forcibly seize  power by using the people. Many people have already sorted out  this situation as to who heads this political action.  Industrial trade unions have behaved correctly, because they  understood the political character of this strike and [words  indistinct]. I must say that this political action is carried  by someone's very dirty hands. [Words indistinct] we try to do  everything to avoid incidents. We know that the main aim of  this political strike is to frustrate the government and trigger  various incidents. However, this will not happen. Rumors of  our readiness to use troops and special militia detachments are  a simple provocation and a lie that are directed first and  foremost against the government. I must say that I do not see  any danger for the government [words indistinct]. The  government is working and performing its functions. As for the  measures to prevent the strike, they can only be legal.</p>

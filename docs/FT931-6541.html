			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Leading Article: India's budget THERE ARE some welcome surprises in Mr Manmohan Singh's third budget, unveiled on Saturday. In floating the rupee and sharply cutting tariffs, he has gone further than expected and shown that he remains committed to reforming and opening up India's economy. Exporters and foreign investors should draw encouragement. However, the flourish of Mr Singh's delivery cannot disguise his dual purpose. Almost all the measures can be justified as extending the reform process. Cuts in excise duties were necessary. The fall in interest rates follows a reduction in inflation. Who can deny the need in India for spending on health, education and agricultural development if the fiscal austerity of the past two years now provides some leeway? But it is hardly coincidence that most of the measures are also vote-winners. Provided that fiscal discipline is maintained and that a sudden surge in imports does not wreck the balance of payments, it would be harsh to blame Mr Singh for adopting a more populist approach. The government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao needs to restore confidence in its direction and to boost national morale after the violence which has followed the destruction of the mosque at Ayodhya. Several important state elections are due and an early general election cannot be ruled out. The government's argument is that the past 20 months of cuts in the budget deficit, subsidies, inflation and the balance of payments deficit, coupled with the end of many bureaucratic hurdles in the way of investment, have provided a base from which to accelerate economic growth. Without increases in spending and cuts in duties, the budget deficit would be even smaller than the 4 per cent of GDP desired by the International Monetary Fund. This may be true. In the longer term, however, India's prosperity will depend on the government tackling the most sensitive issues: tax reform, subsidised lending, and the size of the public sector and of government itself. Mr Singh has skirted round the edges of these except in one important regard: his decision to inject capital into state-owned banks so that they can clean from balance sheets un-provisioned bad debts, tighten their management and prepare themselves to sell equity to the public. The problem of dismantling India's complex web of controls is that each step immediately provokes calls for the next. But this budget should not be judged severely. It is a substantial move forward, with important incentives for exports and for investors - in particular, the large cut in duties on imports of capital goods and tax incentives for investment in infrastructure projects, especially power generation. Faster economic growth will give the government greater popular support to push reforms further. Then the most difficult issues will have to be addressed.</p>

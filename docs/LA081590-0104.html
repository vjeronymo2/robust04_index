			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> COUPLE DROPS CLAIM OF NISSAN SPYING  </P> <P> An Orange County couple have dropped a novel lawsuit in which they claimed that  Nissan Motor Corp. planted an automotive spy in their home to study the habits  of middle-class Americans, attorneys said.  </P> <P> Stephen and Maritza French of Costa Mesa told their lawyer that they did not  want to endure the stress of pursuing the litigation. The decision was hailed  by Nissan, which had denounced the lawsuit as groundless as soon as it was  filed in Orange County Superior Court last December. Jon Anderson, Nissan's  lawyer, said Takashi Morimoto had indeed been conducting market research on the  car-buying habits of the American public, but he rented a room in the French  family home only to study English.  </P></p>

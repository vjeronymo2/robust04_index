			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S.F. PRO-CHOICE MARCH DRAWS 20,000  </P> <P> At least 20,000 people marched through the downtown area Sunday in a noisy  abortion rights demonstration that organizers called the largest "pro-choice"  gathering ever held in the Bay Area.  </P> <P> Police estimated the crowd at 20,000, but organizers of the "March for Women's  Lives" said more than 30,000 participated in the march and rally at City Hall.  </P> <P> Margaret Connell, 59, of Santa Barbara, marched with her 85-year-old mother and  30-year-old daughter. Their sign read: "Three generations for choice."  </P> <P> "I think what's before us is a choice of whether abortion is safe and legal or  whether abortion is unsafe and illegal," Connell said. "It's not whether  there's going to be abortion."  </P> <P> There was only a minor sprinkling of anti-abortion sentiment.  </P> <P> On the steps of Los Angeles City Hall on Sunday, pro-choice activists drew  outlines of women's bodies on the ground and placed red-stained clothes hangers  within each in what the Action Alliance to Keep Abortion Safe and Legal called  a "bleed-in."  </P> <P> Alliance spokespersons said they hoped "to remind the public of the increased  deaths which will result of our young women if the right to a safe and legal  abortion is lost."  </P> <P> Spokespersons added that they had spoken to city officials and agreed to pay  for the clean-up.  </P> <P> Sunday night, similar figures were rendered in front of The Times Mirror  building, across from City Hall.  </P></p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Banks count the cost of their biggest mistake: Free banking was widely welcomed. John Gapper charts its introduction - and the rush to abolish it MR BRIAN Pearse, chief executive of the bank that introduced free banking for customers in credit, is characteristically blunt about the wisdom of the move. 'Free banking was one of the two biggest mistakes ever made by high street banks,' he told a building society conference last week. Mr Pearse was chief executive of Barclays' US operation when Midland made its move in 1984, shortly followed by the others. The second mistake, in his view, was that banks did not co-operate to form a common cash machine network. The second mistake is likely to remain in place longer than the first. The problems created by not charging customers unless they go into overdraft  -and then imposing disproportionate charges - are increasingly pressing. All banks are now considering charges to offset the annual Pounds 4.5bn cost of services such as the 30 withdrawals each customer makes from cash machines. Abbey's disclosure yesterday that it is likely to introduce charging for customers in credit will accelerate plans. Mr Tim Melville Ross, Nationwide's chief executive, emphasised this week that the building society would follow with charges on its FlexAccount if the big banks started charging. The pace of competition has accelerated because falls in base rates have reduced earnings from banks' interest-free deposits. The reduced return on 'free resources' lost National Westminster Bank 0.57 percentage points of interest on its Pounds 67.3bn UK interest-bearing assets last year - or Pounds 380m. Mr Richard Goeltz, NatWest's chief financial officer, says the effect on profits was far lower because NatWest has 'hedged' its assets to reduce the overall effects of interest rate movements. But banks now think they could not sustain 'free' banking if base rates fell to 5 per cent. But charges are a sensitive matter. About 6,000 customers of Save &amp; Prosper, the small retail bank run by Robert Fleming, were directly affected when it introduced a monthly charge for customers whose current account balances fell below Pounds 1,000 at the end of the month. It has since lost 5,000 of them. Banks also anticipate a huge re-shuffling of accounts with an uncertain final outcome following the re-introduction of charges because 13 per cent of customers now hold more than one account. They may be prompted to choose between them by the prospect of paying charges on a little-used one. The ideal effect of re-introducing charges for banks would be that they lose customers who are not worth keeping. But this does not necessarily mean losing all the customers whose current accounts do not support the annual cost of between Pounds 35 and Pounds 75 for the provision of basic clearing services. Many such customers hold other products such as savings accounts which make them profitable overall. But no UK bank yet has the technology to calculate this figure, and apply charges accordingly. Mr Ian Lindsey, Save &amp; Prosper's banking director, says it is at least three years away. An alternative approach would be to charge customers per transaction to ensure that those who cost most pay most. The difficulty is that this is clearly unpopular. Abbey National's own research found that 88 per cent of people thought fees for 'core' transactions such as statements were unfair. This is likely to push banks towards imposing a flat-rate fee per quarter or month if a customer's balance falls below a certain level. This is dubbed the 'Disneyworld' charge - a single pass to all attractions - by Professor David Llewellyn, banking professor at Loughborough University. Prof Llewellyn argues, however, that a better approach would be a 'two tier' structure adopted by utilities which have high fixed costs attached to distribution networks, such as British Telecom. This means a fixed quarterly fee, plus additional charges for heavy use of some discretionary services. Prof Llewellyn, whose recent study of the subject has been read closely by Abbey, also argues that consumers should be given a choice of charging structures to soften the blow. But Abbey's decision makes it likely that the choice will come sooner than many bank customers might wish.  ------------------------------------------------------                 Current account charges  ------------------------------------------------------                               Cost per     Equivalent                               year of        annual                              12 months     percentage                              overdraft        rate                                pounds        pounds  ------------------------------------------------------ Pounds500 authorised overdraft  ------------------------------------------------------ 1 First Direct                  87            17.4 2 Halifax                       88            17.5 3 Nationwide                    90            18.1 4 Woolwich                      95            19.0 5 Abbey National               112            22.4 6 TSB                          172            30.9 7 Midland                      178            31.9 8 Lloyds                       202            36.1 9 R Bk Scotland                202            36.1 10 Girobank                    204            36.6 11 NatWest                     213            38.1 12 Barclays                    226            40.6 13 Co-op                       293            52.1  ------------------------------------------------------                               Cost per     Equivalent                               year of        annual                              12 months     percentage                              overdraft        rate                               pounds         pounds  ------------------------------------------------------ Pounds500 unauthorised overdraft  ------------------------------------------------------ 1 Halifax                      145            28.9 2 Woolwich                     155            31.0 3 Abbey National               172            34.4 4 Yorkshire                    270            48.1 5 Nationwide                   276            49.2 6 Girobank                     298            52.9 7 R Bk Scotland                339            60.5 8 TSB                          312            55.2 9 Co-op                        361            63.6 10 Lloyds                      442            76.8 11 NatWest                     528            90.9 12 Barclays                    556            95.2 13 First Direct                637           108.0  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

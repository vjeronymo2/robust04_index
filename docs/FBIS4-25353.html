			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yu Shichang (0151 0013 2490): "Liaoning's </F> Overall Economic Operation is Good, Some Conspicuous Problems  Need Serious Attention"]    [Text] Li Gejun, deputy director of the provincial planning  and economic commission, gave a report to the press on 24 May on  the provincial economic situation. He held: Liaoning's economy  has developed continuously, speedily, and healthily since the  beginning of this year, and the general situation is good.  However, there are some conspicuous problems in the economic  operation, especially the problems of the small increase in the  production of state-owned enterprises, the low overall economic  efficiency, and the increase in the enterprises that incur  losses. We should now correctly handle the relations between  development, reform, and stability.    When talking about the basic situation in the current  economic operation in Liaoning, Li Gejun first introduced the  good aspects. First, spring plowing has proceeded smoothly;  forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery are  brisk; and township enterprises continue to develop vigorously.  Second, state-owned enterprises have registered a fairly large  increase, and nonstate-owned enterprises have continued the high  growth rate. In the first four months of this year, state-owned  enterprises in the province achieved an output value of 38.19  billion yuan, up 4.1 percent from the corresponding period of  last year; and nonstate-owned enterprises achieved an output  value of 61.47 billion yuan, up 56.62 percent. Third, the  increase of fixed asset investment and the number of newly  started projects have been brought under control to a certain  extent. Fourth, market purchases and sales are stable, and the  chaos in commodity prices took a favorable turn. Fifth, the  export of local products has grown continuously, and the amount  of foreign funds actually used has increased. Sixth, the  increase volume of bank deposits outstripped that of loans, and  people's savings grew substantially, with the increase volume  10.66 billion yuan higher than that of the corresponding period  of last year. Seventh, the transition to the new tax system has  been stable, and revenue and expenditure have basically been  normal. According to the new tax distribution system, the local  financial revenue of Liaoning reached 3.207 billion yuan in the  January-April period, up 17.4 percent from the corresponding  period last year in terms of comparable standards.    In analyzing Liaoning's conspicuous problems in the economic  operation, Li Gejun emphatically pointed out: The production of  state-owned enterprises increased fairly little, and their  overall economic efficiency was not high. In the first four  months of this year, Liaoning's budgetary state-owned industrial  enterprises created 1.825 billion yuan in profits and taxes,  down 38.1 percent from the corresponding period of last year.  Enterprises which incurred losses outnumbered the figure  registered in the corresponding period last year by 275, and  66.1 percent of the enterprises suffered losses. Both the  number of enterprises that incurred losses and the amount of  deficits increased by a large margin as compared with last year.  In the first quarter of this year, 447, or 12 percent, of  Liaoning's state-owned industrial enterprises stopped production  totally or partly, and 275,000 staff members and workers were  involved.    One of the factors that contributed to the rise of the  losses  of the state-owned enterprises was the fairly conspicuous  contradiction in the shortage of funds, the unsmooth circulation  of enterprise capital, the irrational structure of the funds  that are tied up, the low efficiency in the use of funds, and  serious mutual arrears among enterprises. In addition, the  implementation of the new tax system has reduced the amount of  the capital that enterprises can use.    Another conspicuous problem in Liaoning's economic operation  is the large commodity price increases. Li Gejun held: The  current situation in commodity prices is very grim. After  increasing by 13.5 percent last year, Liaoning's retail price  index has continued to climb this year, rising by 19 percent in  average. Now the price rises have slowed down.    To effectively check price rises, Li Gejun held: Governments  at all levels and every department concerned should continue  their good job in monitoring, supervising, and inspecting  prices. Since late last year when the system of reporting the  main foodstuff prices every three days took effect, more than  2,000 cases violating the law on prices have been investigated  and handled. The departments concerned in Liaoning are  exercising administrative means to determine the price ceilings  for grain and edible oil. Economic means have been exercised by  12 cities and 21 counties to establish price adjusting funds for  nonstaple foodstuff in order to stabilize market commodity  prices.    After analyzing Liaoning's economic situation, Li Gejun  pointed out: Some contradictions and problems have been  alleviated to different degrees, but to resolve the  contradictions in the structure and mechanism which have formed  for a long time needs a pretty long process. The key is to  correctly handle the relations between development, reform, and  stability, to grasp the opportunity, to speed up development, to  better the regulation and control over economic operation, and  to promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy economic  development in Liaoning.    Zhao Xinliang, director of the provincial planning  commission, stated that reports on the economic situation in the  entire province would be held often in the future to increase  the transparency of Liaoning's economic operation through the  press.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The 125th anniversary of the first Constitution of  the Cuban Republic at War was observed on 10 April in Guaimaro,  the town that witnessed this historic event in Camaguey  Province. The Mambi reveille once again stirred the heart. It  summoned the independence movement of 125 years ago today. It is  a symbol of the unity of all Cubans around their Revolution and  Fidel.    Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the National  Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], stressed during the  political and cultural ceremony marking the 125th anniversary of  the Constitution, the heroism of those who in the midst of the  struggle selflessly fashioned a republic with altruism, for a  just fatherland and equality among men.    [Begin Alarcon recording] When on May Day, the ANPP special  session meets to examine the nation's main problems, it will be  rendering homage to our heroic and devoted workers, but it will  also be a tribute to those who founded the fatherland and held  its first meeting here. The ANPP session, like the one in  Guaimaro, will achieve a consensus of ideas for the struggle,  and in the midst of the struggle; from it, we will emerge as in  Guaimaro, with a renewed fighting spirit, with strengthened  unity, with a will bolstered to wage today's battle with the  energy, dedication, and dignity of the men of 1868.

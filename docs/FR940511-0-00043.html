The creation of new artificial reefs would be prohibited pursuant to the prohibition on alteration of, or construction on, the seabed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NOAA should prohibit the construction of pipelines on the sea floor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulation prohibiting the alteration of, or construction on, the seabed would prohibit the construction of pipelines on the sea floor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Issue: Cultural and Historic Resources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NOAA should prohibit moving, injuring, or possessing historic resources within the Sanctuary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NOAA agrees that it is necessary to protect and manage historical and cultural resources within the Sanctuary boundary. NOAA has included a prohibition on moving, removing, possessing, injuring, or attempting to move, remove, or injure these resources, except as resulting incidentally from traditional fishing operations. If NOAA determines that fishing activities are resulting in injury to Sanctuary historic and cultural resources, NOAA may amend the Sanctuary regulations to abolish the exemption for these activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations dealing with cultural resources fail to preserve the tribes' ability to control access to, and removal of, their cultural heritage. Therefore, NOAA should add a new &sect;925.5(a)(8) prohibiting: ``removal or attempted removal of any Indian cultural resource or artifact, or entry onto a significant cultural site designated by a tribal governing body with the concurrence of the Director, except with the express written consent of the governing body of the tribe or tribes to which such resource, artifact, or cultural site pertains.'' NOAA should pursue a cooperative agreement with the tribes to coordinate management of cultural artifacts of tribal significance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The MPRSA provides NOAA with the authority to control access to cultural artifacts within the Sanctuary thereby helping to ensure their preservation. Accordingly, anyone proposing to remove a cultural or historic resource must apply for and obtain a sanctuary permit from NOAA. NOAA acknowledges the interest of the coastal tribes in preserving their cultural heritage and, in particular, those cultural artifacts of tribal significance found within the Sanctuary. NOAA considers its objective of preserving the historical and cultural resources of the Sanctuary to be compatible with the coastal tribes' desire to preserve their cultural heritage. Therefore, NOAA has modified &sect;925.9(j) to state: ``The Director or designee shall obtain the express written consent of the governing body of an Indian tribe prior to issuing a permit, if the proposed activity involves or affects resources of cultural or historical significance to the tribe.'' NOAA has also added &sect;925.9(k) which states: ``removal, or attempted removal of any Indian cultural resource or artifact may only occur with the express written consent of the governing body of the tribe or tribes to which such resource or artifact pertains, and certification by the Director that such activities occur in a manner that minimizes damage to the biological and archeological resources. Prior to permitting entry into a significant cultural site designated by a tribal governing body, the Director shall acquire the express written consent of the governing body of the tribe or tribes to which such cultural site pertains.'' NOAA will enter into a cooperative agreement with the tribes and the State of Washington that clarifies the process by which permits will be granted to conduct research or salvage operations on historical and cultural resources of tribal significance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current management of cultural resources is agreed upon between the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the tribes. The BIA supports the tribes in the management of their cultural resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> See response to previous comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulation as proposed in the DEIS/MP is duplicative of State law. There already exists state and Federal antiquities acts to protect coastal archeological and historical sites that occur on or near the median high tide boundary. The State archeologist already coordinates archeological matters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The MPRSA is not duplicative of existing laws protecting historical and cultural resources. The MPRSA is more comprehensive in that it provides enforcement authority, including civil penalties, for the destruction or injury of historical and cultural resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Abandoned Shipwreck Act of 1987 gives states the title to certain abandoned shipwrecks in state waters. Under the MPRSA, NOAA has trustee responsibilities for abandoned shipwrecks and other historical and cultural resources within national marine sanctuaries, including those located in state waters, for the purpose of protecting them. NOAA will coordinate with State agencies to ensure that historical and cultural resources within the Sanctuary are protected, and that the policies affecting historical and cultural resources in State waters are consonant with the policies in the Federal waters of the Sanctuary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Issue: Discharges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Ocean Dumping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NOAA should not prohibit the use of dredged material disposal sites off Grays Harbor, Willapa Bay, the Columbia River, or on the north jetty and breakwater of the Port of La Push.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

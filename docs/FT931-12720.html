			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Soviet coup trial date set THE leaders of the August 1991 Soviet coup are to be freed from jail but prevented from leaving the country pending a trial set yesterday for April 14, Leyla Boulton writes from Moscow. Of the 12, seven have already been released from custody, and the remaining five were allowed to go home yesterday on the grounds of illness. An incompetent prosecution of the case, plus growing popular sympathy for the former Soviet leaders, suggests that the trial may not even go ahead in the end.</p>

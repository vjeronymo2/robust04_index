			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTO THE NIGHT: QUINCY JONES FETE IS A STAR MAGNET  </P> <P> The Scene: Party Monday night at the Roxbury restaurant and club thrown by Time  Warner executives Steven Ross and Nick Nicholas to launch the Quincy Jones  Entertainment Co., a joint venture of Jones and Time Warner Enterprises. It was  part reception, part dinner, part hype. In the words of one bartender, "This  isn't a soiree; this is a fete."  </P> <P> Who Was There: All the Time Warner brass, including but not limited to Ross,  Nicholas, Bob Daly, Rob Friedman and Terry Semel. Among the 550 others were  Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw, Harrison Ford and Melissa Mathison, Clint  Eastwood, Paula Abdul, Danny Glover, Mary and Irving Lazar (who explained the  A-list crowd: "Big talent attracts big talent"), Mike Ovitz, George Schlatter,  Tina Sinatra, Brooke Shields, Ashley Boone, Lou Gossett Jr., and Henry Mancini.  </P> <P> The Buzz: What will Quincy's new company do with Time Warner? Whatever Quincy  wants. Films, TV, plays, music -- the way the Time Warner execs talk, if Quincy  wanted to open a Taco Bell with singing waiters, they would say, si. "He's one  of the great geniuses of our time," Ross said. It was all young love in bloom.  </P> <P> Dress Mode: Relatively business-like conservative. One fashion writer  explained: "If this was New York, it would be what they wore to work. But this  is L.A., so they went home and got dressed."  </P> <P> Chow: Served buffet-style, there were two extensive menus that included grilled  salmon, smoked ham, Southern fried chicken, short ribs, collard greens and  seafood saffron rice. The food was bountiful; the trick was finding a place to  sit.  </P> <P> Quoted: "I circled the field a long time," Quincy Jones said. "It took 57 years  to get here. Then the deal took 14 months to put together."  </P> <P> Best Compliment: "When you have a body of work like Quincy has, you begin to  appreciate it for all its facets," Harrison Ford said. "It's just the pure  energy of goodness of soul."  </P> <P> Glitches: The line for valet parking extended all the way up Sunset Boulevard  to somewhere near the Nevada border. Retrieving cars was equally difficult. "I  think they parked my car in the Central Valley," one guest said.  </P></p>

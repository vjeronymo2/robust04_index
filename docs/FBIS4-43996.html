			<p>BFN     [Text] On the Greek island of Corfu today, the heads of  state of the 12 EU member countries will look for Jacques  Delors's successor. There are three candidates, and one of them  is the favorite: Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, who is  supported by Germany and France.    Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez supports Dutch Prime  Minister Ruud Lubbers, a Christian Democrat:    [Begin Gonzalez recording] We have already expressed our  opinion. We think that all the candidates are very good. If  we have to prefer one over the other, however, I have promised  to support one Lubbers. I think, however, that Dehaene would do  the job perfectly well, and I also told Brittan that we do not  hold any grudge against him either. [end recording].</p>

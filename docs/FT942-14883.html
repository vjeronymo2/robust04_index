			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): GAN - Other Companies Analysts have long been braced for a weak set of results on Tuesday when GAN, one of France's largest insurers, unveils its 1993 figures. GAN has been hit by the competitive state of the French insurance sector and by the exposure of its banking subsidiaries to the property market. Mr Tim Dawson, insurance analyst at Lehman Brothers, anticipates a recovery in net profits to around FFr750m (Dollars 129m) for 1993 from 1992's dire total of FFr402m.</p>

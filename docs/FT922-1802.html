			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Letter: Tax free reserve plan would aid Lloyd's members to meet losses Sir, So the hawks on Lloyd's Council have prevailed over the doves; there is to be no assistance to hard-hit Names, but the four-year, rolling stop loss scheme is to be enhanced by making it operate if a Name loses 80 per cent rather than 100 per cent of his limit. This will encourage existing Names, who have been rattling their chains, and it may even encourage some new ones to join. There is, however, one concession that the government should consider granting as soon as possible. In recent years the Inland Revenue has mounted a concerted attack on Lloyd's syndicates and Names on the basis - totally without foundation as it has turned out - that the syndicates were over-reserved. So aggressive has been the Inland Revenue's approach that it has disputed or disallowed syndicate reserves as excessive one year, only to find after 12 months that these have proved inadequate. For the Name these disputes have meant delay in the recovery of tax due him at a time when cash is all important. Also, the results of this prolonged attack have been harmful, since few syndicates have had the reserves in place to cope with a bad year or series of bad years. The government should introduce immediately a catastrophe reserve for members of Lloyd's: under such a scheme a member could immediately transfer 100 per cent of his profits free of tax to the catastrophe reserve on the basis that it can only be withdrawn to meet losses, that if withdrawn otherwise full tax and higher rate tax are deducted at source. This should encourage new members, place Lloyd's on an equal footing with its continental competitors, enable the Inland Revenue to transfer some of its staff to more productive work, preserve an institution that earns much foreign exchange and ensure that syndicates have no need to be over-reserved because reserves could be held in future more profitably (for all concerned) in the hands of the member.

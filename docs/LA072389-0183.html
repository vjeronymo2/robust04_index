			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> WHAT TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN CHOOSING A TREE;  </P> <P> WEIGH FACTORS SUCH AS HEIGHT, SUITABILITY TO CLIMATE, EASE OF CARE AND  APPEARANCE.  </P> <P> Choosing the best tree for your yard is a bit more complicated than just going  to the nursery and buying whatever looks healthy and attractive. That cute  little tree that looked so good in the container at the nursery may grow into a  huge monster in a couple of years.  </P> <P> You can avoid problems that homeowners most frequently encounter by asking the  following questions: Is this tree suited to our climate? When mature, will this  tree be too large for my yard? Does this tree have destructive or invasive  roots? Is this tree messy, dropping leaves, flowers or fruit? Is this tree  susceptible to any diseases or insects?  </P> <P> You will also have to decide if you would like an evergreen or a deciduous  tree, which loses its leaves every autumn. One beautiful tree can increase the  property value of your home significantly, as well as create a warmer, more  inviting appearance. I always recommend choosing a tree you really like, rather  than just purchasing whatever tree seems suitable for a particular area of your  yard.  </P> <P> The 10 trees listed below have proven to be ideally suited to home landscapes  in Southern California. They were chosen for their outstanding beauty, ease of  care and freedom from the common tree problems.  </P> <P> RIVER TEA TREE: Melaleuca leucadendron. Usually multi-trunked, this evergreen  grows to 25-30 feet tall. It is native to Australia and Papua New Guinea, has  attractive white bark and soft foliage. A perfect-size tree, this Melaleuca  doesn't get too big, stays relatively narrow, yet is large enough to serve as a  dominant tree in a landscape. It can also be used as a screen (plant trees 6-8  feet apart), or to create a woodsy backdrop in a small yard. It is drought  tolerant.  </P> <P> PEPPERMINT TREE: Agonis flexuosa. Another Australian native, it grows to 25-35  feet tall and is hardy to 25 degrees. The leaves have a slight minty fragrance  when crushed. Small, white flowers appear in spring to summer. With this tree  you get the soft, delicate, weeping effect similar to a weeping willow, only  the Agonis is evergreen, drought tolerant and stays small.  </P> <P> EUROPEAN WHITE BIRCH: Betula alba. A favorite because of its lovely white bark  and graceful appearance, the Birch is deciduous and grows to about 50 feet.  Both male and female trees bear small, cone-like catkins. It is tolerant of all  soil types, including soggy soils.  </P> <P> QUEEN PALM: Arecastrum romanzoffianum. The Queen Palm is hard to resist with  its elegant, feathery leaves. It is used in a wide array of landscape designs,  and is particularly stunning with Spanish or Mediterranean style architecture.  The Queen Palm is a rapid grower to about 50 feet tall.  </P> <P> SWEET GUM: Liquidambar styraciflua. This is the tree for spectacular full  color. The Liqidambar has maple-like leaves and spiny, round fruit in winter,  which will need to be raked occasionally. It is deciduous and grows to about 50  feet tall. Plant in front of a south window to help cool the house in the  summer and to remind you what season it is when fall arrives. Suitable for  planting in a lawn, Liquidambars will tolerate lots of water or can go for  weeks between waterings. Liquidambars are used extensively as street trees.  </P> <P> EVERGREEN ELM: Ulmus parvifolia. This elm has a lovely weeping, arching form  and grows to about 60 feet tall. A fine, large specimen tree, not overwhelming,  which benefits from occasional pruning, especially when young.  </P> <P> MIMOSA OR SILK TREE: Albizia julibrissin. The mimosa is deciduous and fast  growing to about 30 feet, with arching branches that form an umbrella-like  canopy. It has light-green, fern-like foliage and beautiful, showy pink flowers  in summer. The variety 'Rosea' is the hardiest and has the brightest flowers.  The flowers will drop and make a pink carpet; if planted over a patio you will  need to sweep occasionally. I think the flowers are worth it. Mimosas thrive on  summer heat and require ample water.  </P> <P> STRAWBERRY TREE: Arbutus unedo. This handsome evergreen grows to about 30 feet  tall, is drought tolerant and is ideal for small yards or as an accent tree.  Compact forms make wonderful container trees in a patio or entry. 'Compacta' is  a compact form. 'Elfin King' is even smaller, growing to a maximum of 5 feet.  White flowers and red or yellow fruit appear in fall to winter. Fruit is edible  but not very tasty.  </P> <P> SOUTHERN MAGNOLIA: Magnolia grandiflora. This glossy evergreen is native to the  southern United States and is prized for its huge, fragrant, 8-10 inch white  flowers. The Southern Magnolia is tolerant of all soil types and grows to about  80 feet tall.  </P> <P> The dwarf variety 'St. Mary's' grows to only 20 feet and has the same  spectacular flowers. Some people complain about the litter of fallen leaves and  seed pods; the good news is they only fall a few at a time, are large, stiff  (leaves are almost plastic-like) and are thus quick and easy to clean up.  </P> <P> JAPANESE BLACK PEAR: Pinus thunbergiana. A versatile pine, native to Japan, it  grows to about 20 feet tall and is easily pruned to achieve different looks. It  is often used for an Oriental effect, as a bonsai tree, or as a single specimen  tree.  </P></p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Disposals by quango praised THE NATIONAL Audit Office, the watchdog on public expenditure, bestows a rare accolade today in its report on the sale of the property portfolio of English Estates. The audit office says the sale of 266 factories, offices and workshops between April 1990 and March 1993 realised Pounds 158m, a figure generally in line with pre-sale valuations. English Estates is a quango whose main role is to manage business premises in England's assisted areas. Yields compared favourably with regional averages in spite of the unattractive location of some of the property and the depressed state of industrial and commercial property. Sales to sitting tenants were the most successful, the audit office finds, achieving prices significantly higher than with other types of sale. Open-market sales appeared more successful when property was marketed selectively, a process which gave bidders improved prospects of success. No provisions to take back profits on resale were imposed since this was thought likely to reduce the proceeds of the sale. The audit office found no evidence of significant reselling of property, although one of two onward sales did achieve a significantly higher price. The procedures adopted by English Estates were 'prudent and generally in accordance with best practice', the office says. It warns against flooding the market with such property, however, particularly when other public bodies are disposing of land and buildings. Although the property portfolio was to have been sold by April this year, the state of the property market has meant that less than half was disposed of then. The Department of Trade and Industry has now set a deadline of April 1996 for the sale of the remaining 204 properties worth Pounds 208m. English Estates: Disposal of Property. HMSO. Pounds 8.95.</p>

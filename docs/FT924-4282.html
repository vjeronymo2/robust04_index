			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: MP claims Maastricht filibustering will be a problem THE LENGTH of speeches on aspects of the government's Maastricht treaty legislation may present Mr Michael Morris, deputy speaker, with a serious problem, one MP claimed yesterday, as the Commons debate over the detailed provisions of the European Communities (Amendment) bill ground into its second day. As Mr Bill Cash, the Tory MP, stood by to resume his 2 1/2-hour contribution of Tuesday night, Sir Russell Johnston, a Liberal Democrat spokesman, raised the issue of long speeches - the first of 11 points of order which began the debate. In the event, however, the Stafford MP resumed his seat after a mere 14 minutes.</p>

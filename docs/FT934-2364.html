			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / International Company News: Laidlaw lays plans to sell stake in ADT Laidlaw is issuing an innovative debt instrument that opens an avenue for the Ontario-based waste and transport services operator to dispose of its 24 per cent stake in ADT, the Bermuda-based security and vehicle auction group. Laidlaw is ADT's largest single shareholder, but the two companies have had a fickle relationship since Laidlaw's former chief executive Mr Michael DeGroote showed his confidence in ADT chairman Mr Michael Ashcroft five years ago by investing in his company. But Laidlaw has recently signalled its wish to dispose of the ADT stake, which it considers a non-core investment. Mr Ashcroft is due to step down as a Laidlaw director after next month's annual meeting. The terms of the Dollars 280m debenture issue give Laidlaw the choice of converting the securities into ADT shares after five years, converting them into Laidlaw stock, or redeeming them for cash. In the meantime, debenture holders will share any increase in ADT's share price to a maximum of Dollars 12.60, a 40 per cent premium on the existing share price of Dollars 9. Any appreciation above Dollars 12.60 would be exclusively for Laidlaw's benefit. The crux of the issue's structure is that Laidlaw believes ADT shares are presently under-valued. It is confident that ADT will benefit from a refinancing package, and from bank covenants which preclude it moving away from its core businesses of security services and vehicle auctions. 'When they do appreciate, we want to share in that appreciation,' an official said yesterday. Laidlaw presently values ADT on its books at Dollars 11.69 a share. The issue does not prevent Laidlaw, however, from selling its ADT shares before the conversion date, if it receives an attractive offer. The debentures, which are underwritten by a group of Canadian securities dealers, will be issued in two tranches, one denominated in Canadian dollars carrying an interest rate of 6.75 per cent, and the other in US dollars with a coupon of 6 per cent. The maximum yield, if ADT shares climb to Dollars 12.60, would be 12 per cent a year.</p>

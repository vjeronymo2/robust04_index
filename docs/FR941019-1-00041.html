			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Eligibility for and Conditions To Use of Safe Harbor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Should all issuers be eligible for the safe harbor or only certain issuers that satisfy specified conditions, such as sufficient reporting history and/or public float to ensure a market following? What other conditions might be appropriate? Should issuers be required to opt-in or opt-out of a safe harbor alone or in combination with the foregoing? If so, what should the opt-in/opt-out conditions be? Should an issuer be required to specify that it is seeking the protection of the safe harbor by making a public filing, or by stating with regard to each safe harbor-eligible statement (where the issuer chooses the safe harbor's protection), that the statement is being made subject to the safe harbor, or by otherwise providing a ``bespeaks caution'' or other cautionary language? How could this condition be met (or policed) for oral statements or written statements made outside of Commission filings? Should the burden of proof be shifted from the plaintiff to the defendant corporation, generally or with respect to certain types of disclosures,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , written statements outside Commission filings, oral statements, etc.? Should shareholders be permitted, or required to vote on the availability of any safe harbor? If so, should shareholders be permitted to approve or authorize more extensive safe harbors than those that would otherwise be available at the election of the issuer?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Should the safe harbor require disclosure of key assumptions because that information is uniquely within the control of the issuer? If assumptions were required to be disclosed along with the forward-looking information, how would this affect the judicial treatment of forward-looking cases? For example, if assumptions were required to be disclosed, would it make it easier for courts to evaluate motions to dismiss cases on a procedural motion and/or impose sanctions for the bringing of frivolous suits? Would this requirement be more or less effective coupled with any proposed litigation reforms?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Should the safe harbor be unavailable (or provide greater or absolute protection) if an insider, or specified insiders, traded (or no insider, or specified insiders, traded) within a specified period where the insiders(s) avoided a loss or made a gain (or failed to do so) based on the dissemination and subsequent correction of the forward-looking statement?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Elements of the Safe Harbor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters should outline and discuss each element of an effective safe harbor. In this connection, should the safe harbor set forth a separate definition of materiality differing from that otherwise applicable under Commission rules and case law? Should the safe harbor impose and/or specify parameters for a duty to update or correct? Should the safe harbor require that a private plaintiff establish that he or she actually relied on forward-looking statements? Should a new definition of scienter be included in the safe harbor,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , by eliminating recklessness as an element of proof? In answering this question, commenters should discuss separately implied and express rights of action, as well as Commission and private actions. Should a safe harbor include judicially developed concepts such as the ``business judgment rule,'' ``bespeaks caution'' doctrine and/or any other judicial approaches discussed in the release? What treatment should the safe harbor give to information that the issuer does not disclose that may be relevant to evaluating the forward-looking statement?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Private Actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Should the safe harbor distinguish between Commission enforcement action and private actions? Should the answer to the foregoing question depend on whether the underlying cause of action is express or implied? Would the Commission be able to compensate through enhanced enforcement for any reduction in the number of private suits in this area resulting from adoption of a particular safe harbor? How would any limitation on private actions, whether directly imposed or incorporated in a safe harbor, affect the Commission's longstanding policy of promoting private actions for fraud as a necessary supplement to Commission enforcement?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Should private litigants be required to pursue any antifraud claims arising from statements covered by a safe harbor in a nonjudicial forum_for example, through arbitration or some other form of alternate dispute resolution? Some commentators have suggested that a safe harbor should be adopted that would permit private antifraud actions to proceed only if the Commission first brings a successful enforcement action for fraud. Commenters are invited to address the merits of this suggestion and means of its implementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Issuer Duties Under the Safe Harbor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Should an issuer be required to update any forward-looking information? If so, for how long? Should the answer turn on whether disclosure is mandated by the Commission's disclosure requirements ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , MD&amp;A) or voluntary? Should an issuer be required to compare projections to actual results to provide information as to the reliability of the projections? Should an issuer be required to disclose and/or to file assumptions or the basis for a statement, as now required for issuers that elect to provide option grant values calculated under the option pricing models? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 90 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 90 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Item 402(c) of Regulation S&hyph;K, 17 CFR 229.402(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Should the safe harbor require a registrant to correct forward-looking information rendered false or misleading after its initial disclosure? Should this duty extend only to information filed with the Commission?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Should a duty be imposed on issuers to update and/or correct forward-looking information disclosed by others? Should the safe harbor expressly provide that there is no duty to update and/or correct statements made by others? Should the safe harbor include a duty to update and/or correct statements only if the issuer becomes sufficiently ``entangled'' with the third party? If so, should the safe harbor delineate those acts or omissions that would support a finding of entanglement?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Registered Investment Companies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Is the forward-looking information that might be disclosed by registered investment companies,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> projections of fund performance, inappropriate for the protection of the safe harbor because it is contingent on the performance of the securities markets, and therefore subject to greater uncertainty and frequency of change? Do any other characteristics of registered investment companies warrant separate treatment of their forward-looking disclosure for purposes of the safe harbor or, more generally, should such disclosure by registered investment companies be afforded any protection under a safe harbor? Comment also is specifically invited as to whether distinctions should be made among different kinds of registered investment companies ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> open-end and closed-end, unit investment trust and management) for the purpose of encouraging forward-looking disclosure and providing safe harbor protection? In light of the fact that investment companies, unlike most other public companies, are not currently required to file current reports (Form 8&hyph;K) or quarterly reports (Form 10&hyph;Q), commenters should address how projections or other forward-looking information by investment companies would be revised or updated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

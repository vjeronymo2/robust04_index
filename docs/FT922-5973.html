			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Bond tells of his price for Rothwells rescue MR ALAN BOND (pictured left), the bankrupt Australian entrepreneur, told a court yesterday that he asked for an ADollars 20m (Pounds 8.3m) success fee for helping to arrange an ADollars 370m rescue of Rothwells merchant bank hit by the 1987 global stock market crash. But he said there was no agreement on the fee before he discussed the rescue with Mr Brian Coppin, a West Australian businessman who had been asked to contribute to the rescue. Mr Bond, the former chairman of Bond Corporation Holdings, denies dishonestly inducing Mr Coppin to deal in securities by concealing the existence of the fee. Giving evidence on the third day of his trial in the Western Australian district court, Mr Bond said he was in Rome discussing a property deal when he was informed that Rothwells merchant bank was facing liquidity problems. Mr Bond said he discussed the Perth-based bank's problems by telephone with Mr Laurie Connell, the chairman, and agreed to return to Australia to help organise a rescue in which the state government would participate. He said the stock market crash had created a climate in which the failure of Rothwells could have had an impact on other Australian companies, including other banks. Rothwells collapsed in November 1988 and is the focus of a Royal Commission inquiry into relationships between politicians and businessmen in Western Australia. More than 20 people face criminal charges, including Mr Connell. Mr Bond said he also discussed the rescue with Mr Brian Burke, the Labor premier. Bond Corp agreed to sub-underwrite ADollars 37.5m, subsequently reduced to ADollars 25m, of a ADollars 150m share issue to recapitalise Rothwells. Bond Corp helped Wardley Australia, the stockbrokers, put together a refinancing deal in which Mr Connell contributed ADollars 70m in subordinated debt, backed by the share issue. The state government guaranteed a ADollars 150m loan facility provided by National Australia Bank. Mr Bond said he asked Mr Coppin to sub-underwrite the share issue for ADollars 20m, later reduced to ADollars 8m. He said he believed the agreement was 'a sound investment', partly because of state government support. Mr Bond said the suggestion that Bond Corp should be paid a fee was raised by Mr Peter Beckwith, Bond Corp's managing director. Mr Bond said he suggested ADollars 20m, but Mr Connell said that was 'a bit much'. Mr Connell said he would suggest a fee of ADollars 16m to other Rothwells directors, and report back to Mr Beckwith, Mr Bond said. He heard no more about the fee until two weeks later, when he was told Rothwells had agreed to pay ADollars 16m. Mr Bond said Mr Coppin made no complaint when told about the fee. He said he had concealed nothing and had not been dishonest. The trial is expected to conclude later this week.</p>

As part of this research program, NIST has since 1970 awarded Precision Measurement Grants to scientists in U.S. academic institutions for significant, primarily experimental research in the field of precision measurement and fundamental constants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Award Period <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> NIST is now accepting applications for two new grants in the amount of $50,000 per year to be awarded for the period October 1, 1995, through September 30, 1996 (fiscal year 1996.) Each grant may be renewed for up to two additional years; however, future or continued funding will be at the total discretion of NIST based on such factors as satisfactory performance and the availability of funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

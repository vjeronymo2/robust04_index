			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARTS ADMINISTRATORS: THE COST OF CALLING THE TUNES  </P> <P> Thomas R. Kendrick, president of the Orange County Performing Arts Center, and  his wife, Judith O'Dea Morr, the center's general manager, are among the  highest-paid administrators of multipurpose arts facilities in the nation, with  combined compensation and benefits of more than $300,000.  </P> <P> Individually as well as collectively, Kendrick and Morr's paychecks and other  compensations rank just behind those of the two highest-paid administrators at  New York's Lincoln Center and ahead of those at the Music Center of Los Angeles  County and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington,  according to a survey by the Times' Orange County Edition.  </P> <P> This is despite the fact that of the seven facilities surveyed, the Orange  County center has the fewest stages and ranks near the bottom of the list in  the number of paid, ticketed performances per season and the number of  full-time employees.  </P> <P> Francis L. Dale, who served until June of 1988 as president of the Los Angeles  Music Center, was listed as earning $175,000 a year with no benefits package,  according to the most recent information filed with the California Registry of  Charitable Trusts in Sacramento. Esther Wachtell, who served as executive vice  president until she succeeded Dale, was listed at $75,000 a year. She has been  replaced in that position by James Black, whose salary is not yet available.  </P> <P> Kendrick and Morr say they are fairly compensated, and center board members say  that at the amount Kendrick and Morr are paid, they are a bargain.  </P> <P> Information filed with the Internal Revenue Service and the California Registry  of Charitable Trusts, required for all tax-exempt organizations, indicates that  Kendrick was paid $184,246 in 1988 and received a benefits package worth an  additional $6,543, primarily for an annuity plan. Morr, who came to Orange  County with Kendrick from Washington, where both worked as top administrators  at the Kennedy Center for nearly a decade, is the second-highest-paid staff  member at the Orange County center, reporting earnings of $108,678 and a  benefits package of $3,749 for 1988.  </P> <P> At the centers surveyed, none of the job descriptions for the top two  administrative slots precisely mirrored Kendrick and Morr's. In principle, all  chief executives are responsible for everything that goes on in their  institutions. But according to Kendrick, this is almost literally true for  himself and Morr in Orange County.  </P> <P> Unlike most of the other executives surveyed, Kendrick said, the couple is  responsible for day-to-day programming, administration, coordination with such  regional groups as the Pacific Symphony and Opera Pacific, finance and budget  controls, construction planning and supervision, marketing and media relations.  (This despite their staff that includes a director of marketing, a director of  development and a controller.)  </P> <P> Also on the couple's list of responsibilities is fund raising, which now means  presiding over a greatly expanded development department and an ambitious  capital campaign to construct new theaters.  </P> <P> At Lincoln Center, although the operating budget is more than twice that of the  Orange County center, president Nathan Leventhal is primarily responsible for  day-to-day operations of the six-theater complex. Leventhal earned $205,865 and  received a benefits package of $20,785 in 1988 for a total of $226,650,  according to documents filed with the State of New York. Financing is handled  by Donald Warner, one of the center's six vice presidents and the  second-highest paid administrator, who earned $108,765 and received benefits  worth $14,750, totaling $123,515.  </P> <P> Ralph Davidson, chairman of the Kennedy Center, oversees programming,  fund-raising and administration. He is paid $125,000 per year and provided with  a car, according to Laura Longley, the center's director of public affairs. He  succeeded Roger Stevens, who took no salary. Much of the actual programming is  done by Marta Istomin, the center's artistic director, whose 1988 salary has  not yet been filed with the IRS.  </P> <P> The two administrators who come closest to Kendrick and Morr in the range of  day-to-day responsibilities are Lawrence J. Wilker and Art Falco at Playhouse  Square Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Their combined compensation for 1988 was  $213,230 -- $89,986 less than Kendrick and Morr's combined total.  </P> <P> But the size of the compensation packages is misleading, Kendrick and Morr said  in separate interviews, because the figures encompass such things as pro-rated  moving and housing compensation and "significant" out-of-pocket contributions  to disability, health and retirement plans to maintain the generous level of  coverage they were provided at the Kennedy Center (but which is no longer  provided to administrators there).  </P> <P> "I think we're fairly paid," Kendrick said.  </P> <P> Morr said that she, too, is "quite comfortable with my level of compensation."  </P> <P> "We didn't move here for pay," but for the challenge of building and shaping a  new institution, Kendrick added. He also said he prefers to be judged "on the  basis of the jobs we were brought here to do, and the jobs we have done."  </P> <P> On that basis, Center board members agree that the couple's compensation is not  out of line.  </P> <P> By many standards used to judge such facilities, center officials and board  members said, the center is a success: it has reached what they consider to be  "full bookings" three years ahead of schedule (center officials say that  virtually every day not taken up by one of 266 events this year is needed for  load-in/load-out time); more than 640,000 people attended performances in 1988,  compared to 607,000 in 1987; paid attendance for events programmed by Kendrick  and Morr (as opposed to booked into the center by others) was 85%, 20 points  above the national average; and paid attendance for all performances since the  center's opening has been 80%, also well above the national average.  </P> <P> "At almost any price, they're a bargain," agreed Roger Johnson, head of Western  Digital Co. of Irvine and the Center's vice chairman for the corporate  campaign. "They came to a brand-new area with a brand-new facility. I don't  think anything speaks better than the end result," in terms of paid attendance  and the quality of the presentations.  </P> <P> Center chairman Henry Segerstrom, whose fortune was based in part on  agriculture, said that comparing Kendrick and Morr's compensation to those of  other arts center heads is like comparing "apples to apricots." For one thing,  lower salaries in Cleveland may go a lot further than higher ones in Orange  County.  </P> <P> Differences are especially pronounced, Segerstrom said, between a facility such  as the Orange County center, which depends entirely on private funding, and  those that receive a large segment of financial support from government.  </P> <P> In order to judge the cost effectiveness of Kendrick and Morr's compensation,  "you have to look at the total executive payroll," Johnson agreed. "We are not  terribly heavy on staff at the center."  </P> <P> However, in addition to Kendrick and Morr, the Orange County center reported  that 27 other employees earned more than $30,000 in 1988. The Los Angeles Music  Center listed only 11 in that pay range. The corresponding figures at other  centers ranged from 2 at the Wortham Center in Houston to 106 at Lincoln  Center.  </P> <P> It is difficult to find an exact comparison for the $73-million Orange County  center, which has one stage -- Segerstrom Hall -- and 65 full-time employees.  The current annual budget is $15.4 million. Apart from its tax-exempt status,  the center has no governmental support. There were 266 paid, ticketed  performances in 1988 at the Orange County Performing Arts Center.  </P> <P> A county facility with three halls, the Los Angeles Music Center has 400  employees and operates on $75 million a year. There were 976 paid, ticketed  performances at the Music Center during the 1987-88 season.  </P> <P> Kendrick and Morr also are, by far, the highest-paid arts administrators in  Orange County, according to information provided to the IRS. David Emmes and  Martin Benson, the founders and artistic directors of the South Coast Repertory  Theatre, earn $65,000 each; Louis Spisto, executive director of the Pacific  Symphony, earns $67,000, and Kevin Consey of Newport Harbor Art Museum earns  $85,000.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Yevtushenko report: "Death on Wheels"] </F>   [Text] On Sunday evening a bus on the highway near Nazran  went up in flames like a torch. The bus was packed with  passengers, suitcases, and, worst of all, cans of gasoline and  in seconds was turned into a crematorium furnace. Out of the 58  passengers, 31 died in the fire. The rest suffered various  burns of various degrees of severity. Eleven are hovering  between life and death.    According to information from the temporary administration  of  the state of emergency zone, this incident is an unfortunate  accident and is not connected in any way with the  Ossetian-Ingush conflict. However, it is assumed here that the  affair is linked to Ossetian terrorists who were taking revenge  for the murder of Marat Khugayev and Boris Kabisov, inhabitants  of Sunzha, a village in Ossetia's Prigorodnyy Rayon, the day  before.    Incidentally, their death has already had tragic  consequences. Last Thursday a detachment of troops assigned to  the temporary administration were traveling in two armored  personnel carriers while combing the forest where Khugayev and  Kabisov were killed. The soldiers stumbled across a group of  armed strangers. When told to stop, the latter replied with  automatic fire and grenades. A battle ensued. The gunmen  escaped into the heart of Ingushetia. Aleksandr Grishko, a  compulsory-service servicemen of the Russian Federation Internal  Troops, was killed; two staffers of the Ingushetia MVD [Ministry  of Internal Affairs] -- Sergeant Yevkoyev and Junior Lieutenant  Dobriyev -- were seriously wounded.    On Saturday administration troops, carrying out the  leadership's order to clear the security zone of the opposing  sides' armed subunits, demanded the removal of an Ingush  permanent observation post located on Ossetian territory. The  reply was sporadic fire. An operational investigations group of  the Russian MVD has investigated all these incidents.</p>

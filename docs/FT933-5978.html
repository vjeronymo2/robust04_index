			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Ministers favour sale of British Coal in five sections BRITISH COAL is to be offered for sale in five separate sections under proposals favoured for adoption by the government. The latest plans were drawn up in the face of strong opposition by British Coal, which wants the sale in one or two parts to give the industry a strong negotiating position in dealing with the electricity generators, its main customers. Ministers want to inject maximum competition into the marketplace. They are expected to announce plans for privatisation in the next month, although details of any break-up have yet to be finalised. Under the favoured proposals the five sections would be based around Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, the north-east of England, Scotland and Wales. The two largest chunks would be Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire. The other three areas would each have only a small number of deep mines  - British Coal has only one pit left in Scotland. The smaller areas will be sweetened for the private sector by the inclusion of open-cast operations. The north-east sector, for example, could include the Stabswood open-cast site in Northumberland. The proposed division into five units will please private-sector companies, such as RJB Mining, which have been lobbying for a break-up. In Scotland there is strong support for the country's coal resources to be broken off from the rest of British Coal. It is believed ministers will not place restrictions on how many sections each private-sector company can bid for. This opens up the possibility that a large part of British Coal will be owned by one company after privatisation. Decisions on the number of mines to be closed before privatisation have still to be made. Few analysts believe more than 15 British Coal pits are viable in the long term. It is thought that private-sector operators will have to match terms and conditions offered by British Coal. Miners break Libyan link, Page 8</p>

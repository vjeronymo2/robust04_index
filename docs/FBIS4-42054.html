			<p>BFN     [Text] The Georgian Prime-Minister Otar Patsatsia has  categorically denied Abkhaz reports about the beginning of the  mass uncontrolled arrival of Georgian refugees in the Gali  region. At a meeting with the local administration and law  enforcement officers in Zugdidi on Wednesday he said false  reports are spread to undermine the normal return of refugees.    The prime-minister said that the most important stage after  the appearance of peace-keeping forces in the security zone is  the return of refugees. Any obstacles to the process should be  removed. Everything is going to be done in keeping with the  four-sided agreements.</p>

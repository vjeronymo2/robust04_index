			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: Ascom puts lack of control as reason for loss ASCOM, the Swiss tele-communications equipment group, blamed inadequate internal controls for the belated discovery last month of SFr61m (Dollars 41m) in extraordinary losses at its German subsidiaries. The discovery forced the group to announce last week that it would suffer a 1992 net loss of SFr46m and pass its dividend rather than achieve the roughly SFr25m net profit forecast a few days earlier in a letter to shareholders. Mr Leonardo Vannotti, president, accepted the full blame for the debacle, which has caused Ascom shares to lose about 14 per cent of their value. However, he said at the group's annual press conference yesterday that no member of group management would be resigning. The losses arose in the group's cable television and mobile radio subsidiaries in Germany. Its cable franchises, purchased only three years ago, have required heavy investment in infrastructure, but so far have attracted few subscribers. The mobile radio business was left with large stocks of technologically out-dated products. In both cases, internal reporting procedures were inadequate and it was only after line managers were replaced in March that the need for large write-offs was discovered by external auditors. Mr Vannotti said group management had been working hard on improving internal controls at Ascom but it was difficult to find the right people for these positions. The group, the product of a 1987 merger of three traditional protected suppliers to the Swiss PTT, had not needed strong controls in the past. Both Mr Vannotti and the board believed that the group's new strategy to expand in specialised global niches was still the right one and they were confident that the recent reporting failure would not recur. It was also clear that group managers had not deliberately misled investors. Therefore, there was no point in any of them resign-ing. Mr Vannotti said he expected the group to return to profit this year.</p>

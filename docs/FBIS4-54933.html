			<p>BFN     [Text] President Arpad Goncz advises that on 8 May, voting  citizens should compare their experiences of the past four years  with the promises heard during the campaign, and that they  should then vote on this basis. According to the head of state,  when deciding about the individual candidates, what voters must  weigh up is whether they have served well the interests of their  immediate communities and whether their private lives are in  order.    The president of the Republic, in his speech on radio  tonight, thought it important to stress that no one can question  the voters' choice of party.    Arpad Goncz hopes that as a result of the elections, a  government will be formed which enjoys the trust of the majority  of citizens, but which also takes minority opinions into  consideration, one that fosters the national traditions and that  is ready for interest coordination, and one that strives for  social justice.    The head of state affirmed that for his part he will do  everything in order that Hungary should have a parliament that  is ready to serve and a government that observes freedom, the  well-being and prosperity of every person, as well as the vital  interests of all Hungarians.</p>

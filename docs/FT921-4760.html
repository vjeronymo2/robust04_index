			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Old favourite emerges from the depths  -London Markets BLINK, and you missed it. In the past four weeks, shares in WPP, the advertising agency, have risen from 42p to 91p, a rise of 117 per cent. WPP warrants, a highly geared bet on the stock, have risen more sharply still, to close at 7 1/2 p. Warrant-holders have nearly quadrupled their money, on paper, in less than a month. WPP benefited from two developments: the winning of two big advertising contracts in recent weeks, and the growing feeling among US investors that advertising volumes are about to pick up. WPP owns the J Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather advertising agencies, so it stands to benefit greatly from any such upturn. Other media businesses have risen, but by much less. The shares of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, which also has big US operations, has risen 20 per cent in the same period, to close at 16 1/2 p yesterday. The Media sector of the FT-Actuaries All-Share index has risen by 5 per cent in four weeks, outperforming the overall market by 4 per cent. Why has WPP so far outstripped its rivals? Partly because of its big account wins, no doubt. But also because its finances are so weak, after the borrowing necessary to acquire these agencies, that there has been a longstanding question-mark over whether it would survive at all. An inflow of new business that ensures its future transforms it from a potential disaster to a company that should be valued on the basis of its strong brand names and market position. Once investors shift their view in this way, the spectacular decline in WPP's stock over the past five years - which, as the chart shows, quite dwarfs the recent run-up in price - is transformed from a liability to an asset. Instead of being a constant reminder of the depths to which the company has sunk, it becomes a beacon of the value once attached to it. No one expects those heady valuations to return, of course, but even a partial recovery is a tantalising prospect. Hence the speed with which WPP has leapt ahead. That may prove illusory: the rise in price may now have run its course, and the company's financial outlook is still uncertain. The general lesson, however, is that the biggest leaps in price in difficult times such as these are made by some of the companies over whom the clouds once hung darkest. One one condition: economic recovery must arrive before the bailiffs. This week it looked likely that in the US that race is entering its final furlong, with the bailiffs behind by a nose. In the UK, it was still uncertain just how much further there is to the finishing line. One indicator turned from optimism to pessimism during the week: short-term UK interest rates, which had reflected an expectation that base ruts would be cut around the time of next week's Budget, rose on Thursday. At their new level, they indicated that the market is worried that a weak pound will preclude any early cut in rates. The stock market, which had been displaying a certain amount of bounce earlier in the week, reacted badly: the FT-SE index closed on Thursday at 2538.3, down 20.1. On Friday, it edged a little lower, closing at 2533.1, down 29.0 on the week. Companies reporting their results this week continued to report no signs that trading is improving. In other respects, the results season is proving more or less true to expectations. Warburg Securities' running calculation of how big companies' actual results compare with its analysts' end-January predictions shows that pre-tax profits for industrials are smack in line with estimates, at 6 per cent down on last year, so far. Industrials' post-tax earnings are slightly better, at 10 per cent down compared with an expected 11 per cent. Industrial companies are paying dividends 10 per cent higher than a year ago, compared with an estimate of 9 per cent. Non-industrial companies are doing slightly worse, dragged down, presumably, by the banks. Two unexpected trends, as the market braces itself for an election, were the apparent lack of impact of political news and individual opinion polls; and a reappearance of takeovers and rights issues, despite the uncertain weeks that lie ahead. The lack of political excitement is doubtless partly attributable to the UK's membership of the ERM, which locks economic policy firmly into a rigid framework of consensus. It also stems, however, from a growing belief that the most likely outcome of the election is a hung parliament, and that therefore one day's opinion polls do not matter so much. The rights issues include some big ones: Pounds 333.5m from Bowater, the packaging group, to finance two acquisitions; and Pounds 516m from Thorn EMI, to buy Virgin Music, Richard Branson's privately-owned record company. Bowater's rights issue was priced at 605p, a 27 per cent discount to the market price of its shares. Thorn EMI's more complex offering involves partly-paid loan stock units that convert into one ordinary share if the deal goes through and the stock becomes fully paid; and into 0.4 shares if the deal falls at a regulatory hurdle and the stock is never paid up. Each unit is priced at 650p, a 17 per cent discount to the market price. Despite the size of the rights issues, the shares of both companies reacted well to the news. Bowater dropped only 3p on the day and closed the week at 785p, up 17p. Thorn EMI, which had fallen from 809p a week ago to 785p on Thursday night, as the Virgin deal became increasingly likely, leapt when the rights issue was announced. It closed on Friday at 806p, down only 3p on the week. There were special reasons for Thorn's strong performance, not least a promise of an immediate tripling of Virgin Music's profits. But the healthy reaction to the rights issues is another sign the market is taking the pre-election excitements calmly.</p>

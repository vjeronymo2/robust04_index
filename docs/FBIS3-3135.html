			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- Three executives of  China's enterprise giants in petroleum, automobile and iron and  steel industries regarded the introduction of a new property  rights system for enterprises as the core in establishing a  modern enterprise system.    And the system should also be managed through various forms  and by managerial professionals, executives of the Daqing  Petroleum Administration, the Changchun No. 1 Automobile Factory  and the Anshan Iron and Steel Works said.    The reform of state-owned enterprises and the establishment  of a new modern enterprise system are one of the pivotal and  catchy juncture in China's reform of its economic structure as  well as a "hot spot" of the ongoing second session of the Eighth  National People's Congress (NPC). As deputies, executives of  the three industrial giants are attending the session.    NPC deputies from enterprises have unanimously agreed that  the establishment of a modern enterprise system is the  fundamental way to invigorate China's large and medium-sized  enterprises but the process will be "big project" and hard  efforts are needed.    After a dozen years of experiments, China has finally  charted  the orientation of establishing such a system for state-owned  enterprises, featured by a clear definition of property rights,  explicit responsibility and rights, separation of administration  and enterprise management and a scientific management.    Qian Dihua, mayor of Daqing city and deputy director of the  Daqing Petroleum Administration, said the establishment of a  modern enterprise system lies in the introduction of a new  property rights system or a system of property rights of  enterprises as legal entities to separate investor rights of the  owners and property rights of enterprises as legal entities.  This would help rid the state of its boundless responsibilities  for enterprises which stems from the dilemma of the status quo.  In the status quo, operators are not legally liable though they  are legal persons.    As one of the country's mainstay enterprises in the basic  industry, Daqing is willing to be selected to lead the industry  in introducing the new system on a trial basis. In line with  the policies mapped out at the third plenary session of the 14th  Communist Party Central Committee late last year, mainstay  enterprises in pillar industries are encouraged to introduce a  shareholding system with state controlling a lion's share of the  shares while allowing collective or individual capital to make  up the rest. The Daqing oilfield has contributed half of the  country's oil production since 1976 when its production bit the  50 million-ton mark.    Unlike the Daqing oilfield, the Changchun No. 1 Automobile  Plant has already begun the experiment of the shareholding  system and has basically completed an inventory and check of the  stockpiles and capital of the enterprise. This year the plant  is expected to complete the transition from the current  structure to a three-tiered corporation structure: parent  corporation, share-controlling company and subsidiary companies.  To ensure the smooth transition, Geng Zhaojie, director of the  plant, is now also the chairman of the board of directors of the  First Automobile Group Corporation.    Geng said, one of the effective approaches to establish the  modern enterprise system is to decide who represent the state to  manage the assets. What enterprises are worried about most in  this regard is the trusting of government departments as  representatives of the state-owned assets to manage the  enterprises, Geng said. The outcome of the trusting will make  it impossible for enterprises as legal entities to hold the  responsibility for property rights.    In his personal view, his parent corporation should be in  the  position to represent the state to manage and operate  state-owned assets. Geng's view seems to be a common  acknowledgement among entrepreneurs that investor companies,  share-controlling companies or large enterprise groups using  state fund as its main source of capital, can serve as  representatives of state-owned assets, rather than government  departments, in the form of legal entities.    With an annual turnout of 240,000 cars, trucks and other  vehicles, the No. 1 Automobile Plant is now ranked among the 500  biggest enterprises in the world. The plant is planning to  manufacture one million vehicles by the year of 2005.    Li Huazhong, general manager of the Anshan Iron and Steel  Works, calls for diverse forms of modern enterprise system. He  said the representatives of the state-owned assets should be  made up by professionals in enterprise management in the  capacity of "members of the board of directors" or "supervisors".    Leading the industry in the country, the Anshan Iron and  Steel Works produced more than 8.5 million tons of iron and  steel products last year. The works began experimenting the  shareholding system as early as 1986 and so far has established  several subsidiary companies in its efforts to find jobs for  surplus laborers.</p>

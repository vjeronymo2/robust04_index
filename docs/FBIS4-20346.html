			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhang Liqun (1728 4539 5028), with discussion </F> involvement by Wang Jian (3769 1696), Zhang Liqun, Zhang Chuntai  (1728 2504 3141), Liang Hua (2733 5478), Yang Takan (2799 1129  0170), and Fan Caiyao (2868 1752 5069), affiliated with the  State Planning Commission, Economic Studies Institute,  Comprehensive Research Office; edited by Jiang Dongsheng (5592  2639 3932): "Analysis of 1993 Economy and Forecast for 1994"]    [Text] The year of 1993 was another one of high growth for  China's economy, as well as a special one in which economic  growth saw greater fluctuation. We project our 1993 GNP at a  comparable-price growth rate of over 13 percent, making 1993 our  year of highest growth since reform and opening. After July  1993, as Central Committee Document No. 6 was issued and its  macroeconomic regulation and control policy was applied, our  industrial growth rate went into a sharp slide, with its monthly  growth rate slipping from June's 30.2 percent to 16.4 percent by  October, for a high drop of 13.8 points. But after October, as  large amounts of credit funds were put into circulation, our  industrial growth rate rebounded again sharply, reentering a  high-growth state, with a much shorter regulation and control  time-lag, which was the first year since reform in which such a  situation had arisen. We hold that our 1993 economic growth  features evolved in the setting of the dual-conversion of our  economic growth style and economic system, showing that China's  economic growth had entered a new period.  <H5>  I. An Analysis of Our 1993 Economic-Growth Course and Its </H5> Causes    Our 1993 economic-growth course can be divided roughly into  two stages: January through June, with sustained high growth;  July through November, with a reentry into high-speed growth  after experiencing a quite large fluctuation.    1. An Analysis of Our January-Through-June Sustained High  Growth and Its Contributing Factors    On the heels of our 1992 economy having entered a period of  overall high growth, our 1993 economy saw sustained high growth  in a state approaching the verge of overheating. Our industrial  output value monthly growth rates were 9.8 percent for January,  32.9 percent for February, 26.1 percent for March, 25.2 percent  for April, 27.3 percent for May, and 30.2 percent for June. This  data shows that except for the monthly growth rate changing  sharply from January to February due to the impact of the Spring  Festival, our overall growth trend was steadily upward, topping  30 percent by June. Meanwhile, our capital goods prices rose  quickly, with retail prices rising steadily to top double digits  by June at 13.9 percent. Our investment, financial, and  circulation activities quickly heated up to show a chaotic  order, all of which indicated that our whole economy was nearing  the brink of overheating.    The cause of this growth course was the dual-conversion of  our growth style and economy. Since 1992, China's economic  growth had been conspicuously characterized by investment-demand  pull with heavy industrial growth taking the lead. In contrast  to its features since reform of consumer-demand pull with light  industrial growth taking the lead, this shows that China's  economic-growth style had undergone a great change. The  setting for this was a change in our development stage. After  passing through the consumer makeup-lesson stage, by the 1990s  we were faced with a higher level of consumer and a changed  consumption structure, in which China's industrial structure was  beginning an all-out upgrading, with particularly faster change  in secondary industries, mostly industry. Our industrial scale  and overall economic scale correspondingly expanded rapidly.  This upgrading resulted in a large amount of equipment  replacement, establishment of new industries, and rapid  qualitative and quantitative improvement of our infrastructures  and basic industries, thus causing large-scale investment  growth, as well as rapid growth of the investment-product  production sector -- heavy industry. This stage was one of  rapid heavy industrial growth that certain industrialized  nations had experienced.    Table   Month           January     February     March     April     May      June   State                       64.1         70.7      68.9      69.3     70.7  Investment  Accumulated  Growth Rate   Retail          18.9        11.1         18.5      25.4      27.3     28.4  Commodity  Sales Growth  Rate   Heavy           15.6        36.3         30.2      28.4      28.8     30.5  Industrial  Growth Rate   Light           3.9         29.3         21.9      21.9      25.7     29.7  Industrial  Growth Rate      It was precisely because we had entered this stage that we  saw the sustained rapid growth from 1992 to 1993, which growth  had profound development-stage causes. Our growth reality for  the first six months of 1993 shows that this stage's features  are exceptionally clear. 1) Investment grows much more than  market consumer demand. 2) Heavy industrial growth remains  higher than light industrial growth. The following are some  pertinent data:    As to system reform, since the last half of 1992,  [production-] factor markets had entered a period of rapid  growth, with capital and real estate markets beginning to form  and steadily expanding in scale, providing more channels for  investment-capital formation, and supporting rapid investment  growth. Our development-stage and system conversions combined  to jointly drive our economy into a high-growth state.    Due to the development-stage factor, savings and investment  funds increased sharply, causing overall financing to expand  rapidly, while factor-market development was still in a  preliminary stage, with planning and order not yet evolved.  Expanded overall financing drove money markets to expand  rapidly, while the sharp growth of land supply and demand drove  the real estate market to expand quickly. Under such  conditions, money and real estate markets that were in an  initial growth stage unavoidably experienced chaotic order,  causing an abnormal rise in money and real estate prices,  rapidly heating up our whole economy to approach the brink of  overheating.    2. An Analysis of Our July-Through-November Economic  Fluctuation and Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Results    Faced with imminent overheating, the Central Committee  issued  Document No. 6 in July, taking a series of macroeconomic  regulation and control steps, such as rectifying our financial  order, inventorying underway projects, and rectifying  real-estate and development-zone investment, which brought fast  results. Our industrial output value growth rate receded from  June's 30.2 percent to 25.1 percent for July, falling steadily  through August and September to 16.4 percent by October. In  September, directed at enterprise operating difficulties and  strong local demand for faster growth, the center took steps to  put more money into circulation, also bringing quick results.  By November, our industrial output value growth rate had  picked back up to 18.9 percent, and was in a  further-acceleration trend. So prompt and effective  macroeconomic regulation and control is a phenomenon that merits  conscientious summing up and analysis. We would note the  following about it.    1. This phenomenon shows that the central government has a  clearer understanding of China's economic operating laws. Its  regulation and control timing choice was more fitting, as our  economic growth at the time was climbing, while supply-shortage  restraints were not yet evident, and factors, such as our  foreign exchange balance and key raw-material inventories, still  had a certain supportive capability. In contrast to 1985 and  1988 when supplies were short and potential exhausted, with  growth already causing a series of glaring conflicts, this  choice of timing to take regulation and control steps showed a  certain amount of foresight, preventing sharp economic  volatility. Its regulation and control dynamics were also more  appropriate, certainly not completely forcing our economy into a  trough, but rather aiming at supporting all economic-growth  terms for a timely promotion of economic recovery to high-growth  momentum. These two examples show that the central  government's macroeconomic regulation and control skills are  much better.    2. The quick results from these regulation and control steps  show that the basic terms of China's economic operations have  undergone a significant change. From a development  perspective, as pointed out above, in growth through the form of  mostly investment-demand pull, in contrast to that through  mainly consumer-demand pull, demand regulation and control  capability is much greater. And from the angle of system  reform, as factor markets grow, the fundamental impact of  markets on economic operations grows sharply, with economic  growth being guided more by all market signals, and the decisive  impact of financial activities on the economy growing more  prominent. It was precisely in such a setting that the mostly  financial regulation and control policy measures brought such  quick results. This shows on one hand that as  demand-regulation capability grows, macroeconomic regulation and  control results and significance rise sharply, while showing on  the other that in China's macroeconomic regulation and control,  financial regulation and control measures are dominant.    3. This macroeconomic regulation and control still depended  mostly on administrative means, such as exercising financial  regulation and control mainly through curbing all fundraising  activities and interbank borrowing, which actually returned fund  supply channels to banks. Bank regulation and control of  overall funding relied mainly on direct control of the amount of  basic currency put into circulation, thus controlling the money  supply, instead of using benchmark interest rates to regulate  and control monetary demand. So as to regulation and control  means and conduction mechanisms, it was still  nonmarket-oriented. This situation conflicts to a certain degree  with our market-system development and further change in our  regulation and control grounds.    This review of the state of our 1993 economy shows that  China's economy, as to either development stage, system base, or  regulation and control capability, has entered a period of  higher level and more mature development.  <H5>  II. An In-Depth Perspective of Our 1993 Economic Situation </H5>   Despite the above assessment, our 1993 economic growth  involved certain profound conflicts that must not be overlooked.    1. The Relations Among Our Growth, Investment, and Trade  Structures and Reported Problems    In our 1993 economic growth, the fastest growing industries  were ones such as motor vehicles, building materials,  metal-cutting machine tools, communications equipment, and  petrochemical products; but in investment growth, the fastest  growing industries were ones, such as building materials,  financial insurance service trades, real estate, transportation,  and commercial beverages. In contrast to our fastest growth  industries, this is quite inconsistent. On the other hand, as to  our trade import structure, our fastest growing industries were  ones, such as motor vehicles, rolled steel, metalworking machine  tools, textile machinery, rubber and plastics manufacturing  machinery, wire telephones or telephone switchboards, and  refined oil, basically consistent with our domestic  economic-growth structure.    This shows that in contrast to domestic demand changes, our  growth and trade-import structures responded quickly to meet  demand, or market changes, while our investment structure did  not respond flexibly enough. In other words, our  market-guidance capability toward investment remained  inadequate. In addition, our imperfect market development with  a certain misguidance phenomenon, as well as the large impact of  local government behavior on investment activity, were also  factors in the lack of coordination between changes in our  investment and market-demand structures. In such a state,  market demand guided growth-structure change, while our growth  structure could not effectively guide our investment structure  through changes in industrial profit rates. From a long-range  view, the impact on our domestic supply structure followed  market-demand change, causing a sharp conflict of uncoordinated  supply and demand structures, which could be supplemented only  by trade imports. Such a state put great pressure for a time  on our future balance of international payments, as well as  steadily lowering the international market share of domestic  enterprises. As this resulted in a reduction of pull by  domestic market development on our domestic industrialization  progress, this was a problem of farreaching impact which, when  relying mainly on domestic markets to promote industrialization,  required full attention. In the short term, the excessive  pressure being put mainly on our international balance of  payments showed that the state of our international balance of  payments had an exceptionally crucial impact on our overall  domestic supply and demand and structural balance, and thus on  our domestic prices and even our whole economic growth.    Genuinely resolving this problem meant rationalizing our  investment-finance mechanism. On one hand, this required  further improving our capital goods market, by adjusting  upstream product prices, and standardizing and improving markets  for factors, such as funds, in order to bring into better play  the role of factor prices in guiding resources and funds. On the  other, it meant a larger central government investment dynamic,  by giving adequate investment inclination and support to fields  in which markets had no impact, such as infrastructures, basic  industry, and particularly high-tech forerunner industries.    2. The Widening of Our Urban-Rural Income and Market Gaps  Indicated the Resurgence of a Glaring Binary Structural Conflict.    Preliminary estimates for January through November are that  real urban incomes corrected for inflation were up 13.9 percent  from the same period in 1992; for the first three quarters, real  peasant income corrected for inflation was up 3.7 percent from  the same period in 1992. So our urban-rural income growth-rate  gap reached 10.2 percentage points, which gap had been only 5.7  points in 1992.    Along with this wider income gap, our urban-rural market gap  also widened. For the first 11 months of 1993, our retail  commodity sales growth rate was 30.1 percent for urban markets  but 18.3 percent for rural markets, for a gap of 11.8 points;  corrected for inflation, this gap was 9.5 percent. Around  about 1992, these two gaps were respectively 7.8 points and 3.3  points.    This indicated the resurgence of a glaring binary structural  conflict in China's economy, or a rewidening of our urban-rural  market and economic gaps, whose impacts were similarly  far-reaching.    a. The impact on our market development. As rural markets  still made up over 50 percent of China's retail commodity  market, the slowing of peasant income growth and our rural  market-development rate was bound to affect the expansion of our  overall retail commodity market. b. The impact on domestic  enterprises. In particular, the rural market pull was mainly on  domestic labor-intensive and traditional consumer goods  industries. Changes in this part of the market would have a  great impact on the development of these domestic industries.  This situation was particularly disadvantageous to  domestic-market enterprises that were subject to eversharpening  competition, particularly to state enterprises and a large  number of our midwestern township enterprises. As Chinese  industry was currently still lacking in capability and  competitiveness to meet domestic high-tech market demand, there  was room for improvement in its urban market share. In  addition, our rural market inadequacy of the time left Chinese  enterprises sharply restricted by overall domestic-market demand  growth. c. Rural market change was having a clear impact on our  rural industrialization. As a key market of rural industry was  the rural areas, this was going to further impact peasant income  growth, putting it into an unhealthy cycle. d. Rural market  change and the widening urban-rural economic gap also had a  farreaching impact on our agricultural development and overall  economic stability. This problem needed solved in ways, such as  rapidly upgrading urban industry to concede a part of the market  to rural industry, and increasing exports of rural  labor-intensive products. In the short term, as the existence of  this problem affected mainly the effective expansion of consumer  goods markets, as well as the market share of domestic  enterprises, it could be held that domestic consumer-goods  market demand, as to domestic enteprises, was in a state of  stable growth, so would not exert a strong pull.    3. State-Asset Reorganization and a Solution for State  Enterprises Was a Matter in Urgent Need of Resolution.    Our 1993 economic fluctuations reexposed the problems  existing in state enterprises and state-asset operations, such  as low operating efficiency, unmarketable products, poor market  competitiveness, economic cooling, triangular debt, product  overstocking, and growth rates down sharply, which showed up  first in state enterprises. These problems were essentially  ones that state enterprises and state assets could not adjust to  properly in the course of excellence through market competition,  leaving their structures and situations severely unsuited to  market-demand changes and competition needs. So we had to  reorganize state assets to complete our structural-adjustment  mission, while speeding up our conversion of state-enterprise  operating forces to meet market-competition needs. The existing  problems in our state enterprises and state assets left China's  economy with very little capability to sustain regulation and  control. Once growth rates fell, this would put great pressure  on government, as well as sharply discounting our overall  economic growth efficiency, to lower our economic growth quality.    4. Our Factor-Market Development Remained Poor, With a Lack  of Market Order, and Still Unsound Capability To Regulate  Factor-Disposition.    Our 1993 economic-order chaos showed up conspicuously in  factor markets, with economic regulation and control also being  expressed mainly as rectification of factor markets. As we  generally controlled factor-market scale to reduce the  factor-market impact on the disposition of [production] factors,  factor markets remained unable to improve quickly or develop  fully. But in view of our socialist market economy reforms,  which required the establishment of a complete market system, as  factor markets played a key role in the market system and the  market-disposition of resources, as well as being a crucial  grounds for the new form of macroeconomic regulation and  control, factor-market development and improvement was  imperative. A matter that required attention was the relations  between an appropriate resolution of factor-market development  and the conversion of macroeconomic regulation and control  style, to ensure an effective macroeconomic regulation and  control capability.    Analysis of these problems shows that while the Chinese  economy has entered a period of more mature growth, deeper  development and system conflicts remain, affecting the sound  development of our whole economy. Along with our dual growth and  system conversion, the time is gradually approaching to resolve  these deeper conflicts, so that we are facing a crucial period  for reform and development.    III. An Evaluation of Our 1994 Economic Trends    The determining factors in our 1994 economic trends are  roughly as follows:    Demand-expansion potential, including investment growth and  domestic market demand expansion; supply-growth potential,  including farm-product supply growth, and basic and key raw  material supply-growth capability; our international balance of  payments, reflected mainly in import-growth capability;  inflation trends and economic and social sustainability. These  are separately analyzed and projected below.    1. An Analysis of Our Demand-Expansion Prospects    We hold that our major demand-expansion area in 1994 will  remain investment, which is interrelated with our conversion of  growth style and change in development stage. Our investment  demand in 1994 will be affected by investment aspirations,  investment fund sources, and investment-fund supply  channels. Investment aspirations will be related to our current  development stage, about which all parties will remain  exceptionally exuberant. For a detailed analysis, our 1994  planned investment is 1.4-1.45 trillion yuan, up an estimated  16.7 percent from 1993, basically suited to our GNP growth rate  of about 10 percent for the first time in years of planning,  showing that the Central Government has made quite large plans  for increased investment. Local governments will remain burdened  on one hand with the problems of employment, shortage  limitations, and invigoration of local economies, while being  further heavily motivated by 1994 reelection activities on the  other. In addition, as our overall economic policy will be for  the whole nation to seize the opportunity for faster  development, local government investment aspirations will also  remain exceptionally strong. Enterprises faced with great  pressures from market change, equipment upgrading, and the  establishment of new-product production lines will also take  active steps to invest more. In general, the aspirations of  all parties to invest more will remain very strong. Investment  fund sources will also be more abundant. Current estimates are  that 1993 was our year of fastest income growth and most savings  growth, with our savings deposit balance at 1.46 trillion yuan  by the end of November, up 30.6 percent from the same period in  1992. In addition, 1994 will see still better terms for a  further increase in our use of foreign investment. Our real  use of foreign investment had reached $22.7 billion for the  first three quarters of 1993, and is expected to top $30 billion  for all of 1994, to be a major funding source for investment. In  addition, once our exchange rates are merged in 1994, some of  the foreign-exchange funds that flowed abroad in 1993 will flow  back to China, also adding to our investment funding sources.  The current problem is in investment fund channels. On one  hand, local government investment fund channels are down in the  new investment-finance system, with limitations on channels,  such as credit fund regulation authority, the two basic  regulation funds, and fundraising. On the other, once the  central government sets up the policy-investment bank, it may  have trouble smoothly dovetailing it with its former  investment-control sector, which problem might affect  investment-fund supply. But we hold that investment sources will  be abundant, with strong investment aspirations by all parties,  so that investment demand will remain very high.    As to consumer demand, 1994 will see a stable growth trend.  For a detailed analysis, urban consumption will grow faster,  particularly in large cities. Certain new consumer hotspots  will further expand. For instance, areas, such as housing and  interior decoration, telephone and communications equipment,  new-age home electronics, and private automobiles, will all  grow faster. But as rural markets will be in a slow trend,  with the purchasing power in small and midsize cities and of  low- and middle-income city dwellers for new consumer goods  remaining obviously inadequate, consumer markets will generally  remain in a state of sustained, steady growth roughly similar to  1993.    In general, demand in 1994 will maintain a brisk growth  momentum pulled by investment. We predict for 1994 an  investment growth rate at prvailing prices of still over 30  percent, with retail commodity sales growth remaining at about  20 percent. As domestic demand will remain very brisk, our  1994 exports will still maintain their low-growth trend and,  despite the impact of factors, such as the merging of exchange  rates, are predicted to have a growth rate still not higher than  10 percent. This analysis shows that as to demand pull, 1994  will still have high economic-growth conditions.    2. An Analysis of Our Supply-Growth Prospects    The product supplies closely connected to demand expansion  are farm products, transport capability, power, and key  production raw materials. Overall, 1993 remained a year of  bumper agricultural harvests. While our cotton and sugar crop  yields were lower, our farm product supplies in general still  had a certain potential.    Our railway transport capacity grew slowly in 1993, below 3  percent, probably indicating inadequate railway transport  growth. So our 1994 transport capacity will be one of supply  shortages on top of shortages. As 40 percent of our railway  transport capacity goes to coal shipping, transport-capacity  limitations will directly affect our energy growth, which will  be quite a large restraint on our 1994 economic growth.    In 1993, our rolled steel supplies grew very quickly. By  the end of November, despite our sustained high economic growth,  our rolled steel inventories were still up 21.5 percent from the  same period in 1992. But our 1993 rolled steel supply growth was  due to exceptional factors: a) Iron and steel enterprises,  induced by market prices, put their equipment into overload  production, with rolled steel output up 16.7 percent for the  first 11 months, making 1993 another year of high growth on the  heels of that in 1992. b) Guided by market prices, imports  grew excessively. By the end of November, rolled steel imports  had reached 25.81 million tons, up 370 percent from 1992. In  1994, as all of these factors will have a much lower impact,  with iron and steel enterprise growth potential no longer large,  and sharp import growth also restricted by foreign exchange, our  rolled steel supply growth rate will be back down sharply from  1993.    This analysis shows that in 1994, our supply-growth  potential  will be lower than our demand-expansion potential. From a  supply-growth perspective, this will support a GNP growth rate  of only about 10 percent, leaving a definite gap with our  demand-expansion momentum.    3. An Analysis of Our International Balance of Payments  Prospects    This involves mostly an analysis and forecast of our trade  balance and foreign exchange reserves. We have already  analyzed above our 1994 export growth rate, which will be lower.  But our import growth will remain faster, due on one hand to  our great domestic market-expansion potential (investment and  consumer demand), and on the other to the large gap between our  domestic supply and demand structures. So in 1994, our imports  will grow faster than our exports, with our trade  foreign-exchange balance remaining in a deficit state, and our  foreign exchange reserves down further. By the end of November  1993, our state foreign exchange reserves were at a level of  enough exchange to pay for two and one-half months of imports.  If this declines further in 1994, it will very quickly fall  below the warning line.    Our state of international balance of payments shows that  there will be little capability in 1994 to increase domestic  supplies through imports, which will further restrict our  domestic supply-growth potential. Particularly once our exchange  rates are merged in 1994, the probable exchange-rate rise will  touch off a tariff-base change, which will put definite  limitations on import growth. This will have the impact of  easing our international balance of payments, while restricting  our supply growth.    4. An Analysis of Our Inflation Prospects    After November 1993, our domestic market prices went into a  further rising trend, with the general appearance in particular  of rising prices for basic consumer goods, such as food, and  many places afflicted with the phenomenon of panic-buying of  grain, edible oil, and meat. So our 1994 price and inflation  trends have become a hot topic of widespread concern to all.    We hold that our 1994 prices and inflation will be  determined  by our macroeconomic regulation and control steps and effective  market management. The above supply analysis shows that our  supply-growth potential will still be able to support a GNP  growth rate of approximately 10 percent which, generally  speaking, is still quite a high growth rate. If supply can be  kept within the limits of growth, there will be neither a large  gap between supply and demand, or severe inflation and price  rises. But as our 1994 demand-expansion momentum will remain  very strong, being larger than our supply-growth potential, if  we do not regulate and control at all our demand-pulled high  economic growth, but adopt rather an incentive policy, our  prevailing-price growth rate will be very high, with very severe  inflation and price rises. In addition, the phenomenon since  November 1993 of faster price rises for basic consumer goods,  particularly grain, is sharply related to the lack of the  necessary control, restraint, and regulatory means for grain and  edible oil markets since grain and edible oil prices were  deregulated. This phenomenon shows more of a market-management  problem than one of tight supply and demand for basic consumer  goods and farm products. So as long as our overall  macroeconomic regulation and control steps in 1994 are correct,  to effectively control and regulate markets for daily  necessities, such as grain and edible oil, we will not see  severe price rises for basic consumer goods.    Summing up the above analyses, we hold that 1994 may bring  either of two economic trends: a) A situation in which high  growth and more severe inflation coexist, in which case we will  likely see major regulation and control steps taken in the last  half or fourth quarter, bringing quite sharp economic  fluctuation. b) An overall policy keynote of appropriate  regulation and control to bring higher but stable growth,  accompanied by sustainable, approximately 10 percent price rises  and inflation. The key to which trend will occur will be  determined by our 1994 macroeconomic-policy keynote. We hold  that we ought to base our actions on a correct understanding of  our supply potential and growth conditions, to choose an overall  macroeconomic policy orientation of appropriate regulation and  control, in an attempt to achieve the second growth trend.  <H5>  IV. Major Issues and Suggested Countermeasures for 1994 </H5>   1. Investment-Finance System-Reform and Rational Guidance of  Investment    In 1994, we are going to establish a policy-investment bank,  which will combine the former control functions of the State  Planning Commission and the Economics and Trade Commission over  capital construction and technological-upgrading investment, for  joint control of investment funds. In addition, local  government investment-fund sources will be sharply restricted.  This reform will involve two issues: a) Whether investment  channels can be opened up to impact investment growth; b)  Whether our investment orientation can be guided correctly to  resolve the problem pointed out in the above analysis of the  lack of coordination between our investment-growth and  economic-growth structures. We hold that the key to the first  issue is to rationalize the relations of the policy-investment  bank with the Planning and the Economics and Trade commissions,  for an effective increase in Central Government investment. This  issue is actually related to the second one, as a correct  guidance of investment orientation, in addition to perfecting  the functioning of market forces, will more importantly bring  the government role in the disposition of funds into full play  in our current economic development stage, which role must be  realized mainly in the form of Central Government investment.  So in investment-finance system-reform, we need to give  central place to Central Government investment, by ensuring that  Central Government investment channels are open. In addition,  we need to analyze in detail Central Government investment  targets. Of our investment fields that are currently under  little market guidance, in addition to infrastructures and some  basic industry, the most prominent ones are high-tech  industries, such as the equipment and basic electronics  industries, which are industrial forerunners. As these require  large investments, are highly capital- and technology-intensive,  have long investment-construction periods, and do not have clear  short-term market prospects, enterprises and localities find it  very hard to invest in these fields, leaving a particular need  for Central Government investment guidance. We hold that there  is now more emphasis on infrastructure and basic industry  construction, but not enough on faster development and  construction of high-tech forerunner industries, so that the  latter should be given priority. This will be the only way to  promote faster upgrading of our industrial structure.    In investment-fund use, central government investment should  give prominence to industrial-policy targets, rather than being  overaffected by microeconomic efficiency goals. Otherwise, the  market role would interfere too much in Central investment  activities, making it impossible for the Central Government to  supplement market defects through direct investment. So when  coordinating the relations between the former  government-investment control sector and the policy bank, we  need to effectvely meet mostly industrial-policy needs, instead  of overemphasizing microeconomic capital efficiency.    Summing up this analysis, we hold that the crux of our 1994  financial-system reform should be to effectively increase  central government investment capability, as well as using  mostly industrial policy to set central government investment  orientation. This will also be of significance in effectively  regulating and controlling our investment-growth rate, thus  affecting overall demand.    2. Effectively Combining Financial-System Reform With  Overall  Macroeconomic Regulation and Control    Our analysis of our 1994 economic trends shows that rapid  and  sound economic growth in 1994 will depend largely on the central  government's overall macroecnomic regulation and control  capability, centered on its financial regulation and control  capability. A very important part of our 1994 financial reform  will be making specialized banks more businesslike, in which  process, whether reform is complete or not, specialized banks  will acquire more independent decisionmaking power. As our  regulation and control of specialized banks and overall  financial activities will be converted more to setting the basic  money supply and benchmark interest rates, effective financial  regulation and control will be a mojor issue affecting our  overall economic situation.    We hold that in 1994, our capability to control fund volume  and regulate and control financial activities through the basic  money supply will be sharply lower. This is due mainly to too  much basic currency having been put into circulation in the  fourth quarter of 1993. From September through November, the  central bank put over 200 billion yuan in basic money supply  into circulation, promoting a rapid increase in bank loans,  which grew more than 250 billion yuan in October and November,  over twice their increase for the first three quarters. As we  estimate that even more money was put into circulation in  December, we are projecting our loan increase for 1993 at 470  billion yuan, up 22 percent from 1992. Under such concentrated  lending and putting into circulation of basic currency, funds  grew very quickly for both all specialized banks and  enterprises. Our current specialized bank provision rate is  over 13 percent, sharply higher than the normal level of 5-7  percent, and more than 10 points higher than that at the  beginning of 1993, showing that bank credit-expansion potential  is great. As to enterprise funds, enterprise deposits began to  bottom out in October, growing 24 billion yuan that month, over  50 billion yuan in November, and an estimated even larger amount  in December. This shows that the large amount of funds put into  circulation are already higher than our objective  economic-growth needs. Our calculations show the  unit-loan-increase correspondence to industrial output value  growth at 1.50 yuan for 1991 and 2.47 yuan for 1992, but only at  0.55 yuan for September through November 1993. This situation  is now more stable on one hand because the rapid demand growth,  particularly that of investment, is subject to a time lag in  pulling high-speed economic growth. On the other, it is due to  more control steps directed at specialized banks, such as the  relending of basic currency put into circulation going first to  the head offices of all specialized banks where it is divided up  among all branches, and all specialized bank branch  large-denomination remittance settlements having to go through  the central bank, all of which have sharply reduced fund  turnover rates, partially offsetting the impact of more overall  funds.    As specialized banks make entrepreneurial reforms in 1994,  the above measures to restrict specialized banks will be  affected to decrease in impact, with resulting faster fund  turnover rates, and problems related to more overall funds  growing more conspicuous. In addition, as it is predicted that  investment demand will expand rapidly in the first quarter of  1994 due to massive fund support, the enterprise fund-turnover  rate will also accelerate. Summing up this analysis, the  excessive amount of credit granted in the fourth quarter of  1933, and the entrepreneurial reforms of specialized banks in  1994, will sharply reduce the capability of the central bank in  1994 to regulate and control overall finance through controlling  the basic money supply.    As to the function of benchmark interest rates, since China  has still not perfected our money markets, once specialized  banks become businesslike, as new restraint forces will remain  hard to evolve in a short time, and particularly as prices will  fluctuate sharply during rapid economic growth, benchmark  interest rates will still have a weak capability to regulate  overall finance.    Summing up this analysis, the Central Government's overall  macroeconomic regulation and control capability will be lower in  1994 than in 1993, with financial reforms likely to exacerbate  this trend. As to the sound growth of our overall economy, this  will pose a potential danger.    In light of this, in our 1994 financial reform, we should  pay  conscientious attention to its impact on our macroeconomic  regulation and control capability, particularly on our financial  regulation and control capability. Moreover, we should cut  back on the amount of basic currency put into circulation  starting from the beginning of 1994, in an attempt to reduce the  impact of the excessive amount put into circulation. Meanwhile,  we should standardize and perfect as quickly as possible our  money-market order, by strengthening restraints on enterprises,  particularly financial enterprises, in an attempt to strengthen  the regulatory impact of capital prices on financing activities.    3. The Merging of Our Exchange Rates and Our Balance of  International Payments    In our 1994 economic trends, the major support to supply  will  be import growth and, as long as supply grows faster, we will be  able to achieve our goal of rapid economic growth with low  inflation. So import-growth potential has a supportive  capability for our international balance of payments, being one  of our key grounds for sound economic growth in 1994.    Our 1994 foreign exchange reform will abolish foreign  exchange retention and quota control, deregulating foreign  exchange prices, with banks managing foreign exchange services  and foreign exchange transaction activities. This will have the  impact of probably raising foreign-exchange exchange rates and,  once foreign exchange quota control is abolished, affecting  central import activities, also lowering central ability to  control overall foreign exchange usage. While it is predicted  that higher exchange rates will stimulate exports and restrict  imports, having a good impact on our international balance of  payments, the restriction on central imports may have a bad  impact on our import structure. Imports of capital goods where  the relations between domestic and international prices have not  yet been rationalized, as well as ones, such as crude oil,  refined oil, and grain, will be impacted sharply, while imports,  such as high-priced, high-profit manufactured consumer goods,  will grow faster, which will be particularly adverse to  supporting effective supply growth. In addition, more  importantly, our ability to control the use of foreign exchange  will decline. As pointed out in our above analysis, exports  will grow slowly and imports sharply in 1994, putting foreign  exchange in a state of undersupply. So easing our foreign  exchange control in such a state is very likely to touch off  large exchange rates volatility, as well as reducing our foreign  exchange reserves faster, thus weakening our ability to regulate  and control our international balance of payments. This could  result in a deterioration in our international balance of  payments, forcing the government to institute a policy of  overall economic retrenchment. As to economic growth, this is  yet another unstable factor.    So in our 1994 foreign exchange system reform and exchange  rates merging, we need to pay attention to overall economic  trends, particularly our international balance of payments, by  doing all possible to avoid or lower the negative impacts  pointed out in our above analysis, in order to pave the way for  a more effective use of foreign exchange funds, the overall  strengthening of our macroeconomic regulation and control  capability, and better macroeconomic regulation and control  effectiveness.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Text]Translating material from the press of the Hungarian  minorities in Romania, Slovakia, Serbia, and Ukraine presents  several difficulties. In the original text, cities and other  geographic areas are called by their traditional Hungarian  names, which are usually different from the official names used  in the majority language. In addition, parties and organizations  are often designated by unexpanded acronyms, and it is not even  always clear whether these are derived from the Hungarian or  from the majority language. Moreover, some designations are  politically sensitive due to territorial disputes or historical  considerations.    FBIS has adopted the following guidelines for handling such  material. The guidelines assume that the translator has access  to the bilingual list of place names published in Budapest:  (MAGYAR NEVE? Hatarokon tuli helysegnev-szotar; Arany Lapok,  1990). Since the Ukrainian section of the book gives the Russian  form and is therefore obsolete, a partial Hungarian/Ukrainian  list of place names is included below (p.6). In addition, lists  of party and organization acronyms are provided.  <H5>  I. Use of Bilingual Place Names and Acronyms </H5>   Translations should give the majority-language form of place  names and organizations that is approved by the Board of  Geographic Names (BGN) gazetteer, because this is the  internationally recognized form found on maps. At the same time,  the source's use of the Hungarian should be indicated because it  reflects the original material and may have political  implications. The following guidelines address both requirements:    1. In the headline and subslug, use the majority language  version of the place or organization (in the latter case,  usually an acronym).    2. In the text, use whatever place name or acronym is used  in  the original. If this is in Hungarian, cross-reference the  majority-language version in a bracketed editorial note on its  first appearance in the item.    3. As is indicated by the above, the English acronym is not  used.    Example:    Marko Interviewed at UDMR Conference in Oradea    Bucharest ROMANIAI MAGYAR SZO in Hungarian 19 Jun 93 p 9    [Interview with Bela Marko, chairman of the Democratic Union  of Hungarians in Romania, by Janos Szabo in Oradea; date not  given: "Marko on Future Role of UDMR"]    [Text] Shortly after his arrival in Nagyvarad [Oradea], Bela  Marko, president of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in  Romania [RMDSZ--in Romanian, UDMR], gave an interview to our  paper.    [Szabo] What do you expect the RMDSZ to achieve here in  Nagyvarad?    [Marko] I hope that we can resolve some of the problems we  encountered at last month's session in Kolozsvar [Cluj], where  the Hungarian Smallholders Party of Romania [RMK--in Romanian,  PMGMR]....  <H5>  II. List of Acronyms </H5>   The following lists are incomplete but include most of the  acronyms used in the Hungarian minority press of these countries  in 1993. When possible, both the Hungarian and majority-language  acronyms are listed and cross-referenced because the minority  press sometimes uses them interchangeably. NOTE: The  translation of "szovetseg" and several similar words--translated  variously as union, alliance, federation, and association--could  not be standardized because of previously established variations  in common usage.  <H5>  Romania </H5> <H5>  Hungarian Organizations </H5>   EMK = Erdelyi Magyar Kezdemenyezes (Transylvanian Hungarian  Initiative)    FMP = Fuggetlen Magyar Part (Independent Hungarian Party)    MAT = Magyar Autonom Tartomany (Hungarian Autonomous  Territory--historical ref.)

In the text, Bos should be retained,  with [Gabcikovo] in brackets after the first occurrence. When  the reference is to the original joint Slovak-Hungarian project,  use Gabcikovo-Nagymaros in headlines and subslugs, retaining  Bos-Nagymaros in the text. Treat the first occurrence in the  text as follows: Bos [Gabcikovo]-Nagymaros.    Csallokoz = Velky Zitny Ostrov (Slovak) (area between the  main Danube and its northern branch)    Csango = [Partly assimilated Hungarian minority in the  Moldavian region of Romania] Untranslatable. Avoid in headlines.  Unless the text provides a definition, put the above in brackets  after the first occurrence in the text.    Delvidek (or delvidek) = ["Southern country"--southern  Hungary until 1920, now northern Serbia and Croatia]. Do not  translate. Use the original, putting the above in brackets after  the first occurrence in the text. Avoid in headlines.    Dunantul = [Hungary west of the Danube river] Do not  translate as Transdanubia, because it may not be clear whether  the region east or west of the Danube is meant. Use the  original, putting the above in brackets after the first  occurrence in the text. Avoid in headlines. Note that the suffix  "tul" (beyond) indicates west of the Danube but east of the the  Tisza (see below).    Felvidek (or felvidek) = ["Upper country"--northern Hungary  until 1920, now Slovakia] Do not translate. Use the original,  putting the above in brackets after the first occurrence in the  text. Avoid in headlines.    Karpatalja = The area of Ukraine on the Western side of the  Carpathian mountains. In headlines and subslugs, translate as  "Transcarpathia," which reflects the Ukrainian term for the  region. However, in the text, translate as Subcarpathia  (reflecting the Hungarian original). After the first occurrence  of Subcarpathia in the text, put [Ukraine's Transcarpathian  region] in brackets. NOTE: When rendering the official  majority-language form of a place name, use the Ukrainian form  (rather than the Russian as previously in Soviet times). A  transliterated list of common place names is appended.    Kiralyhagomelleki Reformatus Egyhaz = Kiralyhagomelleki  [Pasul Craiului (Oradea)] Reformed Church District. NOTE:  Put Romanian term in brackets after the first occurrence  only.    Magyar = Hungarian    Always translate--do not use "Magyars," etc. When the text  requires distinguishing between citizens of Hungary and  Hungarians living in other countries, qualify as appropriate  with a term in brackets: [minority] Hungarians; [ethnic]  Hungarians; [emigre] Hungarians.    Magyarsag (1) = all Hungarians everywhere.    Example: A magyarsag erti Istvan kiralynak a.    All Hungarians everywhere understand King Stephen's.    Magyarsag (2) = being Hungarian; Hungarian identity.    Example: Buszke a magyarsagara.    He is proud of being Hungarian.    Example: Amerikaban is megorizte a magyarsagat.    Even in America, he kept his Hungarian identity.    nemzet = nation; people    nemzetiseg = ethnic minority; ethnic group; nationality  (citizenship)    nemzeti kisebbseg = national minority    nemzetalkoto elemek = constituent elements of the nation    tarsnemzet = co-nation    Szekely = Szekler    Szekler is the appropriate English translation, but it is  obscure. Therefore, avoid in headlines, and put the following in  brackets after the first occurrence in the text: [sub-group of  the Hungarian minority in the Transylvanian region of Romania].    Tiszantul = [the region of Hungary east of the Tisza river]  Do not translate. Use the original, putting the above in  brackets after the first occurrence in the text. Avoid in  headlines.  <H5>  V.

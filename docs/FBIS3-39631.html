"Undoubtedly a turn has now taken place. Perhaps it cannot  yet be seen in the statistics, but there are many indications  that the swing has either happened, is happening at the moment,  or will happen shortly," he said yesterday at a seminar arranged  by banking firm Ane Gyllenberg.    Korkman predicted that economic growth will be "strong" in  1995, and voiced confidence that the expansion thereafter will  be both enduring and vital. Among other things he pointed to  satisfactory competitiveness, the absence of bottlenecks, and  the balance of payments surplus that mean that this time the  external restrictions on growth this time are minor.    According to Korkman, economic policy is aiming for  export-led growth which will bring balance to Finland's foreign  business and in this way bring down interest-rate levels. Only  after this will investments start moving, consumer demand  reawaken, and new jobs be created.    "Unemployment is the Finnish economy's biggest problem, and  the only way of curing it is a long period of significant  growth."    Korkman warned that the rate of inflation could increase if  the upturn is a steep one, but he nevertheless described the  risk of this as small. He predicted that the large surplus of  timber in the forests will hold stumpage prices in check, and  said that the high level of unemployment will reduce the risk of  a spiral of wage inflation.    Korkman also commented on the debate surrounding the recent  improvement in the strength of the markka. In his view the  markka is not "greatly undervalued," at least not measured in  terms of purchasing-power parity.    "It is true that the markka has fallen greatly since  devaluation and since it began to float freely, but most of this  fall went toward eradicating its former overvaluation, which  amounted to dozens of percent."    On the other hand he said that he believes that the level of  real-term interest rates and the real costs of loans in Finland  are still "high" in historical terms -- an indication that he  would prefer that the markka's continued rise were checked and  that the Bank of Finland went for an active cut in interest  rates.</p>

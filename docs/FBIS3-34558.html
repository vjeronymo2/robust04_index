			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 8 Feb (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi  has criticized the statements issued by terrorist groups through  foreign news agencies following any incident. He described  these statements as a sign of bankruptcy, noting that they come  in reaction to the constant security campaigns and the  tightening of the noose around the terrorists.    In remarks he made today after attending a ceremony on  training day for the Central Security Forces in al-Jizah,  al-Alfi noted that terrorist group members are criminals who do  not enjoy recognition. He stressed that the initiative is now in  the hands of the security agencies, which receive high-level  training, maintain planning and coordination, and achieve  constant success.    The interior minister noted that the statements released by  the terrorist groups are the result of the strong and successful  blows by the security agencies against their dens and that their  statements are mere noise designed to show that they exist.    Al-Alfi pointed out that there were security shortcomings in  the attack on the showroom owned by al-Sayyid Yahya, the main  witness in the case of the attempted assassination of Prime  Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi. He noted that an investigation is now  being conducted by inspection teams from the Ministry of  Interior to determine who was responsible for the security  shortcomings.    Asked if some of those who carried out the attack were  arrested, al-Alfi asked to delay the announcement of arrests of  any suspects, adding that the Interior Ministry will issue a  statement when the time comes to maintain the confidentiality of  information for the sake of the public good.    In response to a question on tightening security around  citizens who give out information to security agencies, al-Alfi  emphasized that those who give information are under protection,  although this is done secretly. He added: If a mistake has  been made in one area, this does not mean that mistakes will  continue.    Asked about the bomb that exploded yesterday in front of the  Central Bank branch in Ramsis Square, the interior minister said  that it was a trivial thing done to prove that the terrorists  are still present.    Asked about the security situation in Asyut, the interior  minister stressed that the situation is completely calm there  and that there is a security presence and that security agencies  are constantly being modernized. The interior minister referred  to the regrettable incident that claimed the life of Brigadier  General 'Umar Hasan Mustafa the day before yesterday, adding  that it happened because of a personal error by martyr Brig.  Gen. 'Umar, who used his private car on his day off without any  guards accompanying him.    This morning the interior minister attended a ceremony  marking the training day of the Central Security Forces in  al-Jizah, where he inspected the living quarters of conscripts  and inaugurated a water project. He attended some exercises  demonstrating how to confront terrorists and break into their  dens using modern equipment. The ceremony was attended by Major  General Samir Fu'ad, first assistant to the interior minister  and commander of the Central Security Forces; Major General  'Abd-al-Wahid 'Atallah, director general of the al-Jizah zone;  and a number of senior officials from the Central Security  Forces and the Interior Ministry.</p>

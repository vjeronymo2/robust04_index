Those forces are on an  offensive under the leadership of [former military commander for  Huambo Province] Jorge Sukissa. They are attacking defenseless  civilians in general as well as National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA]-controlled areas.    Reports from the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel,  Vorgan, correspondent in that area, say that the Luanda  communist regime's air force bombed the villages of  (Caumbangala), (Cuilo), (Chacolo), and (Samucuai) on 20, 21, 22,  and 23 March, killing 34 civilians, including 22 children.    It is interesting to note that the government press in Lunda  Sul Province has made no mention at all of those attacks by the  MPLA-PT forces. Instead, it has falsely accused the UNITA  forces of taking the initiative and launching an offensive. The  UNITA forces have the simple duties of defending the people  against the genocide being perpetrated by Jose Eduardo dos  Santos' men and of abiding scrupulously by the unilateral  cease-fire declared by UNITA President Dr. Jonas Malheiro  Savimbi on 20 September of last year.    Meanwhile, the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola  have  informed the Angolan and international communities that they  will do everything in their power to defend the people against  attacks by South African or any other mercenaries helping the  troops run by Luanda's Futungo de Belas Palace.</p>

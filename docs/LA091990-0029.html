			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUTTE COUNTY OKS BAILOUT OFFER TO AVOID BANKRUPTCY  </P> <P> Butte County supervisors, narrowly averting the nation's first county  bankruptcy, on Tuesday approved the $11.1-million bailout offered by Gov.  George Deukmejian.  </P> <P> The five-member board voted 3 to 2 to accept the Republican governor's  proposal, which local officials said will avert immediate bankruptcy but will  leave next year in doubt.  </P> <P> "We're only putting off the inevitable," said Supervisor Hack McInturf.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, Deukmejian proposed deferring more than $6.3 million owed  the state for fire protection services, postponed the state's demand for  payment of a $2-million matching share for a new Butte County jail and offered  a $1.15-million direct cash grant. The payment deferrals will allow the county  to use those funds for local programs and services.  </P> <P> The proposal also calls for the county to raise about $1.65 million by  increasing local fees, including property taxes and jail booking fees.  </P> <P> As part of the agreement, the county agreed to scale back on requests for new  law enforcement services, pay increases and other programs. The county said  earlier that it needed $14.1 million to keep from going bankrupt, a figure that  included expanded jail facilities and more deputies.  </P> <P> But on Tuesday county officials said they could survive with the $11.1 million  to balance the budget.  </P> <P> The crisis arose after county officials were unable to balance this year's  $155-million budget, saying that 85% of their money was locked into existing  programs by statute -- such as welfare and health care for the poor, and fire  protection services.  </P></p>

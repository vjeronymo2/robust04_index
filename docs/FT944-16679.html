			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Tiphook's lead banks named in US suit National Westminster Bank and Commerzbank, the two largest lenders to the transport leasing group Tiphook, have been drawn into a Dollars 700m (Pounds 443m) US class action suit against the company. The lawsuit claims the banks helped to mislead US investors to enable Tiphook to raise capital to repay loans. Two former non-executive directors, Sir Charles Powell, Lady Thatcher's former foreign affairs adviser and now a non-executive director of NatWest, and Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, Commerzbank's chairman, are also named as defendants, as representatives of those banks. The move appears to be an attempt to achieve a larger and quicker settlement, as Tiphook's financial standing is in effect controlled by its banks. The original legal action was filed in January on behalf of US investors who took up three tranches of bond issues between November 1992 and April 1993, raising Dollars 700m for the company. The named defendants included Mr Robert Montague, Tiphook's chief executive and founder, several executive directors, and the underwriters to the bond issues. The investors claim they were sold Tiphook bonds and shares on the basis of 'materially false and misleading' information. Sir Charles and Mr Kohlhaussen resigned 'with regret' from Tiphook on March 10. Legal reasons were cited, connected to Tiphook's new bank arrangements, but there were previous potential conflicts of interest, as their banks were the prime recipients of the funds raised. The action claims: 'Tiphook's lead lenders were represented on Tiphook's board of directors by their own senior directors and were thus aware of the true distressed condition of the company. These lenders pressured the company to repay Tiphook's bank indebtedness to these institutions with indebtedness financed by unsuspecting public investors in the United States.' An initial status and settlement conference on the case has been called for October 18, to set the timetable for the proceedings. Tiphook has consistently stated that the accusations will be 'vigorously contested'. The two banks would not comment. The bond prospectuses anticipated, among other things, easy continued access to capital, strong cash flows, and 'the best Christmas in two years'. The first signs of declining fortunes came just six days after the final prospectus, when Tiphook announced that interim profits would be 20 per cent below previously projected results. A stream of bad news then leaked out and by October 1993 it had indicated possible breaches of its banking covenants. Tiphook has made provisions to cover its legal defence, but an adverse judgment could topple the company into receivership. Mr Montague was served with a bankruptcy petition from Royal Bank of Scotland on Monday night, over a Pounds 2.3m loan. If made bankrupt, he would be ineligible as a director. Mr Montague is hoping for support from the bulk of his creditors to push for an Individual Voluntary Arrangement, which would schedule debt repayment, and avoid bankruptcy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Colin Brown and Tom Wilkie report: "Nuclear Sale `Could Be </F> Put on Back Burner'"]    [Text] The 2 billion pound privatisation of the nuclear  power industry could be put on hold following a decision by  ministers that they will need primary legislation to float the  assets of Nuclear Electric on the market.    The Government is under pressure to include a Bill in the  Queen's Speech in the autumn. Any further delay could end the  privatisation chances, and would be seen as evidence that the  crisis of confidence in John Major's leadership has led to a  loss of nerve.    In a second blow to the nuclear industry's hopes, a shadow  has been cast over the future of the two nuclear reactors it is  proposing to build at Sizewell in Suffolk, adjacent to Britain's  first pressurised water reactor, Sizewell-B, which will start  generating in the late summer. Tomorrow, Suffolk's planning  officer is expected to recommend to the county council that it  should oppose the 3bn pound development because the Government's  nuclear policy is unclear.    Nuclear Electric plc is privately lobbying ministers to give  the go-ahead for its privatisation without legislation.  Officials have told ministers that the Government is  technically entitled to do so. Nuclear Electric was set up as a  private company owned by the Government after electricity  privatisation because the costs of nuclear waste disposal and  decommissioning old reactors made it unsaleable. Some leaders  in the nuclear industry fear any delay until after the next  general election, because they believe that their privatisation  hopes will only be realised by a Tory government.    However, two senior ministers have confirmed that the  Government believes it will need primary legislation. One  ministerial source said it would be "politically unacceptable"  to go ahead without seeking the approval of Parliament.    Nuclear Electric, which owns and operates reactors in  England  and Wales, has been enticing the Government with the prospect  that it could gain 2 billion pounds from the sale of the company  in 1996, if it gave an early go-ahead for privatisation. But a  split has opened in the industry's ranks, with its Scottish  counterpart being noticeably less "gung-ho" for privatisation.    Publication of the terms of reference for a review of the  nuclear industry, a necessary precursor to privatisation, has  been delayed for at least four months. Tim Eggar, the Minister  for Energy, promised the terms for a review of the nuclear  industry by the end of last year. They were stalled by the  legal objections to the opening of the Thermal Oxide  Reprocessing Plant (Thorp) at Windscale in Cumbria. It was  strongly expected by the industry they would be announced a week  ago, but the date slipped again.    That led to a strong rumour that the review had been  abandoned. Yesterday, a Department of Trade and Industry [DTI]  spokesman said: "The review has not been abandoned."    In principle, the terms of reference may be announced when  the Commons resumes next week after the Easter recess, but  ministers are keen to ensure that starting the review should not  open the way to a legal challenge to the inauguration of  Sizewell B.    There has been an intense ministerial wrangle over the terms  of reference, with the DTI insisting on a short internal  feasibility study before giving the go-ahead for privatisation.    Ministerial sources yesterday indicated that the Department  of the Environment had succeeded in ensuring that the long-term  environmental impact of nuclear waste would be taken into  account. The Treasury has also been keen to ensure that the cost  of decommissioning of nuclear plant in the next century would be  fully covered if the industry was privatised.    The decision to seek primary legislation makes it more  difficult to meet the timetable of privatisation before the next  election. The DTI, which is in charge of energy policy, has to  introduce a gas Bill in the next Queen's Speech to open the  industry to more competition. It is considering privatising  parts of the Royal Mail. Opposition sources said it was unlikely  the DTI would find a third slot in the autumn for a Bill to  privatise nuclear power. "After that it will be too late,  because it would be too close to the election," one Labour  source said.    Labour believes that Michael Heseltine, President of the  Board of Trade, will not allow privatisation to die. "I suspect  we are getting into Heseltine's leadership manifesto here. He  still wants to be seen by the right-wing as a radical," the  source said.</p>

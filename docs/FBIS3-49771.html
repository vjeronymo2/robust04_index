			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksander Kwasniewski, leader of Social </F> Democracy of the Polish Republic, by PAP correspondent Marzanna  Doering; place and date not given]    [Text] [Doering] Social Democracy of the Polish Republic  [SdRP] is at present undergoing an astonishing metamorphosis.  After a time of discreet silence on the subject of the feud  between the government and local self-government structures, in  mid-December it suddenly issued a statement of its position on  that subject, a statement in which words like  "decentralization," "self-government," and "citizens' society"  literally abound.    [Kwasniewski] We have never, in fact, kept silent on the  subject, and there is nothing paradoxical in the position  adopted by the SdRP Supreme Council. Because a large number of  misunderstandings have arisen around the questions of  self-government and the administration reform, it was necessary  to define our position clearly. After a debate on the subject,  the Supreme Council adopted an official position that is now  binding for us. In all of our dealings in parliament, as well as  in internal government negotiations, we will defend the  decentralization of power, the modeling of a citizens' society,  the consolidation of self-government structures, and the  expansion of the range of competence of these structures. These  principles also apply to other self-government structures, such  as self-government bodies in educational establishments,  economic self-management bodies, and trade unions. Our interest  in decentralization is not an expediency strategy. We believe  that decentralization makes sense from the viewpoint of the new  state structure and the new decisionmaking system.    [Doering] All of this sounds very fine. By voicing such  views  in the six months separating us from the planned local  self-government elections, you can easily gain the reputation of  a keen self-management advocate. At the same time, the Polish  Peasant Party [PSL] has come to be seen as against local  self-government structures--in a situation where the coalition  is supposed to make joint decisions.    [Kwasniewski] On what grounds do you base your claim?    [Doering] I base it on the silence maintained by the  Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] on the freeze imposed on the  self-government pilot program, the suspension of the transfer of  schools to parish authorities' management, and the collapse of  the finances act, which entailed the preservation of the  income-tax distribution system that is highly disadvantageous to  active parishes and the absence of the compensation payments  scheme for VAT [value-added-tax] induced losses. Should I go on  with the list? All these decisions were made by the government  and by parliament.    [Kwasniewski] The majority of these cases involved either  unfortunate timing or other disadvantageous coincidence. If the  government had not been appointed in October but rather, two or  three months earlier, maybe we could have avoided a greater  number of these setbacks. As it was, however, the government was  destined to carry out its work on the budget in great haste.  This was compounded by the need to attend to local  self-government draft acts--for example, the finance act--which  were not even prepared by the present government. Perhaps we  should have shown more confidence in the work of our  predecessors, but you cannot really deny the new government the  right to make its own decisions in such important matters. If  the previous cabinet had prepared a draft constitution, surely  you would not insist that the new government should pass it on  to parliament right away during its first session?    [Doering] I am not sure.... If it was a good enough  project, I would probably not worry too much that it was not of  my own making. But let us return to our main question: When can  we expect the SdRP declarations of support for local  self-government structures to be shored up by more tangible  actions?    [Kwasniewski] We are all facing a forthcoming test--the  local  self-government elections scheduled for the end of May and the  beginning of June. Then, all our proposals and decisions will be  verified by the voters themselves. It is not as if we could get  away with talking nonsense about the self-government system, or  with doing nothing about it except making well-meaning noises.  Self-government structures are at present controlled by the  Democratic Union and other groups of similar political  orientation. If it were to become apparent that the present  coalition has not only failed to do anything tangible to further  the cause of self-government but even halted the progress of  certain self-government processes, I have not the slightest  doubt that today's opposition would win the elections. On the  other hand, if the coalition demonstrates successfully its  honorable intentions concerning the self-government system, it  will stand a good chance of succeeding.    [Doering] You speak as if the coalition were unanimous on  the  question of a reform of the system.    [Kwasniewski] I will not deny that from the very beginning  there have been differences between us. The PSL is more  cautious, and we in turn have no reason to question their  knowledge of the functioning of self-government structures at  the parish level. It is, after all, their own ground. The PSL  has never questioned the need to decentralize power and to  reinforce self-government structures, but it adopts a different  viewpoint: We should put things in order first and reform them  later. In my opinion, in certain areas this position is quite  sensible, but in others it could possibly prove slightly too  conservative. We have always believed that we should make  decisions in favor of changes. We have expressed our political  will and we will try to put it into practice. By mid-January, we  will have held our first round of talks with the PSL. I hope  that we will be able to decide whose position should prevail  before the end of January. We need to make sure that a range of  fundamental questions is sorted out first--first, the principles  of financing the parishes; then, extension of their range of  competence; finally, the issue of whether we should create a new  system of districts.    [Doering] What if you come up against a brick wall in your  talks with the PSL?    [Kwasniewski] We will then continue to discuss the same  things in parliament. We are not alone there.    [Doering] What decisions should you be making in the  question  of the package of parliamentary bills prepared by Hanna  Suchocka's government--that is, the district and voivodship  reform, the central authorities reform, the reform of the civil  service sector, the government order system, and the  reorganization of the Council of Ministers Office [URM]?    [Kwasniewski] In all of these areas, changes are urgently  necessary: There is no doubt whatsoever about that. The  difficulties could begin as soon as we come to argue over the  details--and the details fall within the brief of the working  group for the public administration reform, appointed in  mid-December by the SdRP Supreme Council. The civil service is a  most important stabilizing element in the state administration  system, and the sooner it is introduced, the better. We must  find ways to minimalize corruption, and that goal is best served  by a system of government orders. I would exercise the greatest  caution toward the URM reorganization project. I always suspect  that all reorganization is the result of the need for a radical  review of the personal appointments in the given system.  Regardless of whether the URM is given a new name and whether it  is left as one bloc or divided into three general directorates,  it will always be with us because it has three important  functions to fulfill: provision of services to the government  and the prime minister; legislation and contacts with  parliament; and coordination of the operations of local  government administration.    [Doering] In the latest campaign, the SLD made a firm pledge  of support for the district reform. What districts and when?  Minister Strak says: Let us first put the local state  administration in individual regions in order, and then we can  decide whether we should organize self-government elections  there.    [Kwasniewski] In my opinion, once you have started  something, it is advisable to see it through. Stopping a new  development as soon as you started seems to me too defensive a  strategy. There is no sense in maintaining the regional system  today: The regions are, as it were, semidistrict creations, and  as such they remain strictly artificial. We must make it quite  clear that we intend to finish what we started. The district  reform will mean that the number of voivodships will be reduced  to about 15-20. This will inevitably cause heated arguments and  conflicts because the parliament that approved that formula for  the reform was chosen to represent the present configuration of  49 voivodships. We can expect that all conceivable sorts of  lobbies will be set up and activated in defense of the status  quo. If, say, we return to the original blueprint of 17  voivodships, what do you expect will be the reaction of the  deputies from the 32 voivodships that would then cease to exist?  They would have to go back to their earlier milieus and local  configurations--but many present voivodship centers have already  become accustomed to wielding their local power.    [Doering] The PSL wants voivodships to function in the  self-government system.    [Kwasniewski] I do not see justification for the correctness  of this concept in our circumstances because Poland functions as  a unitary system. If a state is not organized as a federal or  individual laender system, voivodships should be  linked to the central authorities, and voivodas should represent  the central government.    [Doering] Because we have come to the subject of voivodas,  let me cite your own words spoken before 19 September: "We will  not check individuals' party membership cards to assert from  which political affiliations people come to us. If they have  satisfactory qualifications, they should be placed in those  posts where their abilities will be put to the best use."    [Kwasniewski] I still subscribe to that opinion.    [Doering] How does it square with the announcement that you  will replace existing voivodas by people from the victorious  coalition?    [Kwasniewski] Anyone who charges me with calling for purges  will be at serious odds with the truth. I said that a new  political situation arose as a result of the election. I may  even apologize that the old government lost the election, but  that is what happened. Today there are people who say: "We are  not interested in politics, but we are at your disposal." If  they are competent administrators, they will retain their posts.  And there are also others who say: "We do not see a place for us  here anymore; our mission is over." That was precisely what took  place in Pila, Zielona Gora, and Wloclawek. There are now  vacancies there. How do you imagine we should go about finding  new candidates to these posts? Pick them off the street? Or from  the opposition's ranks? We have adopted the principle that the  group that won the election in a given voivodship can assume  initiative in this matter. Because that means that that group  has at its disposal the most numerous personnel reserves to be  recruited from among its broad base of supporters. However,  candidates must still obtain approval from the voivodship's  self-government assembly. And the candidates from Pila, Zielona  Gora, and Olsztyn did obtain such approval. These people are by  no means party apparatchiks: They are all competent experts.    [Doering] The SdRP December statement contained a mention of  a proposed change in the election law, designed to improve  representation at parish level. Does this suggest that you agree  with Minister Strak when he claims that councils are not  representative?    [Kwasniewski] The May 1990 elections were won by citizens'  committees. But where are citizens' committees today? We have  also introduced candidates from a variety of electoral lists  into the councils.    [Doering] That problem could be resolved in the elections  themselves rather than through changes in the electoral law.    [Kwasniewski] We are considering a proposal to choose parish  elders and town and city mayors in universal suffrage, although  opinions on that solution are rather divided.    [Doering] What would be the SdRP's interest in such a move?    [Kwasniewski] Precisely. I am not altogether sure whether it  would be in our interest. That is why we are still hesitating.  Local self-government elections do not attract much popular  attention, so it could be that such direct choice would enhance  their attractiveness and increase the chance of stimulating  local communities to greater activity.    [Doering] In other words, it would pull those who are as yet  undecided toward you?    [Kwasniewski] I do not see it in terms of political  interest.  Let me risk a prediction: The approaching elections will end in  a big compromise, and no one will be able to say that they have  won an unqualified victory in it.</p>

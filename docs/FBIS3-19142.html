			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi by </F> Massimo Archidiacono; place and date not given: "Silvio, Why  Are You Protesting?" -- first six paragraphs are L'INDIPENDENTE  introduction]    [Text] [Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi is siding  neither with the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] nor with the Clean  Hands Team.    He is not upset over the magistrates' accusations about  Fininvest [Berlusconi business group] and the declarations made  by [Judge] Borrelli seem obvious to him: What is happening, the  kickback scandal and all that is involved is only the  consequence of the "country system" as he calls it.    "One could say that the leading businessmen have had to cope  with a stack of laws -- explains the Senator [Bossi] -- with a  system of compromises that guaranteed no real clash, foreseen as  possible under the rules of competition."    The Northern League leader drives his metallic-colored car  to  the umpteenth election meeting in Lavagna (Liguria) where he is  expected at 9:00 PM. He knows little about the controversy that  has exploded between the leader of Forza Italia and the head of  the Clean Hands team.    "It was the parties that controlled everything," he  continued. "There was a real duopoly and not only in television;  an entire economic system was divided between political  oligarchy and the dynastic oligarchy of a few powerful business  families."    The moral of the tale is: "Now Berlusconi is protesting, he  talks of a political attack, but to tell the truth I really do  not know what he is protesting about. The judges are doing  their job, and if they really dig deep down who knows what they  will find.... There may also be a political maneuver behind  this. The whole kickback scandal is political, otherwise there  would be no explanation as to why, at a certain point of the  investigation, they decided to attack the League, trying to  corner us, by implicating us with the Sama trap, instead of  calling on trial all those people that are now fleeing overseas  in order not to end up in prison."    [Archidiacono] Bossi, are you siding with the magistrates  who  are prying into Fininvest?    [Bossi] No, I am saying that the system of corruption  created  a heavily interlaced plot. No leading businessman was excluded  from this. And I mean no one, have I explained myself? I am  saying that if the judicial authorities dig deep, they risk  upsetting everything. However, at the same time the kickback  scandal was created not to do justice but as an escape valve for  a system of old parties in difficulty. I see nothing shattering  about this last incident, rather it confirms that Berlusconi is  a branch of the old regime: which could even be positive if he  demonstrates (as he is doing) that he wants to change.    [Archidiacono] I insist, the statements made by the Knight  are resentful, he is talking of "political repression" at his  expense....    [Bossi] I can well believe that he is shouting, he is afraid  of being damaged and of losing votes. Already in the North he  will get nothing because we from the League are there. Now he  is also running a risk in the South.    [Archidiacono] Martinazzoli [secretary of the Italian  Popular  Party, PPI] even maintains that Berlusconi is suffering from a  "sudden attack of megalomania."    [Bossi] I will not enter into controversies of this kind. I  could not care less. Our alliance with Forza Italia is an  electoral alliance precisely to avoid destruction by moderates  like Martinazzoli. If I was asked who Berlusconi is, what I  think, I would reply that in the end he is some one that has  been able to set himself against the old regime.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town June 24 SAPA -- Former Umkhonto we Sizwe  [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] intelligence chief Mr  Ronnie Kasrils has been appointed deputy minister of defence,  President Nelson Mandela announced on Friday [24 June]. He said  in a statement that Defence Minister Mr Joe Modise had made  representations to him about the need for additional senior  personnel to run his ministry.    He had agreed to the request after taking into account the  important role of the SANDF [South African National Defense  Force] and the challenges it faced in the vital process of  integrating the different armed forces.    Mr Mandela said Mr Kasrils had experience in military  affairs  as a leading officer of Umkhonto we Sizwe.    His experience, expertise and skills enabled him to play an  important role in the defence subcouncil of the Transitional  Executive Council.    "I am confident that he will do the same in his new role as  deputy minister of defence," he said.    Mr Kasrils' appointment brings the total number of deputy  ministers to 13.    He became a member of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) on its creation  and carried out acts of sabotage before being sent abroad for  military training.    After several years in the ANC office in Dar es Salaam Mr  Kasrils and his wife Eleanor moved to London where he worked to  establish underground MK units in South Africa. During this  period he also co-wrote several books about the philosopher and  socialist Bertrand Russell.    In 1977 Mr Kasrils moved to Angola to become political  instructor in the MK camps and later political commissar for  Angola.    He was based in Lusaka between 1985 and 1989. He was chief  of  military intelligence from 1983-1988 and was a co-opted member  of the National Executive Committee from 1987.    When he returned illegally to the country at the end of  1989,  Mr Kasrils was hunted by the security forces for his role in  Operation Vula and repeatedly escaped arrest before being  indemnified in June 1991. He was elected to the NEC [National  Executive Committee] and the National Working Committee and the  Political Bureau of the SACP [South African Communist Party].    Kasrils' autobiography "Armed and Dangerous: My Undercover  Struggle Against Apartheid" was published earlier this year.</p>

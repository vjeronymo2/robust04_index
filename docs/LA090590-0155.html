			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> B.C. LIONS RELEASE GASTINEAU  </P> <P> Mark Gastineau's comeback attempt with the British Columbia Lions ended Tuesday  when the former NFL All-Star was released by the team and waived through the  Canadian Football League.  </P> <P> The 33-year-old defensive end failed to keep a morning appointment with head  coach Lary Kuharich.  </P> <P> He cleared CFL waivers after none of the other seven teams claimed him.  </P> <P> "I don't know where he is," Kuharich said after practice. "It's over, I guess."  </P> <P> Gastineau played 10 seasons with the New York Jets and played in five Pro Bowls  before walking out on the NFL team during the 1988 season.  </P> <P> The Lions signed Gastineau before the 1990 CFL season at the insistence of  owner Murray Pezim, the Vancouver stock promoter who backed Gastineau's bid to  become a pro boxer. Gastineau played four league games for the Lions before  going on the injured list in early August with a rib cartilage problem.  </P></p>

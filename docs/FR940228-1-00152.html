Academic Year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A. Section 481(d)(2) of the HEA provides that an ``academic year''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must require a minimum of 30 weeks of instruction time in which a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student is expected to complete at least 24 semester or trimester  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours or 36 quarter hours at an institution that measures program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> length in credit hours or at least 900 clock hours at an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution that measures program length in clock hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Issues that the community was asked to address and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community's views:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. How should prorations be calculated? For example, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22 weeks are offered, how does an institution determine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of an academic year that applies?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Prorations of an academic year in educational programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shorter than an academic year should be based solely on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the number of credit or clock hours provided, without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regard to the number of weeks required. Proration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should not be used for educational programs of one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> academic year or longer. Attempts to prorate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> length of an academic year using both weeks and credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or clock hours would be inconsistent and confusing,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because credit or clock hours are not always evenly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distributed over the calendar length of an educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Prorations should be based on the minimum number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clock or credit hours that a full-time student in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible program is scheduled to take in an academic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year. Prorations should not be based on the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weeks in the academic year. A minority opposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inclusion of a reference to ``eligible program'' in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendation. [Atlanta]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. What is a week? How should portions of a week be treated?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A week should include any week during a portion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the educational process takes place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A majority of participants recommended that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructional week be defined in terms of a fixed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard of clock hours of instruction. Thus, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, if regulations define an instructional week as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the completion of 30 clock hours, a student who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completes 90 clock hours of instruction in two calendar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weeks should be considered to have completed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent of three instructional weeks. [New York]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A week should be defined as a seven-day period that can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> begin on any day of the week. The seven-day periods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue for 30 periods of time. [San Francisco]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A ``week'' should be defined as either each seven-day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period within an enrollment period; or each seven-day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period (within an enrollment period) during which any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instruction occurred. [Atlanta]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. What is instructional time? Should periods provided for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> orientation, testing, and vacation count?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Instructional time should be measured on the basis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calendar weeks that begin on Monday and end on Sunday.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Instructional time should consist of a period of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuous enrollment beginning with the first week of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classes and ending with the conclusion of the period of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrollment, including any normally scheduled breaks in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the academic calendar. [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Instructional time should include time spent reading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and taking examinations. [New York]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The interests of students, institutions, and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituents need to be considered in determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructional time. Some participants recommended that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the determination be left to accrediting agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other participants recommended that the determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be left to the Secretary. [San Francisco]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. What consideration should be given to programs with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condensed class schedules, or to weekend programs?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Because instructional time should be measured on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis of periods of continuous enrollment, special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration for condensed schedules or weekend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs is unnecessary. [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The interests of students, institutions, and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituents need to be considered in determining how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to treat condensed schedules and weekend programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some participants recommended that the determination be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> left to accrediting agencies. Other participants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that the determination be left to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary. [San Francisco]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Condensed programs that include the equivalent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workload of a regular academic-year program should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered to meet the definition of academic year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [Atlanta]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Third quarter starts with modest rally - London The stock market is looking forward to this morning - effectively the start of the third quarter of 1994 - with more optimism than seemed possible only a week ago. Indeed, it could hardly be worse than the April - June quarter, but there was more than that to the rally in equities at the end of last week. So far, the rally has been modest enough and concentrated largely on the FT-SE 100 list; the Mid-250 stocks have been on the sidelines, sometimes to their advantage. Charterhouse Tilney Securities says the fall of around 0.8 per cent in the Footsie 100 in June contrasts with falls of 4.2 per cent and 5.1 per cent in the FT-SE Actuaries 350 and FT-SE Actuaries Small Cap indices respectively. Markets across Europe have begun to move out of the shadow of the US dollar. For the first time for many weeks, European bonds, and therefore equities, held steady as the dollar/yen rate was hammered lower and US Treasuries fell away. It is not easy to see exactly what the stock market wants from the G7 meetings this week. But fears that the dollar will only be saved by brutal increases in US interest rates seem to have abated. 'If something can be done about the dollar, then this will ensure the chances of stabilising markets . . . ' says NatWest Markets. Other analysts might express themselves more strongly. If the dollar can be stabilised, bond markets will settle down, and the way will be open for UK equities, in particular, to respond to recovery in the economy and in corporate earnings and dividends. SG Warburg calculates that 'top-down' corporate earnings, having grown by 50 per cent last year, seem set to increase by a further 30 per cent this year. The flow of new issues and similar share placings continues to mop up a good part of the liquidity hanging over the stock market. Although liquidity is likely to increase now that fund managers can move into third-quarter planning, the new issue flow will have to slacken if shares are to stage a significant rally. Unfortunately, there seems little sign of this. Recurrent rumours that the Kuwaiti authorities would like to place the stake in British Petroleum, together with Enterprise Oil's purchase of the Lasmo shares held by Philips &amp; Drew Fund Management, suggest a wealth of potential placing activity in the background. This week may be spent waiting for the meeting of the Group of Seven ministers but there are signs that some fund managers are unwilling to let UK shares drift any further. One overseas fund tried, but failed, to put a sizeable sum into the London market last week. Market traders expect the same fund to reappear this week and will be watching eagerly for its traces.</p>

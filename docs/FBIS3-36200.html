			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Feature comprising article by Special Envoy Sergey Zotov, </F> head of the Russian delegation to the talks with Latvia,  followed by editorial commentary, under the general headline:  "Moscow's Tough Reaction to Arrest of Russian Generals in  Latvia Was Justified"]    [Text] [Zotov] The editorial published in IZVESTIYA (No.  8) under the headline "Arrest of Two Russian Generals in Latvia  Is Lesson for Moscow and Riga" pursued the idea that the placing  of relevant Army and Navy units on alert status in connection  with the 10 January seizure of four Northwest Group of Forces  installations and two Russian generals in Riga 10 January by  Latvian militia shows that there is weak civilian control over  the Armed Forces and that the decision was reached without the  necessary coordination among the presidential apparatus, the  Security Council, and other competent structures.    There is no doubt that in a democratic state there should be  effective civilian control over the use of the Armed Forces.    Nor can there be any objection to the premise advanced in  the  article that we should resort to this obviously extreme measure  only after considering the potential for safeguarding citizens  by diplomatic means.    As for the aforementioned incident in Riga, which was  extremely brazen and unprecedented, apart from its emotional  aspect (the capture of generals is always viewed in Russia like  the loss of military colors) it was a blatant violation of  international law. And the numerous illegal acts previously  undertaken against Russian servicemen in Latvia constituted  aggravating circumstances.    In late December 1993 there was a new series of  provocations,  including an attack on a military courier service and two  instances of militia shelling of military transportation. There  was an escalation of unpunished provocations against Russian  troops, culminating in the events of 10 January, which were  timed to coincide with the Russian delegation's arrival in Riga.    Even after the Latvian president announced his readiness to  take the proper measures, it took five hours before the Russian  generals were released, during which time our citizens were  threatened with being shot. The Russian side also took account  of the fact that the militia is virtually beyond executive  jurisdiction when it took measures to protect the lives and  honor of the Russian generals.    I want to assure IZVESTIYA readers that Colonel General L.S.  Mayorov, commander of the Northwestern Group of Forces, behaved  superbly in a difficult situation and was in constant contact  with the Russian state delegation from the time we arrived at  Riga airport. Defense Minister P.S. Grachev and Foreign  Minister A.V. Kozyrev, who issued a long statement, were  immediately informed about what had happened. The supreme  commander in chief -- President B.N. Yeltsin -- was immediately  informed too. So it would be wrong to imagine that the measures  taken were some kind of "freelance" military operation.    As for the actual nature of Russia's military measures, in  our delegation's opinion they were the only correct thing to do,  since they stopped the incident fromescalating into a conflict  with unforeseeable consequences.    I particularly want to stress that, if we had limited our  reaction to a statement, this would have been seen by radical  nationalist forces as a signal to move to even more unbridled  provocations against our servicemen, against the thousands of  military pensioners and their families, and against the Russian  population, which is trying to win respect for its rights.    May I voice the view that we have still not yet fully  grasped the importance of this seemingly insignificant  military-diplomatic step in terms of our foreign policy, the  awakening of our national self-awareness, and the boosting of  morale among our Armed Forces. The cherished desire of Russia's  professional diplomats and of all our countrymen who value our  national interests in deeds rather than words is for the steps  taken by Russia 10 January become the starting point for a new  presidential policy and a new foreign policy for Russia.    Russia has firmly and clearly stated, perhaps more than ever  before, that it is still a great power and that nobody will be  allowed to deliver ultimatums to it, pressure it, or blackmail  it. Those planning new provocations against Russia and its  citizens now know that there will be a swift and appropriate  response on our part taking account of international precedents,  including the U.S. experience.    This is nothing to do with "imperial ambitions." We are  merely talking about a state's right and, I would say, its duty  to use all means available to it in international practice to  protect its honor and the national dignity of its citizens. I  am sure that if we consistently and steadily follow this line in  practice we will be able to avoid in the future a great deal of  the trouble that is currently visible on the foreign policy  horizon.    And, on the contrary, if we "give up" this position under  pressure from people offering us "good advice," we will again  encounter attempts to diminish our national worth and come up  against new problems for our state.    Anticipating the reaction of our possible opponents, I would  like to say that there is nothing short-term about these  arguments of mine. The Russian delegation at the talks with  Latvia has always, despite the obstacles raised, consistently  and successfully pursued this line in strict accordance with the  directives ratified by the Russian president. [Zotov ends]  <H5>  Great Powers Still Not Defined by Military Might </H5>   [IZVESTIYA] Having a strong position is any diplomat's  dream. The question is: What is to be considered a strong  position? What result did the Russian military men and  diplomats achieve in demonstrating their readiness to use force?  Initially, after the provocative arrest of the two generals,  Latvian diplomats were indeed prepared to make concessions, and  Ambassador Sergey Zotov decided that airborne assault battalions  would be the most convincing argument at the talks.    But Riga's confusion was quickly over. And not because the  Latvians were not frightened enough. On the contrary, it was  clear to Latvian politicians (and not only them) that it was  necessary to be as stubborn as possible in getting the Russian  Army to withdraw and in cutting themselves off from Russian  generals behind an iron or any other kind of curtain.    Did this show of force make the Russians living in the  Baltic  any more secure? Probably just the opposite. The position of  Russian people is affected badly by any attempts to pressure the  Balts; the Russians have become hostages to Russian policy. In  this sense the armed force was absolutely impotent.    So what advantage was gained?    Morale improved sharply not only among generals, as  IZVESTIYA  had assumed, but among diplomats too. It turns out that even  diplomats like banging their fists on the table.    You can understand why. The behavior of the Latvian  officials with whom the Russian diplomats and military have to  deal -- whether they like it or not -- betrays the triumph of a  provincial arrogance that has suddenly recognized its own power.    But it must not be forgotten that the tricks both big and  small that have been played by the Baltic officials had just one  cause -- the presence on their country's territory of another  state's army, whose withdrawal they are demanding as quickly as  possible.    There is also another issue -- the appropriateness of the  response. Almost nine years ago, when Mikhail Gorbachev had  been in power for just two weeks, a Soviet soldier from the  Group of Forces in Germany shot the American Major Nicholson.  It had seemed to the vigilant guard than the American was  trying to discover some secrets.    So, following the logic of Ambassador Zotov, who values  American experience, just how should the United States have  reacted? If assault troops are placed on combat alert when  people are arrested, should the response to a killing be a  missile strike against the enemy?    Fortunately for everyone, the United States restricted  itself  to diplomatic measures, and there is no reason to believe that  it ceased being a great power at that point.    So IZVESTIYA would by no means want the events of 10 January  to be considered the "starting point for a new Russian foreign  policy."</p>

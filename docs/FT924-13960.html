			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Arts: Latin-American fiesta - Concerts Columbus's arrival in the New World 500 years ago may not have been a cause of unequivocal celebration in the world outside, but in the world of music it provided the excuse for the presentation of New World-related compositions in big, enjoyable splashes. On Sunday - Columbus Day itself - Radio 3 devoted 14 hours of its schedule to a continuous stretch of live concerts from around the world; the chamber group Lontano, on air from London from two to three in the afternoon, made their contribution (of music by Villa-Lobos, Revueltas, Chavez and Roldan) the climax of a four-concert series entitled 'A Fiesta of Latin-American Music'. The theme of this series, devised by the Lontano conductor Odaline de la Martinez, was the exploration of the musical relationship between the European and American cultures - a theme loose enough to allow an easy mixture of styles, with brightness of colour and sharp rhythmic definition as common factors. On Tuesday at the ICA, in a programme featuring the American Betsy Schramm, the Argentinian Michael Rosas Cobian and the first two parts of Colin Matthews's impressive chamber epic The Great Journey, Lontano made a particular success of Going with the Grain (1991), for solo marimba and small ensemble, by the young English composer Martin Butler. In common with Butler's O Rio, a highlight of the 1991 Albert Hall Proms series, this piece delights the ear through the sway of gentle syncopated rhythms - identifiably if not pin-down-ably Latin - and the parallel teasing-out of seductive colour-patterns. It is a kind of concerto for marimba (brilliantly played by Richard Benjafield) without the element of battle between soloist and accompaniment usually associated with the concerto form; and its exoticism is fully absorbed into the fabric of the invention, not facilely tacked on. On Saturday at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, Lontano were joined by the London Chamber Symphony for the third (1938) of Villa-Lobos's Bachianas Brasileiras  -the one with an elaborate solo piano part (played here by Gilberto de Matte) - in which jungle bird-song and neo-Baroque musical forms achieve a raucously appealing marriage. The British premiere of Algebra on Fire (1991) by the Brazilian Alejandro Vinao attempted an analogous confrontation of modern technology (including a role for computer) and instrumental ensemble - of, as it were, European rational discourse and Latin irrational imagination. The experience, full of dramatic potential and dark, fiery textures, was hampered by the recourse to amplification, which rendered everything monochromatically loud.</p>

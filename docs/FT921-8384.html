			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: Court set to rule in battle for ownership of Perrier THE battle over the ownership of Perrier, one of France's best known mineral water companies, moves into the legal arena today when a court at Nimes, in southern France, will conclude the first of the series of cases critical in determining the outcome of the battle. The court is considering a case lodged by Nestle, the Swiss food group that has staged a FFr13.42bn (Dollars 2.48bn) hostile bid for Perrier, to freeze the voting rights on the shares held by Exor, the French property group which controls Perrier and which is allied with the Agnelli family of Italy. Last month, Nestle, which has teamed up with Indosuez, the Paris bank, to stage its bid, won an injunction to freeze temporarily the voting rights on the shares held by Exor, for which the Agnellis are in the throes of a FFr5.6bn friendly bid. Today, the court will decide whether to make that order permanent. Next Tuesday, the Paris commercial court is expected to deliver its judgment on a Nestle action to try to nullify the FFr1.5bn sale earlier this year of a 13.8 per cent stake in Perrier to Saint Louis, the French sugar company associated with the Agnellis. Nestle, which this weekend won the French government's permission to go ahead with its bid, has argued that the share sale is invalid because it was orchestrated by the Perrier board, which is chaired by Mr Jacques Vincent who is also chairman of Exor, specifically to block its forthcoming bid. The French stock market authorities have also examined this argument and, although they were critical of Exor's relationship with Perrier, said they could find 'no definite proof' of a concert party. Nestle needs to win least one of the two cases for its hostile bid to succeed otherwise Exor and Saint Louis would be able to block its offer with their combined 49 per cent of Perrier's voting stock. Meanwhile, the first indications yesterday emerged of Perrier's financial performance last year. The group, which owns a number of other food brands including Roquefort cheese as well as its mineral water, posted overall sales growth of 3.5 per cent to FFr13.55bn in 1991. Perrier's mineral water division saw sales grow by 4.9 per cent to FFr4.17bn in France and by 2.2 per cent to FFr4.62bn in other countries. Roquefort's sales increased by 4.7 per cent in the second half.</p>

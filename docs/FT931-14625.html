			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Berlusconi's brother for trial over political funds MR Paolo Berlusconi, the younger brother of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media magnate, is to be put on trial on charges of illegal political contributions, according to magistrates in Milan yesterday. The announcement coincided with the arrest of Mr Umberto Di Capua, the head of the multinational ABB engineering group in Italy. Mr Paolo Berlusconi is one of 35 businessmen and politicians whom magistrates intend to put on trial in Milan's largest political corruption scandal. He has been accused with Mr Sergio Roncucci, a senior executive of the Berlusconi family's Fininvest holding company, of paying local Christian Democratic party officials L150m (Pounds 71,320) in relation to a contract for a big refuse site. The arrest of Mr Di Capua is believed to be linked to allegations of illegal payments to local politicians for contracts for the Milan metro's new third underground line. Last June, Mr Ivo Braglia, the head of ABB's transport division, appeared before magistrates for questioning. ABB supplied substations and radio-telecommunications equipment for the multi-billion lire line. The allegations against Mr Paolo Berlusconi are likely to prove highly embarrassing to the Berlusconi family. Although the two Berlusconi brothers divided their business activities last year, with Mr Paolo Berlusconi taking over Fininvest's property businesses, the family's early rise to fortune was built largely on property development. He said the money involved was a personal political contribution, and therefore not subject to the rules on political donations by companies. The arrests and investigations are the biggest move by magistrates against prominent businessmen since last year's arrest of Mr Salvatore Ligresti, the property magnate, who spent almost three months under investigation in jail. Confirmation that inquiries have entered a new phase came with last month's announcement that Mr Bettino Craxi, the Soclialist party leader, was also under investigation. This week, magistrates sent formal documentation to the Rome parliament for permission to proceed against Mr Craxi, who has denied all the charges against him.</p>

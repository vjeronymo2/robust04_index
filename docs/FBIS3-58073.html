			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "M.R.": "Admonishing Words for Asylum </F> Practice in Austria"]    [Text] Even though Austria has one of the highest refugee  quotas in Europe and private donations are high, legislation for  refugees is not optimum: Staffan Bodemar, representative of the  UN High Commissioners for Refugees (UNHCR) in Austria, harshly  criticized Austria's asylum law yesterday.    The law has clear deficiencies that require an amendment.  The Federal Asylum Office checks the actual reasons for a  person's flight only cursorily and in a superficial manner. In  particular regarding the deportation of refugees to so-called  safe third countries, procedures are not careful enough. Here  one must check whether it is indeed to be expected that the  refugee will be safe there.    The great latitude in exercising the asylum law is also  criticized.    Interior Minister Loeschnak, on the other hand, presented a  completely positive balance sheet yesterday: With a recognition  rate of more than 19 percent of asylum applications, Austria is  right at the top of the list in Europe. For the Greens,  Loeschnak's balance sheet is a "cynical game of numbers."    The UNHCR is starting a new poster campaign with the slogan:  "Refugees are Human Beings Just Like You and Me."</p>

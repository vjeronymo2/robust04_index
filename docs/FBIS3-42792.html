			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Kozyrev, minister of foreign affairs of </F> the Russian Federation: "Russian Peacekeeping: There Are No Easy  Solutions"]    [Text] The settlement of the armed conflicts in Georgia,  Nagornyy Karabakh, and Tajikistan has become a key problem of  Russia's foreign policy.    The consequences of these conflicts are reflected directly  in  the daily life of Russians. More than 2 million refugees arrived  in the country in 1993 alone. The Government of the Russian  Federation and the local authorities have in just the last two  years spent R51.5 billion in making provision for them. This is  a difficult economic burden for any country, let alone ours. The  mass influx of refugees has revived the threat, long-forgotten  here, of epidemics of dangerous diseases. Waves of organized  crime are coming to Russia from the "flash points."    The great Russian historian V.O. Klyuchevskiy considered a  principal factor reflected in the historical fate of Russia its  lack of a natural border on the vast expanse between the Urals  range and the Caspian. Down the ages nomadic Asiatic hordes  entered Russia through this "gate."    Although today's Russia is not threatened by invasions of  nomads, it once again in fact lacks a southern border. We simply  do not have the means to furnish one. But even a highly  fortified border would not protect us against the new threats  connected with the instability and internal conflicts of our  neighbors. Especially since compatriots living outside of Russia  are coming primarily to be the victims of these conflicts.  <H5>  For the Defense of National Interests </H5>   The debate in Russian society in connection with the  problems  of the near abroad is unfolding in the space between two extreme  positions.    The first: a solution of the problem by way of "restoring  order" in the former Soviet republics, that is, simply put, the  restoration "by fire and sword" of the disintegrated USSR. In  order to imagine what this would signify it is sufficient to  glance at events in the former Yugoslavia. If Russia has  succeeded thus far in sparing itself the horrors that have  fallen to the lot of the peoples of this country, it is only  because Moscow has not attempted to restore the Union state by  force and redraw internal borders. Adopting an imperial policy  would mean getting that same Yugoslav scenario, but one that is  immeasurably more dangerous owing to the dimensions of the  former state and the presence on its territory of nuclear and  chemical weapons, nuclear power stations....    The second position: Russia "walks away" from the near  abroad, removing itself completely from involvement in the fate  of the states of the former USSR. But this option also, despite  all its ostensible allure, would ultimately result in  catastrophe. If, for example, the Russian peacekeepers were to  leave Tajikistan, tomorrow hundreds of thousands of refugees  would be pouring into Russia from there, and not only Russians  but both Tajiks and Uzbeks also, what is more. The result would  be chaos in Russia itself, from which it would be a straight  path to a pogrom-type-nationalist dictatorship, and from this to  the Yugoslav version once again.    It transpires that Russia is "condemned" to perform a  special  role in the former USSR, but the role not of a gendarme but of a  peacekeeper. Especially since no state of the near or far abroad  and no international organization is displaying a desire or is  in a position to replace Russia as the peacekeeping force in  this region.    But recognition of a special role does not signify Russia's  claims to some "free hand" in respect to its neighbors. We are  organizing our actions strictly in accordance with the  principles of international law: respect for the sovereignty and  independence of the states involved in conflicts,  noninterference in their internal affairs, and recognition of  their territorial integrity, with respect for the rights of the  national minorities. In all cases where this is possible Moscow  aspires to joint actions within the framework of the CIS.    At the same time, on the other hand, it should be clear that  Russia is forced at times to speak strongly and has no intention  of paying in the lives of its soldiers for a lack of will to  reconciliation in the parties involved in a conflict.    Russian peacekeeping has already accumulated considerable  experience. There have been no military operations in South  Ossetia or the Dniester region for more than a year now.  Mechanisms of mediation in a settlement of the Karabakh and  Abkhaz conflicts are operating. Russia's important practical  contribution to a settlement of the conflicts in Nagornyy  Karabakh and Abkhazia has already been recognized in a number of  documents of the UN Security Council and the CSCE. If a decisive  turn toward peace in the post-Soviet space has not yet occurred,  it is not because the choice in favor of an active peacekeeping  policy was wrong. It is primarily a question of the seriousness  and complexity of these conflicts. And the "peacekeeping  techniques" formulated by the United Nations, the CSCE, and  other organizations are still imperfect to a large extent also.    No one in the world has a 100 percent effective methodology  of peacekeeping operations. This is indicated, specifically, by  the experience of their prosecution in Bosnia and Somalia. Like  other states also, we have to learn peacekeeping, perfecting  both international and domestic mechanisms.    It is essential first and foremost to ensure the pursuit of  a  common all-state policy in respect to local conflicts. It should  not appear as a "layer cake," in which each layer corresponds to  the tastes of individual persons, departments, or regions.  Manifestations of such an approach, even in defiance of Russia's  official position, not only seriously harm the cause of a  settlement (we saw examples of this in Abkhazia) but also  undermine trust in Russia on the part of the world community,  fostering the myth of "Russian imperialism."    The new constitution adopted at the general referendum  clearly enshrines the prerogatives of the president in questions  of foreign policy and security. The further strengthening of  Russian statehood requires that a barrier be erected in the way  of departmental and opportunist calculations.    The efficiency of our peacekeeping should be enhanced  through  the alignment of Russia's trade and economic relations with the  parties to conflicts with the overall aim of a peace settlement.    Peacekeeping also needs a strong material and legal  foundation. It is important that our new parliament not repeat  the deplorable experience of the former Supreme Soviet, which,  while from time to time striking an heroic pose in relation to  our neighbors, displayed no concern for the creation of a  full-fledged legislative base of Russian peacekeeping.  <H5>  Faced With a Common Challenge </H5>   Support for Russia in the settlement of conflicts in the  former USSR is a test of strength of the partnership that has  taken shape between former adversaries in the cold war. I  emphasize that we are talking about assistance, not attempts to  instruct and control while shifting the burdens of the  accomplishment of this task onto Russia.    Europe and the world are coming increasingly to recognize  that these conflicts are not some far-off fratricidal strife but  a serious problem of European and international security. Even  now the waves of the narcotics mafia and crime from the "flash  points" are beginning to roll down to Central and West Europe.  Understandably, no "cordons sanitaires" will save Europe if  conflicts and instability in the post-Soviet space engulf Russia.    But it is not only a question of a common threat. The  fundamental interests of Russia and our partners in the far  abroad coincide in a desire to see in the new independent states  observance of generally recognized international standards, in  the field of human rights included. After all, the southern  border of the CIS has become, simultaneously, the border of the  CSCE also. This is important for Russia primarily because only  under the conditions of peace, democracy, and the observance of  human rights in these states can the rights of the  Russian-speaking population be fully secured.  <H3>  The United Nations and the CSCE: `Inspectors' or  Participants in Peacekeeping in the CIS? </H3>   The world community has begun to pay more attention to  peacekeeping operations in the former USSR as of late. We are  grateful to the representatives of the United Nations and the  CSCE who are working in the conflict zones hand in hand with the  Russian peacekeepers. But a certain duality is being displayed  in the position of many of our partners. They are torn, as it  were, between recognition of the real significance of the  Russian peacekeeping mission and doubts lest it serve as a  pretext for a revival of Russia's "imperial propensities." As a  result we are at times encountering attempts to make cooperation  with us dependent on a variety of speculative conditions and  "criteria," which only distract from the real cause.    These apprehensions are noticeable among our neighbors also.  Memories of the carnage caused by the Soviet authorities in  Tbilisi, Baku, Vilnius, and Riga are with them superimposed on  top of new fears born of the ultra-nationalist appeals of a  number of Russian politicians. The best "medicine" for such  fears is interaction in the sphere of peacekeeping, within the  CIS framework included.    An international peacekeeping strategy is needed,  on the whole.    An important component of it should be the bolstering by a  UN  mandate of the peacekeeping operations being conducted by Russia  in the former USSR. We are not talking about some international  "legalization" of the presence of Russian peacekeeping forces in  CIS countries. There is no need for this since they are deployed  there on an entirely legitimate basis, at the request of the  corresponding governments. The need for such a mandate is caused  by the fact that Russia's peacekeeping operations are  "nontraditional" from the standpoint of UN practice. They are  being conducted on the territory of neighboring states, where  Russia has serious economic and other interests. Under these  conditions a UN mandate and the presence of observers are  designed to confirm the dispassionate nature of the Russian  mission, strengthen its connection with the UN efforts, and, on  the whole, enhance the efficiency of the peacekeeping operations.    UN and CSCE observers should be sent to the conflict zones  at  the right moment, when a cease-fire has been achieved. In this  case they could really bolster the Russian peacekeeping  contingent as a third force. The breakdown of the Abkhazia peace  negotiations in the summer of 1993 showed the cost of delay in  the deployment of a peacekeeping mission. On the one hand the  Russian contingent failed to obtain the necessary reinforcement,  although it was known from the outset that the forces available  by the start of the operation would be insufficient for  accomplishing it in full. The Russian piece of folk wisdom:  Don't start a job you can't finish, is pertinent here. But such  jobs have to be undertaken! The same applies to the United  Nations. Extraordinary efforts were required of Russian  diplomacy first for the number of observers whom the UN Security  Council would have been prepared to send to Abkhazia to be  increased from the laughable figure of eight-12 to 80. But by  the time of the breakdown of the agreement, two and a half  months later, no more than 20 observers were on the scene.    International support should be expressed also in acceptance  of the principle of a fair distribution of the burden of  expenditure on peacekeeping. We are raising the question of the  formation of a voluntary international fund to this end.    A strengthening of the peacekeeping functions of the CSCE  constituted the essence of our proposals at the recent meeting  of CSCE foreign ministers in Rome. The adoption of the  declaration on countering aggressive nationalism was an  important achievement. This is a serious contribution of the  CSCE to the prevention of interethnic conflicts forming the  basis of many armed clashes in the former USSR and Yugoslavia.    The three-year Russian peacekeeping experience has not been  in vain. We now know better what needs to be done for a  settlement of interethnic conflicts and how and, what is most  important, what should not be done. It is now essential to  patiently and consistently continue the cause of peacekeeping  that has begun, not succumbing to the temptation of simplistic  ideas: resolving everything at a stroke or walking away,  abandoning everything.  <H5>  Russia's Participation in UN Peacekeeping Operations </H5>   IKMOON (UN Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission)--15  military observers;    MOONG (UN Mission on Haiti)--five civilian police  officers and one civilian specialist have been allocated, but  the deployment of the mission has been suspended at this time on  account of the situation on Haiti;    MOONPR (UN Mission for Assistance to Rwanda)--it  is planned sending 15 military observers;    MOONPRZS (UN Mission To Observe the Referendum in  Western Sahara)--three military observers;    ONVUP (UN Body Observing Compliance With the Truce  Conditions, Near East)--17 military observers;    SOONO (UN Protection Force, former  Yugoslavia)--one infantry battalion (831 men, in January 1994,  following reinforcement, its manning level will be 1,200), 13  military observers, 40 civilian police officers, two civilian  specialists, two motor detachments;    YUNOMOZ (UN Operation in Mozambique)--20 military  observers (a further six are being sent) and one civilian  specialist;    YUNOSOM (UN Operation in Somalia)--one civilian  specialist.

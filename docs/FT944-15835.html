			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Smaller traders battle for profits The monthly statistics designed to present a composite picture of retail behaviour often mask a wide range of experience on the ground, especially among small businesses. Mr Roy O'Connor, who owns variety stores in Birmingham, Shrewsbury and Hereford, said: 'I talk to a lot of people in the retail trade and right across the spectrum sales are on the floor. So where they get their government figures from I do not know.' On the other hand, Mr Richard Cooke, manager of the Bull Ring Centre, a covered market for discount shops in Birmingham - where Mr O'Connor owns a store - said retailers had 'had an exceedingly good year'. Mr Cooke said Sunday trading had brought merchants an extra 5 per cent in sales values. 'We feel that with Sunday trading, we can get more families shopping,' he said. 'People on their own are generally hesitant to spend, but get the family together and they will make decisions to spend.' Mr John Morell, owner of JM Engraving, a down-market jeweller in the Bull Ring Centre, said sales were up by about 3 per cent to 4 per cent on last year, about in line with the CSO's retail sales figures. But, he said: 'Prices have not changed one iota.' Mr O'Connor said that if anything, clothing prices had fallen about 5 per cent in the past year. 'We have started to import a lot of goods and prices have dropped and margins have come down,' he said. Mr O'Connor said discounters might be suffering more acutely than the larger chains. 'For the past five of six discounters have been the name of the game. But with people now getting some job security and married couples both bringing in incomes, they tend to go to hypermarkets or use their credit cards at M &amp; S and Next, rather than coming to the independent discounters.'</p>

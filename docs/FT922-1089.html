			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Extra N-station planned for Sizewell A NEW nuclear power station, twice the size of any built in Britain, could be the key to cheap nuclear power, according to Nuclear Electric. The state-owned company, which operates England and Wales' nuclear stations, believes it could build twin reactors next to Sizewell B in Suffolk, Britain's latest nuclear station under construction. The cost would be less than Pounds 3bn in today's money, and some cash might be raised privately. The cost compares with around Pounds 3.5bn for the single Sizewell B reactor, due to start operating in 1994. 'We've already paid for Sizewell B,' Mr John Collier, chairman of Nuclear Electric, told a conference in London yesterday: 'Now we need to think how to capitalise on it. It's our duty to the consumer and the taxpayer.' Nuclear Electric cannot build any stations until it passes a government review in 1994. His proposal surprised some analysts, who said Mr Collier's hopes of private-sector financing, especially at the 8 per cent rate of return he quoted, was unrealistic. Mr Steve Thomas, nuclear specialist at Sussex University's Science Policy Research Unit, said: 'They are saying this because they can't claim to be a nuclear company and not have investment plans.' The new station, which would start up around 2002, would have two 1300MW reactors. It would be second in size only to Britain's coal-fired power station at Drax, North Yorkshire, which generates power for six cities the size of Liverpool. Nuclear Electric believes it would produce electricity at less than 3p per unit compared with between 6p and 8p for the oldest nuclear stations, and just over 4p for Sizewell B. Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, said Nuclear Electric lived in 'never-never land'. It said: 'Never accept the economic realities of nuclear, and never deal with the formidable radioactive legacy of nuclear waste.' Thirty-six organisations and individuals have sent the Department of Trade and Industry their views on the privatisation of British Coal. The 36 included companies interested in bidding. Bodies which contacted the DTI before its deadline on Monday included electricity generators, mining unions and mining groups.</p>

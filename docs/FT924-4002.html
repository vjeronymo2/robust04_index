			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Management: Life's compensations TUCKED away in this week's Cadbury Committee report on British corporate governance is a little-noticed paragraph. It reads like a clause from the US Freedom of Information Act. It concerns board remuneration, and starts: 'The overriding principle . . . is that of openness. Shareholders are entitled to a full and clear statement of directors' present and future benefits, and how they have been determined.' Barely seven weeks ago a similar declaration was made by the chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission about what Americans persist in calling executive 'compensation'. Introducing a set of changes in the SEC's rules on the disclosure to shareholders of such 'compensation', the commission's chairman said that disclosure should be 'clear and complete'. But there the similarities end. For the six-line clause on executive pay in the Cadbury 'Code of Best Practice' is not only far from full by US standards, but also somewhat less than clear. By comparison, the SEC's 'fact sheet' about its new rules on compensation disclosure runs to three full pages, backed up by a sheaf of charts and explanatory notes. The real extent of the yawning gulf between the two nations' interpretations of 'full', 'clear' and 'complete' becomes evident from the content of the two bodies' actual provisions. In the SEC's case, these are fully-blown regulations, but in Cadbury's they are mere recommendations - albeit reinforced by the threat of bad publicity and shareholder pressure if companies fail to conform. From January US companies will be required to include in proxy statements to shareholders a set of tables, notes and reports. They include: The 'compensation' of the chief executive, broken down into seven main categories for each of the past three years: salary; bonus; a catch-all category of five types of other annual compensation (including perks and tax payment reimbursements); awards of restricted stock; awards of options and stock appreciation rights; payouts under long-term incentive plans; and, finally, a second catch-all category of five other types of compensation, such as accrued earnings on deferred pay. Including the itemisation required within certain notes, some highly-rewarded executives could have to declare a dozen separate aspects of compensation. And that is just the start. Precisely the same breakdown must be shown for the four other most highly-paid senior executive officers (if they earn more than Dollars 100,000 a year). All this information must be displayed in a large summary table, with each of the five executives named. Other more detailed tables are also required, covering employment contracts, termination agreements, various possible eventual values of options and stock appreciation rights, plus other items. The compensation committee must provide a detailed discussion of the relationship between executive compensation and corporate performance. I could continue this description at the same length again, but will desist. Worried parties should contact the SEC direct. The purpose of its new rules, along with changes introduced early this year governing voting at company annual meetings, is to give shareholders more influence over the level and structure of executive pay packages. In comparison, the pay section of the Cadbury Code looks puny. It merely recommends disclosure of directors' total 'emoluments' (again, an archaic word), but as a group rather than individually. As at present, the only identifiable individuals for whom any detail must be given are the chairman and highest paid UK director, who are often the self-same person. The code does say that, for these individuals and for the board as a whole, a breakdown should be given between salary and performance-related elements and that the basis for performance-measurement should be explained. But no level of detail is prescribed for either of these. Nor is the controversial subject of stock options mentioned in the code. To anyone other than a self-interested British company director, the obvious temptation from the foregoing might be to ridicule Cadbury's efforts. But that would be wrong for two reasons. First, the committee's recommendations are well ahead of actual British corporate practice. According to Monks Partnership, a leading remuneration consultancy, only eight of the companies in the FTSE-100 Index comply wholly with Cadbury's pay guidelines (which also include an indication of the existence and composition of a remuneration committee). Barely a third explain incentive payments in any way; only a fifth show the performance element in total board emoluments; and only an eighth show it in those of the chairman or highest paid director. In other words British disclosure practice is antediluvian compared with that of the US. The second factor is that the whole effectiveness of the Cadbury Code - of which board pay is only a small part - relies on the creation of a consensus among most companies that its clauses are fair, sensible and practical. At this stage, to have threatened three or four more directors per boardroom with disclosure of their individual pay arrangements would not have been exactly tactful. Later, perhaps, but not now. Cadbury's 'softly, softly' approach is one of several reasons why companies which do not conform to the code must now move very rapidly to do so. Otherwise they will bring on themselves - and everyone else - a much tougher and regulatory regime. Since Cadbury issued its draft report in May, the climate of London financial opinion has begun to swing away from gentlemanly but ineffective self-discipline, towards official regulation. In any case, fuller pay disclosure is in a company's interest. The more open it is, the less room there is for misunderstandings - or for justifiably bad publicity - when shareholders and the media find out. But time is running short for voluntary action.</p>

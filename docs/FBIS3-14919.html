"This is what the Gudauta leaders are afraid  of, since in this case all their claims to statehood will be  buried," he told journalists in Tbilisi.    The Abkhazian leadership stands for deploying peacekeeping  forces on the border between Abkhazia and Georgia along the  River Inguri.    In comments on the results of the 3rd round of talks held on  February 22nd-25th, Ioseliani said that the Georgian delegation  knew from the outset that "the Abkhazian side will not accept  any constructive solutions." "Nevertheless we met with them, so  that the entire world can see with whom we are dealing," he said.    According to Ioseliani, all participants in the talks "were  indignant at the destructive stance taken by Gudauta."  Discussions on the Abkhazian problem are continuing at the U.N.  in New York, he noted.</p>

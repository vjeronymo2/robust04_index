			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with G.A. Satarov, aide to the Russian Federation </F> president, by Vasily Kononenko; date and place not given:  "Those Not Signing Accord Treaty Will Not Be Branded `Enemies  of the People'"]    [Text] The concluding phase of work on the Treaty on Social  Accord has clearly run into a holdup. A number of State Duma  factions have delivered virtually an ultimatum demanding that  their "specific interests" be taken into account. It is  possible that this show of dissidence was organized in order to  reserve themselves a place on the sidelines of the system, which  not everyone in society is greeting with applause.    Most likely greater clarity will emerge in this process  following the meeting between B. Yeltsin and representatives of  Federal Assembly factions. What are expected at that meeting  are a speech from the president, a report on the attitude to the  treaty of the main political forces and regions, which will be  delivered by S. Filatov, leader of the president's  administration, and speeches from the leaders of both houses of  parliament, and also faction leaders. Nevertheless, the main  approaches and stances with regard to this most important  document can be seen right now. The president's aide G. Satarov  answered the IZVESTIYA correspondent's questions.    [Kononenko] Georgiy Aleksandrovich, does it surprise you  that only three factions in the State Duma as of today support  the treaty, or do you accept it as logical?    [Satarov] It is not surprising in the least. The opponents  of this document advance no convincing arguments, but they do  uphold their own political interests. In other words, it is a  matter not of the document's contents but of the factions'  attitudes. Just take a look at the similar theses of the  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] and the Communists!  They say: This agreement represents the preservation of the  present regime until the elections. In the language of  political scientists this means: It is possible to fight for  power right now -- therefore, we will fight for power.    [Kononenko] But perhaps these factions' proposals were not  taken into consideration?    [Satarov] They were all initially agreed on the following  approach: No proposals should impinge on the sides'  constitutional powers. The LDPR representatives' demand for the  removal of six ministers from the government, for example,  impinges on the executive's constitutional powers. Therefore  they cannot be a subject for discussion.    [Kononenko] What is the assumed list of participants in the  treaty?    [Satarov] It will evidently be signed by the president, the  prime minister, the patriarch of All Rus and the leaders of  other religions creeds, the leaders of factions and the main  trade union organizations and regions, and so forth.    [Kononenko] What is the mood in the regions?    [Satarov] Judging by the information arriving from the  regions, no one disagrees with the document. There is a  readiness to sign it without criticism and with the  corresponding proposals. These proposals have already been  received by the working group. I have not come across anything  unacceptable in them.    [Kononenko] Can attacks be expected on those who do not give  their signatures to this treaty?    [Satarov] No one intends to declare them "enemies of the  people." Everyone still has a chance to accede to this document.</p>

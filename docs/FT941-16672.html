			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / International Company News: Commerzbank seeks DM950m Commerzbank, Germany's third-biggest stock market listed bank, yesterday unveiled plans for a DM950m (Dollars 559m) rights issue, sweetening the offer with a promise of a DM2 dividend increase to DM12 for 1993. The bank attempted to sharpen appetites for the new shares with the promise that interesting business prospects in its financial services operations would have a favourable impact on 1994 results. The issue, which follows a smaller financing move early last year, will mean Commerzbank will increase equity capital to DM16bn and achieve its aim of raising the bank's capital-to-assets ratio to 5 per cent from 4.6 per cent in one step. As on the occasion of the last rights issue, the latest issue is not supported by a full-year profits forecast. However, Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, chairman, was careful to give an informal preview of strong 1992 results last January, just days before the subscription period opened. Last November, he announced profits ahead 52 per cent for the first 10 months of 1993. Shareholders will be able to subscribe to this year's issue - a 1-for-10 at DM315 a share - between January 24 and February 7. The new shares will be eligible for dividend payments from January 1994, the bank said in a statement. Commerzbank stock has recently been trading at around DM380 compared with a 12-month peak of DM400, which was reached amid rumours of a possible takeover, and which helped the company's shares outperform those of other big banks. However, all German banks last year increased their provisions against bad debts. They expect this year to feel the impact of recession. Moody's Investors Services downgraded Commerzbank's long-term credit rating last October. Credit watch agencies believe German corporate insolvencies will increase by about 25 per cent this year. Commerzbank's DM2 dividend increase includes a DM1 payment attributable to a recent lowering of corporate tax rates, which many banks have said they will pass on to shareholders. Bankgesellschaft Berlin has set a price of DM384 for its 5-for-8 rights issue. Bankgesellschaft Berlin comprises Berliner Bank, Berliner Hypotheken- und Pfandbriefbank and Landesbank Berlin. All three banks expect satisfactory results for 1993.</p>

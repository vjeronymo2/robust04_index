			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Nairobi devalues by 30.7% KENYA devalued the shilling yesterday and took action to clean up mismanagement and corruption in its financial sector, Reuter reports from Nairobi. Bankers and economic analysts welcomed a 30.7 per cent cut in the official rate of exchange against the US dollar and the recent central bank takeover of a number of lending institutions, but doubted they represented a big shift in government policy. Yesterday the central bank posted its daily mean rate at 59.0072 Kenyan shillings to the dollar compared to KSh45.160 previously. It gave no explanation for the move. Private banks yesterday quoted between KSh72 and KSh75 for the dollar. Most analysts said the government had been forced to take action to try and contain a looming economic crisis, spurred by huge unpaid loans to so-called 'political banks', high interest rates and a shortage of hard currency. 'These measures may well have been taken for all the wrong reasons. Nevertheless they are to be welcomed if they lead to more of the same,' said one World Bank official. In March, the government, angered by an International Monetary Fund refusal to recommend a resumption of critical balance of payments support of some Dollars 40m a month, abruptly reversed economic liberalisation policies. Foreign currency controls were reimposed in agriculture and tourism and President Daniel arap Moi accused the IMF of trying to impose 'dictatorial and suicidal policies' on the east African country. Bankers said Mr Moi and his closest supporters had expected an effective flotation of the currency on February 19, which saw its value halved in barely five weeks, and the creation of an interbank market to be sufficient to win back IMF approval. But money supply surged 35% last year and the IMF urged tougher action.</p>

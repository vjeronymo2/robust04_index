			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Insurers face legal threat on pensions The Trades Union Congress will today warn insurance companies that they may face legal action if they fail to reach agreement with the Securities and Investment Board over a timetable for compensation arising from mis-sold personal pensions, Richard Donkin writes. Part of the uncertainty covering payouts, the TUC says, has been the failure to agree a 'key date' on which benefits in a mis-sold personal pension scheme can be compared with the benefits left behind in a company scheme, thus setting the formula for compensation. Mr John Monks, the TUC general secretary, said that affiliated unions could be forced to take legal action, similar to that taken by Lloyd's Names, if insurance companies continued to resist SIB plans to force them to agree a timetable. 'Unless the insurance companies can demonstrate that they are prepared to make full restitution on an agreed timetable, the whole sorry affair may end up in court,' he said. He described the mis-selling of personal pension schemes to people who would have been better off staying with their occupational pension arrangements as 'one of the great financial scandals of our time'. He said the TUC would encourage trustees of occupational schemes to examine how former members could rejoin schemes. Mr Monks added that it 'should not be left to insurance companies to choose a date that favours them over their victims'.</p>

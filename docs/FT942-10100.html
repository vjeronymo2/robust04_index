			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Arts: Portrait of Edith Wharton What has caused the present boom in the work of Edith Wharton nearly 60 years after her death? Reissues of her novels followed by two films, The Age of Innocence and Ethan Frome, are crowned by Irene Worth's skilfully assembled Portrait. Consisting simply of extracts spoken in front of a lectern against a black backcloth, this hour and a half of uninterrupted exposure to the mind of Wharton is completely absorbing. The years have left Irene Worth wholly undimmed; she remains a glowing presence, as if she had just stepped out of a full-length oil by Whistler. She throws herself into the personality of Wharton with a fine spontaneity. Wharton was a captivating storyteller who revealed hidden sources of power in seemingly vulnerable women. Worth shows how Wharton's own life serves as a singular example of the feminine struggle in the 20th century. The opening anecdote is taken from her autobiography A Backward Glance, the show's chief source. Little Edith is walking along Fifth Avenue with her father. Worth describes how a kiss was planted on the little girl's cheek by her small boy cousin. She gently mimes the gesture of his lifting her veil to reach the target. Each subsequent extract describes the lifting of a further veil or psychological barrier as we follow Wharton's progress from the moneyed world of her parents, marriage to the rich Teddy Wharton, professional authorship, chic life in Paris and London alongside the likes of Henry James, divorce and sexual awakening in the arms of the rascally American journalist Fullerton. She recites with commensurate passion a fragment commemorating this unhappy affair then breaks the tension with the throwaway line - 'But then I see everything from the woman's point of view'. That is the basis for Wharton's current success. At the Cottesloe at 8 pm on May 12, 13 and at 4 pm on May 18, 19.</p>

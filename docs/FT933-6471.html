			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Arts: MacMillan's operatic issues - The Edinburgh Festival The festival prospectus promised us a 'double bill of operas'. Whatever else they may be, Busqueda and Visitatio sepulchri by James MacMillan are not that and the evening devoted to them at the King's Theatre on Wednesday left impressions that were anything but operatic. This was the most substantial offering of Edinburgh's in-depth survey of MacMillan's work. For those not familiar with the composer, a brief biography may be helpful. MacMillan is Scottish, at 34 still young in today's terms, his homeland's leading voice in new music. He has taken up a decisive stance on political and religious issues. Of these two works, both are steeped in the Catholic faith and one also recalls a recent case of political mass injustice, beliefs on MacMillan's part which give this music added purpose. Visitatio sepulchri is less an opera, more a celebration of faith. It sets a 14th-century liturgical drama that would have been enacted at Notre Dame in Paris on Easter Sunday. First the crucifixion, then the resurrection as recounted by three angels to three women, and finally a 'Te Deum', its culmination in a hymn of praise. The intention is to portray the events in as objective a manner as possible, so MacMillan effectively de-personalises his music, having the text chanted or sung in ensemble wherever possible; no individual emotional response is allowed. Much of the central section is spare, as though wanting to convey an antiquity of tone, resonating down the centuries. The 'Te Deum' starts with a lot of unconvincing agitation from the orchestra, too angst-filled to be appropriate to the words, but rises at the end to glorification. None of this is easy to bring off and Francisco Negrin's stage production tipped the piece well over the edge into pretentiousness. Wafted on a cloud of incense, three semi-naked dancers pose half way up the wall, while the women and angels play spot the symbolism, flicking water at each other and ripping pages out of books with very meaningful looks. Next time I would like to see a simple re-enactment of the drama. For Busqueda, even that is unnecessary. MacMillan's theme here is the lost sons of Argentina, a subject already memorably captured on film. An opera is words through music, but this work is decidedly words with music. What he gives us is a collage, in which poems written by the mothers of 'the disappeared' are read or sometimes chanted, interspersed with sections of the Latin Mass. There is little singing; indeed little music imposes at all. As an accompaniment to the poetry, the score is sparse, generally expressing an elegiac mood of grief, as filtered through years of waiting. I found its response to the poems mostly simple and moving. The narrator was Juliet Stevenson and Ivor Bolton conducted the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, seated on stage, where there was thankfully no production to distract our attention.

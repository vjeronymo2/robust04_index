			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The 51st rotational session of the Persian Gulf  Cooperation Council, PGCC, foreign ministers concluded its work  after two days of talks on international and regional issues  Saturday June 5, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. In a part of the  statement, PGCC calls for Iran-UAE talks on the disputed islands.    Following the release of this statement, a spokesman for the  Iranian Foreign Ministry yesterday, Monday, June the 6th, said:  Historical evidence shows that the islands have always belonged  to Iran, and to resolve the differences the Islamic Republic of  Iran welcomes holding of talks with the UAE, without any  pre-conditions.    The Islamic Republic of Iran has, however, left the door  open  for talks as put forth by the spokesman of the Iranian Foreign  Ministry yesterday. The spokesman said the invitation extended  to the UAE's foreign affairs adviser is still valid.    The UAE, immediately after the Iran-Iraq war in 1988,  without  any hard evidence, claimed ownership over the Iranian islands of  Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa. The claims have so far  worked as a media propaganda by the regional states and those  fueling tension and crisis in the Persian Gulf region.    The PGCC statement has also protested against the anti-Saudi  propaganda on the Iranian media during the hajj season. In this  connection Dr. Mohammadi [not further identified] said: The  Iranian media enjoys full freedom--something which the  neighbours should understand.    The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman rejected the claim  that Iran has supported one of the sides in the Yemen conflict  and has provided military assistance to that country, saying:  From the outset of the conflict the Islamic Republic of Iran has  clearly announced its stance expressing regret over the outbreak  of clashes and concern over the division and separation of the  Muslim brethren of Yemen. Also, the Islamic Republic of Iran,  while opposing any kind of military operations and adopting a  neutral stance, announced its willingness to carry out mediation  in the conflict.    In this connection he added: Iran is deeply interested in  preventing the foreign provoked dismemberment of Islamic  countries and believes that differences among Muslims should be  resolved through peaceful means. Therefore, Iran deeply regrets  the killing of any Muslim in Yemen -- whether from the south or  the north -- and calls on the warring sides to put an end to the  war and begin talks, which should be aimed at preserving Yemen's  integrity. Iran also calls on others to show restraint and not  become a source for the dangerous escalation of the crisis.</p>

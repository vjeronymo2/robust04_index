			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Customs predicts Pounds 250m duty loss NEW single-market personal allowances on drink and cigarettes carried into the UK from other European Community countries are expected to cost the government Pounds 250m a year in lost Customs duties, the Commons trade and industry committee was told yesterday, David Dodwell writes. Mr Michael Knox, head of the Customs and Excise Single Market Unit, said 150 Customs officers had been deployed across the UK in an effort to clamp down on illegal imports. He added that on average one illegal sale a day had been detected since border controls on trade were abolished on January 1. Most of the cases involved duty evasion of Pounds 1,000 or less.</p>

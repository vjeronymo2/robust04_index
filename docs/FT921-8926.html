			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Japan braces itself for yet another scandal: Gangsters and two former executives of big parcel delivery company are questioned - Prosecutors suggest some funds came to rest in the bank accounts of leading MPs, both government and opposition JAPAN witnessed the ceremonial start yesterday to another long-playing scandal. Investigators raided company offices and gangster haunts, and hinted that they were following a trail of alleged bribery likely to lead to the upper ranks of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Details of the Sagawa Kyubin Scandal have been common knowledge for several months, and the first whispers were heard a year ago. But a scandal doesn't become a Scandal in Japan until police and prosecutors, in the presence of television cameras, go through the motions of a large-scale raid, signifying to the nation that the game has begun. For the moment, the targets of police questioning are two former executives of the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, the country's second largest parcel delivery company, and members of Inagawakai, the gangster group also entangled in the securities industry scandals last year. Prosecutors allege that the former Tokyo Sagawa executives, Mr Hiroyasu Watanabe and Mr Jun Saotome, had abused their authority by organising Y528bn (Pounds 2.32bn) in loans and guarantees, much of it for land and stock speculation. And, the prosecutors suggest, some of the funds eventually came to rest in the bank accounts of leading MPs, both government and opposition. While prosecutors furnished showing the complex route followed by the parcel company's money, Japanese were left wondering last night whether they would eventually see another spate of political resignations or whether prosecutors will be content to put a few allegedly corrupt executives in the stocks. The case resembles the Recruit Scandal of three years ago, when Recruit, a business information company, was shown to have provided politicians and executives with cut-price shares in return for assistance to the ambitious and fast-expanding company. Mr Noboru Takeshita was forced to resign as prime minister and the LDP was badly bruised in an upper house election. Yet only two minor politicians were indicted on bribery charges, and many implicated MPs have returned to high office, including the present prime minister, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa. The very public investigation is now focused on whether the two Tokyo Sagawa executives violated the commercial code by allegedly raising the Y528bn in funds between 1987 and mid-1991. Prosecutors say that more than Y100bn went to companies associated with Inagawakai, the gangster group, which apparently used the money for stock and property speculation in its shift towards 'respectable' activities. Whatever the investigation's outcome, the Sagawa Kyubin scandal again emphasises to Japanese that the structure of the country's political system makes corruption inevitable. The cost of being a politician, with gift-giving and palm-greasing part of the daily routine, prompts unholy alliances with shady executives and ambitious companies. LDP officials hope the complexity of the case will keep prosecutors preoccupied until after upper house elections due in July. Mr Miyazawa announced he was 'aware that raids have taken place,' while the chief cabinet secretary, Mr Koichi Kato, hoped that the investigation would be 'strict and fair' and that the opposition parties would not use the scandal to delay the passing of budget bills.

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] An article by Vesna Kostic and  Aleksandra Bilanovic in the 13 May edition of the Belgrade news  weekly NIN examined the increase in the number of wealthy people  in Serbia and the manner in which they achieved their wealth.  Only a few of the newly rich became so through "entrepreneurial  ability," according to the authors. The rest acquired their  wealth through "connections and acquaintances, institutional  concessions, market monopolies, and natural resource  concessions." NIN pointed out that some of the new rich,  "through lobbying and bribes, ensured privileged positions for  themselves in the granting of loans (especially last year from  primary issue, or currency issued without backing), the  distribution of strategic products, and the issuance of permits  to engage in the import-export trade and real estate  transactions."    The article cited Dr. Aleksandra Posarac of the Belgrade  Institute of Economic Science, who said that "a variety of  mechanisms for plundering the people" exist and that they offer  "ideal conditions for amassing enormous capital without work."  In essence, according to Dr. Posarac, it is a matter of  redistributing existing public resources. She defined these as  foreign trade firms and all other public companies; society  bears the risk while the profit goes into private pockets. The  Dafiment Bank also played a significant role in the enrichment  of individuals, in Posarac's opinion. "The lists of Dafiment  depositors that have been made public account for the  disappearance of only tens of millions of German marks, but the  question of what happened to the 200 million that are  unaccounted for remains. Where are they?"    In a box titled "Who They Are and How Much They Have," NIN  published a list of the Serbian new rich, qualifying it as  incomplete and based on unverified assessments by business  partners, acquaintances, and "accessible publications." NIN  observed that the list shows that the rich are for the most part  people who participate or participated in the government, who  were or are directors of public enterprises, and who worked or  still work in public foreign trade firms. Several of the  individuals on the list, the weekly noted, have connections with  Genex, a Belgrade firm also known as Generalexport that,  according to the 1990 Trade Directory of Yugoslavia, engaged in  foreign and domestic trade, representation of foreign firms,  tourism, hotel management, and air transport. The list consists  of the following names:    -- The Karic brothers: Their total assets are assessed at  $100-150 million; they own firms (trade offices) in almost all  of the states of former Soviet Union, from Moscow and Kiev to  Tashkent and Uzbekistan; they have opened firms on the other  side of the Atlantic; they have at their disposal huge business  offices in Belgrade; they have a house in Pec, Serbia, seven  apartments in New Belgrade, and a villa in the Dedinje section  of Belgrade. They own a huge piece of property near London with  three medieval castles, one of which has as many as 38 rooms,  luxurious swimming pools, and a thoroughbred horse farm.    -- Zoran Drakulic: His worth is assessed at $100 million; in  Cyprus he has a company with the name East Point; in Belgrade  his company is called Ju Point and in Budapest Ein Point. This  former Genex official "has expanded his business so much that he  has even opened an office in China."    -- Miroslav Miskovic: There are rumors that he has capital  of  $35-40 million dollars; former director of Zupa of Krusevac and  former member of the Serbian Government, he is the largest  shareholder of the Delta company (foreign trade, a bank, and the  Deltino restaurant). He has a luxurious villa in "Neimar."    -- Zoran Kacar: He is worth $15-20 million; he was the first  to start purchasing hard currency for deposits into "giro"  accounts through Interplast Trejd; he owns several apartments in  Belgrade and a house on the coast; he is owner of a chain of  bakeries in the United States and a large number of firms in  Austria, Sweden, Germany, and Cyprus. There is a rumor in  Belgrade that because of a conflict with the authorities he left  the country and now lives in the United States.    -- Zoran Markovic: He owns the Bel Pagetta firm, and he  claims that the investment in this project amounted to $2  million, but "it is unlikely that he has at his disposal less  than $5 million"; he has been expanding his business into Poland  and Slovenia and is expected to expand into Romania and The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; he lives in a Genex  company apartment.    -- Nikola Kitanovic: The man who invented "Raul Amon" says  that the assessment of his worth at over $10 million is very  modest; he expects a profit of $130 million from a contract  recently signed with a Chinese firm.    -- Dr. Nenad Djordjevic: This former State Security Service  official and instructor at the Advanced School of the Ministry  of Internal Affairs is today owner of the VTS firm; his worth  has been assessed at between $50-130 million.    -- Mirko Marjanovic (Serbian prime minister): It has been  assessed that he has $50 million in cash.    -- Dragan Tomic (minister in the Serbian Government,  coordinator of the new economic program, and director of the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's largest furniture company,  Simpo): NIN did not succeed in discovering his worth, but it is  claimed that his assets are for the most part in London in a  firm that belongs to his son, who is in the re-export business.    -- Zoran Obradovic: A former Genex employee, he is the owner  of the Petromet firm; his worth has been assessed at about $10  million.    -- Miki Savicevic: Former director of Genex, he has firms in  Switzerland and Russia; it is believed that his worth is about  $10 million.    -- Milenko Isakov: He is the owner of the MCS firm, which  exports copper; his worth has been assessed to tens of million  of dollars.    -- Sinisa Radosevic: also a former Genex employee, he is in  the agricultural business and is worth up to $10 million.    The list does not include Radoman Bozovic, Federal Assembly  speaker, and Dusan Matkovic, general director of the ferrous  metallurgy firm Sartid-13 and former minister of industry,  although their names are "most often publicly mentioned," NIN  states, adding that this is because no one is willing to give  any information whatsoever on the way the two obtained their  wealth and on the amount of their wealth. "Many names are  mentioned in a whisper and with fear, which not only reveals  that what is at issue may be the wealth obtained through illegal  means, but also that these are people who have a tendency to  resort to violence and malevolent displays of their power." Very  often what is at issue are personalities from the "demimonde"  and even the "real underworld." Thus, for example, a certain  Manda is mentioned as the owner of a rather large number of  gambling houses and boutiques, but merely mentioning his first  name is considered to place the safety of one's family at risk,  NIN says, adding that the same is true of attempts to decipher  the origin of the wealth of Zeljko Raznjatovic Arkan and his  close associates.    In its 27 May issue, NIN reports that Serbian Prime Minister  Mirko Marjanovic, whose name appears on the list above, has  filed a complaint at the First Municipal Court in Belgrade  against the NIN journalists who wrote the article for "damage to  his reputation and honor."</p>

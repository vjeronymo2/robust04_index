			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GIVING FREELY;  </P> <P> POLA SPENDS DAYS WITH TROUBLED YOUTHS, AFTERNOONS AS UNPAID WESTLAKE ASSISTANT  </P> <P> How is it that a guy who never relinquished so much as a yard in his final  three seasons as a Pacific 10 Conference fullback, can't stop giving now?  </P> <P> Doesn't want to stop, for that matter?  </P> <P> Kennedy Pola, who was born the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated, is a giver  like Don King is a talker, like Donald Trump is a spender; his time, his  knowledge, his self.  </P> <P> When Jim Benkert was hired recently as Westlake High's football coach, he went  home and dialed a phone number: Kennedy Pola's.  </P> <P> Pola accepted Benkert's offer of a position as an assistant, but when Benkert  eventually broached the subject of money, Pola balked. Only not in the sense  one would expect.  </P> <P> "Kennedy does not want to be paid," Benkert said. "He is sincere in this is  what he wants to do. He insists on not taking any money. He's definitely a  giver and not a taker. In fact, when I asked him about it, he looked me  straight in the eye and said, 'I'm not going to be paid. Put the money into the  program.' "  </P> <P> Benkert is in the process of surrounding himself with a coaching staff of  former players, including Terry Tumey and Tommy Taylor of UCLA, both of whom  were recommended by Pola. But it is Pola who has made the biggest impact to  date. Benkert and Pola were fellow members of Crespi's coaching staff last  season.  </P> <P> "Coach Pola gets you pumped up, really, because he gets so fired up himself,"  said Luke Crawford, a returning running back for Westlake. "He's a good  motivator.  </P> <P> "After last year's season, everybody was down. But when we heard of all the  experience we were getting and the new offense, we were all happy."  </P> <P> Pola, however, does not limit his enthusiasm to the high school football field.  His work, as a representative for Griffin Homes, a large Southern California  land developer, is perhaps most impressive.  </P> <P> What Pola actually is is an alternative.  </P> <P> The mammoth former USC fullback works the streets of Pacoima like a hustler  plays a pool hall. The bait is Pola's 6-foot-1, 270-pound frame, his gregarious  personality and a chance at an alternative life style. The children of  crime-ridden Pacoima are the catch.  </P> <P> Pola, who is part of a staff of such workers, is the front man of sorts for  Griffin Homes.  </P> <P> "The problem out here is youth," Pola said. "A lot of the kids live with their  grandmothers and there are no jobs available. It's really tough. Drugs are  everywhere. Being a part of a gang is being a part of something."  </P> <P> Which is where Pola and the staff at Griffin Homes, which is building a  townhouse complex in Pacoima, comes in.  </P> <P> Among other things, they provide jobs on the construction sites, run basketball  leagues, offer counseling and generally provide a positive image in a  neighborhood badly in need of one. Pola, it seems, is driven by the concept of  helping the children who, before they met him, didn't realize they could help  themselves.  </P> <P> "I love kids," he said. "I love working with anybody who wants to do anything  with their life. And you don't do it by telling them, but by showing them  options. By being there every day. Every day.  </P> <P> "Out here, you can't promise and not keep up."  </P> <P> Since December, Pola, 25, has wandered the streets during the day and at night,  offering his alternative.  </P> <P> "I deal with the kids, the drug dealers and the gang bangers," he said. "For  the first three months they thought I was a cop. But I'm not here to turn in  the drug dealers, I'm here to challenge them. I'm here to challenge them for  every kid in this neighborhood."  </P> <P> They are new challenges for Pola, who is of Samoan descent. His old ones  consisted primarily of keeping his ailing knees, the subjects of eight  surgeries, in good enough shape to last through one more Saturday afternoon. He  played at USC from 1982-85, carrying the ball 139 times for 681 yards. He was a  blocking back who went unclaimed in the National Football League's draft in  1986.  </P> <P> But shortly thereafter, a Tampa Bay Buccaneer official contacted him and  offered him the job of blowing open holes for a rookie running back out of  Auburn named Bo Jackson. Jackson, however, never signed with Tampa Bay, and  Pola's knees had seen enough anyway. He left training camp early and returned  to Southern California to marry Diane Griffin, his college sweetheart. Yes,  those Griffins.  </P> <P> "They say when you're down," Pola said, "and you can find some other incentive  that will help you leave it, you will choose it."  </P> <P> Terry Tumey met Pola at the Rose Bowl. In fact, they met like one would figure  a nose guard and a fullback would meet: paint to paint somewhere around the  50-yard line.  </P> <P> Tumey was in the midst of his first of three seasons as an All-Pac-10 player  for UCLA.  </P> <P> "I tackled him," Tumey said, "and said, 'Aren't you Kennedy Pola?' Then I  helped him up and shook his hand.  </P> <P> "We were acquaintances before. Now I consider us buddies. Now that we're  graduated."  </P> <P> So, when Pola approached Tumey about helping out with a certain high school  football program in transition, Tumey consented. It will be his first try at  coaching.  </P> <P> "I knew nothing about Westlake except they were having a little trouble with  football," said Tumey, who will help coach the defense. "I thought I'd see what  the other side was like. I wanted to be the wagon driver instead of the one  pulling it."  </P> <P> Tumey also is employed by Griffin Homes, where he has grown closer to Pola.  </P> <P> "Kennedy's a great guy," he said. "He's got a lot of personality and gives a  lot of himself."  </P> <P> Several days a week, Pola sheds his size-54 sports coat and makes the drive  from Pacoima to Westlake, where he and Diane live, for football practice at the  local high school. As Pola sees it, some of the problems in the two areas may  be different, but he figures he can help nonetheless.  </P> <P> You see, it's not about football, necessarily. It's about giving.  </P> <P> "That's what I'm trying to show these kids," he said. "This is not all you  have. Let me show you something else.  </P> <P> "I want them to do so much better. If they need to use me to do it, they can do  it. I'm happy with my life, and I want others to be happy, too."  </P></p>

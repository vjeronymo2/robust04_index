			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / FT Satellite Monitor: Dish installations decline sharply a drop of more than 45,000 compared with December. Sales last month were, however, more than three times higher than in January last year, according to the FT Satellite Monitor. The figures, based on monthly interviews with a sample of more than 4,000 adults, takes the number of UK homes with satellite dishes to 2.2m. The number of those who say they will definitely or probably install satellite television totals 1.86m, scarcely changed from a year ago. In that time 800,000 dishes have been installed. Mr John Clemens, chairman of Continental Research, which produces the FT Monitor, said yesterday that the results showed that the dish market still needed stimulation through advertising and special offers. 'The market will need constant promotion and good programming if it is to achieve (as Continental predicts) over 1m new installations in 1992,' Mr Clemens said. Satellite channels are taking more than 25 per cent of viewing in homes with dishes compared with 40 per cent for ITV alone.</p>

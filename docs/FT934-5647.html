			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Satellite network for VW dealers Scientific-Atlanta, the communications technology group, is to provide a private satellite network for Volkswagen which will eventually link its dealers all over Europe. When it is complete the VSAT (very small aperture terminal) network will be by far the largest in Europe with several thousand terminals. As many as 300 dealers are to be linked to the network within the next year mainly in the eastern part of Germany where the telecommunications infrastructure is poor. It is believed to be the first example of a manufacturing company, as opposed to financial services groups, setting up its own VSAT network in Europe. The network will handle everything from data communications and broadcast video for staff training to credit-card verification and the provision of in-store music. After the links are established with VW dealers in eastern Germany the network will be expanded to cover dealers in the rest of Germany and then across Europe. VSAT networks are common in the US and by the end of last year more than 100,000 terminals had been installed worldwide, adding up to a Dollars 350m (Pounds 234m) a year business. They are less common in Europe with an estimated 2,000 terminals in use, mostly in Germany. Apart from financial services they are mainly used by governments. In the Volkswagen deal Scientific-Atlanta will be the equipment provider and V-Crest Systems Europe, a wholly-owned Volkswagen subsidiary will manage the project. Scientific-Atlanta claims that VSAT networks can offer 20-30 per cent discounts on traditional land line communication. Volkswagen says in many parts of eastern Germany it is impossible to link dealers using a traditional terrestrial network. The Atlanta-based company decided to enter the European VSAT market last year mainly because of the European Union's moves towards deregulation of telecommunications markets.</p>

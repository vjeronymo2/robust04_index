			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Technology: Forming a brand new gel Bran, the staple of the healthy breakfast cereal, is earning itself a new image - as a source for a supergel which could be used in wound dressings, industrial lubricants and food. GB Gels, of Swansea, has developed a process for making polysaccharide (complex sugar) gels from vegetable and cereal by-products. American corn bran, the waste left after the cereal is milled, is proving particularly useful. The company has already signed a worldwide licensing agreement with Seton Healthcare for the Oldham-based company to use the gel in wound dressings. Seton hopes its first product will be a clear hydrogel which will be used to keep wounds moist and so promote healing, says Graham Collyer, director for product development and regulatory affairs. Other uses are numerous. The gel could be used as an inert base to carry medicines in ointment form. Because it is bio-degradable, unlike today's synthetic gels, it could be used in agriculture or as a lubricant in oil drilling. Most importantly it could be used as a gel in the food industry to replace gelatin or gels made from seaweed. Rod Greenshields, chief executive officer of GB Gels, believes US and continental European consumers could be the first to benefit from the developments because the licensing of new food substances is more conducive to the gel there than in the UK. As bran is approved for food use in the US, France and Germany, the gel could easily be approved as a derivative, says Greenshields. In the UK, the new gel would have to go through lengthy approvals as a new food additive. The process developed by GB Gels is similar to brewing beer. The useable part of the bran is extracted to produce a liquid extract which is treated with enzymes to make the gel. This can be spray-dried if needed to form a powder. It can also be passed through a series of purification processes for truly sterile medical purposes.</p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil companies meet on Azerbaijan project WESTERN OIL companies involved in negotiations over a Dollars 9bn project to develop three oilfields in the Azerbaijan sector of the Caspian Sea are meeting in New York today following talks with the new Azeri government last Thursday. The group of eight western oil companies saw long-term talks with Socar, the Azeri state oil company, interrupted recently by political upheaval in the republic which replaced the populist government with hardliners. The companies are continuing to discuss plans in New York for unifying the three oilfields in one development in spite of indications that the new government could switch back to individual negotiations. Mr Stephen Remp, chairman and chief executive of Ramco, a small UK oil services company which is involved in the talks said the companies had instructions from Socar, the Azeri state oil company to continue talks on integrating the development. He said that the group of eight oil companies including British Petroleum, Amoco and Pennzoil hoped to hear from the Azeri government this week. The Azeris are being represented in New York by their advisers, Morgan Grenfell. Socar yesterday indicated to the Reuter news agency that the Azeri government would be looking for more profit from the deal and could throw open the negotiations to other oil companies. 'The new government wants to see what is going on, but there is a strong desire to move forward quickly by both the government and Socar,' Mr Remp said. He added that it would severely delay the projects if a tender were to be put out to other oil companies. The western partners are talking about the development of the Guneshli, Azeri and Chirakh fields offshore of Baku. Guneshli is already in production, but the other two fields need to be explored and developed. The three fields are estimated to contain 4bn barrels of oil.</p>

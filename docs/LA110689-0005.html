			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MENTAL TRAUMA  </P> <P> We have been told of those people, including many who became homeless, who  suffered mental trauma from the recent hurricane on the East Coast and the  earthquake in the Bay Area. Mental health professionals and the media have made  an effort to inform the public about the trauma and how it is treated.  </P> <P> This, of course, is as it should be. But what about the homeless who end up on  the streets for other reasons? They, too, suffer mental trauma when they become  homeless, but this is ignored. The trauma, plus the stress the homeless  continue to experience, appears to destroy initiative in many and the ability  to cope.  </P> <P> Isn't it cruel to say that "those people don't want to work"? And can't their  trauma-induced suffering be acknowledged and treated in an enlightened and  humane manner?  </P> <P> G.D. RIEMENSCHNEIDER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

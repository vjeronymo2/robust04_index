			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kostas Iordhanidhis] </F>   [Excerpts] The Balkan operetta staged last week by the  Albanian regime proves that, just as his predecessors Enver  Hoxha and Ramiz Alia, [Albanian President] Sali Berisha needs to  invoke a "foreign threat in order to survive domestically."    To carry out domestic terrorism, Hoxha built a series of  pill  boxes throughout the fields and beaches of Albania. [passage  omitted]    Today Hoxha's "defense system" seems hilarious, but it  worked  effectively in justifying economic sacrifices and enforcing  internal terrorism for decades. Berisha, who is a product of  the same system, resorted to the same technique to justify a  possible increase in "security measures" in North Epirus.    The incident of the murder of two men at an Albanian  military  camp, if indeed it happened, appears to be a classic provocation  or invention. The reports about the infiltration of persons in  Greek uniforms who attacked the Albanian military camp reminds  one of similar hoaxes by Hoxha's regime, who in 1983, for the  last time, made allegations to the international public that  foreign agents had invaded the Albanian coast. Their names were  never made public, but the security authorities claimed that the  suspects were masked and carried foreign currency, Greek  drachmas and Italian lira. [passage omitted]    The dominant view in Athens is that Berisha was encouraged  by  Western governments, with particular suspicion centering on  Turkey, in order to launch this extremely powerful attack on  Greece with verbal charges and letters to the Security Council.    What is most probable though, is that the Albanian president  attempted to capitalize on the prevailing negative climate to  add one more charge that Greece is destabilizing the Balkans.    Having limited political experience, however, he went beyond  the tolerable limits, which reliable sources say prompted the  United States and Germany to intervene to calm things down.  This should finally lead to the resolution of the whole crisis,  especially following Berisha's retreat on Thursday [14 April]  when he noted that the Greek Government may not be completely  responsible for the incident at Episkopi.    Furthermore, Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi agreed  to hold a meeting with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias,  proposing 21 April in Bucharest. He said he is open to other  dates and venues. In addition, Albania agreed to convene an  experts' meeting--which had long been planned--and it will also  deal with the border incident. The Albanians have not yet given  a positive answer to the Greek Government's proposal for a  meeting between the commanders of the Gjirokaster and Ioannina  military units.    Irrespective of the turn that the Greek-Albanian crisis has  taken, however, it is clear by now that the situation could very  easily get out of control with very serious consequences for the  region's stability as well as the welfare of the Greek minority  in Albania.    It is clear that the Berisha regime is concerned not simply  because of the so-called "politicization" of the minority, but  mainly because of the activities of the Greeks which make them  the most important economic factor in North Epirus and the whole  of Albania.    From this point of view, it is not a accidental that the  Albanian authorities have recently arrested Greek businessmen  for possessing foreign currency (Greek drachmas), changed the  customs officials along the Greek-Albanian border, changed signs  written in Greek, and exercised tremendous pressure on small  businessmen and other residents of North Epirus.    It is obvious that the issue of the Greek minority must be  dealt with in a new framework, because it is not possible for  the Greeks of Albania to be plunged from a being under police  observation into being hostages to serve the domestic needs of  the regime in Tirana. [passage omitted]    Our country's policy toward the Greeks of Albania should  have  clear goals and firm in tone, and it should at least aim to  safeguard all their rights as provided by international  agreements. No government or political system in Greece can  tolerate the enslavement of the North Epirus residents.</p>

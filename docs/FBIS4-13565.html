			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Arye Kiesel] </F>   [Text] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 1994 training year  "got off on the wrong foot."    A senior Army element has said: It is evident even now that  the training plan is not being carried out, and the crack  infantry units' training has been "significantly impaired" by  the operational activities in Hebron and elsewhere in the  territories.    In recent days, top IDF echelons have voiced great concern  over the fact that dozens of elite infantry companies had been  taken off the training schedule and dispatched to the  territories, primarily to protect local Jews. The problem  encompasses companies from the entire Infantry Corps.    Many companies are busy safeguarding the existence of the  closure on the "divide" between the territories and Israel.  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who has been recently informed  about damage to the training plan, said yesterday that "the work  load of the regular troops in the territories is immense." He  added that this year soldiers and reservists will again share  the load.    A senior military figure said yesterday: "We expected a  significant decrease in the reserve units' work load, but we  could not foresee the Hebron massacre and the ensuing wave of  terror attacks which tied the regular army up in routine  security tasks at the expense of training. We must ensure the  regular troops' combat readiness, and therefore, we have to call  up reservists."    Last month, numerous reserve units replaced regular troops  in  the territories. Many of these units were called up on short  notice on speedy call-up procedures.    The senior military source added: "Even now I know our  training plan will be seriously affected, and this must be  averted despite the IDF's duty to continually take care of  routine security."    To ease the reserve troops' work load, the IDF plans to  establish guard and security units, but this plan is unlikely to  ease the infantry and armored units' work load at this stage.  Thus they will again serve dozens of reserve duty days this  year, and they will serve them in the territories.</p>

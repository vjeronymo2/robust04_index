			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Investment in people being forgotten Sir, Your surveys of the engineering industry (Ingenuity, September 14 1993 and March 25 1994), have missed a fundamental ingredient in the creation of wealth. In addition to a financial infrastructure conducive to long-term investment in appropriate plant, the corresponding investment in people is essential. While training and skill-upgrading are the current fashion, they need a professional foundation to be of real benefit. In recent years, the professional bodies have demanded higher academic attainment, relevant postgraduate training and responsible experience before admitting candidates to corporate membership to raise the overall competence of the registered engineering community; especially pertinent with the accelerating pace of technological advance. Given the pressure of returns on investment and the capital intensity of new technology, a level of technological expertise corresponding to the financial supplied by chartered accountants and legal by qualified lawyers should be a prerequisite. The closer to the point of investment decisions registered engineers can be found, the better informed technologically such decisions are likely to be, as our more successful industrial competitors have shown over several generations. Coverage of this point and its effect upon our relative industrial performance would add value to your reviews. Ralph Sabry-Grant, chartered electrical engineer, 32 Grange Gardens, Pinner, Middlesex HA5 5QE</p>

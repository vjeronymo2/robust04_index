			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Kuwait MPs censure managers of KIO A KUWAITI parliamentary report has taken the Kuwait Investment Office's management, both past and present, to task over actions taken since a shake-up last year following the Dollars 5bn collapse of the KIO's investments in Spain, Reuter reports from London. The Kuwait finance and economics committee, which is scathing about former managers, criticises the new team for its handling of investments, its conduct in legal action, costs and use of advisers. Accusing former senior officials of fraud and mismanagement, it calls for a wider probe into management still in place in Britain, Spain and 'up the scale of responsibility'. The KIO's Spanish arm, Grupo Torras, went into receivership in December, eight months after Mr Ali Rashaid Al Badr took over as president. The KIO is now pursuing the unit's former president, Sheikh Fahad Al Sabah, general manager Mr Fouad Jaffar, Spanish agent Mr Javier de la Rosa and other former officials, seeking Dollars 1bn in criminal damages in Madrid and Dollars 510m in civil damages in London. Allegations of secret political payments for support after the 1990 Iraqi invasion emerged in the report into Dollars 300m of Torras funds not yet traced. Kuwait finance minister Mr Nasser Abdulla Al-Rodhan has denied the allegations. Former managers say they have been singled out, for political reasons, in a power struggle in Kuwait, which Kuwaiti sources say is aimed mainly at Mr Al-Rodhan's predecessor, Sheikh Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah, a senior member of the royal family close to the Emir. On Friday a Madrid court threw out the Spanish case for the third time and the British trial could take up to five years, costing up to Pounds 60m (Dollars 90m), sources close to the KIO say. The report asks why claims against all Torras directors, including those still on the board, are not being made and says foreign investments should be taken away from the KIO in London.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / White House accused of Iraq loan 'cover-up' THE Bush administration sought to 'suppress the truth' about US government knowledge of more than Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.5bn) in illegal loans made to Iraq by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), an Atlanta court was told yesterday. Mr Bobby Lee Cooke, a prominent Georgia lawyer who is representing Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former BNL Atlanta branch manager, also began naming senior BNL executives in Rome who, he alleged, helped to orchestrate the loans. BNL has in the past denied that anyone in its Rome headquarters knew about the Iraqi loans. Mr Cooke, seeking to transform what was to have been a sentencing hearing for Mr Drogoul into an impromptu trial, said he would provide evidence in court to explain how the US government 'from the very onset has tried to suppress the truth and mislead this court'. He called the BNL case 'the mother of all cover-ups' and said the position of the Department of Justice 'denies all logic and Socratic reasoning and, most importantly, is not the truth'. In a 55-page sentencing memorandum the Justice Department had accused Mr Drogoul of being the sole orchestrator of the Iraqi loans, more than Dollars 2bn of which went to help President Saddam Hussein's nuclear, chemical weapons, cluster bomb and ballistic missile projects. Mr Drogoul admitted his guilt in June and reached a co-operation agreement with US prosecutors. However, Mr Cooke said he cancelled the agreement as the government was trying to put words into his client's mouth. Judge Marvin Shoob, presiding over the BNL case, appears sympathetic to Mr Cooke's argument. The judge told prosecutors yesterday their theory that Mr Drogoul orchestrated the entire loan scheme was 'difficult to believe'. In court yesterday Mr Cooke said he would introduce evidence to show that: US intelligence officials working for the National Security Agency (NSA) made regular visits to Mr Drogoul in Atlanta and were briefed on the BNL-Iraqi loans. Mr Giacomo Pedde, the former director general of BNL, was among those aware of the Atlanta loan. A senior US government official and the Iraqi ambassador met Mr Drogoul in Washington in the autumn of 1988 and encouraged him to provide Iraq with US government loan guarantees. Senior White House and State Department officials interfered in the BNL case by telephoning prosecutors in Atlanta. Aides to Judge Shoob said they expected the unusual Atlanta court hearing to continue all week as the government and Mr Cooke provided evidence and questioned witnesses.</p>

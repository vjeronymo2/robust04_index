			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN THE AMERICAS;  </P> <P> EVERY GOOD-BYE AIN'T GONE;  </P> <P> FAMILY PORTRAITS AND PERSONAL ESCAPADES BY ITABARI NJERI (TIMES BOOKS: $17.95;  226 PP.; 0-8129-1805-3)  </P> <P> The title of this collection of nonfiction stories linked mostly by family  relationships (a first book that began as fiction but ended as "literal truth")  comes from an African-American proverb: "Every shut-eye ain't sleep; every  good-bye ain't gone."  </P> <P> In demonstrating that life's farewells are not necessarily permanent,  journalist/essayist Itabari Njeri travels to and away from a name, a culture, a  gift and -- most of all -- an extended Afro-American/Afro-Caribbean family that  is "too large, too loving in ways that negate the love itself, and too  demanding."  </P> <P> It is a journey of conversions, as well as discoveries and farewells: from the  child who loved music and made it a "god"; to the girl who changed her name and  acculturation -- seeing things only in black and white; to the woman who  discovers the necessary value of synthesis. She takes a path from extreme and  demanding "gods" to "balance."  </P> <P> Among the extreme forces in Njeri's life is her enormous family. It is a  veritable New World bazaar -- an assortment of aunts, uncles, cousins and  grandparents of varying colors and sizes whose multi-ethnic quality could  belong only to the Americas. The author is African, East Indian, Amer-Indian  and English -- the great-great-great-granddaughter of a rum-running English  pirate whose castle still stands in Barbados.  </P> <P> But, the author feels, this background would be deemed improbable by most  Americans. "So institutionalized," she says, "is the ignorance of our history,  our culture, our everyday existence that, often, we do not even know  ourselves."  </P> <P> Njeri, however, is determined to "know" -- and to write the truth. She is  obsessed by family secrets, for they are also keys to self-knowledge. And  within the natural duality of black-American life, family secrets also can be  the means of understanding a whole people.  </P> <P> Njeri's opening story, "Granddaddy," outlines a journey to Georgia to solve a  major family mystery: the search for the man responsible for the death of her  grandfather more than 20 years before. All her life, she had heard the family  story that drunken, drag-racing, white boys had collided with her grandfather's  car and killed him -- but the accident had been covered up.  </P> <P> She finds the killer, but no emotional catharsis. The rumors that made her  grandfather a martyr to racism just aren't true. There was no drag-racing, and  no cover-up. There was, in fact, a monetary settlement in favor of the widow --  something that she (the grandfather's second wife) had neglected to tell the  rest of the family.  </P> <P> There is no guilt, but there is no innocence either. Betrayal and casual racism  pervade. A white doctor, considered a family friend, calls the grandfather a  "bad man" who basically deserved to die because he favored integration and  belonged to the NAACP. And when her grandfather's wife (who looked white) ran  through the streets in her nightgown to the accident scene, a white policeman  said, "Don't worry yourself ma'am. It's just a nigger."  </P> <P> The truth leaves Njeri only with unresolved anger and bitterness against an  "insidious . . . social system that . . . seemingly left no one to blame, as if  systems do not bear the marks of their creators."  </P> <P> Njeri is a gifted and generous writer who rarely hides her feelings. These  explorations of family myths and revelations of family conflict are a tumble of  colliding emotions -- love, hate, anger, regret -- and are often very funny.  She is most successful in delineating family quirks and eccentricities.  </P> <P> The problem with families, of course, is coming to terms with them and finding  a separate identity. Like the "Sleeping Beauty" ballet with its gift-bestowing  good and bad fairies, every child feels both blessed and cursed at birth by its  family. Every gift is double-edged.  </P> <P> From her philosopher/historian father, who sang like Irish tenor John  McCormack, the author receives her greatest gift -- a beautiful voice. She has  the "celestial vibration," her father says. But she feels love from him only  when she sings, for he is an abusive, embittered alcoholic -- an  "African-American intellectual in crisis," his career thwarted by racism and  his own Marxist politics. She admires him as a teacher but hates him as a  father. And parental separations are a fact of her Brooklyn and Harlem  growing-up.  </P> <P> From her mother, a lapsed Catholic professional nurse of West Indian heritage,  she learns to "persevere with grace." But her mother refuses to admit that  alcohol has destroyed her husband and most of her family. This large West  Indian family also is cursed by "colorism" -- Alice Walker's word for the  African-American obsession with skin color.  </P> <P> "Colorism" has wreaked havoc. Because Cousin Jeff looked like Ricky Nelson, he  had to prove that he was the "baddest nigger on the block," finding heroin,  prison and death on a Harlem rooftop in the process. But Great Aunt May passed  for white to join the segregated ILGWU as a "Romanian," and her brown-skinned  sister, Ruby (the author's grandmother), refuses to speak to her.  </P> <P> Religion is another source of conflict. At Cousin Jeff's wake, the bemused  priest obviously tries to figure out the relationship of the white man in the  coffin to "all these very dark and very light and everything-between people,"  as decidedly black Protestant "Yes Lords" and "Amens" are interspersed among  the "Hail Marys."  </P> <P> Cultural conflicts ultimately come between the author and music. Caught up in  1970s political fervency, Njeri, a gifted vocal student at New York's High  School of Music and Art, breaks with classicism. She wants to be Leontyne  Price, but she gives up the "devil's" music to join Amiri Baraka's African  nationalist movement.  </P> <P> Baraka renames Jill Moreland "Itabari": Swahili/Arabic for worthy of trust.  "Njeri" is provided by her non-nationalist mother. It is Kikuyu for worthy of a  warrior -- which provoked some amusing reactions when she actually visited  Tanzania.  </P> <P> But African nationalism is a dead end. She finds a political family that is  almost as oppressive as her biological one, and the nationalist message of  self-love and self-esteem sometimes sounds suspiciously like the enemy's racism  -- against "white people in general" and "Jews in particular."  </P> <P> A final stab at music -- this time "doo-wop" -- is another dead end. She gives  up music for journalism. There is a distinct sense of lost love, and regret, in  this book. The author mourns her voice with a sense of helpless fatalism: ". .  . what sense is there talking about a gift one failed to use as one might have,  could have, should have."  </P> <P> But she understands that this first love was a victim of politics, family  psychology and her own youth. Quoting African-American author Trey Ellis, on  the new "Black Aesthetic" that "shamelessly borrows and reassembles across both  race and class lines," the author says, "Had I understood that as a teen-ager,  I might still be singing today."  </P> <P> Maybe growing up requires giving up? Njeri has found "balance," she says, and  intellectual satisfaction in writing. She also, in a rather forced ending,  finally finds true love. He is a Latino who debates whether minstrel shows are  racist distortions or only a question of the sincerest form of flattery. The  debate nearly ends the relationship.  </P> <P> But Njeri has reached the point in her journey where cultural differences  matter less than emotional synthesis -- the only sane path between the rock and  hard place of black and white in America.  </P></p>

			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Payment fears hit BET DOUBTS about next year's dividend hit BET's share price after the board reported a fall in first half profits figures and a cut in the interim payout. The business services group announced a 43 per cent fall in profits to Pounds 40.5m, in line with market forecasts, and cut the dividend from 4.25p to 2p. However it was comments from the chief executive that the board, 'will have to consider very carefully the correct level for the following year' that led to fears of a cut in next year's dividend, sending the shares tumbling. The comments also led to fears for this year's full dividend payment although the company said it intends to maintain at 6.5p. By the close the shares had given up 20 to 93p,in heavy trade of 15m shares, as several analysts downgraded profit expectations for both the current and following year to take account of the gloomy trading outlook. BET's broker, BZW, shaved its current year figure by Pounds 14m to Pounds 84m. Tobaccos fall Tobacco groups BAT Industries and Rothmans International lost early gains as the market became convinced that US broker Salomon Brothers had downgraded the groups. Salomons' strategist had removed cigarette and foods group RJR Nabisco from its recommended list but had not mentioned the two UK companies. However, tobacco analyst Ms Diana Temple said there was a persistent worry that US president-elect Mr Bill Clinton might increase federal excise taxes on tobacco at the second stage of the tax bill at the start of January. BAT saw its share price swing round from a gain of 24 earlier in the day to a net fall of 10 at 955p. Rothmans, also overshadowed by the prospect of disappointing interims tomorrow, fell 11 to 596p after being 3 firmer earlier. Wellcome wanted Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome bucked the trend in the market and the sector with a rise of 12 to 1036p. Lehman Brothers pharmaceuticals analyst Mr Stewart Adkins discussed the stock at the morning meeting on his return from a wide ranging US road show. The house has Wellcome as a strong buy and has recommended it to 300 institutional clients over the past month. Meanwhile, Glaxo tumbled 18 to 807p in late trading on concerns that a large seller was moving back into the US market. Dealers said the New York seller offloaded up to 7m American depositary Receipts last week, equivalent to 14m shares. Nervousness ahead of the OPEC conference scheduled to open in Vienna tomorrow took the edge off the oil and gas sector. Earlier, leading oil stocks had made modest progress, reflecting the initial firmer trend of the dollar. The latest slide in the oil price triggered a flurry of selling and the majors were struggling as the market closed. Shell settled 3 off at 542p on 4.1m traded, while BP only just managed to stay in ahead closing a fraction harder at 232 1/2 p on 5.6m. British Gas, helped early in the day by renewed buying thought to have been carried out by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, tumbled late in the session on the appearance of a handful of sizeable selling orders and closed 4 off at 262 1/2 p. A number of chemicals stocks gained at the expense of ICI as concerns grow over the planned demerger of the group. Sellers of ICI, which closed 15 lower at 1009p, moved into Laporte, up 15 at 633p, BOC, 4 better at 741p, and Courtaulds, 3 firmer at 512p. Water shares never recovered from an early bout of weakness and substantially underperformed the rest of the utilities area. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was said to have adopted a more bearish view of the waters although this was not confirmed. However, turnover was unremarkable, with only Yorkshire Water and Severn Trent attracting turnover of over a million shares. The latter slipped 10 to 462p while Yorkshire bucked the overall trend and settled 2 firmer at 531p. Anglian were 8 down at 483p, Thames the same amount easier at 493p and North West, reporting interims tomorrow, 9 1/2 off at 490p. The electricity stocks were moderately easier. Lloyds Bank shares jumped as the market closed, rallying from 494p to end a net 4 higher at 501p in thin turnover. Lloyds Abbey Life raced higher to close 17 up at 390p with dealers pointing out the stock's recent underperformance against the sector. Vodafone eased 3 to 387p in front of interim figures due this morning. Profits are expected to top the Pounds 150m against last year's Pounds 140m, and the dividend increased by around 12 per cent. Electronics group Diploma advanced 22 to 344p after the group's preliminary results eclipsed even the most optimistic of market forecasts. Security and car auctions group ADT jumped 40 to 500p after posting a rise in third-quarter profits to Dollars 41.9m from Dollars 23m. John Mowlem retreated 6 to 73p with the company's broker, Hoare Govett, said to have downgraded estimates for the group. NSM, which rose 45 per cent last week, eased 3 to 55p in front of interim results expected this morning. In a dull property sector, one of the most financially troubled stocks attracted investor attention. Regalian Property, which is in breach of its banking covenants, was lifted on a rumour that a buyer had been found for its prestigious Kensington Palace Gardens. A sale would greatly alleviate Regalian's dire debt situation. The shares rose 1 1/2 to 13 1/2 p in big turnover of 2.6m. Speculation that Vickers would soon announce a one-for-three rights issue continued to depress the shares, which fell 4 to 81p. A profits warning from Dagenham Motors about second-half figures caused the shares to slide 25 to 78p. Lex Service fell 6 to 230p in sympathy. Tomkins added 3 to 215p after County NatWest issued a note indicating it had warmed to the company's bid for RHM, unchanged at 257 1/2 p. Brisk trade of around 14m shares in Tomkins' nil paid shares was seen yesterday though turnover in the ordinaries amounted to only 2.4m. Magazine group EMAP improved 7 to 299p after posting raised half-year results and an improved dividend. However, the headline figure included Pounds 1m from a disposal and broker SG Warburg shaved its full-year estimate by Pounds 2m to Pounds 40m. Television station HTV Group rose 4 to 18p, buoyed by weekend press speculation of a bid for the company. Traders said the share price strength followed an article suggesting that TV-AM which is to lose its transmission licence at the end of December, was stalking the the company. Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) lost ground in active trade after Sunday press reports that the group's profits would fall short of analysts' forecasts for 1992 and 1993. MGN was down 4 at one stage but rebounded to close 1 1/2 off at 79 1/2 p. Big turnover in Compass Group, normally a tightly-held stock, followed a 1.4m agency cross at 478p. SG Warburg was said to be positive and the shares edged up a penny to 479p. Brewer Bass gained, largely at the expense of Whitbread, shares in the former jumping 10 to 575p as some in the market considered its rating undemanding. Whitbread was weakened by a flurry of mostly negative post-results notes. Japanese-owned broker Yamaichi advised clients to take profits. Whitbread slipped 4 to 445p. Doubts whether Etam would again become a bid target for Oceana Investment Corporation circulated among analysts after the Etam chairman sold 120,000 shares on Friday. The shares slipped a penny to 242p. Kwik Save moved forward 9 to 758p ahead of interim results tomorrow. A pre-results buy note from County NatWest for Tate and Lyle, which reports the same day, forecasts that the shares will break 400p within the next three months. The stock added 2 to 359p.

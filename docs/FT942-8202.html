			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / International Company News: Williams turns down Dollars 2bn bid for WilTel Williams Companies, the diversified energy group, yesterday rejected a Dollars 2bn offer from LDDS Communications, an acquisitive US telecommunications group, to buy its subsidiary WilTel, which runs the nation's fourth-largest long-distance network. However, Williams's board said it had authorised management to explore other forms of co-operation with LDDS. Management was also looking at possible alliances with one or more other partners. LDDS, which announced its offer earlier this month, is a long-distance reseller, buying access to long-distance lines in bulk and reselling the access at a profit. It is WilTel's second-largest customer, and has been negotiating a new, long-term contract for services.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / East German bonus for public officials attacked as grotesque GENEROUS extra payments to west German beamte (public officials) to persuade them to work in east Germany have been criticised as 'grotesque' by Mr Heinrich Weiss, head of the BDI employers' organisation. His unusually outspoken attack on 'interest group selfishness' comes a few weeks after the Bonn government decided to offer the beamte a tax-free monthly income top-up of up to DM2,500 (Pounds 836) as part of the new emphasis on establishing an efficient administration in east Germany. This incentive was offered despite the fact that beamte are meant to be prepared to serve wherever the state decides. Mr Weiss points out in a newspaper interview published today that they already enjoy special job security and pension benefits to compensate for the uncertainty created by that duty to the state. The west German beamte are often described as arrogant and insensitive by the east German public officials with whom they work and the extra payments may well have increased resentment. West German companies which have acquired east German subsidiaries are also usually paying incentives to managers to go east, but these tend to be proportionately lower than the beamte incentive. The Treuhand privatisation agency continues to have great difficulty attracting west German managers to help manage the east German companies which cannot be privatised. However, it emerged yesterday that Mr Lothar Spath, former premier of Baden-Wurttemberg, will probably take over as chairman of the prestigious east German Carl Zeiss Jena group, now owned by the Thuringian government.</p>

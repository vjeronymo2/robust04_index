The Commission is redocketing this proceeding as Docket No. PL94&hyph;1&hyph;000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the conference, the Commission would be interested in hearing commenters' views on the following issues:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The pricing differential mechanisms were designed to lessen the pipelines' costs of renegotiating gas supply contracts. The theory was that providing pipelines a means to honor existing contracts while they were being renegotiated would be less expensive for consumers than requiring contracts to be bought out immediately. Has this theory been validated?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. How are the pricing differential cost (PDC) mechanisms functioning?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. What impact, if any, do the PDC mechanisms have on pipelines' renegotiations with producers?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. While the pipelines have been recovering PDCs, what percentage of their overall contract volumes and costs have been finally resolved?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. What impact, if any, does the two-year authorization have on the use of the PDC mechanisms? What type of review should the Commission undertake to evaluate specific PDC mechanisms if a pipeline seeks to extend the authorization? If the Commission were to extend a pipeline's 2-year authorization period, what effect would that have on your response to question 1?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Are there alternatives to the PDC mechanisms?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. If so what are they?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. What impact would these alternatives have on the timing of cost recovery?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. There are various procedural ways the Commission can deal with subsequent quarterly PDC filings where the first filing has been set for hearing. Possible alternative approaches include: establishing new hearings; consolidating new filings with the existing hearing; or, making subsequent filings subject to the first proceeding. Are there other approaches that should also be considered?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission will provide for remote viewing of the conference in Hearing Room 1, 810 First Street, NE., Washington, DC. In addition, if there is sufficient interest, the Capitol Connection may broadcast the conference in the Washington, DC metropolitan area or nationally. Those interested in the local or national television broadcast should call The Capitol Connection at (703) 993&hyph;3100 no later than May 4, 1994. Requests from viewers outside of Washington, DC should be directed to Julia Morelli or Shirley Al-Jarani.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person who wishes to make a formal presentation to the Commission should submit a written request to the Secretary of the Commission no later than May 2, 1994. Written statements to accompany oral presentations are welcomed, but not required. Persons providing written statements should file 15 copies of the statement with the Office of the Secretary by May 16, 1994, and 100 copies at least one hour prior to their oral presentation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All questions concerning the format of the technical conference should be directed to: Mary Hain, Office of the General Counsel, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Room 4010J, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, Telephone: (202) 208&hyph;2143. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

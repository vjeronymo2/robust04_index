			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / EIB chief questions need for new bonds The European Investment Bank yesterday cast doubt on the need for new lending instruments such as 'Union bonds' to fund large rail, road and telecommunications projects in Europe. Sir Brian Unwin, EIB president, said the bank had plenty of spare lending capacity to fund so-called trans-European networks. This would remain the case for at least the next two years. Sir Brian was speaking in Brussels where he reported that EIB lending last year had risen by 15 per cent to Ecu19.6bn (Dollars 21.75bn), compared to Ecu17bn in 1992. Around Ecu7.8bn was advanced to trans-European networks. Late last year, the European Commission, acting on the suggestion of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgian prime minister, produced plans to raise money at cheap rates to lend on to governments to fund the infrastructure projects. The plan aroused concern in the UK and Germany which questioned the suggestion that there was a financing gap. Under a compromise, the Commission has set up a working party including senior officials from all member states - as well as Sir Brian - to first identify 'sensible, viable and economic' projects and then tackle the financing issue. In 1993, the EIB channelled Ecu12.5bn to the poorer regions of the Union. Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland attracted 37 per cent of total EIB lending. The bank also doubled lending outside the EU in Asia, Latin America, and central and Eastern Europe to Ecu1.9bn. It is gearing up for a role in the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza as well as post-apartheid South Africa. However, Sir Brian made clear he has no interest in being drawn into Russia which was 'a wholly new and difficult area'. He expressed optimism that the new European Investment Fund designed to help small and medium-sized businesses would be up and running by April. A consortium of private banks from all 12 member states is expected to put up the required 30 per of the EIF share capital shortly; but Spain, Italy and Luxembourg have yet to ratify amendments to the original statute of the EIB.</p>

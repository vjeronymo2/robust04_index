			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Martin Currie offer for Pacific Horizon lapses Martin Currie Pacific investment trust yesterday announced that it had allowed its offer for Pacific Horizon investment trust to lapse. It did so although the offer had been unanimously recommended by Pacific Horizon's board, and had been accepted by 74.51 per cent of shareholders and 54.42 per cent of warrant holders. This suggested that Jupiter Tyndall Merlin, the fund management company which manages Pacific Horizon, had succeeded in its attempt to block the takeover. Jupiter Tyndall had amassed a 25.1 per cent stake in the company's warrants, and used this to block an earlier offer. Martin Currie Pacific's directors said in a statement yesterday that Jupiter Tyndall 'placed an interpretation on the rights of the warrants which conflicted with that of the board of Martin Currie Pacific and its legal advisers'. The statement went on to say that if the offers had been made unconditional, the board believed Jupiter Tyndall would then have issued legal proceedings. This situation would not have been in the interests of its shareholders, according to Martin Currie. However, Martin Currie made it clear that it was reserving its position and waiting to see the new proposals which Jupiter Tyndall has promised in the near future.</p>

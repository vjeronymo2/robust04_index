			<p>BFN     [Text] The ROK and the United States agreed to take gradual  [tangyejogin] steps for sanctions against North Korea, which in  the end refused the request of the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA].    Correspondent Kim In-kyu reports from Washington:    [Begin Kim recording] Today at the U.S. State Department,  Kim  Sam-hun, ROK nuclear ambassador; and Robert Gallucci, U.S.  assistant secretary of state, discussed appropriate  countermeasures [taehung chochi] against the North Korean act of  violating the Nuclear Safeguards Accord. They shared the view  that they should take gradual sanctions against North Korea at  the earliest possible date.    Following the talks between the ROK and the United States,  Assistant Secretary Gallucci held a special briefing at the  State Department and revealed that there was no difference in  views whatsoever between the two countries on steps to be taken  next, including sanctions against North Korea.    In particular, answering the question on a possibility of  the  beginning of actual sanctions against North Korea within this  month, Assistant Secretary Gallucci said that for this issue,  close consultations will be held with allied nations and with  Standing Committee members of the UN Security Council between  this weekend and next week. Thus, he made it clear that they  will strongly push for sanctions this month.    Nuclear Ambassador Kim Sam-hun revealed that since the  foundation for continuing dialogue with North Korea collapsed,  steps for sanctions against North Korea were discussed with the  United States and the UN Security Council. As a result, they  unanimously expressed the position that a resolution for  practical sanctions must be adopted before it is too late in a  bid to not lose the momentum favorable to sanctions against  North Korea.    Ambassador Kim Sam-hun and Assistant Secretary Gallucci  pointed out that although a method of analyzing fuel rods among  the three possible methods to determine the amount of plutonium  North Korea has extracted up to now has vanished, another  method, including a special inspection of a radiochemical waste  dumping site, still remained. Thus, they suggested that there is  room for dialogue if North Korea allows the special inspection.  [end recording]</p>

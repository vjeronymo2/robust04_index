			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Sun shines on - But while pension performance is strong, the charges are hefty In 1810, as the company's official history records, 'several highly respectable and opulent gentlemen, having it in contemplation to establish a society for life insurance with an ample and bona fide capital,' hired an actuary and set up Sun Life Assurance. A few years later, the staff doubled with the addition of an 18-year-old clerk, who retired at 66 and drew a Pounds 500 pension for 30 years. As he continued to collect it in person, he would proclaim: 'Ah] You can't kill an annuitant.' The company now has total assets under management of Pounds 16bn and is owned equally by UAP, the largest insurance company in France, and Liberty Life, South Africa's third-largest life assurance concern. They acquired their stakes in 1992; since then, shares in Sun Life have not been traded. The society offers an innovative range of pension products and is particularly strong in the small company pensions market. Its mainstream personal pensions are considered to be among the best available, while clients with more than Pounds 20,000 to invest can take advantage of a low-cost, discretionary private fund facility. Sun Life was one of the first life offices to sell 'unitised' with-profits individual pension plans, which aimed to simplify the complex structure of the traditional with-profits contract. Under a unitised plan, the fund - which invests chiefly in equities, property and gilts - is split into units which can be bought and sold in the same way as other unit-linked funds. The two main advantages for clients are a more explicit charging structure (fees on traditional with-profits contracts are notorious for being obscure) and being able to switch between the with-profits fund and those that are unit-linked. The society's charges may be explicit, but user-friendly they are not. Take a regular premium contract. During the first two years, your premiums buy capital units which carry an extra annual fund management charge of 3.5 per cent in addition to the l per cent charge on the accumulation units purchased from year three. This hefty charge on capital units is maintained throughout the full term of the contract. But where no commission is paid to the adviser, capital units account for only the first year's premiums, while single premium investments purchase only accumulation units. In addition to the annual management charge, there is an initial management charge (the bid/offer spread) of between 5-6 per cent, plus charges for administration and switching between funds. For those who stay the course, Sun Life pays an 'extra fund injection' loyalty bonus on plans that reach the agreed retirement date. The bonus rebates some of the regular charges levied over the years, together with an allowance for investment growth. This helps to explain the society's competitive 'reduction in yield' figure of 1.2 per cent, which shows the equivalent annual percentage charge over the life of the contract. The bonus helps to offset the otherwise relatively high charges of the early years. But the society also imposes a penalty on contracts terminated early. If you stop payments after 10 years on a 25-year contract, you will lose more than 50 per cent of the value of the capital units bought in the first two years. John Woolnough, Sun Life's business development manager for individual pensions, argues that the overall level of charges should be considered in the light of other important features. He says: 'The client's adviser should recommend a company with consistently good performance over different periods of time, backed by a long-established investment team. Higher charges can be an irrelevance if the performance is good.' Certainly, Sun Life is on firm ground when it comes to that. The two most popular personal pension plans - the unitised with-profits and unit-linked managed funds - are top performers over the short and long term. The compound annual growth rate of the managed fund (which invests in all of the society's specialist funds) is 20.02 per cent since its launch in May 1980, compared with the sector average of 16.76. The number of transfer plans the society has sold to employees with company scheme benefits is low compared with competitors: 15,000, of which only 3,000 were through direct sales. Nevertheless, Sun Life is reviewing all 3,000 to check that each was in the best interests of the client.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   INSURANCE FOR LIFE - FACT FILE 3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Name: Sun Life Assurance Society  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Status: Proprietary  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Founded: 1810  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Market position: Second largest proprietary office by new business income  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Financial strength rating: Standard &amp; Poor's assessment is 'adequate'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Funds under management: Pounds 16bn (at 31/12/93)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Premium income 1993: Annual Pounds 106.7m; single Pounds 2,232.2m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Number of personal pension plan clients: 179,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Number of transfer plans sold: 15,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sales outlets: Over 80 per cent through independent advisers, rest through direct sales and tied agents.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Commissions paid: Average life office rates to independent advisers, eg about 60 per cent of the first year's premiums on a 20 year contract  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Nil-commission terms available?

To reveal the impact of real charges on the final fund of Sun Life's managed unit-linked plan, we asked for illustrations using actual charges for a man age 45 who expects to retire at age 65 (ie a 20-year contract), paying (a) Pounds 200 per month and (b) a stand alone single premium of Pounds 10,000. Illustrations using Lautro standard charges, which in fact are much lower than charges used by most life offices, are shown in brackets. The last illustration gives a theoretical value if no charges were made. The growth assumptions are Lautro's standard 6 per cent and 12 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Full commission paid  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                       6% growth        12% growth  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Monthly premium                   Pounds 77,101    Pounds 148,747 Pounds 200                       (Pounds 80,900)  (Pounds 158,000) Single premium                    Pounds 25,458    Pounds  77,358 Pounds 10,000                    (Pounds 28,200)  (Pounds  85,200)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Nil-commission  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Monthly premium                   Pounds 85,172    Pounds 167,572 Pounds 200                       (Pounds 80,900)  (Pounds 158,000) Single premium                    Pounds 26,769    Pounds  81,341 Pounds 10,000                    (Pounds 28,200)  (Pounds  85,000)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Theoretical nil charges  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Monthly premium Pounds 200                        Pounds 91,129    Pounds 183,971 Single premium Pounds 10,000                     Pounds 32,071     Pounds 96,463  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Where full commission is paid, Sun Life's charges are significantly higher than the Lautro basis, yielding a lower projected return. When the commission cost is stripped out on the monthly contract, the situation is reversed on the monthly but not on the single premium contract.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

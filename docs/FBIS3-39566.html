			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press release issued by the UK Home Office: "New Europol </F> Drugs Unit Boosts Fight Against Drug Trafficking"]    [Text] European action to combat the growing menace of  organised international crime was boosted today by the opening  in the Hague of a new European drugs intelligence organisation  -- the Europol Drugs Unit [EDU].    The EDU is the first step in the creation of a European  Police Office -- Europol -- which will be a central coordinating  body for the exchange and analysis of intelligence on all forms  of serious crime.    The EDU and Europol will not have any operational powers.  Home Secretary Michael Howard hailed the move as a success for  European police cooperation.    He Said:    "The drugs problem is an international one, and needs to be  tackled at an international level.    "Criminals show no respect whatever for the frontiers  between  countries, and our efforts must be directed to the widest  possible fields of cooperation.    "The EDU is a sign of Member States' determination to  cooperate closely and effectively crack down on the growing  menace of drug trafficking and organised crime in Europe.    "I believe that Europol can play an important role in  providing information to assist national police and customs  services in tracking down and arresting the criminals involved  in these activities.    "The Drugs Unit is an encouraging start. We have two liaison  officers in post, from the police and customs services who will  be linked into the UK via the National Criminal Intelligence  Service."    The EDU Will:     -  Exchange and analyse intelligence on drug  trafficking and money laundering in the European Union and the  criminal organisations involved in these activities    -  Give  national law enforcement agencies a wider, more coordinated view  of these activities across all Member States    -  Help these agencies  target their action more effectively against drug traffickers  and other criminals involved in serious organised crime.    National liaison officers have been posted to The Hague from  all Member States .    Each Member State must set up a unit to act as a two-way  link  for the exchange of information between EDU and its own police  and customs services. In the UK this will be the National  Criminal Intelligence Service.    Europol was first proposed in 1991 by Chancellor Kohl. An  existing UK-led initiative for a European Drugs Intelligence  Unit was absorbed into the proposal.    Europol will be established on the basis of a full  Convention  signed and ratified by all Member states. The draft Convention  is currently under negotiation, and a deadline for completion  has been set for October 1994 by the European Council.  <H5>  Notes To Editors </H5>   1. The EDU was formally opened in the Hague by Dutch Justice  Minister Mr Hirsch Ballin and Interior Minister Mr van Thijn.    2. The EDU will operate under the terms of a Ministerial  Agreement signed by EU Interior and Justice Minsters in  Copenhagen on 2 June 1993. Within the EDU the treatment of  information will be governed by Member States' own national data  protection legislation.    3. Europol will be an intergovernmental organisation within  the framework of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union. Work  towards its establishment is the responsibility of an  intergovernmental working group under Title VI, which reports to  the Council of Interior and Justice Ministers. The European  Council has set a deadline of October 1994 for completion of the  Europol Convention.    4. Formal interviews for the senior management of EDU will  take place in Brussels on 22 February. Ministers of the Interior  and Justice will consider recommendations on 23 March. The UK  will be bidding for one of the three posts.    5. The national liaison officers will work under the interim  management of Mr Storbeck of Germany, and Colonel Bruggeman of  Belgium.</p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SOONERS SEEDED NO. 1 DESPITE LOSING BY 12  </P> <P> Byron Irvin scored 29 points and Doug Smith had 22 points and 14 rebounds as  10th-ranked Missouri upset No. 2 Oklahoma, 98-86, Sunday to win the Big Eight  Conference tournament at Kansas City, Mo.  </P> <P> Despite the loss, Oklahoma received the No. 1 seeding in the Southeast Regional  in Nashville, Tenn. The Sooners (28-5) will play East Tennessee State Thursday.  </P> <P> The seedings were announced on national television prior to the end of the Big  Eight final, which Missouri dominated from the start.  </P> <P> The Tigers (27-7), who have won two of three from the regular-season Big Eight  champion Sooners this season, will be the No. 3-seeded team at the Midwest  Regional in Dallas, where they will play Creighton Friday.  </P> <P> Stacey King, who played poorly in a 14-point effort against Iowa State in  Saturday's semifinals, scored a tournament-record 38 Sunday. That equaled the  combined output of 6-foot-10 Smith and 7-1 Gary Leonard, who had 16 for  Missouri.  </P> <P> But King didn't get much help from Oklahoma's perimeter players. The Sooners,  who shot 42% compared to 66% for Missouri, scored only 19 points from outside.  </P> <P> OTHER TOURNAMENTS  </P> <P> ACC  </P> <P> North Carolina 77, Duke 74 -- By beating the No. 7 Blue Devils in the Atlantic  Coast Conference final at Atlanta, the No. 9 Tar Heels won the tournament for  the first time since 1982, when they also won the NCAA tournament.  </P> <P> Steve Bucknall scored all 10 of his points in the final 5:28, twice making  three-point plays, to lead North Carolina down the stretch.  </P> <P> The victory helped erase the memories of last year's 65-61 loss to Duke in the  ACC final and kept the Tar Heels (27-7) close to home as the No. 2-seeded team  in the NCAA Southeast Regional at Atlanta.  </P> <P> Duke (24-7), seeded No. 2 in the East Regional, will play South Carolina State  Thursday night at Greensboro, N.C.  </P> <P> Duke, which trailed North Carolina by as many as 12 points in the first half,  rallied to take a 59-57 lead with 5:44 left. But Bucknall scored his first  points on a three-point play to give the Tar Heels a 60-59 lead with 5:28 left.  Bucknall's second three-point play gave the Tar Heels a 69-66 lead with 1:46  left.  </P> <P> Bucknall, who was six for six at the foul line, and King Rice each added four  free throws in the final minute.  </P> <P> Duke's Danny Ferry, who was held to 14 points, attempted a 70-foot desperation  heave at the buzzer that would have tied it, but it bounced off the rim.  </P> <P> Of Bucknall, North Carolina Coach Dean Smith said: "His play down the stretch  was just sensational. He was a leader out there when we needed one."  </P> <P> Bucknall said: "I just didn't want to go through what we went through last year  when we all cried in the locker room after losing."  </P> <P> J.R. Reid, the tournament's MVP, led North Carolina with 14 points. Jeff Lebo  had 13, Kevin Madden 12 and Rick Fox and Scott Williams 11 each. Phil Henderson  had 16 points for Duke.  </P> <P> Big East  </P> <P> Georgetown 88, Syracuse 79 -- Alonzo Mourning scored 21 points and the No. 3  Hoyas won their sixth Big East Conference championship by beating the No. 5  Orangemen at New York.  </P> <P> The Hoyas (26-4) won three tournament games by an average of 20.6 points and  were seeded No. 1 in the East Regional. The Hoyas have been in the NCAA  tournament every year since the Big East was formed 10 years ago.  </P> <P> The Big East championship was the sixth in as many appearances in the final for  Georgetown. Five times the loser was Syracuse, which has lost seven of its last  eight meetings with the Hoyas.  </P> <P> Georgetown led Sunday's game by as many as 23, but the Orangemen (27-7) were  able to make the final score respectable with an 18-4 streak in the final 2:33.  </P> <P> Georgetown senior guard Charles Smith, the conference's player of the year, was  named the tournament MVP after scoring 16 points Sunday to go with 24- and  26-point performances in the first two games.  </P> <P> Stephen Thompson led Syracuse with 19 points. Mark Tillmon had 17 points for  Georgetown and Jaren Jackson added 13.  </P> <P> Metro  </P> <P> Louisville 87, Florida St. 80 -- Pervis Ellison scored 22 points as the  16th-ranked Cardinals beat the No. 14 Seminoles at Columbia, S.C., to win their  second straight Metro Conference tournament title.  </P> <P> Louisville (22-8) led by 14 in the second half, but the Seminoles rallied to  cut the margin to three with 1:35 left on a three-point play by Derrick  Mitchell. However, Ellison and LaBradford Smith each hit two free throws in the  final 37 seconds to clinch the win.  </P> <P> The title was the third in four years for the Cardinals. Florida State (22-7),  which won the Metro regular-season title, has been to the tournament final five  times but has never won.  </P> <P> SEC  </P> <P> Alabama 72, Florida 60 -- Keith Askins scored 14 of his 23 points in a  second-half span of 2:14 to break open a close game at Knoxville, Tenn., and  lead the Crimson Tide to the Southeastern Conference tournament championship.  </P> <P> Askins' run came on four consecutive three-point baskets, and he turned two of  them into four-point plays as the Tide went from a 35-34 lead to a 49-38 margin  the Gators were never able to overcome.  </P> <P> Askins started his run with a with 15:50 left.  </P> <P> It was the fifth victory in a row and the seventh in eight games for Alabama  (23-7).  </P> <P> Florida (21-12), the regular season SEC champion for the first time in the  league's 57-year history, lost for only the second time in 12 games.  </P> <P> Livingston Chatman scored 20 points to lead the Gators, who played without  Dwayne Davis, sidelined with a knee injury in Saturday's semifinal victory over  Tennessee.  </P> <P> Southwest  </P> <P> Arkansas 100, Texas 76 -- Lenzie Howell scored 28 points as the Razorbacks won  the Southwest Conference tournament at Reunion Arena in Dallas.  </P> <P> Arkansas (24-6) won its first SWC tournament since 1982. As the fifth-seeded  team in the Midwest Regional, the Razorbacks will play Loyola Marymount  Thursday night in Indianapolis.  </P> <P> Texas (24-8) was seeded 11th in the Midwest and meets Georgia Tech Friday night  at Reunion Arena.  </P> <P> Keith Wilson, who hit four three-point baskets in the second half, had 18  points for the Razorbacks.  </P> <P> Arkansas, incensed by the ejection of center Mario Credit and a technical foul  on Coach Nolan Richardson, raced to a 57-37 halftime lead over the Longhorns.  Credit was ejected for swinging an elbow at Texas center George Muller with  Arkansas leading, 38-28.  </P> <P> The 100 points by Arkansas breaks the championship game record of 92, set by  Houston in 1978.  </P> <P> Mid-American  </P> <P> Ball St. 67, Kent St. 65 -- Bill Butts scored 19 points, hitting five  three-pointers, and Paris McCurdy had 15 points and 11 rebounds as the  Cardinals (28-2) survived a late rally by the Golden Flashes (20-10) in the  Mid-American Conference title game at Toledo, Ohio.  </P> <P> It was the second straight narrow victory for Ball State, which beat Eastern  Michigan by one point in the MAC semifinals.  </P> <P> Ball State will play Pittsburgh Thursday in the NCAA Midwest Regional at  Indianapolis.

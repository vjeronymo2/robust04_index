			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Tory tensions rise over Bosnia: Attack by Baroness Thatcher puts British government on defensive THE UK GOVERNMENT was forced to defend its policy towards Bosnia yesterday as a fierce attack by Baroness Thatcher heightened tension among Tory MPs over the scale of Britain's involvement. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, strongly rejected the former prime minister's call for the Bosnian Moslems to be allowed to arm themselves - possibly setting the UK on a collision course with the US. Mr Reginald Bartholomew, the US special envoy to the Bosnian peace talks, said yesterday that although the US was pursuing 'the diplomatic track', it was not prepared to wait much longer for Serbia to endorse the peace plan. Failing that, Washington would soon press its allies for a partial lifting of the UN arms embargo. Mr Rifkind said tougher sanctions against Serbia need not be delayed through Russia's postponement of a UN security council meeting this month - implying that the 15-day warning period before imposing sanctions could be cut. He also left open the possibility of Britain's supporting air strikes to enforce a peace settlement - although such a move would bring the UN into the conflict as a combatant. Lady Thatcher continued her attacks yesterday in US television interviews and in the House of Lords, where she said there was 'nothing moral or right about leaving a people defenceless in the path of a determined dictator-aggressor'. Ministers appeared taken aback by the ferocity of the former prime minister's words. Although her outburst provoked some ridicule because of its emotional tone, it found support among some MPs. Baroness Chalker, overseas development minister, told Lady Thatcher in the Lords that her proposals might cause 'all-out war' in Bosnia. An opinion poll today suggests that she also partly reflected public opinion. A Gallup survey for The Daily Telegraph shows that 61 per cent back sending an international force to Bosnia to enforce a peace settlement. Two thirds of those polled said British troops should form part of any such force. In Belgrade, the Moslem-led Bosnian government said it would withdraw support for the international peace plan if Srebrenica, the besieged town near the Serbian border, was captured by Bosnian Serb forces. Andrew Hill in Brussels writes: The European Commission will be asked at its meeting next Wednesday to approve Ecu150m (Pounds 119.55m) of additional humanitarian aid for victims of the conflict in former Yugoslavia. Mr Manuel Marin, EC commissioner responsible for aid, will submit a formal proposal to his fellow commissioners, with the support of colleagues responsible for trade, foreign affairs and the EC budget. If approved, it will bring to Ecu500m the amount of aid granted to the former Yugoslav republics from the EC's central budget since December 1991. The Commission approved a first contribution of Ecu60m of aid for victims of the conflict at the beginning of March. Threat by Bosnia, Page 2 Editorial Comment, Page 23</p>

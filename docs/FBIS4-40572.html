			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Oleg Cherkovets: "U.S. Landing Force Rushes to </F> Russia. If It Doesn't Work at the Center Then Try It at the  Edge"]    [Text] No sooner had a report gone out in the mass media  about a Russian military ship -- the destroyer Neustrashimyy --  taking part in joint naval maneuvers involving as many as 15(!)  states in the southern part of the Baltic Sea (but against whom  was the Neustrashimyy, together with seven NATO countries, going  to maneuver, and into whom was it going to put fear in these  parts?!), than new information of the same kind emerged. It  turns out that joint exercises involving Russian and U.S.  marines to "perfect rescue missions" are due to take place in  the waters around Vladivostok.    Well, the Americans really want to step in their hobnail  boots onto our soil! If you don't hit the bull's-eye in the  center of Russia -- the Totskiy training ground -- then try at  the edge. Never mind that it's 10,000 versts from Moscow, but  what a place this is: It was a little less than 75 years ago  that the Americans were chucked out of this very location,  Maritime Kray, or were at least asked to leave, and now they  will again be entering it, albeit only at its very edge. What a  pleasure this is: To tweak the Russian bear's nose while the  occupiers of the Kremlin are tying its paws behind its back.    What is significant is this. Citing AP, the MOSCOW TIMES  newspaper reported that in the maneuvers a U.S. Navy ship should  land 250 marines and 12 combat bridge vehicles. It has also  been proposed to drop another 250 U.S. warriors with appropriate  equipment on the Totskiy training ground in Orenburg Oblast.  Does this mean that they want to insinuate by hook or by crook  a strictly determined number of "bodies" with equipment into our  land -- in order to perfect a particular operation? What  particular operation?</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Letter: Still gleaming Sir, Observer's comments on the shrinking market for gold analysis in London ('Golden Goodbyes', May 8) might have carried a little more weight, if he had not effectively destroyed his entire argument in his last sentence by suggesting that the Consolidated Gold Fields annual survey ought to be revived. It never ceased. The survey, on which I have worked as a consultant each year since the late 1960s, continues to be produced by Gold Fields Mineral Services, whose shareholders are the major gold mining groups that previously formed part of the Cons Gold empire. The next one is due out in a couple of weeks. Timothy Green 8 Ponsonby Place London SW1</p>

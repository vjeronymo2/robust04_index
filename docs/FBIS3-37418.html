The document is called "Organized Crime and the  Prospects of National Socialists Coming to Power in Russia."    It says, in particular, that the growth of organized crime,  which is interwined with the Internal Affairs Ministry organs  and local executive authorities, threatens Russia's political  and economic development and creates real conditions for  national socialists to come to power. In Russian cities and  rayon centers literally all owners of stalls, stores, cafes, and  restaurants pay money to bandit groups. All market vendors and  car importers pay them money. Some 70-80 percent of privatized  enterprises and commercial banks have been victims of extortion  of late. The size of the payment (a kind of tax benefiting  bandit groupings and corrupt officials) is 10-20 percent of the  turnover, which often exceeds the enterprise's final profits.    Bandit formations have informers everywhere in the militia  organs, traffic police, and banks. According to entrepreneurs  in Tver, a vehicle will be stopped by racketeers if they get  word from a traffic police checkpoint that it is carrying a  valuable load.    Vladimir administration leaders confirmed that attempts to  carry out surprise searches of bandit groupings' headquarters  were blocked because they had been alerted through the traffic  police-Internal Affairs Ministry system. In Moscow transport  inspectors are unable to monitor the work of mobile service  stations because the illegal traders are alerted by traffic  police personnel.    In Kazan only bandits are allowed to drive foreign cars,  Volgas, and Zhiguli-9's. Other citizens have these cars taken  away from them. The same rule has applied for some time in St.  Petersburg too. Bandit groupings have started to demand money  from farmers, market gardeners, and inhabitants of suburban  settlements in Kazan. A similar practice is now being  introduced in the Moscow region.    In Tver entrepreneurs are required to obtain permission from  the leaders of bandit groupings to set up a stall or open a  store. Only with their consent will the local authorities issue  licenses. Independent entrepreneurs have been driven out of some  areas of activity altogether, since organized crime is financing  on very favorable terms (a very large interest-free loan, for  example) young people who are prepared to cooperate. As a  result they have a significant advantage over their competitors  (of course, when they achieve some success they surrender a  large part of the profit as payment for the credit).  Incidentally, this distingishes the situation in our country  from the situation in Western Europe and the United States:  There organized crime controls only "criminal" areas of  activity, such as prostitution, the drugs trade, and gambling.  In Russia organized crime controls all types of activity.    The extra tax paid to the bandits and the artificial  restrictions on business activity for the purpose of obtaining  massive monopoly profits lead to price rises of 20-30 percent.  The population's living standards fall accordingly.    The memorandum notes that organized crime's accumulation of  capital during 1991-1993 has been vast. Some of it is  transferred abroad through banking structures (under threat of  physical violence), but this does not save the bank managers.  They are eliminated because they know about the secret deposits.  Bankers have the highest death rate among entrepreneurs.    In Russian cities a large class of young hoods has  developed,  whose sole function is racketeering and obtaining money. In St.  Petersburg there are tens of thousands of these hoods, 500 of  whom are hardened criminals. They all have high incomes and  drive foreign cars. They take over restaurants and cafes and do  not allow ordinary mortals into them.    The boom in organized crime is closely linked to the  economic  status of entrepreneurs and privatized enterprises. The  extremely intricate tax system that exists at the moment does  not encourage enterprises to increase profits. For instance,  according to the calculations of M. Kabakov, director of the  machine building plant named for Kalinin, the plant's doubling  of its profits through drastic economies and manpower cuts will  only increase net profits by two percent. Under the present tax  system an entrepreneur who owns a distillery can only ensure  11-percent profitability, given an inflation level of 1,000  percent per year. Entrepreneurs are forced to conceal income.  Bandit groups find out about these things through agents and  tell the entrepreneurs that if they do not pay them money they  will be "handed over" to the tax police. The entrepreneurs  reckon, not unreasonably, that it is better and safer to pay the  bandits.    In the banking sphere centralized credits distributed  outside  the tender system are the economic basis of organized crime.  Some 10-20 percent of the cash earned on commission is taken  in exchange for these credits. The abandonment of targeted  credits would make it possible to eliminate the economic basis  of organized crime.    All the aforesaid, the memorandum says, means that an entire  generation is growing up for whom the situation is normal and  who, when in difficulty, turn not to the official authorities,  but to the unofficial authorities. These people will sooner  hire killers to punish a partner who has gone wrong than go to  the courts or seek arbitration.    The Analysis Center concludes that if this continues, we may  arrive at a situation similar to that in Latin America or, say,  Italy, where policy is actually determined not by government or  parliament, but by organized crime. In particular, there is no  longer any doubt that the leaders of Russian organized crime are  compiling a meticulous dossier on all major officials and  politicians. In these conditions Zhirinovskiy's populist  promises to establish strict order could attract tens of  millions of Russians and -- which would be particularly  dangerous -- hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs to the LDPR  [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] banners. A failure to take  decisive steps to remove the economic roots of crime and provide  the laws to combat organized crime amd the absence of political  will in the fight against organized crime could bring the  national socialists to power during the 1996 presidential  elections.    What needs to be done, in the analysts' opinion? Practice  shows that it is futile to depend on local militia departments  to combat organized crime. Informers give the bandits several  days' notice of impending raids so they can lie low. Only the  creation of well equipped special formations, reporting direct  to the president and located outside cities, will make for an  effective fight against organized crime. These formations would  have access to information stored in Internal Affairs Ministry  organs.    According to experts, in order to arrest the organizers,  leaders, and "godfathers" of bandit groupings in a city such as  St. Petersburg all you need is special formations numbering 100  men. These detachments must have extensive rights (for example,  preventive detention for a period of several months) and major  privileges, in particular: a large salary ($250-300 as of  December 1993), an official apartment, of which the occupant  automatically becomes owner on his retirement, compulsory life  insurance, and so on. If evidence of corruption comes to light  the employee will be automatically sacked and stripped of all  privileges. These detachments should not include anyone who has  served in the Internal Affairs Ministry or KGB (Security  Ministry) in the past, but they should be given access to all  the information collected by these departments. At the same  time, a committee should be set up along the lines of the U.S.  FBI. Its employees would monitor certain regions, with frequent  changes of personnel.    If such structures were created, organized crime's current  freedom from punishment would rebound on it, since at the  present time its members have no fears and their names are well  known in every militia station.    Internal Affairs Ministry personnel could be drafted in from  from other cities for use in operations to put down organized  crime. Having no links with organized crime in that particular  city, they would be able to assist the president's special  detachments. You can catch two or three members of bandit  groupings these days by raiding restaurants or cafes.  Practically all of them carry illegal weapons or they could be  charged on other grounds. Since the organization of bandit  groupings depends entirely on their leaders, the preventive  detention of them for a period of several months and the  severing of links with informers in Internal Affairs Ministry  organs and the local administration will destroy the bandit  groups. This is evidenced by the fact that even if a leader  goes on "leave" for a month the bandit grouping is paralyzed.    Changes must be made to the Criminal and Criminal Procedure  Codes providing the organs combating organized crime with wider  rights. They should be given the right to preventively detain  people suspected of involvement in organized crime for a period  of up to three months without charge. Tax legislation should be  radically reformed, with the emphasis switching to the taxation  of resources and, above all, land. We should dramatically  curtail the use of the mechanism of quotas and licenses,  switching to the regulation of foreign economic relations  through duties. The granting of targeted credits should be  abandoned. We must switch to the allocation of Russian Central  Bank credits on a competitive basis.</p>

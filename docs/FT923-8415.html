			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK fights sugar disease BRITISH AGRICULTURE officials are combating an outbreak of the sugar beet disease rhizomania on a farm in Norfolk, eastern England, the first such case in two years, the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food said yesterday, Reuter reports. The ministry said that the outbreak was detected during an annual survey for the soil-borne disease which reduces crop yield and the sugar content of the beet. Strict movement controls have been imposed on the farm and inspectors are investigating neighbouring farms, the ministry said. It said that the disease, which is present in much of continental Europe, was first discovered in Britain on a farm in Suffolk in 1987. It was found on two farms in 1989 and three in 1990, all in Norfolk. The last outbreak was in 1990.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's Agriculture and Food Minister Viktor  Khlystun has disclosed that the cabinet had not yet discussed  the possibility of revising the new custom tariffs imposed as of  15 March on food and other products, however, debates could  start in the next few days. Meeting the press in Moscow on  Thursday, he spoke in favor of preserving the new tariffs on  food as a means to create a civilized market and safeguard the  interests of domestic commodity producers.    He reported that the cabinet had sent 1 trillion rubles to  farms for the spring sowing and would provide more credits as of  early April. This year's state allocations for agriculture will  total 5 trillion rubles. Khlystun argued that since funds for  agriculture had been set aside "very late," there had been  delays with the acquisition of spare parts, fuel and lubricants,  and pesticides. "The situation regarding sowing is alarming but  not desperate," the minister said.</p>

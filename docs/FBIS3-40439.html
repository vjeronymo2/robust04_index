			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [As received via ANSASERVICE database] </F>   [Text] Rome (ANSA), 12 Jan -- A European mini launcher,  able to put small satellites into low orbits by 1999 at a cost  of less than $20 million each, is being studied by the French  CNES [National Center for Space Studies] and the Italian Space  Agency. The outline project for the rocket, that has been named  ESL (European Small Launcher), is already ready and the  definitive study, which should be finished by the end of June  1994, is about to start. The French company SEP [European  Propulsion Company] and the Italian company BPD (Fiat group)  will participate in the study.    The determining factor for the new carrier will be the very  contained launching cost: $20 million to put one tonne into  orbit at a height of 700 kilometers. This cost is analogous  with that planned by Lockheed for its new LLV mini launcher that  should make its debut sometime this year.    A market comprising "numerous launches" each year can be  foreseen for the ESL to meet European requirements alone. The  small carrier could be used for telecommunications satellites to  be put into low orbits ("constellations" of the Iridium type,  Globalstar, Odyssey, Ellipso, Aries, Taos and other commercial  satellites), for remote sensing in polar orbits, scientific  research, and military applications (electronic monitoring,  surveillance, and telecommunications). The payload (also for  multiple launches) can vary from 100 kilograms to be put into  any type of orbit, to 1000 kilograms in orbit at a height of 700  kilometers.    The launcher should be extremely reliable (0.99) and have an  acceleration that can be sustained without damaging the  equipment (7G) that can be put into orbit with good precision.  The payloads will be able to have a cylindrical volume 4.8  meters high and 2.2 meters wide. Initially it is planned that  there will be two launches a year, and these will increase later  to between five and 10.    The ESL will be a solid-fuel, three-stage rocket (the same  as  the boosters of the Ariane-5) plus a final liquid fuel  propulsor. The rocket will be 25 meters high, have a diameter  of 2.6 meters, and weigh 121 tonnes. The thrust at take-off  will be 173 tonnes. It is planned to use the same platform as  for the Ariane-5 for the launch. The first two stages are  identical, each one requiring 51.2 tonnes of fuel and built of a  composite material (carbon fiber) which gives a six percent  reduction in weight with respect to metal. The same material is  used for the third stage that will require 7.2 tonnes of fuel.  The fourth stage, which gives the final trajectory to put the  satellite into circular orbit, will account for 260 kilograms of  hydrazine that will feed six burners.    It is estimated that the investment for the development will  be about 500 billion lire over four and a half years. If the  realization of the project is approved at the beginning of 1995,  it will be possible to make the first launch in 1999.</p>

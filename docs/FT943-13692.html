			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Bank looks at Malaysia link to missing gold coins Standard Chartered is investigating the disappearance of Dollars 10,000 (Pounds 6,400) of gold coins, allegedly given by its Mocatta bullion division to a Malaysian minister as a 'trade sample'. The disappearance of the coins has emerged as part of a wide-ranging probe by the London-based international bank into allegations that Mocatta executives may have paid commissions to officials in the Philippines and Malaysia to obtain business. 'The investigation into what happened to the gold is still going on,' commented a banker. 'There may be a perfectly innocent explanation, though it all looks very odd.' The disclosure of the disappearance of the coins comes at an embarrassing time for the British government, which had been hoping that Malaysia might soon announce a lifting of its ban on UK participation in Malaysian government contracts. That ban was put in place because of the Malaysian government's fury with the British press over the Pergau Dam alleged arms-for-aid deal and allegations of bribes paid to Malaysian politicians. The Bank of England has been kept closely informed of Standard Chartered's investigation and is understood to be concerned about its implications for diplomatic relations between the UK and Malaysia. The Malaysian High Commissioner in London, Mr Abu Kamaradin, yesterday met Standard Chartered's chief executive, Mr Malcolm Williamson, to discuss the bank's probe. Last night Mr Kamaradin had no comment to make on the allegations. Standard Chartered has also uncovered evidence that payments may have been made to officials at the Philippines central bank in order to win business. The bank said yesterday that it had uncovered 'a small number of unusual transactions' involving the Far Eastern operations of its Mocatta subsidiary, as part of its attempt to improve controls in the group. More recently, it has uncovered 'discrepancies in expense claims'. It said that reasons given for the expenses 'included gifts to individuals in certain countries to facilitate business, a practice contrary to bank rules and procedures'. The bank has not proved that the specific gifts were passed on to the alleged recipients or that the expenses were genuinely incurred, but the investigation is continuing. The sums involved in the expenses claims run to tens of thousands of pounds, according to a banker. Two senior Mocatta executives have been dismissed by the bank. One, who was based in Hong Kong, left the group in January. The other, based in London, went more recently. Bankers said yesterday that the Standard Chartered disclosures would make life more difficult for many western banks operating in the Asia-Pacific region, which as a matter of course make payments to local officials in order to obtain business.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Japanese Economic Measures: Japanese trade surplus for 1992 rises to Dollars 111bn JAPAN'S trade surplus for fiscal 1992, which ended last month, rose 26.2 per cent to Dollars 111.34bn (Pounds 73bn) as the slowing of the economy led to weaker demand for imports and a widening of the country's bilateral surpluses with the European Community and the US. The Japanese government is hoping that yesterday's announcement of a new stimulatory package will defuse criticism of the surplus. However, finance ministry officials admitted that import demand is unlikely to recover quickly in the coming months. Japan's customs-cleared imports from the US fell 2.4 per cent to Dollars 52.3bn, while exports to the US were 7 per cent higher at Dollars 98.4bn. Exports to the EC rose 2.9 per cent to Dollars 61.5bn and imports from the EC were down 2.6 per cent at Dollars 30.5bn, while total exports were 7.4 per cent higher and imports grew 0.3 per cent. The surplus had peaked in 1986 at Dollars 89.7bn, falling to Dollars 54.3bn in 1990, but it has expanded rapidly over the past two years as the domestic economy stalled, creating international pressure on the government to rekindle growth. But the expansion is not over yet. For the month of March, the surplus increased 26 per cent to Dollars 13.78bn, after a 15.4 per cent rise in exports and a 9.4 per cent lift in imports. Seasonally adjusted, the surplus was Dollars 9.98bn, down from Dollars 10.19bn in February. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) said that the yen's appreciation was responsible for much of the increase, as the average yen-dollar rate last month was Y117.84 compared with Y130.78 last year. Yen-based exports were only 4 per cent higher during the month, and imports were 1.1 per cent lower than a year earlier. Japanese officials are concerned that the recent rapid appreciation of the yen will push the surplus higher over the next couple of months, before yesterday's package has time to take effect. They are also conscious that the new US administration may see a continuing rise in the surplus as a sign that Japan must be pressed for further market-opening concessions. The figures reflect the changing patterns of Japanese trade. Exports to China during the year were 36.4 per cent higher and imports from that country expanded by 20.1 per cent, while exports to Russia fell 35.8 per cent and imports were down 21.5 per cent. The China boom continued during the month of March, when exports from Japan rose 57.1 per cent on the same month last year, and imports were 32.3 per cent higher, lifting that country above Taiwan and South Korea among Japan's trading partners, and putting it second only to the US. During March, exports of transport machinery, mostly cars, rose 23.5 per cent and those of general machinery were 15.4 per cent higher. The strongest import growth was in mineral fuels, up 15.8 per cent, and machinery, up 10.4 per cent.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Putting customers in the picture - Kodak is projecting a new image Kodak has the kind of marketing problem most companies would envy - a brand name that is so well known that it overshadows all of its products. When people hear the Kodak name, they think of photography, as they have done for more than a century. Kodak has one of the strongest brand names in the world along with Coca-Cola and Sony. That is great when Kodak is selling camera film, but not so good when it wants to be taken seriously as a supplier of high-tech office equipment. Kodak is up against competitors like Xerox, with a brand name synonymous with photo-copiers, and Canon, the Japanese group. Among 'business decision makers', only one in five associates Kodak with photo-copying while three out of four link the Rank Xerox name to office copying equipment. Similar figures emerge for Kodak's other office equipment products, which range from digital cameras and document scanners to optical disk storage systems and high volume colour copier-duplicators. Kodak's commercial customers consistently give its products - most of which have high price tags - good marks for reliability and service, but the problem is that existing customers are few in number. Kodak's executives acknowledge the brand image problem. The company's traditional photographic market is under attack from other competitors like Japan's Fuji Film, making the move into office equipment all the more important. Mike Mansell, head of Kodak Office Imaging in the UK, says that although most business people have personal experience of Kodak's photographic products, those who influence decisions 'do not really associate Kodak with the business environment'. Mansell believes that some of Kodak's consumer advertising, like last year's campaign featuring disposable cameras, 'may be seen as relatively flippant' by business customers. In the past, Kodak has tried 'umbrella' advertising to emphasise the broad range of its businesses and overcome this commercial credibility gap. However, the group recognises that it faces a marketing challenge and not just an advertising problem: a radical response was needed. First, Kodak has redefined its core business around the 'imaging' banner - a concept that links traditional photography and the digital technologies which dominate the office equipment market. By doing this, Kodak hopes its brand name will become linked to the imaging expertise it employs in scanners, optical disks and printers, and not just in consumer photography. As a first step, Mansell says that Kodak must change its internal image, 'the one we have of ourselves,' and project the new image consistently. Second, the group structure has been reorganised into three divisions - imaging, which includes both photographic products and business equipment, chemicals and health. One aim has been to shorten lines of communication, ensuring that functions such as research and development, marketing and customer service are better co-ordinated. The reorganisation is also meant to simplify the management of customer accounts and encourage sales representatives to listen more closely to customers' needs. The formation of Kodak Office Imaging, for example, brought together businesses which previously operated as distinct units, sometimes even in competition with each other. Now customer databases, long acknowledged as one of the most powerful marketing tools, have been merged and only one Kodak sales rep will call on customers in future instead of two. Mansell says the new structure has already resulted in 'some enormous new (sales) opportunities', although he adds that it will take time to change customer perceptions. Time is not on Kodak's side. The company is under pres- sure to sort out its marketing quickly in order to halt a succession of poor results including a 19 per cent drop in 1992 first quarter net earnings. The success of this latest reorganisation, the fifth since 1983, and Kodak's attempts to develop its commercial brand image, will be critical to its future. Mansell says Kodak will not be 'throwing money at advertising'. Instead it is attempting to deal with the technical problems its customers are facing. 'It is going to take a great deal of effort and commitment on our part, but if we don't do it, we will be losing a great opportunity.'</p>

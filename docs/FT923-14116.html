			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Norsk bid to escape dumping duties NORSK HYDRO, Norway's largest public company, has reached an agreement with the US Department of Commerce in an attempt to avert the threat of anti-dumping duties on exports of magnesium from Canada to the US. The duties - a 21.61 per cent countervailing duty and 31.33 per cent anti-dumping duty - would be imposed by the International Trade Commission (ITC) if it found that Norsk Hydro's Canadian magnesium production had been subsidised and that the company had sold production from Canada in the US at dumping prices. However, Mr Per Erik Bjoerklund, of Norsk Hydro, said yesterday the Commerce Department had now acceptedNorsk's offer to renegotiate power supply contracts with Hydro Quebec and to repay an estimated CDollars 20m of provincial investment funds which it received from the governments of Canada and Quebec to establish the plant. 'The fact that we have renegotiated our power contracts and are willing to repay investment funds does not mean we admit to the department's allegations but that we are willing to solve the issue in order to have the charges dropped,' Mr Bjoerklund said. The agreement between Norsk Hydro and the department has not yet been signed, however, which means that US customs will require a deposit from Norsk Hydro equal to the proposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties if it exports Canadian magnesium to the US until the ITC ruling on August 19. Since the charges were made last autumn, Norsk Hydro has reduced production to half the Canadian plant's 45,000-tonne-a-year capacity. The Commerce Department cleared Norsk of allegations of dumping magnesium from Norway in the US.</p>

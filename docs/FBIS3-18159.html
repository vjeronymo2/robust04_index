			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Morten Fyhn report: "EU Shifting on Food Prices"] </F>   [Text] Brussels -- Norway is beginning to win sympathy in  the EU [European Union] for its demand to be allowed not to  adjust its sky-high food prices to the EU's much lower levels  overnight. According to AFTENPOSTEN's information, a growing  number of EU countries are beginning to realize that it will be  necessary to grant Norway and Finland a transitional period.    It has long been known that Germany and Britain have  disagreed with the EU Commission's proposal to demand immediate  price harmonization. In the internal discussions currently  taking place nonstop in the EU in an attempt to reach a common  position, other countries have backed the German and British  views. "I expect that the EU will offer Norway a transitional  period," a well-informed EU source told AFTENPOSTEN.    Despite the fact that a transitional period for price  harmonization has been the practice in earlier expansions of the  EU, this time the Commission has, out of regard for the EU's  single internal market, consistently opposed acceptance of  gradual harmonization. Norway and Finland -- the two applicant  countries with a much high level of prices -- have been just as  consistent in their refusal to agree to any other solution. If  the EU now gives way to their demands, this would immediately  increase the chances of the two sides being able to reach an  agreement on agriculture at the weekend.    The main reason why the EU is in the process of reversing  its  position is that it quite simply will too expensive to demand  immediate price harmonization. The EU knows that the applicants  refuse to cover farmers' loss of income, and calculations  indicate that the bill in the first year alone will be between  16 and 20 billion kroner. If the EU were to go along with the  Commission's demand and itself pay all or part of the bill, this  would mean expenditure that the majority of EU countries have no  desire to meet. A gradual harmonization is expected to cost a  mere 4 billion kroner in compensation.    On the fisheries front too there are signs of hope for  Norway  on one of its main demands -- that of duty-free access to the EU  market for fish and fish products from day one of membership.  The mood in the EU points to the possibility that this demand  will be met on certain conditions. One such condition is that  Norwegian exports should initially be kept at the level they  have traditionally had, and that an oversight mechanism is set  up so that it will be possible to intervene if the market is  flooded with Norwegian fish with major falls in prices as a  result. It is being said that Norway is also assumed to be  interested in such a solution.    The large quota demands from Spain remain the most important  problem in the negotiations. Fisheries Minister Jan Henry T.  Olsen was in Paris yesterday to discuss the fisheries demands  and today meets German Foreign Ministry Under Secretary of State  Juergen Trumpf in Brussels. Germany is openly irritated at  Spain and is expected to respond sympathetically to Olsen's  famous statement to the effect that Norway does not have a  single fish to give away.    The solution that is now on the cards is that Norway will  use  the quotas that Spain and other EU countries have been granted  under the EEA [European Economic Area] agreement as a means of  applying pressure. The Norwegian position is that these quotas  will disappear if Norway leaves the EEA to take up EU  membership. Spain's demand has its point of departure in the EEA  fisheries agreement -- something that Norway deems to be legally  untenable.</p>

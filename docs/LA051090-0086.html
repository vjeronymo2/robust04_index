			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BISHOP MAHER HAS 2ND BRAIN TUMOR OPERATION  </P> <P> Roman Catholic Bishop Leo T. Maher underwent a second brain operation Wednesday  to remove necrotic tumor tissue that was causing spinal fluid to accumulate in  his brain.  </P> <P> Maher,, 74,,, was in fair condition Wednesday afternoon after a two-hour  operation that began about 9:30 a.m., said Dr. Thomas Waltz, chief of  neurosurgery at Scripps Clinic.  </P> <P> "We're very hopeful his neurologic function will be improved, but only time  will tell," Waltz said after the surgery. "We know that the tumor has done some  damage to the brain, but it has not done any damage to the part of the brain  that has to do with speech and mental function. It's had to do with the  function of his left extremities."  </P> <P> Maher, bishop of the San Diego Roman Catholic Diocese, had returned to Scripps'  Green Hospital on Tuesday for tests preparatory to radiation treatments for his  brain tumor. Doctors removed about 80% of the tumor April 25.  </P> <P> The bishop was not as alert Tuesday as he had been earlier, Waltz said. He also  was complaining of increasing difficulty using his left arm and leg, and of  back pain from a fall he suffered while recuperating at home from the original  surgery.  </P> <P> The radiation treatments were put off, and a second surgery was recommended  after brain imaging showed the tumor remnant had swollen. It was causing  pressure and was also probably blocking the release of spinal fluid, Waltz  said.  </P> <P> The brain produces about a pint of spinal fluid a day in structures called  ventricles, releasing into the rest of the nervous system. The tumor was  trapping fluid in a section of a ventricle called the temporal horn, Waltz  said.  </P> <P> During surgery, Dr. Brian Copeland and Waltz found that the residual tumor had  begun decomposing after the previous surgery cut off its blood supply. This  necrosis caused the tumor tissue to swell.  </P> <P> Maher's chances of surviving the brain tumor, which is of a particularly  virulent type, are no worse than before the second operation, Waltz said.  Having removed more of the tumor might be seen as a positive sign, since that  leaves fewer cancer cells to be destroyed by radiation therapy, he said.  </P> <P> But Waltz said he is certain there has been some brain damage. Over the next  few days, doctors will be watching Maher closely to determine its extent.  </P> <P> "We won't know until he's awake, and we can examine him to test him," Waltz  said, adding: "To recover to be a person who can be active and enjoy life and  get things out of life and contribute to life, I think he has a reasonably  decent chance of getting to that goal."  </P> <P> Waltz said that, before surgery, the bishop was having increasing difficulty  using his left arm and leg, because he couldn't tell where they were without  looking at them.  </P> <P> This neurological problem had improved slightly after the first surgery, but  worsened again earlier this week, he said.  </P> <P> Waltz said radiation therapy could begin about two weeks after Wednesday's  surgery.  </P> <P> Maher has led the diocese of more than 460,000 Roman Catholics since 1969. He  is scheduled to retire on July 1, his 75th birthday.  </P></p>

			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Business failures up by 4.5%in first quarter BUSINESS failures in the UK in the first quarter of this year have continued to rise above the high levels of 1991. A survey by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information company, shows that 14,881 British businesses collapsed during the first quarter, 4.5 per cent more than the 14,245 failures recorded by the same survey in the last quarter of 1991. The current weekly rate of business failures, 1,240, shows a big rise over the 800-level in the first quarter of 1991. Mr Philip Mellor, Dun &amp; Bradstreet's marketing manager, stressed yesterday that in previous recessions the failure rate had peaked some time after a recovery was under way. 'The larger company has the ability to cut back fixed costs while the smaller business, so far into the downturn, does not have that option,' he said. The survey was drawn immediately into election campaigning when Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said it showed that business failures would exceed 100,000 during the recession, with more than 1m lost jobs. 'This makes this recession election a referendum on Conservative economic failure,' he said. Dun &amp; Bradstreet's figures show a slight slowing in the weekly rate of company liquidations, from 479 to 467, between the last quarter of 1991 and the first quarter of this year. Individual or small business bankruptcies, however, rose from 708 to 773 per week. London and the south-east were the worst-hit areas, with nearly 40 per cent of all business failures and more than half of liquidations. Business failures in the south-east, excluding London, were 87.5 per cent higher in the first quarter of 1992 than during the same period last year. The next highest rates of increase in corporate liquidations between the first quarters of 1991 and 1992 were in the West Midlands and Wales. The lowest were in the East Midlands and Scotland. Bankruptcies rose by more than two-thirds in all regions except Scotland, where the increase was 29.4 per cent.</p>

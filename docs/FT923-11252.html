			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Food: The priest and his busy nights with Carmen - A restaurateur with a mission CARMEN has opened in Seville. Not the opera, although this may feature in Spanish celebrations this year, but a restaurant. It is the latest in the empire of Luis Lezama, a businessman with an unusual mission: to provide work for reformed juvenile delinquents. This seems an unusual occupation for an astute restaurateur. But Lezama is also a priest and if he sees any contradiction in his calling and running a highly profitable chain of restaurants he does not show it. 'I am using the hotel trade to bring people new knowledge of themselves,' he says with great satisfaction. He cites the fact that many of the former 'petty thieves' - he calls them his brothers now - are in demand worldwide, to teach and train others in the Spanish cooking styles they have made their own. His staff are exchanged with Hungarians, with Czechs from Prague and even with Japanese. When not in Seville, managing the opening of Carmen, Father Lezama can be found at the headquarters of his restaurant chain, the Cafe de Oriente in Madrid. Upstairs at this popular cafe-bar, across the square from the Royal Palace, tourists and the Madrilenos, chat openly, sipping cocktails or the numerous Mexican beers. But downstairs is more discreet. King Juan Carlos is a regular guest in the Comedor del Rey, the King's Room. The Comedor, once the 15th century cellar of a medieval convent, is panelled off from the restaurant's 20 or so other diners by a trellis wall, inches thick, lined with blood-red velvet. Eavesdroppers, intentional or not, are foiled by music from the discreet but powerful loudspeaker outside the only entrance to the salon. Beneath the high arches of the brick-walled King's Room, the guests usually remain anonymous. The maitre d' declines to tell diners whether it is the king who lunches or whether the guests are high-ranking politicians or judges. Whoever they are, the diners are treated to Michelin-star service by Lezama's award-winning restaurant brigade. Across the salon table, Lezama does not look like a man who has taken holy orders. His suits are well cut, his glasses expensive. He does not sound like a priest, either. His talk is of profits, of expanding his restaurant group and of fine foods. But, in the early 1960s, he set himself to work with young troublemakers in the village of Chinchon and then in the suburbs of Madrid. In 1974, with the permission of the church, he negotiated a loan from a local bank and bought a small restaurant-bar, Taberna del Alaberdero, which he staffed with former offenders. Profit paid the wages and the remainder was reinvested in the restaurant. Now, almost 20 years later, Lezama's interests have expanded, with the express permission of the church, to include an outside catering company and six restaurants in Spain, as well as a restaurant in the US, another Taberno del Alaberdero, in Washington DC. What started as a simple idea, to create work for young offenders, has become an empire embracing high quality service in the restaurant and hotel business. What Lezama calls his foundation today employs 370 people and has its own board of directors. On the board sit many of the founder members of the first Taberno del Alaberdero, including Francisco 'Paco' Moreno. 'Paco, my Paco', says Lezama proudly, pointing to the man serving the meal, 'is now maitre d' at the Cafe de Oriente.' Paco deferentially ignores Lezama, and continues to present the meal, announcing it as wild duck in a fine, crisp, puff pastry. Lezama in turn explains how the pastry normally takes four to five hours to prepare in an oakwood oven. However, he boasts, the head chef, Santos Garcia Munoz, a long-serving member of 'the family', can do it in three. Without anyone noticing, the table has been cleared, the cutlery changed by the deft Paco, and the next course arrives: salmonetta, young salmon. The dish is decorated with a fan of thinly sliced courgettes on a spicy pimento sauce. To accompany the meal he offers tender, warm, onion bread. Though Lezama does not take the fish course, he is for a moment distracted by the succulent salmon. 'Madrid is the finest port in Spain, although far from the sea. We buy the finest fish here for all our Madrid restaurants.' It is the emphasis on excellence at the Cafe de Oriente that has earned it a Michelin star, and enables it to charge prices ranging from Pounds 50-Pounds 60 a head. 'We expect mainly the business visitor,' says Lezama, as if to apologise for the price. Upstairs at the cafe-bar, prices are also high, usually Pounds 35-Pounds 45 a head. In spite of the high prices business is good, reports Lezama. The foundation's total turnover is about Pounds 2.75m (Pts500m), with a profit margin of 9-10 per cent a year after tax. Although the bulk of profits are reinvested in the foundation, he explains, all the managers have shares in the business, which helps to explain their long-term interest. It would be possible to improve the turnover and the profit of the restaurants still further, he says, but the company would lose any increase in taxes. 'We prefer to invest the money in the resturants and create new jobs.' To prove his point Lezama explains that his empire is still expanding. Now Carmen is open and, for the first time, hotel rooms have been added to the foundation's assets, at the Taberno del Alaberdero restaurant, also in Seville. With only ten suites, the five-star hotel was intended to be pricy: from Pounds 200-Pounds 280 per person, per night, depending on the season. However current rates range from about Pounds 140 per night night. Whether Lezama's pricing strategy will attract the business he seeks, and whether his newest restaurant is a success, remain to be seen. But he hopes this latest production of Carmen will have a happy ending.</p>

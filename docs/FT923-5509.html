			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Recessionary problems put pressure on tyres  -How falling volumes and increased competition has affected Kwik-Fit WHEN THE effects of recession start to permeate even the baked bean market, what company can be said to be recession-proof? Apparently, fewer by the day - to the severe detriment of their share prices. Consumers long ago cut back on discretionary items such as cars and furniture but now they are even trimming such staples as baked beans and car tyres. Take Kwik-Fit Holdings, which has a chain of nearly 500 centres throughout the UK replacing mainly car tyres and exhausts. In May, its share price soared to a high of 222p, nearly four times the level of August 1990. Since then it has dropped as low as 94p and closed yesterday at 102p. At the heart of the problem was the sudden cutting of profit forecasts from Pounds 36m to Pounds 24m. While the tale of dashed hopes has some features peculiar to Kwik-Fit, the underlying story is that tyres - which account for half the company's sales  -have fallen victim to the recessionary ills of lower volumes and price pressures. Buyers were drawn to Kwik-Fit's shares as the company achieved a two-thirds increase in pre-tax profit in the year to February 29 to make a record Pounds 32.1m. Further growth was assumed. It was reasoned that drivers keeping their cars for longer would fuel the replacement market. Add to this a legislative change, which increased the minimum tread depth from 1mm to 1.6mm, and the market was expected to grow by about 5 per cent this year. With Kwik-Fit also boasting a strong balance sheet, after turning net debt of Pounds 19.1m into Pounds 3.5m cash in 1991-92, investors who were bearish on the UK economy and new car sales switched into the stock. 'It is a big disappointment for them that it has not proved more recession-proof,' says Mr Charles Burrows, at James Capel. What happened was that publicity surrounding the new tread-depth law, which came into effect on January 1, pulled sales forward. It is estimated that distributors took about 2.2m tyres from the manufacturers in that month, about 700,000 more than in January 1991. After the January bulge, it was believed that the market - which amounted to about 17.5m tyres last year - would settle down at a higher level. But by the early summer the pattern was of lower sales - 1.4m in June compared with 1.7m the previous year. Analysts say that what investors had forgotten in the case of Kwik-Fit was the feature it shares with retail chains: high fixed costs. 'Its high operational gearing makes it very dependent on volume,' says Mr Andrew Fitchie, at SG Warburg. Other factors threatening its profits on tyres have also come into play. Competition has increased as garages hit by falling car sales have put more emphasis on the repairs and replacement business. And motorists have traded down. Mr Tom Farmer, Kwik-Fit's chairman and chief executive, says imports of cheap tyres from eastern Europe and Taiwan have risen considerably. In May importers supplied more than half the market. Another measure of the switch to lower-priced products is sales of remoulded tyres. Mr Richard Swann, advertising and public relations manager at ATS, part of Michelin, says the group's remould factory 'is working flat out to keep pace with demand'. But at least the penny-pinching motorist is replacing his or her tyres. According to the Tyre Industry Council, surveys carried out with the police have found that between 15 and 25 per cent of cars have at least one bald tyre. There is some anecdotal evidence from the trade that the new law might have cramped the sales efforts of the tyre outlets. More people have been asking for the tread depth to be measured and if it tops 1.6mm, decide to leave the tyre on for a few hundred miles more. In the past, they might have relied on the fitter's advice on which tyres needed replacing. Fleet managers keeping a tighter control on costs have been asking which tyres must be replaced, instead of blithely ordering new sets. One factor crucial to the life of a tyre is the number of miles the car does. Some observers believe that the private motorist has started to cut down on mileage as an economy. But figures to confirm this are hard to come by. An Automobile Association survey last year concluded that the average private motorist did 671 miles a month, or just over 8,000 a year, but it had no historical comparison. When it sought drivers' views in the spring of 1991, it found that 85 per cent did not intend to change their motoring habits as a result of the recession. Some of those who said they would mentioned cutting their mileage. The only up-to-date information comes from the Petrol Retailers Association. Mr Bruce Petter, director, said the market for 'motor spirit' (excluding diesel) was 2.1 per cent down in the March to May quarter. And 1991 was 1.2 per cent down on 1990. Even this modest decline represented a worse performance than in the depression of the early 1930s, when petrol sales kept going up. Against this background of deferred spending and reduced activity, analysts are expecting that the interim results from the motor trade will show falls in the after-sales side of the business. In Kwik-Fit's case, the continued growth of exhaust sales - a higher margin operation than tyres - will limit some of the damage. The company responded constructively to criticisms of the exhaust business in a Consumers' Association report, published in Which? magazine in January. If it makes Pounds 24m pre-tax for the full year, this will still be well above the Pounds 19.4m made in 1990-91. But investors are more likely to remember the sudden shock of this summer's downgrade and it will take all of Mr Farmer's marketing flair to rebuild credibility.</p>

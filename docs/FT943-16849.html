			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Arafat returns in triumph to Gaza: Palestinian leader pledges to take struggle to Jerusalem An emotional Yassir Arafat took his first chaotic but triumphant steps on Palestinian soil yesterday after nearly 27 years in exile. He vowed to take the Palestinian struggle from Gaza to the holy city of Jerusalem, claimed by Israel as its eternal capital. 'Our blood, our souls - we will sacrifice them for you Abu Amar (Mr Arafat's nom de guerre). God is Great]' went up the Palestinian battle cry as euphoric Palestinian fighters-turned-policemen waved victory signs and automatic rifles and a bagpipe band played nationalist music. 'My brothers, while we are here in Gaza we remember the martyrs of the al-Ibrahimi mosque,' Mr Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, told the thousands of welcomers, referring to some 30 Palestinians shot dead by an Israeli man in the West Bank town of Hebron in February. 'We and they are going from here to the mosque (in Hebron), going to Nablus and Jenin and Tulkarm and Qalqilya and Bethlehem and Beit Sahour and Beit Jalla and Ramallah and then shortly after to Jerusalem] Jerusalem] Jerusalem, to pray there,' he said in a 30-minute address, listing the most important Palestinian towns and holy places. But he also assured Israel he would honour the autonomy deal signed by Israel and the PLO last September, calling it 'a courageous peace, a courageous compromise'. The deal provides for self-rule by the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, Jericho and eventually the West Bank as a whole, to be followed later by negotiations on the final status of the occupied territories. Israel's rightwing opposition leaders reacted angrily to the speech, but government officials viewed the homecoming with either indifference or equanimity. Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, said Mr Arafat 'can say what he likes, as long as he acts only on what's been agreed. And so far, he has followed the self-rule agreement - rejecting terror, preventing terror, dissociating himself from the PLO charter'. Earlier, tears streamed down the 64-year-old Palestinian leader's face as he stood through the open roof of a black Mercedes limousine and waved to thousands of Palestinians who lined the 40km route clapping and ululating. In Gaza City, policemen from the Palestine Liberation Organisation, who blocked streets and guarded rooftops, fired into the air to greet the man they revere as the embodiment of Palestinian resistance and nationalism. Minutes before his arrival, Palestinians were still emerging from their subdued mood to whitewash graffiti-stained walls and hang flags and bunting from balconies. Policemen were also busy until the last moment painting checkpoints with flowers and cutting palm branches - a symbol of peace. Many Palestinians remain deeply sceptical of Mr Arafat and the peace deal he struck with Israel, which leaves many of the most burning Palestinian demands shelved to later negotiations. Some at least who turned out to greet the 'president' did so out of respect for an old leader and a son of Palestine rather than because they support him personally. Others were simply curious to catch a face-to-face glimpse of the most famous Palestinian. Mr Arafat became chairman of the PLO in 1969 and had last visited the occupied territories as a clandestine guerrilla leader shortly after Israel had taken control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Arab-sraeli war. But with the homecoming over, Mr Arafat faces his greatest moment of truth. He can no longer survive as a popular leader on the basis of myth, legend and theatrics but will be quickly faced with the enormous social and economic challenges facing Gaza. Expectations are running high that the 'president' will be able to solve unemployment of 50 per cent, rampant poverty and appalling sewage, water, transport and electricity problems. He will face mounting pressure to share power by holding democratic elections in the occupied territories, as provided in the Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles. In the next step in the peace process, Israel and the PLO will have to negotiate on such contentious issues as the future status of Jerusalem. Many in the Palestinian opposition believe all they have to do is sit and wait for the chairman to fail and diminish in stature. 'He will fail no matter how much money Arafat brings because the peace agreement is so far below the basic demands of Palestinian people,' said Dr Mahmoud Zohar of the Hamas Islamic Resistance movement. In his ride to Gaza City, Mr Arafat also saw the thorn which remains in the peace process: the presence of 4,000 Jewish settlers in Gaza and another 120,000 in the West Bank. As he passed the settlement of Kfar Dorom, Jewish residents waved Israeli flags and banners which said 'Go Home'. Master of surprise charts risky course, Page 2 Editorial Comment, Page 8</p>

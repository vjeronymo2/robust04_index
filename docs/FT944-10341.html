			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Egypt-IMF talks to resume Egypt will resume formal talks with the International Monetary Fund this year, to try to break a deadlock over devaluation of the Egyptian pound. An IMF mission is expected in Cairo before Christmas to discuss devaluation and a raft of other issues, including reform of Egypt's tax and trade policies and the pace of its privatisation programme. Agreement to give new impetus to formal negotiations followed brief talks in Cairo this week between Mr Atef Sidki, Egypt's prime minister, and Mr Stanley Fisher, the new IMF managing director. The IMF has been pressing Egypt to devalue the pound as part of its three-year-old structural adjustment policies, saying the currency is as much as 40 per cent overvalued and seriously impedes attempts to generate export-led growth. The government has refused, saying devaluation would shatter hard-won confidence in the currency, which in turn has contributed to strong inflows of expatriated Egyptian money and reserves now topping Dollars 16bn.</p>

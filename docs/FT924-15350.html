			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Cost of residential care 'forcing old to sell homes' THE RISING cost of long-term residential care is forcing the elderly to sell their homes, according to a report published today by the Family Policy Studies Centre, an independent research body. But even the sale of a house will be insufficient to pay for more than five years in a private nursing home on average, according to the report, sponsored by Help the Aged. An average house, realising around Pounds 66,000, would pay for eight years in private residential care without nursing. That would mean an increased burden on the families of the elderly in care, which the report estimates at between Pounds 30 and Pounds 40 a week. Social security would also need to pay more, and the report estimates the cost to the taxpayer of supporting elderly people in private care at close to Pounds 2bn this year. Elderly people are the main consumers of health services, with those aged 85 and over costing the National Health Service and community services an average of five times as much as those aged between five and 64, according to Mr Francis McGlone, author of the report. The FSPC study adds to a report by Nuffield College, Oxford, published this year, which estimated that houses to the value of Pounds 2.5bn were sold each year to pay for long-term care. According to the Nuffield report, nearly two thirds of those who owned their homes when they went into long-term care needed to sell them to pay the bills. Over the past year, several large insurance companies, including Commercial Union, Eagle Star and Private Patients Plan, have launched insurance policies aimed at paying for long-term care. A wide-ranging public debate is needed to establish the extent to which families should take responsibility for dependent relatives, a report says today, Alan Pike writes. The report, by Professor Anthea Tinker and colleagues at the Age Concern Institute of Gerontology at King's College, London, says examination of the extent of the state's responsibility for care of the elderly should be informed by overseas experience, including the German system where adult sons and daughters had some legal responsibility for dependent parents. About 6m people in Britain care for dependents. The report says carers risk having low incomes in retirement because of lost employment opportunities. Disability and Dependency in Old Age.

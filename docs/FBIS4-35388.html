			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Believers Resistance official 'Ali </F> al-Husayni by 'Imad Marmal; place and date not given]    [Text] The kidnapping of al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani, one of  the leaders of the Believers Resistance [al-muqawamah  al-mu'minah], has focused attention on this group, which broke  away from the Amal movement but remained faithful to the Amal  charter, maintaining its own interpretation of the charter and  establishing close and "special ties" with Hizballah without  enrolling in its ranks.    What are the circumstances of the birth of the Believers  Resistance, what is its structure, what is its role in the issue  of the Israeli pilot, and how has the kidnapping of al-Dirani  affected it?    AL-SAFIR posed these questions to Believers Resistance  official 'Ali al-Husayni, 40 years old, who learned of the  kidnapping of al-Dirani on Radio London on Saturday morning [21  May]. He was shocked by the news, particularly because he met  with al-Dirani the day before and urged him to be more careful  because there was information that he was being targeted.  However, Abu-'Ali [al-Dirani], who was only taking  precautionary measures while moving from one place to another,  did not increase his guard, believing he would be safe in his  home.    The following is the text of the interview with al-Husayni:    [Marmal] How will the kidnapping of Mustafa al-Dirani affect  the morale of the Believers Resistance and its role?    [Al-Husayni] Whenever Israel deals a blow to us, the  resistance becomes stronger. When Israel assassinated 'Abbas  al-Musawi, the Islamic Resistance became stronger and  established roots in the people's conscience. After the  kidnapping of al-Hajj Mustafa, the Believers Resistance will  become stronger. Israel will not be glad for long about this  operation; it will suffer pain as we have suffered.    [Marmal] If the authority is directly responsible for what  happened, given that it is responsible for the people's  security, what about the internal breach of security and has it  been identified?    [Al-Husayni] From the information we have gathered, it is  clear that this act of piracy would not have succeeded without  the help of some agents. We have gathered some information,  which tally with the other information gathered by other parties  and the Lebanese Army. We are following up on these leads to  expose these agents and punish them.    [Marmal] Can you elaborate further on this subject?    [Al-Husayni] The terrain of the area does not permit the  Zionist enemy to use it with the help of only pictures and maps.  There must be some local people who are familiar with this  terrain. We also had information that the enemy had made a  miniature of the Qasr Naba village and the hills surrounding it.  They may have used this miniature to rehearse for the operation.    [Marmal] Why were precautionary measures not taken in the  light of this information?    [Al-Husayni] The humble nature of brother Abu-'Ali  al-Dirani,  the positive security situation in the area, and the absence of  direct party activity there made us rely on the state's  protection. A helicopter landing operation of this size would  not have succeeded if there was a will by the authorities to  confront it.    [Marmal] Did you obtain clarifications or explanations from  the military authorities on the way they dealt with the Israeli  operation?    [Al-Husayni] The security authorities, as they said, did not  do anything because of their weak capabilities. We are not  accusing the Lebanese Army, which we respect. We paid in our  own blood to preserve its unity. Al-Hajj al-Dirani is one of  those who paid a direct price for this. However, I accuse the  political leadership, who gave the impression directly or  indirectly that the aim of the operation was possibly to smuggle  out of the country some of [Samir] Ja'ja's supporters who fled  toward the mountains. The alert was stronger in the Jubayl area  than in others.    [Marmal] Was al-Dirani involved in the case of Israeli  airman Ron Arad?    [Al-Husayni] The Israeli airman was captured by the Amal  Movement's Central Security Service, which was headed then by  al-Hajj al-Dirani. I do not mean here that the prisoner is held  by the movement. I have no idea who was in charge of the  prisoner after Abu-'Ali.    [Marmal] It is reported that he was handed over to certain  quarters?    [Al-Husayni] This is not true. Such reports are part of an  intrigue.    [Marmal] What are your predictions concerning the fate of  Arad?    [Al-Husayni] He could either be dead or alive. The entire  issue has become a riddle, as [Hizballah Secretary General]  Hasan Nasrallah said. Since the Israeli airman is not held by  the Believers Resistance, the Islamic Resistance, the Amal  Movement, Syria, or Iran he might have been killed during  Lebanon's several wars: the war of liberation and the  inter-Lebanese wars. At any rate, the Israeli airman was  captured while bombarding Lebanese territory. Abu-'Ali was in  his house when Arad was captured. You cannot equate al-Dirani  with Arad.    [Marmal] Therefore, you believe that al-Dirani will not give  new information to the Israelis?    [Al-Husayni] Certainly. He does not have any significant  information. If we had information we would have used it to  swap prisoners. We are people who treat prisoners well.    [Marmal] Are there any contacts with the International Red  Cross about al-Dirani's condition?    [Al-Husayni] We have held contacts with official circles,  which will contact the Red Cross. It is the primary duty of the  Red Cross to visit the detainees.    [Marmal] What about the political and organizational  characteristics of the Believers Resistance?    [Al-Husayni] The Believers Resistance is neither an  organization nor a political party. It is rather a movement  waging jihad. The members and cadres of this resistance were  members of the Amal Movement. But as a result of an  organizational dispute within the movement, those cadres became  members of a Jihad resistance movement in 1988 in implementation  of the movement's charter. The Believers Resistance has deep  roots, which is evident in the number of its martyrs. We have  nothing to do with political parties. We were an opposition  movement in Amal but now we are not affiliated with it. We did  not establish a new organization because we are not convinced.    [Marmal] What is the nature of your relations with  Hizballah,  particularly since there is an impression that the Believers  Resistance is part of it?    [Al-Husayni] Our policies are parallel in terms of our Jihad  and irrefutable enmity toward Israel. We agree with Hizballah  because both of us represent links in the world Islamic  movement. We also have the same Islamic authority. We also work  together to safeguard Lebanon's unity, peace, and coexistence  and to establish social justice by eliminating political  sectarianism. In other words, we are part of the Hizballah  nation, according to the Koranic interpretation. This is what  we learned from Imam al-Sadr, because he represented the wise  authority, which is a descendant of the prophet's household. My  words should not be interpreted to indicate we are a Shiite  movement. We are rather a Lebanese movement based on Islamic  ideology.    [Marmal] What about relations with Iran?    [Al-Husayni] Iran is a state that champions justice. We  appreciate Iran's moral and other kinds of assistance. The  resistance, whether it is the faithful or Islamic, is willing to  accept assistance from any state that is hostile to Israel.</p>

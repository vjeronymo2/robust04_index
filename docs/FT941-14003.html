			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Unpredictable ebbs and flows US fund managers, when compared with their British counterparts, have tended in the past to be thoroughly parochial. Not any more. Over the past 12 months, analysts have constantly detected American footprints behind successive twists and turns in the global equity and bond markets. Yet there is a paradox here, in that the US ran an estimated deficit on the current account of its balance of payments last year of more than Dollars 100bn. That implies that it had to import Dollars 100bn from abroad to finance the deficit. How is it that a country importing capital on this scale could be responsible for capital outflows that drove the rest of the world's markets to record levels? Part of the answer is that the global market in capital now operates on a gigantic scale. Japan remains the biggest global saver, with a current account surplus in 1993 that probably topped Dollars 140bn. But the smaller European countries contribute significantly to the pot. Switzerland and Benelux alone run current surpluses not far short of Dollars 30bn. And then there are surpluses aplenty in the south-east Asian dragon economies, where the Confucian virtue of thrift has a way of generating high capital exports. If, as seems likely, the outflow of portfolio capital from the US last year amounted to Dollars 130bn-Dollars 140bn, there will have been equal and opposite flows in the form both of portfolio capital, direct inward investment, short-term finance and so forth from the rest of the world. Whereas in the 1980s much of the US deficit was bilaterally financed by Japanese investors, the flows are now more diversified. Japanese capital pours into Europe on a bigger scale; European capital goes to the US; and since the global balance of payments has to balance, everything works out in the end except in the official statistics, which fail to capture all the movements. It follows from all this that predicting market trends on the basis of balance of payments capital account movements is becoming increasingly difficult. Independent logic The present pattern of international payments is likely to change substantially over the rest of the decade as the US and most other large industrialised countries reduce the structural element of their budget deficits, which are a form of public sector dis-saving. The more normal historical pattern, whereby rich countries export their savings to take advantage of higher returns in the developing world, will reassert itself. But whatever happens to the surpluses and deficits, the portfolio flow will pursue an independent logic, because fund managers, especially in the US, may continue to increase the overseas proportion of their funds. It is precisely this structural change in the US investment portfolio that has been moving the markets. The money that has poured out of the US banking system and into bond and equity funds has spilled over into foreign markets. More important, US life assurance companies and pension funds have been persuaded of the virtues of diversification and are raising the foreign content of their portfolios in order to reduce risk. SG Warburg Securities estimates that if these institutions were to raise their target for foreign assets to 10 per cent of the portfolio, it would generate another Dollars 300bn of net purchases of overseas assets, or Dollars 60bn a year over five years. That would probably be more than enough to offset a sudden withdrawal of mutual fund money in response to any increase in US short-term interest rates. Move markets Japanese investors are the only other group with an ability to move markets that bears comparison with the Americans. Here again, there has ceased to be any obvious correlation in the 1990s between portfolio flows and the state of the capital account. Despite a current account surplus that has gone from Dollars 36bn in 1990 to more than Dollars 140bn in 1993, Japanese purchases of foreign bonds and equities were negligible compared with the level of outflow in 1989. But then in the last quarter of 1993 their foreign purchases suddenly rose to more than Dollars 30bn, as they realised that they were missing out on the rest of the world's boom when the domestic market was sluggish. If the Japanese economy starts to recover, the external account will shrink. But Japanese portfolio movements will probably continue to obey a logic that has recently been dictated more by perceptions about economies, currencies and yield differentials than the balance of payments, or arm-twisting by government bureaucrats. It would not be surprising if the outflow of portfolio capital increases in the current year. There is, of course, an alternative, contrarian, approach to cross-border investment which argues that the foreign investor is usually the greater fool to whom wiser domestic investors sell just before the peak of the market. Certainly that could be argued of the Japanese, who sometimes appear to compensate for their genius in manufacturing by creating bubbles in finance. Maybe their sudden dash for foreign markets late last year should be taken as a warning signal.</p>

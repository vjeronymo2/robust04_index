			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Motor industry deal prompts pay fears Brazil's car workers are likely to return to work next week after reaching a compromise with the government and manufacturers over an 11.9 per cent pay claim. The main unions, which went on strike on Monday, bringing Brazil's important car industry near to a standstill, are to decide at meetings at the weekend whether to return to work. But union leaders and manufacturers' representatives are hopeful the dispute is over, and some people returned to work yesterday. The breakthrough came when the government withdrew from negotiations and said that it would not stand in the way of a one-off pay rise, as long as the increase was not passed on to customers in the form of higher prices. The government is trying to protect its new currency, the Real, from inflation, and argues that car makers can afford to pay for the increase from recent productivity gains, instead of by pushing up prices. The deal could lead to demands for pay rises from other unions. According to rules issued at the time of the Real's launch, pay rises can only be granted during each union's annual pay round. Since the pay round for the main car unions was not scheduled until April, other workers may now push to speed their claims. A widespread round of wage increases could weaken the Real, since it would be likely to add to consumer demand. Some economists say demand is already rising too quickly because of the rapid fall in inflation following the Real's introduction in July. The strike, which has so far led to lost production of 18,000 vehicles, mainly at Volkswagen, Ford and Mercedes-Benz, seems to have had no effect on the standing of either of the main candidates competing in next month's presidential election.</p>

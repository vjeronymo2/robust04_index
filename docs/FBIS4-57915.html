			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 24 May (PL) -- PRENSA LATINA learned today  that Cuba has taken another step toward normalizing relations  with Cuban emigrants by creating the Directorate for Affairs of  Cubans Residing Abroad [Direccion Para los Asuntos de los  Cubanos Residentes en el Exterior].    The new office reports directly to the Ministry of Foreign  Relations and has already started to implement agreements  reached at the recent Cuban emigrant conference, which took  place last month in Havana.    More than 200 Cubans residing in other countries attended  the  meeting, which was convened by the Foreign Ministry. They  discussed ways of securing normal relations with their country  of origin, despite the reasons that led them to live abroad.    Jose Cabanas, a graduate of the Higher Institute of the  Foreign Service of Cuba, was appointed to head the newly created  office, whose creation is also a result of the conference  between the Cuban Government and the participants at the April  conference.    According to sources close to the Foreign Ministry, Cabanas  is adding the final touches to the first decisions of his new  office. The decisions will be announced in the coming days.    Among the decisions, as announced by Foreign Minister  Roberto  Robaina during the recent conference, is the implementation of a  process for children of the emigrants to study certain  specialized careers at several Cuban higher education centers.    Likewise, there are several decisions that will make it  easier for Cuban nationals living abroad to travel to the  island, including the elimination of a provision requiring them  to pay for reservations at local hotels, which is part of the  tourism program that has been in place up until now.    The Foreign Ministry is planning to set up a publication  directed at improving information emigrants receive in the  countries where they live, particularly in the United States.  Conference participants admitted that this information is  distorted.    Work at the Directorate for Affairs of Cubans Residing  Abroad  is directed at implementing these decisions and creating ways to  expand the contacts initiated with the emigrants.</p>

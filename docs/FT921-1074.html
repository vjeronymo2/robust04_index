			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Drinks all round for top of the hops Drinkers in England and Wales show a marked taste for international brands of lager when they go to the pub but they remain loyal to regional brands of ale. Five of the pubs' best-selling beers last year were international lagers - Heineken, Foster's, Castlemaine, Carlsberg and Stella Artois. But only two ales, Allied-Lyons' Tetley bitter, and John Smith's bitter, brewed by Courage, laid claim to national popularity by gaining places in the list. Two national lagers, Carling Black Label and Skol, and Guinness stout occupied the remaining places in the top 10 which had total sales of Pounds 2.3bn, more than the combined sales of the next 30 brands. A survey by Stats MR, the market monitor, for Publican, the pub trade newspaper, lists only one independent regional brewer's product, Marston's Pedigree, in the top 100 best-selling drinks. But Ruddles, the Leicestershire brewer now owned by Grolsch of the Netherlands, wins a mention and regional tastes are reflected in the range of beers from the national brewers - Bass, Courage, Allied-Lyons, Whitbread and Scottish &amp; Newcastle - which dominate the Pounds 10bn a year pub market. The five brewers supplied 69 of the top 100 brands. A growing taste for stout has lifted Murphy's, distributed by Whitbread, into the top 50, and Courage's Beamish brand into the top 70. Holsten Pils leads the trendy premium packaged lagers but S&amp;N's Newcastle Brown ale is the most popular bottled beer. Bulmer's Strongbow and Taunton's Dry Blackthorn head five listed ciders. Diamond White packaged cider rates a higher placing than many bottled lagers. Bell's whisky, Bacardi rum, Gordon's gin, and Smirnoff vodka lead the spirits and specialty brands with places in the top 20, but the list also includes Southern Comfort, Martini Dry, Malibu, Pernod, Tia Maria, and Bailey's. Two brands of dark rum, a drink long considered out of fashion, are listed but not a single brandy. Perhaps less surprisingly, only one low alcohol beer, Bass's Tennents LA gets a rating.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 19 TASS -- Most Russian newspapers  highlight today Russia's peace initiative, which makes it  possible to avoid the bombing of positions of Bosnian Serbs by  NATO planes.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA writes that "the West asked Russia to do  its utmost for enabling NATO not to put its ultimatum into  effect... After adopting the ultimatum, which was prompted by  emotions and not careful calculations, and after realising how  dangerous its consequences may be, the NATO countries began  themselves to persuade Russia to do all it can for preventing  the bombing."    "Boris Yeltsin and Russian diplomats have managed to ward  off  the threat of the bombing of the positions of Bosnian Serbs. By  all appearances, the Russian diplomacy is set to develop the  initial success," the newspaper points out. This means that the  Moslems are expected to respond to the Russian initiative in the  same way as Serbs. The Russian diplomacy believes that its next  task is to achieve the demilitarisation of Sarajevo, following  the diplomatic breakthrough, and its putting under U.N. control,  as is envisaged by all the settlement plans. "This should be  followed by the settlement of local Bosnian problems, along with  keeping in sight a global settlement of the crisis."    According to ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, "the plan of the settlement  of the conflict, suggested by Boris Yeltsin, makes the bombing  senseless ... However, it is too early to celebrate a victory.  A successful settlement of the crisis, brought about by a mine  explosion at the Sarajevo market place and the death of 68  people, is just the first stage in establishing comprehensive  peace in the Balkan Peninsula. Many more joint actions will be  required from all countries of the world community before the  fratricidal war, which has been going on for 22 months, will be  ended with a peace settlement."    Analysing the Russian peace initiative and its possible  impact on the normalisation of the situation in Bosnia,  IZVESTIYA writes that "the Russian diplomacy is saving NATO from  the need to resort to force in Bosnia" and is giving a chance to  Serbs. "This breakthrough of the Russian diplomacy is a logical  and natural continuation of its Balkan policy, which has done  far more good than actions and statements of any other Russian  institution, party or group. Servicemen from various countries,  who are now in Bosnia as part of the U.N. peace-keeping force,  know well that not a single agreement has been fulfilled there  so far, not a single ceasefire accord has lasted long. The  situation with the latest agreement will become clear on Monday,  the day when the NATO ultimatum expires. Even if the situation  changes for the better, the settlement of the crisis around  Sarajevo is an important, but initial step towards stopping the  war and finding a political settlement in Bosnia and  Herzegovina."    According to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, "Russia's stand is clear: to  prevent NATO air strikes at Bosnian Serbs." In the opinion of  the author of the article, which is frontpaged by the newspaper  today, "whatever they say in the West about the fear that Serbs  felt after the NATO ultimatum, it is confidence that played a  decisive role in the fulfilment of its terms by Serbs, the  confidence that they feel for Russia and its servicemen." The  article points out, at the same time, that if the U.N. plan of  the troop withdrawal and the taking of Sarajevo under U.N.  control is put into effect, this first major victory over the  Bosnian nightmare will go to the credit both of the U.N., NATO  and the Russian diplomacy."</p>

			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIRGINIA BEACH PEACEFUL ON ANNIVERSARY OF RIOTING;  </P> <P> FESTIVAL: LABOR DAY BASH A YEAR AGO TORE UP CITY. THIS YEAR'S CELEBRATION IS A  MELLOW STREET PARTY, WITH NO MAJOR INCIDENTS REPORTED.  </P> <P> City officials Sunday labeled Laborfest '90 a mellow street party, a sharp  contrast with the tumultuous Labor Day weekend beach bash a year ago that  degenerated into violent looting and rioting.  </P> <P> Police had reported no major incidents Sunday and no felony arrests.  </P> <P> Since Friday evening, police had reported 48 arrests, including 26 for public  intoxication, and four summonses for unnecessary noise.  </P> <P> More than 50% of those charged with misdemeanors were white, 40% were black and  the few others were from different ethnic backgrounds.  </P> <P> The city had spent an estimated $2 million in preparations, including costs  related to running nonstop shuttle buses and overtime for city employees.  </P> <P> Officials estimated that 28,000 visitors were at the resort strip, down from  the estimated 100,000 who jammed onto Atlantic and Pacific avenues last year.  </P> <P> One year ago, Virginia Beach awoke on a Sunday morning to what looked like a  war zone. More than 100 storefronts had been smashed and merchandise looted at  a cost of $1.4 million.  </P> <P> The violence, which erupted during an annual gathering of college students from  predominantly black universities known then as "Greekfest," divided the city  and carried racial reverberations across the country.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca  Network in Spanish at 0530 GMT on 7 April broadcasts a live or  recorded 120-minute interview with Cuauhtemoc Cardenas,  presidential candidate of Mexico's Party of the Democratic  Revolution, PRD, during the "Let Us Speak Clearly" call-in  program hosted by journalist Lolita de la Vega.    After a brief introduction and a video clip of Cardenas'  biographical data, de la Vega begins receiving calls from people  shown on video who are identified by caption.    She asks Cardenas if his party agrees with some of the  ruling  party's policies, to which he replies: "We may agree in certain  areas." He says: "we are pleased with the initiation of the  negotiations in Chiapas, which in our opinion was necessary.  Fortunately, the government sought negotiations to prevent a  military resolution to the Chiapas conflict. We are also happy  to see inflation is under control. We recognize the  government's positive steps, but it is also our duty to point  out those things with which we disagree or which we believe are  negative."    When a caller asks Cardenas if he is running for president  again to serve Mexico or to satisfy his personal ambitions,  Cardenas replies: "I was asked by my fellow party members,"  adding, "we are seeking profound changes in the country. It was  not a personal decision. I can serve my country as a candidate,  as a president, or as a simple citizen but will always struggle  for democratic changes."    When de la Vega asks if he would be willing to invite  members  from other parties to participate in the changes he proposes, he  says: "Yes, of course. The only condition is that the person  should have a real commitment to make democratic changes, should  be someone known for his desire to serve, should have a proven  honor, capability, knowledge, and, as I said, a willingness to  make changes and to serve the country."    Concerning corruption, de la Vega asks what actions he would  take to ensure dishonest officials would be punished; he says:  "Certain mechanisms would have to be implemented, because as it  is the comptroller general's office does not function, because  it is both judge and defendant." He adds "this position should  be in the hands of the opposition."    Regarding his approach to tackle the problem of  unemployment,  he says: "I see the country's reconstruction as a joint effort  of many forces, not just of the government, private enterprise,  or workers. I believe private enterprise, workers, and the state  can work together to achieve common objectives. We all want to  create jobs, to increase production, to improve productivity, to  have better salaries, more purchasing power, more tax revenues,  more investment funds." He adds: "We must use our resources.  I believe one of our main acts should be to reactivate our  energy policy, to build electricity plants, to develop our oil  industry, to improve our highway system."    In response to a caller who asks him what would be his first  steps to separate the executive and judicial branches, Cardenas  says: "First of all, through a different policy; in other  words, by effectively complying with the law and the  Constitution and not by interfering with or intervening in areas  where we are not supposed to. The president should not go  beyond his constitutional and legal capacity. We should  effectively advance to guarantee the autonomy among the  government branches. I am confident the next Congress will be  different, because the majority of deputies and senators will  not owe their election to the president."    A caller asks Cardenas if he fears an attack similar to  Colosio's by members of his own party; he says: "No, much less  from within my party."    Cardenas is asked what he would do to resolve extreme  poverty, especially among Indians throughout the country. He  says: "We must spend more funds for this purpose and realize  the problem of poverty is affecting more than 50 percent of the  country's population; that is, more than 40 million Mexicans."  He adds: "We must encourage employment, better salaries; this  cannot be done overnight, but we must make great efforts to  revert current practices, to strengthen the educational system,  and to improve our health system."    A caller from Monterrey asks if he plans to unify health  service and improve salaries of professionals in the health  sector. Cardenas says: "We must make a great national effort,  both economic and political, to improve the salaries of all  workers." He adds: "How? Through a better distribution of  expenses, making better use of the country's resources, and by  managing those funds better."    De la Vega asks Cardenas what he thinks would be the best  solution to improve salaries; he says: "We must generate  economic activity, jobs, and better salaries." Asked to be more  specific in explaining his economic policy, he says his economic  proposal is "making the economic policy more social; in other  words, we must realize economic measures affect the people,  their standards of living, job opportunities." He adds: "We  will have to reduce interest rates, make our banking system more  efficient, create a climate of confidence for domestic and  foreign investors, and create the conditions to strengthen our  markets."    When asked why there should be international observers in  the  elections, he replies: "We believe if there is nothing to hide,  there can be observers both from inside the country and from  abroad who can contribute to cleaner elections, which is a  national demand that has become stronger after Colosio's death."    A caller from Mexico City asks Cardenas what actions he  would take against the mafia and manipulation of the public  through television stations. He replies: "I believe it is  absolutely necessary to open new opportunities in television, to  create the possibilities of opening television stations at  universities and higher centers for education, stations handled  by community organizations, opening more opportunities for  artistic creativity, for the film industry." He adds: "We  believe it is necessary to break the monopoly in the country,  specifically concerning Televisa, as it is unfair for one  station to have excessive coverage, which is what is happening  today."    When asked by a caller: "What lesson did all Mexicans get  from the problem in Chiapas?" Cardenas answers: "It showed us  there are problems of misery, arbitrariness by authorities, land  evictions, a lack of democracy, elections that are not held.  Those problems must be attacked at their roots. I believe this  is one of the main lessons we have received from the Chiapas  conflict, which also indicates what the solutions are: If we  attack misery, strengthen the productive sectors in that region,  if we end arbitrariness, we will surely prevent a similar  problem in Chiapas or any other part of the country."    De la Vega continues to read letters received from viewers.  She reads a letter from a Mexico City viewer who asks: "What  is your opinion of Subcommander Marcos?"    Cardenas replies: "We do not know much about him. He is a  fighter. He is definitely a fighter who defends his ideas. He  risks his life for his ideas and the people in whom he believes  and those who believe in him. We respect that position. We  have followed different paths in the hopes of solving similar  problems or reaching similar goals. We hope we will have the  opportunity to meet him during a future visit to Chiapas.  Perhaps we can sit down and talk and exchange views so that I  can have more firsthand information on what he wants and what we  can do to contribute to a stable peace in Chiapas and throughout  the country."    De la Vega then asks Cardenas what he will do for retirees.  Cardenas says: "We have suggested increasing pensions. During  the first phase of the plan we would like to increase them to at  least the minimum wage. We hope to later increase pensions to  the same salary the retired person earned while he was working."    De la Vega reads a letter from listener Rene Ortiz who asks:  "If the PRD wins the elections, what kind of a cabinet will you  have?" Cardenas answers: "With people from the various  political forces that support a democratic change," adding  "honest people who will honor their commitments. It will be a  pluralist government."    De la Vega then asks: "Do these people have a name?"  Cardenas responds: "In certain cases I can say yes, and I hope  I will be able to disclose those names shortly."    An unidentified speaker then asks Cardenas about Mexico's  economy and "how he plans to solve those problems?"    Cardenas says: "We have already said how we would solve  certain problems. As I said earlier, productive investment must  be boosted. We must stress job creation. We must reduce  interest rates and make loans more accessible so that more  investments can be made." Cardenas goes on to say: "We must  improve our road systems and build hydroelectric plants. The  construction industry must serve as a guide toward economic  recovery. That is what we must do to ensure the economy will  begin to recover, but everyone must contribute to this. We need  the help of the businessmen, the state, and workers."    Caller Juan Villagran asks Cardenas about changes to the  Constitution. The caller wants to know if Cardenas agrees with  the changes made. Cardenas responds: "We do not agree state  education is no longer free. I believe this is something we  must reinstate. Only elementary and high school education are  free today. I believe if the state is funding education, all  education, from kindergarten to the university, should be free.  We oppose other changes to the Constitution. We are against  changes made to Article 16 of the Constitution. This change  grants the Attorney General's Office the right to be judge and  jury. This office no longer needs a warrant issued by a judge  to arrest someone. We also oppose changes to Article 27,  because with these changes the people lose their right to demand  land that is in the hands of large landowners. These large  landowners have land that surpasses the amounts legally allotted  to one person. We oppose these changes and believe a review of  these changes would be appropriate and more changes made."    De la Vega reads a letter from viewer Elina Perez Gomez who  asks: "Mr. Cardenas, are you aware you have provoked violence  in our country? If you love Mexico and the memory of your  beloved father, you would not do the things you do. There are  mercenaries of war, and I believe you are involved with them."  Cardenas responds: "I do not agree with that opinion. We are  not seeking violence; quite the contrary, we have been victims  of violence. The PRD has lost more than 250 members. We do not  want more violence, and this is precisely why we are struggling  for a change in the country."    Viewers continue to ask questions on education and the PRD's  plans for those women who head households. Cardenas says: "We  want to offer these women the many rights and services the state  can offer. For example, they should have equal rights when  requesting a home; they should not be discriminated against when  requesting a job. They should also have the opportunity to  train for specific jobs so they can provide for their children.  That is what we must do."    Another viewer comments on the issue of ideological violence  and asks: "Don't you think that with your way of being you  contributed to Colosio's assassination?" Lolita de la Vega  says: "That is terrible." Cardenas replies: "I do not believe  I did." De la Vega says: "I am sure you did not."    De la Vega continues to read letters sent in by viewers. A  viewer from Veracruz wonders where Cardenas will get the money  the Mexican people need. He wonders if Cardenas will borrow the  money as other presidents have done. Cardenas answers: "No.  We will have to work with a budget. We can only spend what we  receive." De la Vega asks: "What if that is not enough?"  Cardenas responds: "We must find a way. We must better  distribute our resources. We must boost production. We must  ensure greater production, resources, more taxes." De la Vega  says: "But the people will not like the idea of more taxes."  Cardenas responds: "Not higher taxes. We need to get more  people to pay taxes. It does not mean we will increase the  taxes for those already paying taxes."    An unidentified caller asks Cardenas about his plans to  promote foreign investment in Mexico. Cardenas replies: "As I  said earlier, we must bring back trust and create the necessary  conditions for foreign investment to return to Mexico. Foreign  investment must be mainly in the production sector. It should  promote new projects that will create new jobs." Cardenas  continues to say this is possible with "an honest government, a  government that does not accept bribes and commissions, a  government that does not demand a share in investment, a  government that will treat everyone alike and give advantages to  those who wish to come to the country and take the risk to help  the country progress."    Again on the topic of women, Cardenas is asked about his  plans for women should he win the elections. Cardenas  reiterates women should have the same rights as men to an  education and a job. He adds many people must understand the  rights of women must be respected. Cardenas adds: "We must be  aware women will need special work schedules. We have made  women responsible for the care of children, old people, and the  sick, and something must be done to help them."    Lolita de la Vega then asks Cardenas how many women  candidates for the Senate his party will nominate, and he says  at least 30 percent of the nominees will be women. When she  asks why only 30 percent when women constitute 52 percent of the  Mexican population, Cardenas responds: "Because we are  advancing slowly. There are parties which do not even have that  many women candidates. This is a first for the PRD, and I hope  we will be able to do this. It is often not easy to find people  to work with."    A caller asks Cardenas about differences between the  political platform he had when he was a PRI member and his  current platform. Cardenas replies: "If you read the two  platforms carefully, you will find that there are not too many  changes." "This platform states the need to make democratic  changes; the need to build a democracy in the country."  Cardenas continues: "The only difference is that we are  opposed to corporate unions and corruption. We want a pluralist  government. We believe in changing political and economic  policies. We believe in seeking other social opportunities.  That is the basic difference between the two platforms."    Asked about the budget he plans to allocate for education,  Cardenas says: "We must strengthen the budget for higher  education. We have said that the education system should receive  at least 8 percent of the budget, but it would be great if we  could allocate more than 8 percent."    Regarding the loan U.S. President Clinton made to Mexico the  day after Luis Donaldo Colosio was assassinated, Cardenas said:  "It was done to save the country's economy. It was to keep our  currency, which is already weak, from falling. The U.S.  Government undoubtedly gave political aid to the Mexican  Government. That is the existing relationship between the two  governments, and I hope that this help, whenever it is positive  help, will continue once another administration assumes office."    Lolita de la Vega reads the final question for the evening:  "Will you accept the elections results even if you lose?    Cardenas responds: "The important thing is that we have  clean elections in the country. This is not something we should  see only on election day. We must begin to see it today. If  observers are allowed to come and observe, if all political  parties have access to the data on the electoral lists, if we  see that mistakes in the electoral lists are corrected, then we  will see that the conditions are right and that there is a  willingness to guarantee that the results are accurate. At that  point we will all have to admit that they were clean elections.  These changes, however, must begin right now. They cannot wait  until the last day. It is a process that takes months to  conclude."</p>

			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FIERY JAZZ PIANIST CAMILO TAKES NOTE OF HIS CRITICS;  </P> <P> MUSIC: THE DOMINICAN SAYS HIS FAST-PACED STYLE ISN'T AN AFFECTATION. HE PLAYS  THE COACH HOUSE ON SUNDAY.  </P> <P> "I guess you could call me a kind of hot-blooded person. I think quickly, I  talk quickly, and when I play, I hear all these notes. It's not that I'm trying  to show off, it's just the way I hear music."  </P> <P> Michel Camilo, who plays Sunday night at the Coach House in San Juan  Capistrano, is in fact one of the fieriest pianists to come down the jazz pike  since Oscar Peterson. His work snaps, crackles and pops with explosive  technical energy.  </P> <P> "I know I'm sometimes accused of having too much technique," Camilo  acknowledged. "But if everybody played alike, music would be boring. What makes  this life interesting -- and jazz in particular -- is personality. And that's  what I try to bring to my playing.  </P> <P> "Look at the players I've been most influenced by, players like Phineas  Newborn, Oscar Peterson, Bud Powell and Bill Evans. They all play a lot of  notes too. But they also have their own kind of minimalism, and so do I, I  hope."  </P> <P> A good part of the Dominican Republic native's technical expertise traces to  extensive classical training. A youthful prodigy in a family that already had  two generations of composers and performers, he began writing his first  compositions at age 5 and was playing major recitals before he was a teen-ager.  </P> <P> "I guess," he said with a laugh, "that I'd rather not throw away all those  painful years of practice and learning to play the instrument properly."  </P> <P> Still, Camilo seems to have made an effort to counteract some of the criticism  with his new Columbia/Epic album, "On The Other Hand."  </P> <P> "I chose (that title) for a reason," he said. "It's like I'm saying, 'Sure, I  can play fast, but, on the other hand. . . .' I see it as a kind of subtle way  of letting people know that there are different aspects to my playing.  </P> <P> "They think of me as a fiery player, but the album shows that I can write for  horns, that I love ensemble work, and that I sometimes love to play tender  music. It's like I'm flipping over the coin to show the other possibilities."  </P> <P> Camilo, bassist Michael Bowie and drummer Cliff Almond will demonstrate some of  those other possibilities at the Coach House with numbers from the new album as  well as selections from his first two chart-topping releases, "Why Not" (the  title song won a Grammy in 1983 for Manhattan Transfer) and "On Fire."  </P> <P> Many of the pieces reflect a blending of his Caribbean heritage with his  experiences living in New York City for more than a decade. Curiously, however,  when Camilo arrived in the city, there were few Caribbean traces in his  playing; he was a hard bop player, pure and simple.  </P> <P> "That's what I used to play in the Dominican Republic," he recalled. "I know  that sounds strange, but when you live on an island, you tend to look outside  for influences. And all the records I listened to were hard bop.  </P> <P> "Then, when I came to New York, there were so many different clubs, with so  many musicians who came here to measure themselves. . . . If you're going to  survive, you have to start thinking about what you can do that will be  different, that will help you stand out from the crowd."  </P> <P> Camilo's solution was to dip into his own background. "I said to myself, 'Wait  a minute, I'm not just a hard bop player. I've got all these influences, all  this other life experience, that I can use in my music.' And that's how I began  to write music that had a little Caribbean flavor."  </P> <P> He further developed his music by applying a few methods from his classical  training. "Classical pianists really know how to milk a melody, and I use that  approach. I try to find a shape for a song or a solo, something that makes it  more than a stream of notes and phrases -- something with a beginning, a middle  and an ending. And that's another place where the facility I have on the  instrument has helped me.  </P> <P> "But the bottom line for me is this: Does it move you or doesn't it move you?  Is it touching something inside or isn't it? It's not how many notes you play,  it's whether you're saying something or not. Whether you're painting the right  picture.  </P> <P> "Music is a language, the language of the soul. Especially jazz music. It's so  here, now, right at this very moment. And that's what I've always loved about  jazz. That's why I play it -- the challenge and the excitement and the  spontaneity of instant composition. It's living music, on the edge. That's the  risk of it. And I love living risky."  </P> <P>  Michel Camilo and Ric Flauding play Sunday at 8 p.m. at the Coach House, 33157  Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $15. Information: (714)  496-8930.  </P> <P> </P></p>

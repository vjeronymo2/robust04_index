			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 5 (XINHUA) -- China's legislature  today carried a law on protection of investments of Taiwan  compatriots and a supplementary decision on severely punishing  illegal emigration and border crossing.    The two laws were passed at the closing ceremony of the  Sixth  Session of the Standing Committee of the National People's  Congress (NPC), over which its chairman, Qiao Shi, presided.    The 15-clause investment law is intended to protect Taiwan  investors' legal interests in the country's mainland, and  promote economic exchanges across the Taiwan straits, according  to officials from the NPC law committee.    The law stipulates that Taiwan investments will not be  nationalized or requisitioned; under special circumstances or  for the public good, the state may purchase them through legal  procedures and the investors will be reimbursed.    The investments, possessions, property rights, profits and  other legal incomes of Taiwan compatriots in the mainland are  protected by the law and are allowed to be transferred or  inherited, the law states.    Taiwan investors will receive decisions, positive or  negative, from government bodies within 45 days of their  applications being submitted, the law also said.    Profits and other rightful income of Taiwan investors can be  remitted back to Taiwan other regions outside the mainland.    "This will guarantee that the interests of Taiwan investors  will not be harmed by red tape," a senior lawmaker said.    The supplementary decision on punishing "snake heads," as  mercenaries engaged in illegal emigrants trafficking have been  dubbed, says that the worst criminals may face life imprisonment  or the death penalty.    This tough supplement to the country's criminal law will  effectively curb the crime of illegal emigration and border  crossing, legislators said, and order on the country's borders  will be better maintained.    The new law provides that the worst criminals, recidivists,  or ones who cause severe wounding or death to illegal emigrants,  may be given sentences of seven years to life imprisonment.    Those who murder, wound, rape or sell illegal emigrants whom  they organized, or wound or murder border inspectors, may be  sentenced to death, according to the law.    The NPC Standing Committee ratified nine new deputies'  membership of the National People's Congress. Five NPC deputies  died since last year, one resigned, and two were deprived of  their seats because of corrupt practices.    The NPC Standing Committee approved the draft agenda for the  13-day Second Plenary Session of the Eighth NPC, beginning on  March 10, and the draft list of the presidium and secretary  general of the full session. These will be decided by its  preparatory meeting.    The committee also approved the work report of the NPC  Standing Committee for deliberation at the full session.    A draft decision to grant the Xiamen economic zone  province-like legislative rights will be further deliberated in  the coming national session, according to the meeting.    The committee also ratified China's entry to several  international treaties and several appointments and replacements.</p>

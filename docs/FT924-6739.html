			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / GEC unions win enhanced pay-offs UNION negotiators yesterday claimed victory when GEC Avery, the Birmingham-based weighing equipment subsidiary of the UK electronics and electrical engineering group, agreed to restore an enhanced redundancy pay agreement for more than 2,000 workers. The agreement, due to be signed today, wins back the right to redundancy pay for workers employed before April 6. It had been cut about two years ago as part of an economy drive. The move follows a damages award by the High Court to a former employee made redundant on inferior terms. The company has agreed to pay unions' court costs of Pounds 130,000.</p>

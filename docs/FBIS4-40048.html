			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [No dateline as received] -- The president of  the Republic of Kazakhstan has addressed the Republican Supreme  Council with this message: [passage omitted]    A short while ago -- two and a half years ago -- Kazakhstan,  as well as all the other CIS countries, began its policy of  implementing radical market reforms, and since then it has  achieved considerable success in introducing market reforms.  The old system's foundations have already been demolished.  Transformations are now irreversible.    We have also demolished the old system of management and  production, the centralized distribution of resources, material  benefits, and labor. On the whole, we have introduced a change  from guided price formation to a free pricing practice that  reflects sales opportunities. The state will regulate only a  small list of the socially important goods and services.    The state has eliminated restrictions with regard to wages  in  the production sphere and services. The "Iron Curtain" in  foreign trade has been eliminated and demonopolization has been  carried out. The influx of foreign investments to the country's  economy has considerably increased. The radical reform of the  budget and banking system is continuing, with a view of adapting  them to civilized norms. The loan capital and currency markets  are being created, labor and housing markets are expanding.    We are changing our view on property. At present, the  process of dismantling of state ownership is quite active and  conditions are created for further privatization of state  enterprises.    The institution of private property is being granted the  same  kind of rights as the state in terms of economic relations and  public attitude. [passage omitted]    At present, Kazakhstan is living through an extremely  difficult social and economic crisis, which is unique in a  sense. First, crisis is something that accompanies any market  economy. All the developed countries, at one stage or another,  had to face it. The main thing is to minimize its consequences,  speed up the rate of lifting the country's economy out of this  crisis. Nobody ever succeeded in escaping it. Unfortunately,  we had to start with a crisis stage.    Second, Kazakhstan has gained its sovereignty at a time of  obvious crisis manifestations, caused by deficiencies in the  administrative methods of economy management, which have  exhausted themselves.    Third, the crisis that we are living through has been caused  by the disintegration of the old economic system and the need to  establish a new one. [passage omitted] The main reason for the  deepening crisis is the disintegration of the USSR.  Kazakhstan's economy, on the day of it gained independence was  a part of the powerful and monolithic economy of the USSR, which  used to fulfill its own local tasks. [passage omitted]    We also inherited an unbalanced trade balance, especially  with Russia. In 1990 we imported produce worth 18 billion  rubles (in prices of that time) and exported goods worth half of  this sum. This negative balance is now being treated as the  state debt of the country, which affects the state budget.  Under the worsening financial situation, under the conditions  of the open market and with prices for fuel approaching the  world level, Kazakhstan has overproduced such commodities as  meat, phosphorus, fertilizers, tractors, cement, and others.  The market for Kazakhstan's goods is restricted mainly by the  CIS space. Consumers, both domestic and internal, have become  more choosy in selecting goods, taking into account both  quality, quantity, and price. The volumes of production of the  once strategically important types of goods exceed the domestic  needs of the country. Due to their quality and absence of  experience in foreign market's trading they do not have a  reliable and stable market outside Kazakhstan. [passage omitted]    Animal husbandry in agriculture is inefficient with its high  prices for forage and absence of selectivity [sentence as  received]. We have extremely high volumes of grain production  that exceed the needs of the country. The areas under crops are  extremely large and, at the same time, we have low crop  capacity. [passage omitted].    Third [as received], [words indistinct] market forces have  encouraged the creation and development of new sectors of  economy, new economic businesses, and operations. They have  filled the void and begun to bring the country's economy in  compliance with new demands. At the preliminary stage,  entrepreneurs channeled their efforts to the circulation sphere,  as the most efficient for private business. Trade and the  service sphere, which used to occupy a small place before, is  being developed rapidly. [Word indistinct] an active process of  redistribution of the capital and work force, a more flexible  movement of commodity resources in accordance with the demands  of the market economy have started as a result of appearance of  [words indistinct] in some other spheres of the economy.  [passage omitted]    We have compatible enterprises in all the spheres of  economy,  in order for them to survive and develop we need large  investments, both external and internal. But all the long-term  spendings are possible under one condition that the inflation  rate will remain at a level not higher than 10 percent. The  issue is to improve the economy financially. That will make  internal investments possible. The population will have a  stimulus for accumulating capital [words indistinct] and  modernizing production. We need a tough financial policy by the  National Bank, no matter how difficult this may be. There is no  other alternative.    The efficiency of the market economy's policy and practical  activity, which is being conducted by the government, apart from  objective factors, is being impeded by certain unthoughtful  steps and decisions, mistakes. [passage omitted]    The old parliament was too slow to follow the dynamics of  the socio-economic and political processes. [Word indistinct]  elaboration of laws, there were around 300 of them, have been  too quick and done without approbation. Quite often deputies  were used as machines for voting. At the same time, drafts of  the certain legal acts on the most urgent problems of state and  economic life have been left unexamined. Among them is the  draft program of the legal reform that was submitted for  consideration by the parliament two years ago. Its adoption  would have helped to make considerable changes in this sphere  and would not have made possible the acuteness of the  constitutional reform problem. [passage omitted] The banking  system has not been prepared to work under new conditions.  Wide-scale and nonregulated liberalization of banking activity,  unrestricted freedom of activity of commercial banks, imperfect  legislation, and unprepared financial and credit policies of the  state for the market economy's principles and conditions have  resulted in the situation where negative tendencies became  domineering. The fact that we are lagging behind with the  reform in the banking system, slows down the adaptation of  production to market conditions, its diversification, and the  development of market forces. [passage omitted]    The government is too slow in tackling the topical issues,  it  has not elaborated the procedure and mechanism of bankruptcy.  Its tax policy and practice, as well as its policy in many  other issues is not up to the mark. The government has been  slow in creating the market of securities, insurance policy,  creating a civilized market infrastructure. There are a lot of  serious problems in dismantling, managing state property and  state owned enterprises. [passage indistinct].    Society focuses its attention on Legislative and Executive  Branches of power, ignoring judicial. At the same time, the  court is the most important element in the defending rights and  freedoms of people. The Judicial Branch of power in Kazakhstan  has not yet found its place. [passage omitted] Recognizing the  mistakes that have been made, we at the same time, should  understand that Kazakhstan, its political and state leadership  along with society, are in the process of learning, mastering  the new, and implementing large-scale transformations. The  situation in the country could have been worse. [passage  indistinct].    At the same time, political stability depends on the  economic  situation. Therefore, furthering the economic reform also  becomes a political problem. [passage omitted] The moment that  we are living through is illustrative in the sense that the old  economic system has stopped being an integral system, and the  roots of the new one are not yet strong enough. The only way of  supporting them and stabilizing the economy is to facilitate  rates of transformations. We should not waste our time. This  will not make the situation easier, it will just elongate and  over complicate things. Last year and the beginning of the  present year have shown this vividly. We will still have to  travel a long and difficult journey. The main thing is to draw  our lessons from accumulated experience and make amends to the  program of reforms. [passage indistinct] In general we know  what to do next: These are the dismantling and privatization of  state ownership, anti-inflationary policy, minimization of  budget deficits and the positive balance of payments,  introduction of a tough mechanism of bankruptcy, liberalization  of prices, trade, and the creation of a competitive environment.  The problem that the political leadership of the country is  facing today is: A) Either to conduct the policy of reforms, as  before and at the same rate, with due consideration taken of the  available resources. It essentially means counting on our own  resources and the introduction of maximum restrictions in the  social sphere; or B) Taking into consideration the general  situation, to choose something new and make amends to the  current policy so as to ensure higher dynamism and efficiency of  reforms. Until now we conducted the policy of minimizing the  budget deficit, suppressing inflation, increasing taxes, and  restricting spendings. Such a financial policy has contributed  to a much quicker formation of market relation and, at the same  time, has resulted in a crisis in the social sphere. The  beginning of the current year has shown that reduction of  spendings in this particular sphere has reached its limit, which  is unacceptable by the population. Behind it is the degradation  and disintegration of a number of branches of industry. [passage  indistinct]</p>

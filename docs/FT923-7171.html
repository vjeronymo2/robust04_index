			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Sense of urgency catches up with Tokyo: Bank support measures aim to ease selling pressure on the stock market MR Tsutomu Hata, Japan's finance minister, has come a long way by finally admitting the extent of the gloom pervading the country's banking system. He may well have had a long night waiting for reaction to the emergency package he announced yesterday. The bank support measures materialised after increasing pressure from business leaders and continuing sharp declines on the stock market. Until recently, the government had maintained a complacent stance towards troubles in the banking sector and financial markets, denying that any real problems existed. However, in a complete turnaround, the Finance Ministry yesterday expressed concern over the health of the Japanese banking system, acknowledging that the banks faced the 'most severe situation since the second world war'. Mr Hata's comments reflect the urgency of the rescue measures. The finance minister said the measures were a part of the government's larger emergency economic package to be announced this autumn but that an early announcement had been favoured to increase the effectiveness of the assistance. The aim of the measures is to introduce stability into the troubled banking system in order that banks will be able to provide liquidity once the economy recovers. However, the package is a temporary solution, including some measures which could be seen as 'window dressing' of accounts. However, the underlying aim is to support Japan's banks, and consequently the stock and real estate markets, by reducing the pressure to sell stock holdings. Profits would be shored up and the squeeze on credit eased by requesting banks to ease internal rules on property-related loans and providing banks with new means to raise capital. This would be achieved by the following means: The ministry will ask banks not to sell stock holdings to realise gains in order to shore up interim term profits for the six months to September. Mr Hata said the ministry wanted banks to break the 'vicious circle' where stock selling by banks to realise profits on holdings erodes unrealised gains on share investments, and creates the further need to raise profits by selling shares. To lift rules limiting the payout of dividends to 40 per cent of net profits, in order to ease pressure on banks to raise profits. To allow banks to switch accounting measures where stocks can be carried at cost, and evaluation losses on share holdings could be reported separately from the profit and loss statements. To request banks to ease internal restrictions on real estate lending, thus ensuring the flow of funds necessary for a healthy economy. To ensure that the banks meet the capital requirements set by the Bank for International Settlements by introducing new capital-raising instruments, such as perpetual subordinated loans. To enhance securitisation of loans by allowing banks to break up loan assets into small lot securities. To study ways to eliminate non-performing debts at non-bank financial institutions including housing loan companies. To study ways to activate the stagnating real estate market, thus enabling banks to sell property held as collateral. To help banks dispose of their problem loans smoothly, including providing tax incentives. To disclose the amount of problem loans at the banks at the end of the current fiscal year, using new, broader standards. For the coming interim term to September, however, the ministry will disclose the banks' bad loans by applying the former standard, where only loans on which interest has not been paid for six months or more are considered non-performing. To enhance further deregulation of the financial system and to urge banks to increase rationalisation efforts. Japanese bankers welcomed the ministry's proposals, and Mr Tsuneo Wakai, chairman of the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan, said he considered the measures appropriate, adding that the banking industry would do its best to ensure stability in the financial system. Mr Sakae Kudo, chairman of the Japan Securities Dealers Association, also expressed the hope that the measures would help wipe out concerns about the banking system. Mr Minoru Nagaoka, president of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, said that the ministry's steps would be effective in lifting share prices. While Mr Hata acknowledged that the proposals offered only temporary solutions, based on the assumption that the Japanese economy and stock market would recover at the end of the fiscal year to March, he expressed his confidence of an upturn in both areas. 'The economic support measures will support the economy, and in effect wipe out uncertainty towards share prices.' However, this view is not shared by many economists who forecast a delayed economic recovery. Also, the stock market still fears that the Nikkei could fall by a further 1,000 to 2,000 points, to as low as 12,000.</p>

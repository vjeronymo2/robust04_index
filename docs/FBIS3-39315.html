			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, NATO, February 14 (BTA) -- Bulgarian  President Zhelyu Zhelev signed the document on Bulgaria's  joining the Partnership for Peace plan in Brussels today.  Bulgaria is the eighth country to join it.    "I would like once again to hail NATO's readiness to open  itself to the security problems of East Europe and to admit new  members in the future. I hope that the process of evolution  starting with Partnership for Peace will be based on equal  treatment and respect for the lawful interests of the partners  in the area of security, and that the provision of security  guarantees in the future will be considered," President Zhelev  said at the ceremony in Brussels.    In his speech Mr. Zhelev described Bulgaria's joining the  Partnership for Peace plan as a stage of its sovereign policy of  integration into the European and Euro-Atlantic structures. Mr.  Zhelev said that "the Republic of Bulgaria already a NATO  partner, will pursue its sovereign course to full membership in  NATO."    President Zhelev specially stressed that "Bulgaria's  arguments for its participation in NATO do not contain elements  that could be interpreted as being directed against Russia."  "On the contrary, we support Russia's democratic and reformist  forces and wish them success. We are convinced that NATO is in  a condition to find adequate ways and means for Russia to become  committed to European security, without encouraging the imperial  ambitions of certain would-be dictators," Mr. Zhelev said.    Speaking of the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia,  President  Zhelev said they were a challenge to Bulgaria's security and  caused -- through the international sanctions -- formidable  difficulties for this country's economic reform. "Bulgaria's  policy to the Yugoslav crisis was and remains principled,  consistent, peaceful and inspired by good intentions. I am sure  it will be given credit by our Western partners, by all  civilized and democratic countries," Mr. Zhelev said.    "I am convinced that the North Atlantic alliance has made a  good choice by seeking a new type of security in integrated  Europe through the joining of the new democracies. This is a  momentous process which helps democracy strike strong roots in  East Europe and bear fruit that will not have a bitter after  taste for the people who overthrew communism full of hope,  self-confidence and a firm belief in a worthy future that the  West would support," the Bulgarian president said about  Partnership for Peace. He pointed out that for Bulgaria, the  concept of security has military, as well as economic, social,  political and humanitarian dimensions. Mr. Zhelev recalled that  the idea of cooperation with NATO meets with broad public  support in Bulgaria, and that Bulgarian Parliament was the first  in East Europe to adopt a special declaration on the Partnership  for Peace plan.    Mr. Zhelev stated that Bulgaria is ready to adjust its  defense policy to that of the European democracies, the United  States and Canada.    President Zhelev said Bulgaria is the only East European  country invited to join Partnership for Peace, which borders on  two NATO members in the Balkans -- Greece and Turkey. He added  that Bulgaria had reached a good level of cooperation in the  political, economic, military and military-technical sectors  with them. "Its most valuable asset is a remarkable  `transparency' in relations, which transcended the measures  envisaged in the Armed Forces in Europe Treaty so that we  ourselves expanded them on a bilateral basis," Mr. Zhelev said.  He also pointed out that "Bulgaria cannot remain indifferent to  the fact that the military balance in the Balkans does not match  the new political realities in so far as some Balkan countries  have not acceded to the European agreements and therefore their  arms are not under control."    President Zhelev is expected back in Bulgaria tonight.</p>

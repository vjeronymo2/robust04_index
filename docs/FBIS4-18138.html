			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "French Inconsistencies in Haiti"] </F>   [Text] Does France have a policy toward Haiti? One could  doubt it in view of the latest government inconsistency. A  minor inconsistency, but one which says much about the absence  of a long-term vision. Lucette Michaux-Chevry, minister  delegate responsible for humanitarian action and human rights,  had decided to send a ship carrying 530 tonnes of food to Haiti  to relieve the suffering of the population, in particular  children. On Friday, 25 March, the military succeeded in  preventing the ship from berthing, and threated to attack  members of the local French community with the clear design of  forcing Paris to retreat.    It would be annoying and embarrassing if the handful of drug  traffickers, military people, and corrupt policemen who exercise  power in Haiti were to achieve such an easy success. Last  October, a few vociferous neo-Duvalierian "demonstrators" were  enough to dissuade Washington from disembarking 200 U.S. and  Canadian blue helmets tasked with guaranteeing the return to  democracy and that of the country's legal president,  Jean-Bertrand Aristide, overthrown in a coup two years earlier.  The same scenario is being repeated.    The "neo-Duvalierians" nonetheless have certain reasons to  denounce the "cynicism" of France, which is trying to ease its  conscience with humanitarian aid while demanding, ever since the  American about-face, a total international embargo on Haiti --  right now only arms and oil are targeted.    In the name of humanitarianism, Paris has demonstrated a  democratic intransigence toward Haiti which it has scarcely  exhibited toward General Gnassingbe Eyadema's Togo or Omar  Bongo's Gabon.    The first president in his country's history to have been  elected by universal suffrage, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whose  life was saved during General Cedras' coup thanks mainly to the  French ambassador's intervention, has received unfailing support  from Paris, which has readily minimized the errors or mistakes  of a personality who, while very popular in the shantytowns of  Port-au-Prince, lacks the stature of a statesman.    Paris has frequently found itself at odds with Washington  over Haiti. France, whose strategic and economic interests in  Haiti are not as great as those of the United States, is neither  willing nor able to send a contingent of soldiers to the country  to reestablish a semblance of democracy in Port-au-Prince.</p>

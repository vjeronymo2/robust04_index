			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Lottery bidder to seek up to 500 staff Camelot, one of eight bidders for the National Lottery licence, yesterday became the first of the rival consortia to begin large-scale recruiting of staff. The consortium, which brings together Cadbury Schweppes, De La Rue, Gtech, ICL and Racal, said yesterday that it expects about 300 jobs to be created in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, and up to 200 on Merseyside. Jobs are being advertised and the consortium will push ahead with recruiting even though a decision on the lottery licence winner is unlikely before May. Although the aim is to make job offers to suitable candidates, the offers will be conditional on Camelot winning the licence.

Camelot, which is widely believed to be one of the leading contenders, hopes to have a full complement of staff virtually in place in time for a decision about the winner. The consortium would aim to launch the lottery, which is in aid of good causes, within six months of winning the licence. Meanwhile Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow national heritage secretary, yesterday published a list of 14 Conservative MPs, including several former ministers, who are acting as advisers to companies bidding for the lottery licence. They include Mr Kenneth Baker, the former home secretary who was responsible for the white paper introducing the lottery to parliament, and Mr David Mellor, the former national heritage secretary. Ms Mowlam said: 'This is yet another example of Tory vested interests at work.'</p>

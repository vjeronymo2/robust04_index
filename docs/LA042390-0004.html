			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EARTH DAY 1990;  </P> <P> OVER 50,000 PACK PARK AT EARTHFAIR  </P> <P> An eclectic alliance of earth's citizens -- from big business to Hare Krishnas,  from new-age musicians and a British choral group to "cosmic comic" Timothy  Leary, from 6,000 participants in a 5-K run to 800 children in a downtown  parade -- celebrated Earth Day Sunday in San Diego.  </P> <P> EarthFair at Balboa Park attracted more than 50,000 persons -- if not tens of  thousands more, organizers said, and if it was a celebration, it was also part  swap meet -- with home-made jewelry and crafts being hawked, part zoo -- with  traffic and parking headaches, and part trade-show, with private companies  selling their services and wares to save the earth.  </P> <P> In all, there were over 220 booths and stands where representatives of various  organizations and businesses held forth.  </P> <P> It was both high-tech -- with companies selling alternative energy and water  conservation devices -- and deja vu original Earth Day 1970, right down to the  tie-dye T-shirts and at least one booth warning young people to be wary of the  military.  </P> <P> And it was undisputably a success, organizers said.  </P> <P> "A lot of people said this couldn't be done, that we wouldn't be able to get  this many people interested in Earth Day," said Carolyn Chase, director of San  Diego Earth Day 1990 and whose husband, Chris Klein, served as production  manager for the EarthFair.  </P> <P> "We wanted people to leave with a new experience, of how diverse people are who  have to get along on this planet, that somehow we all have to share this  planet. And I think we showed a mandate to our political leaders that yes,  people will vote to solve our environmental problems," Chase said.  </P> <P> The event involved the work of 400 volunteers and cost $40,000 to stage, and  organizers hoped they would recoup that through T-shirt sales and fees paid by  exhibitors, ranging from $35 from the most benign nonprofit group to $300 for  the largest commercial business.  </P> <P> Chase said organizers caught some flak from the strictest environmental groups  because some businesses not perceived to be environmental champions shared the  same exhibit areas as traditional and sometime militant environmentalists.  </P> <P> "But some of the people who cause the problems are going to have to be the ones  who help solve them," she said. "So we wanted them here, too."  </P> <P> Indeed, dichotomy and irony were evident throughout, all in the name of Earth.  </P> <P> A number of animal protection organizations shared the same sidewalk as the  food vendor grilling up fresh hamburgers; San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. gave  away 10,000 free pine trees -- all it had on hand -- by 1:20 p.m., while just  50 feet way, UCAN (Utility Consumers Action Network) displayed an amended  SDG&amp;E logo, "SD Gags on Edison."  </P> <P> The San Diego Herpetological Society set up a booth to promote the virtues of  amphibians and snakes -- just a few feet removed from the America Rat, Mouse  &amp; Hamster Society. But the rats, mice and hamsters were safe in their  cages, and the only snake in evidence was an intimidatingly large boa that had  wrapped itself around the neck of a bare-chested man who was strutting around  the grounds as if he were Father Earth.  </P> <P> Exhibit booths proclaimed, "Save our Ocean," "Save our Wilderness," "Save the  Dolphin," "Save the Wolf," "Save the Children" and "Save the toner cartridge"  -- a spiel by more than one exhibitor to recycle photocopier toner cartridges  rather than buy new ones.  </P> <P> "It's stupid to throw out five pounds of plastic when you can recharge the  toner cartridge for your copier," said John Buzzard, handing out his brochures  to passers-by.  </P> <P> Indeed, just about any business that could work an Earth angle seemed to have  set up shop at Balboa Park.  </P> <P> There was, for instance, Executive Images, a firm that consults executive women  on their most flattering colors. "Earth tones aren't any more popular than the  other colors," said a smartly-dressed woman in black and fuchsia. "What's  important to our customers is that we don't use animals in our testing."  </P> <P> Say what?  </P> <P> A termite control company pitched that it doesn't use pesticides to kill the  pesky bug. It freezes them. Hey, man, that's cool.  </P> <P> Around one booth, half-a-dozen people sat quietly in folding chairs, eyes  closed, as they received free therapy massage from assistants who held their  shoulders, their heads, their chests, their necks and their backs. "Reiki  Universal Life Energy," said the banner. People were signing up for their free  massage. More people just stood and watched.  </P> <P> A few booths over, Terrence C. Burns was selling portfolios featuring mutual  bond investments in environmentally conscious companies. "You can talk all you  want about the environment," he said, "But it's money that's going to make it  happen. "A lot of money. A lot of investments. But maybe you can make some  money, too."  </P> <P> Sign up here.  </P> <P> One exhibitor sold "hologram earth watches" and yes, some watch faces depicted  globes. Others had a single, large eyeball, and others featured the classic  peace symbol of the '60s.  </P> <P> Vendors sold Dove Bars and Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream novelties -- some of  them which, on Sunday, were renamed "Peace Pops." One food booth featured  Cosmic Veggie Dogs and BBQ Earth Balls.  </P> <P> There were Democratic Party and Republican Party booths, and one to help create  a "Green Party" in California.  </P> <P> One exhibit was for the "Project on Youth and non-military opportunities,"  which admonished young people to "check out the facts about military life . . .  before you sign up."  </P> <P> Save the earth by riding trolleys? Visit the booth staffed by the Citizen's  Light Rail Committee. Insist on still driving your car? Visit the Bureau of  Automotive Repair booth, a few feet away.  </P> <P> Who were the single most interesting characters of the day? The couple dressed  up as Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd? Or the three young men, naked except for  some very short grass skirts? ("Fronds of the earth," Chris Klein quipped.) Was  it the man wearing the gas mask and carrying the placard, "Ugly Smelly Air"? Or  was it Captain Healthy, dressed in black leotards, black tights, gold lame cape  and the black Zorro mask? (He was Maurice Luten, Smokey to his friends,  drumming up some business for his weight control center.)  </P> <P> At the Organ Pavilion, Robert Plimpton put the organ's pipes through their  paces, playing pieces such as "Seventh Dance of Creation." "I didn't find any  music inspired by smog," he said, "and I didn't find any music inspired by acid  rain."  </P> <P> Across the park, a 1960s folk group was singing "Sixteen Tons," their music  amplified through speakers powered by solar-energized batteries.  </P> <P> Next to the reflecting pool -- not far from the Toastmasters booth and the La  Jolla Republicans booth, Cynthia Lynn Douglass produced celestial sounds on her  Celtic harp. Donations appreciated.  </P> <P> And bongo drums were everywhere. Dogs, too. Bongo drums and big dogs, meeting  nose-to-nose, as friendly as could be like maybe this was Dog Day.  </P> <P> A mounted San Diego police officer sat proud on his non-polluting horse, posing  for pictures for kids visiting the park for the first time. "Stay clear of the  rear," he advised them, as one youngster yanked on the horse's tail. A hundred  yards away, a utility truck ran a mechanical snake through an overflowing  sewage drain. "Too many people using the restrooms," a worker sighed.  </P> <P> Ah, Earth Day at the park.  </P> <P> There were performing cats taught to teeter on basketball-size globes, and  face-painting opportunities, and a place you could paint the burlap or canvas  bags you bought on the other side of the park ($16.95 plus tax, shipping and  handling) so you wouldn't have to answer, "Paper or plastic?"  </P> <P> T-shirt booths did brisk business. There was the souvenir edition, "Think  Globally, Act Locally," that pitched Earth Day 1990 -- San Diego. Then there  was the keepsake version for tourists: "Earth Day on the Bay," featuring a  silhouette of tall sailing ship and of the Hotel del Coronado, to take back  home to Kansas.  </P> <P> Maureen Colt, 28, of El Cajon, bought 14 -- count 'em, 14 -- Earth Day T-shirts  and sweat shirts. "This is something I want my children and nephews and nieces  to remember," she said. "We all need to learn what we can do as individuals to  help the earth. If every individual did just one thing, then as a whole we can  contribute what we've learned to save the earth. And these T-shirts will be a  reminder."  </P> <P> Other souvenirs would come in the form of reborn commitments to be lived out.  </P> <P> "I was raising my children during the first Earth Day," said 47-year-old Bonnie  Brennan of Clairemont. "Now I find myself much more involved. Now I know that  my own little world is global. I missed out 20 years ago, but now I know things  I can do." Among them, she said, was to set up an ongoing Earth Day Committee  at Sharp Memorial Hospital, where she is a nurse, to better recycle paper, cans  and other material. "I don't want Earth Day to be a one-day celebration," she  said. "I want it to go on from here."  </P> <P> Matthew Kalnik, 27, of Mira Mesa, was cooling off from his 5-K run earlier in  the day and reflected on what lessons he had learned. "I'm a lot more aware of  how I've got to separate toxics, like paint cans and pesticide containers, from  my garbage," he said.  </P> <P> Younger people -- including some not even born by the first Earth Day -- said  they learned their lessons too. Nineteen-year-old Janae Green said she learned  just how low San Diego's water supply is, and of how people waste it.  </P> <P> There was some cynicism during the day, too. "I'm afraid a lot of this is going  to wash off people in a few days," worried Tom Smith, 26, of Rancho Bernardo.  Kody Peterson, 22, of La Jolla, griped: "A lot of companies are here, like  they're big environmentalists, but all they are are hypocrites."  </P> <P> Perhaps most affected by the day were Mike and Kathy Schearing -- who, nine  months ago, made plans to get married at Balboa Park's Cafe del Rey Moro on  April 22, and not realizing until last week that they'd be battling with  EarthFair.  </P> <P> "They only reason we could get the limo in here was because my sister knew the  police officer," said the bride, resplendent in her white gown as thousands of  casually dressed people walked by, gawking at the stretch limousine that maybe  was carrying Mother Earth herself. "A bunch of our friends never got here for  the reception. They didn't want to fight the traffic."  </P> <P> Added the groom, "We'll never forget Earth Day. We sent out a few invitations  and instead, we got the world."  </P></p>

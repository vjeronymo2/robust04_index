			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kong Fanjin (1313 4907 6855) of Commercial </F> Information Center of the Ministry of Domestic Trade: "Trend of  Supply and Demand of Major Consumer Goods for 1994"]    [Text] The market of consumer goods will continue to  maintain a steady growth in 1994. On the basis of the  presumption that the GNP will grow 9 percent, the industrial  production 15 percent, the agricultural production 4 percent,  the urban and rural residents' incomes 24 percent, the total  investment in fixed assets 13 percent and all other economic  targets are fulfilled as planned, the total amount of retail  sales in 1994 would reach 1.57 trillion yuan, up 18 percent over  1993. If price increases are factored in, the actual percentage  would be approximately 7.3 percent, of which the amount of  retail sales for consumer goods would grow approximately 19  percent and the capital goods for agriculture approximately 10  percent. We estimate that the sales of major commodities will be  as follows:    Grain Preliminarily we estimate that China's  total grain output will be 451.79 million tons. A balance  between supply and demand will be basically achieved on the  grain market with a slight over-supply. However, structural  imbalance will remain existent. This year, the price for  purchasing farm products will steadily move upwards in general.  The increase will not be excessively high this year, because  last year's price was already relatively high. The price  increase is not expected to exceed 10 percent. As for specific  varieties of grain, the situation of wheat shortage has been  alleviated. The supply of wheat will exceed the demand slightly.  Due to the readjustment of the import policy and the  introduction of the single foreign exchange rate, the market  price is expected to go up on a small scale. The prices of  millet and soybean will remain strong because of the continuous  expansion of millet and soybean exports and the increasing  demand of such farm products on the domestic market. The price  of soybean is expected to rise only slightly, while that of  millet will be relatively higher. The supply of paddy rice will  be slightly insufficient, because the area planted with paddy  rice was dropping every year and its output declined on a large  scale. It is possible that the situation of rice shortage may  reappear in some areas. Price increase may be relatively high,  and there is an inkling of such price increase. The price of  oil-bearing crops may rise on a large scale this year due to low  inventory and dwindling output.    Cotton. This year's demand for cotton is about 4.5  million tons. The supply and demand of cotton in China are  relatively stable. Cotton is mainly used in light industry,  textile industry, cotton for wadding, exports, cotton reserve  and other uses. A balance has been basically achieved in the  exports and imports of cotton in recent years. The use of cotton  for wadding and other uses is basically stable. The supply and  demand for cotton in 1994 are mainly dependent on cotton  production and how much cotton will be used by textiles and  other light industrial products. After the 10 percent increase  of the cotton-purchasing price in 1989, the effective supply of  cotton has increased. The higher cotton price and the rise of  the production costs for textile products have greatly prevented  the textile industry from blinding expanding. However, since  nearly one-third of the capacity in textile industry is idling,  the supply and demand of cotton have become stable. The export  of cotton textiles remains basically stable. Due to the limits  imposed by the international quota, it is difficult to increase  exports in this connection. On the other hand, the domestic  cotton price is relatively higher. The advantage in exporting  cotton and silk products is notably declining, and it is rather  difficult to compete with others on the international market in  this connection.    In recent years, there have been no major breakthroughs in  developing cotton varieties and production technology. The  average per-mu yield of cotton is basically between 50 and 60  kg. If the area planted with cotton in the whole country is  maintained at the present level of about 90 million mu, the  output of cotton will be approximately 4.8 million tons. Thus,  the total supply and demand of cotton are expected to strike a  balance in the country.    Sugar The supply of sugar may fall short of demand  this year. The main reasons are as follows: A gap is formed in  the supply of sugar in the world, and sugar prices skyrocket on  the international market. In recent years, major sugar-producing  countries in the world such as Cuba, Thailand and India reported  reduced sugar production, while sugar consumption is rising. The  amount of sugar to fill this gap is about 2.84 million tons,  causing the sugar price to go up. However the demand of  sugar-consuming countries and districts is growing. In 1993,  Russia was expected to consume 7.5 million tons of sugar, but it  only produced two million tons itself. It needed to import a  large amount of sugar. Under the influence of the supply and  demand of sugar in these countries, tremendous changes have  taken place in the relations between the imports and exports of  sugar in China. China has become a purely sugar-exporting nation  from a purely sugar-importing nation in 1991. According to  customs statistics, a total of 1.06 million tons of sugar were  exported and 250,000 tons of sugar imported between October 1992  and April 1993, leaving a net export of 810,000 tons of sugar,  up 710,000 tons over the same period in the previous year. In  addition, the sugar reserve in stock is dwindling, and the area  planted with sugar-bearing crops is shrinking. The supply of  sugar is expected to be scant in 1994.    The sales of articles of daily use will be basically at the  same level as before. The demand for bicycles, wrist watches,  sewing machines and aluminum wares will be somewhat greater. The  sales of other articles of daily use will be about the same or  slightly weak. However, products of higher grades will be in  great demand. Consumers will prefer products of higher quality,  new designs and better features. Particularly they will prefer  stainless steel cooking utensils and electric appliances. They  will tend to buy more high-quality perfumed soap and cosmetic  manufactured by Sino-foreign joint ventures.    For bicycles, consumers prefer to lighter, smaller, more  convenient ones with variable gear-shifts. The sales of mountain  bicycles will notably increase. There will be an over-supply of  sewing machines on the market, and the inventory would increase.  The sales may somewhat go up slightly when new models appear on  the market. There will be an over-supply of wrist watches, and  the inventory would increase.    The supply and demand of soap, toothpaste, detergent,  aluminum pots, thermos and other articles of daily use will  level off. Due to the increase of varieties and reasonable  prices, utensils made of plastic material will register a steady  growth. There will be little changes in the sales and marketing  of canned goods, after their prices bottom out. The export of  toys will rise, but not much efforts are being made in pushing  domestic sales. There is a large potential to sell toys  domestically. The general trend in the sales of enamelware has  changed. Now, the supply exceeds demand instead of the supply  falling short of demand several years ago. The market demand  will drop, because the enamelware products are gradually being  replaced by their plastic counterparts.    The sales of durable goods with low inventory in cities will  increase such as motorcycles, air conditioners, video tape  recorders, video cameras, computers, high-quality audio  equipment and health care products. The demand of such products  will drop in medium-sized and small cities, but the total demand  of such products in the whole society will grow. The market for  refrigerators will flourish. The prospect in exporting more  electric fans is good, although the domestic demand for such  fans is decreasing. In short, the total demand for electric fans  is rising. The demand for air conditioners and ceiling fans will  increase, while that for table electric fans will level off. The  demand for color television sets will increase slightly. More  color television sets will be sold in medium-sized and small  cities and flourishing rural areas instead of large cities. The  demand for table-model recorders, imported pocket-sized radio  sets and boom boxes with CD players will increase. Stereo  equipment in the 2,500 yuan price range will become popular. In  addition, there will a good market for electric heating shower  equipment, kitchen exhaust fans, microwave ovens, rice cookers,  food processors, electric ovens, air purifiers, heating  equipment for health care and other home appliances.    This forecast is made on the basis of the following reasons:    1. The macro-economy is being developed healthily, and the  supply of commodities is continuously increasing. According to a  preliminary estimate made by a relevant department, the total  value of commodity supply for 1994 will reach 1.655 trillion  yuan, and the supply of commodities will exceed demand by  approximately 55 billion yuan.    2. There will be a steady growth of residents' income. If  factors such as the gradual increase of government employees'  salaries and its influence as well as the price adjustment of  major rural products are taken into consideration, this year's  growth rate of residents' actual incomes is expected to be  higher than that in the last year. The workers' wage is expected  to increase 21.8 percent, slightly higher than the 21.6 percent  in the previous year. The per-capita peasants' net income will  be close to 1,000 yuan with its growth rate exceeding 13 percent  (12.2 percent in the previous year).    3. There will be more investments in capital construction.  The total amount of investment in fixed assets in 1993 is  expected to reach 1.15 trillion yuan, up approximately 46  percent over that in 1992. It is estimated that this figure will  reach 1.3 trillion yuan in 1994, up about 150 billion yuan over  1993.    4. There will a reasonable growth in institutional  purchases. The rate of growth in 1993 is expected to be  approximately 25 percent. The expenditure of social groups for  consumer goods will still go upwards.    5. There will be more currency issued this year as compared  with the last year. The total amount of currency issued in 1993  is expected to be between 29 and 38 percent higher than that in  1992. The amount issued in 1994 will be higher than that in 1993.    6. The sales of some commodities will decline. Due to  considerable fluctuations in the exchange rate, the delay in  re-entering the GATT, the large-scale price increases and the  relatively low interest rate for deposits, some residents rushed  to buy imported or domestically manufactured high-quality home  appliances and jewelry made of gold during the first half of  1993. These purchases, which were ahead of season, will push the  price of such commodities down this year.</p>

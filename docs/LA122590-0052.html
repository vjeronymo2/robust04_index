			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Chrysler Speeds Up Payments: Chrysler Corp. said it had made stock awards and  incentive payments to about 2,000 executives ahead of schedule because of  federal income tax changes that take effect Jan. 1.  </P> <P> The payments were made last week and include one-time stock awards to  executives and incentive payments associated with a $1-billion cost-cutting  program, Chrysler spokesman Steven Harris said. The payments stemmed from a  "bet-your-check" program set up in July, 1989, in which Chrysler executives  could wager up to 10% of their salaries on meeting the cost-cutting goals,  doubling their money if successful. Harris declined to reveal the amount of the  payments.  </P></p>

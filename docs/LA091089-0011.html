			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON AGING: PROGRAMS FOR OLDER JOB-SEEKERS  </P> <P> Many older job-seekers are professionals who face difficulty in their search.  Labor Department data from 1988 show that more than 25% of employed workers  over age 55 hold managerial and professional positions. And nearly one-third of  the 3,600 older job-seekers who called the Job Hotline of the Los Angeles  Council on Careers for Older Americans in 1988 were in managerial or  professional positions. An estimated 600,000 mid-level white-collar positions  were eliminated in the United States by exit incentives between 1980 and 1986,  and an additional 400,000 will be eliminated by 1990.  </P> <P> The older professional job-seeker faces three major barriers. First, few  programs are designed to assist the mature professional, and limited government  funds are designated to help this population re-enter the work force. Business  outplacement programs are generally reserved for high-level executives, not  mid-managers or professionals.  </P> <P> Second, age discrimination can be a greater barrier for the older professional  than for the lower-skilled job-seeker, because employers view older  professionals as more expensive human-resource investments.  </P> <P> Third, many people, including older professionals themselves, believe that  people who have made "career progress," even modestly climbing the corporate  ladder, should be able to handle the job search alone. However, most  professionals need help marketing their skills, developing a network of people  with common interests, and learning the tricks, such as how to summarize 30  years of employment on a one-page resume.  </P> <P> Some nonprofit and for-profit organizations, particularly in larger urban  areas, have begun to recognize this need and develop programs to assist older  professionals. Some are described in responses to the questions that follow.  </P> <P> Question: Six months ago, I took early retirement from my position as vice  president of public relations with a major bank. I am an energetic, 60-year-old  woman who wants to work. I have sent out more than 100 resumes but have  received very few responses -- three interviews and no job offers. What help is  available?  </P> <P> Answer: Eight coordinating councils operate model older-worker programs  throughout the country. Six of these (in Boston; Chicago; Detroit; Lincoln,  Neb.; Los Angeles and New York City) have programs designed specifically for  managers or professionals.  </P> <P> Most of these councils offer intensive three- or four-day job-search seminars  focusing on skills assessment, interview practice, resume development,  networking and generating leads. Several programs offer extensive follow-up  activities, including staff contacts with program participants each week.  Placement results have been exceptional: Project ABLE of Detroit reports a 75%  placement rate and Boston ABLE a 60% placement rate.  </P> <P> According to Denise Jessup of the Los Angeles Council on Careers for Older  Americans, "Older professionals have special needs in the job search. These  programs have been designed with the recognition that older job-seekers face a  great deal of rejection. Feeling positive about your skills and what you can  offer an employer is the first step toward capturing a new job." Write the Los  Angeles Council on Careers for Older Americans, 5225 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 204,  Los Angeles 90036, for information about the nearest coordinating council.  </P> <P> Other nonprofit organizations also attempt to meet the needs of older  professionals. Nationwide, there are 16 independent Forty Plus organizations.  These groups have a self-help focus; their main function is to help members  help themselves get jobs. There is usually no paid staff; volunteer work is  required of members, who generally pay an initial membership and monthly fee.  Telephones, desks, word processors, support groups, job-search seminars, want  ads and other publications are available. To locate the Forty Plus nearest you,  look in your local phone book or call the Los Angeles chapter at (213)  388-2301.  </P></p>

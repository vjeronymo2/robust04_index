			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in  Russian at 1118 GMT on 17 June broadcasts a report from  Krasnoyarsk where Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Shakhray  is leading a special commission at work there today. He  assessed the situation regarding the delivery of cargo to the  Russian far north as an "emergency."    He says that the Russian Government will do everything  possible to ensure that fuel and food are delivered in full to  the northerners, though there will be difficulties with  technical cargo and building materials, most of which have not  yet been delivered to the river and sea ports.    The Yenisey River Shipping Line manager has said that only a  third of its 2,200 vessels are ready for the navigation season  since customers have failed to pay for the 1993 delivery season  and conclude new agreements for this season. This has resulted  in many of the staff being sent off on enforced holidays. Some  have started resigning.    It was pointed out at a meeting between the government  commission and heads of administration of the northern regions  of Krasnoyarsk Kray and the Taymir and Evenkiy autonomous  districts that money had been allocated from the federal budget,  but only for the delivery of goods.    Shakhray told ITAR-TASS on the issue of northerners leaving  the north that a total flight of people from there should be  prevented. Northerners should be given assistance in relocation.  He hopes that they will be relocated to eastern regions of  Russia where the climate is similar to that of the northern  regions and where the jobs' issue is not so difficult.    Shakhray stresses that the Russian north and polar regions  are very important to the country's economy and they have a  future. People should work on a shift basis and not live there  permanently.    The deputy prime minister also points out at a final news  conference that "in spite of all the economic difficulties, we  will continue to allocate money for the needs of the indigenous  peoples of the north. These people have nowhere to go and they  must have a humane standard of living."</p>

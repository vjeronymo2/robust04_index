In fact, the administration that will take control of  Panama's destiny will have to face the crucial dilemma of  efficiently consolidating the canal management transition  process. The new government will also have to dodge neoliberal  impositions that could undermine the gradual integration process  of the canal infrastructures, which will revert to the national  economy.    The new government will face a new plan regarding relations  with the United States, which will be driven by the imminent  withdrawal of military troops and the progressive  nationalization of the canal. This situation is being  conditioned by cuts in the defense budget with the end of the  Cold War. The issue of national security is not a priority for  the region yet simply because the international financial system  replaced the confrontation of ideologies.    As the United States readjusts its economy to consolidate  the  360 million people market that NAFTA, an agreement also signed  by Mexico and Canada, will create, its regional priorities deal  with the eradication of drug trafficking, as the new Southern  Command chief proposed, and trade deregulation, as international  financial institutions are promoting.    Under the circumstances, it is necessary to redefine  bilateral relations not only politically and economically, but  also jurisdictionally to ensure a trouble-free transition of the  canal administration; that is, a transition that will not be at  the mercy of the country's political stability. This is why the  new government will have the prerequisite of restoring the part  of the Panamanian state's self-determination that the 20  December 1989 invasion removed.    On those grounds, leaders will have to apply daring  solutions  to the problems that bilateral diplomatic relations have  exacerbated over the last few years, namely the post-invasion  upheaval, collective mechanisms against drug trafficking, and  the transition of the canal administration.    In the regional arena, leaders must use dynamic solutions to  reinforce the nation's presence in organizations of political  consensus like the Rio Group. Leaders will even be compelled to  improve hemispheric relations, which visibly deteriorated after  the invasion because of the regime of rigid bilateral foreign  policies.    At the multilateral level, the new government will have to  determine its position on GATT, not just because of the timid  interest the current administration has showed, but also because  of its inability to reconcile the interests of the economic  sectors, which favor trade deregulation, and the industrial  sectors that remain skeptical because of the uncertainty that  joining this organization will generate. Given such a big  challenge, there is a need for a government with leadership and  the ability to establish consensus at the lowest social cost  possible; a consensus that will explain in equitable and  balanced terms the competitive advantages the country will have  upon joining the integrationist movement.    The approval of the Sea Convention Law [Convencion sobre  Derecho del Mar], which was postponed for the last few years, is  another pivotal issue in foreign policies because Panama holds  first place in world merchant marine tonnage and is on the  threshold of managing an interoceanic canal with the potential  to tap maritime resources.    Integrationist initiatives are usually the result of a  historic process of accumulation by which states modernize their  production processes by systematically embarking in  international trade to seek competitive advantages to ensure  strengthening their economies. These assumptions in Panama have  yet to materialize. That is why it is necessary to consolidate  the national economy, to bring it closer to the countries with  negotiating capabilities in the integration dynamics.    This is why we cannot conceive of separating political  integration from economic factors, nor can it (Central American  integration) be the result of rhetorical pronouncements that do  not come from objective analyses of the country's political and  socioeconomic realities. Therefore, by being aware of the  country's potentials and needs, the new government will have to  adopt measures aimed at increasing plans for regional  participation.    With this in mind, it will have to establish a series of  foreign policy priorities by modernizing the political  mechanisms of negotiation at the foreign ministry. Given the  challenges inherent to the canal administration, this  modernization necessarily means optimizing foreign services as  the key instruments to incorporating Panama into the Latin  American integration process.</p>

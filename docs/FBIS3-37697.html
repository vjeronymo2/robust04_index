The FRG, for example, was traditionally the Soviet  Union's largest Western trading partner, but in 1989 trade with  the Soviet Union accounted for only 1.5 percent of total West  German foreign trade, that is, less than trade with Denmark.  The Soviet model of the past was autarky motivated by military  considerations, and that was the case even at a time when war  between the two nuclear alliances was impossible and it was  clear that the future belonged to whoever led in the civilian  technology field.    Now that the Cold War is over, we have a chance to achieve  lasting peace. In Western Europe, economic integration has led  to stability and enduring peace. Economic cooperation and the  growth in prosperity resulting from it are significant elements  in a new security structure for all of Europe. We want to  achieve a state of affairs in which security is primarily  guaranteed by extensive ties, cooperation, and trust, not by  military capability.    Open markets promote an international climate of confidence  and fair dealings with each other. They encourage the exchange  of ideas and bring peoples close to one another. Free trade  relations promote peace.    What now has to be produced is a "Strategy for Partnership"  for the democratic states of the East and West. The basic idea  underlying such a strategy is that in a rapidly changing  international environment, mutual interests have to be taken  into account and that there should be a long-term strategic  vision rather than short-term responses to individual events.  One of the most important elements of such a strategy would  undoubtedly be support for the reforms in Russia and the Eastern  European states.    A democratic, stable, economically healthy, open, and  predictable Russia accords with the interests of the entire  world. It must be clear to everyone that the world does not  need a weak, strife-torn Russia, but needs a Russia that is a  strong partner, one that will make an indispensable contribution  to the creation of global peace structures and will assume a  lasting place in the family of free, law-governed, and  democratic states. That is the most effective way of putting a  stop to aggressive nationalism.    Everything possible must be done to give Russia and the  reform states of Eastern Europe access to world markets.  However, this is only possible to the extent that conditions  for free enterprise are created in Russia. The decades of  squandering Russia's natural wealth by providing artificially  cheap energy at the expense of the population is an example of  how violations of free market laws harm the people. Thus,  market-oriented reform in Russia is not only a condition for  full participation in the global marketplace, but also a  condition for the economically sensible and thrifty use of  Russia's own domestic strengths. That in turn is a condition  for Russia's economic success. Russia will only become  democratically stable if it is economically successful, and it  can only become a lasting partner for stability in Europe and  the rest of the world if it is democratically stable.    Russia has had a democratic constitution since 12 December  1993. The Russian parliament enjoys democratic legitimacy.  Thus, Russia has moved much closer to membership of the  European Council. At the same time, the foundations of the  framework for a law-governed state, which is necessary for the  functioning of social market economy, have been created. The  free market economy needs an active start that can protect its  function with regard to competition and laws. A law-governed  state and certainty about legal conditions is a basic condition  for political and economic freedom.    After World War II, West Germany had an opportunity to  rebuild the country, which had been ruined, with a social market  economy. A social market economy means combining the freedom of  the market with the dictates of social justice. At first, West  Germany also experienced a wave of inflation and unemployment  while the war economy, with its excessive emphasis on armaments  and heavy industry, was converted to meet the demands of the  population of a country living in peace. Once this conversion  crisis had been overcome, however, the social market economy  came to mean increasing prosperity for all.    The situation in Russia today is in some respects different  from that in West Germany 45 years ago. However, the mechanisms  of free market development, which were effective then, are no  less effective today. Whoever disregards them pays the price in  the form of stagnation and decline.    Russia possesses immeasurable reserves of mineral resources.  However, its greatest wealth lies in its inhabitants, in their  professional qualifications, their spiritual strength, and  tenacity. Russia possesses first-rate educational reserves. In  the research and development field, there are many technologies  in which it is a world leader. This valuable potential must be  retained and developed.    The transition from centralized command and administrative  structures as well as state monopolies to a decentralized free  market economy based on competition is a unique historical  process for which there are no models. The right course will be  a tightrope walk between extremes. A shock without therapy is  no less dangerous than a therapy that only tries to treat  symptoms without addressing the roots of the illness. A  difficult political balance between the exigency of effecting a  transition and the vital necessity of maintaining social  stability will continually have to be struck. Adjustments will  be inevitable. There is no ideal way leading to the future.  However, there is even less of a way back.    Without the reformist beginnings of the past few years, the  current situation in Russia would be all the more difficult. The  latest economic data provide grounds for hope: Russia's  position in foreign trade is beginning to improve, the  privatization program is making impressive progress, production  is gradually responding to signals from consumers. Russia is  demonstrating that it possesses the capacity for self-renewal, a  capacity that has enabled Russia to survive times of crisis so  often in its history.    Russia cannot simply copy Western models and theories.  Russia will modernize, but it will not give up its deep-rooted  culture and wealth of tradition. In the same way as the  requirements in Russia are unique, reform processes must also  take account of the elements unique to Russia's situation. The  free market economy in Germany is, for example, different from  that Japan, although the fundamental principles are the same.    With active German support, Russia has made considerable  progress on the way to global economic partnership: It is an  equal member in international financial institutions and a  partner in dialogue with the G-7. Germany will promote the  development of this dialogue. Germany supports Russia in  developing closer ties with the OECD. The Coordinating Committee  for Multilateral Export Controls will be disbanded. Instead,  Russia will become an equal partner in a new forum that is to  collect comprehensive information on exports of military  technology worldwide. Extensive progress has been made in  negotiations between the EU and Russia on comprehensive  agreement on cooperation and partnership. So far, Germany has  provided Russia with assistance totaling almost 90 billion  German marks. It thus accounts for over 50 percent of worldwide  support for Russia's reforms. This unequivocally reflects  Germany's firm commitment to engage in partnership with a  democratic Russia.    The unilateral transfer of assistance is not, however, a  permanent state of affairs. It can only assist the growth of  solid, mutually advantageous trade relations, but cannot be a  substitute for Russian efforts to achieve a transformation.  Until now, Russia has primarily exported raw materials. It  must now enter world markets with technologically advanced  products. That assumes that military production will undergo  conversion with the aim of boosting civilian prosperity.    In the future, Russia's greatness will not be measured in  terms of the number of soldiers or weapons it has, or the size  of its territory. Russia's global role will become all the more  important if it succeeds in developing a future-oriented,  democratic model of society, bolstering CSCE principles,  contributing to an increase in prosperity -- in Russia and  worldwide -- and participating constructively in mankind's great  future tasks. Not military capacity for destruction, but  economic and technical capacity, and positive development will  determine states' status and influence. Russian intellectual and  cultural life must once again assume its appropriate place in  cultural dialogue.    Change begins in the mind. If one analyzes the economic  successes of the countries of Southeast Asia, one notes that a  large number of highly gifted students studied abroad for a time  and brought back new ideas and impulses. The same path is also  open to the former communist reformist states. For almost three  generations, there were virtually insurmountable barriers  between the intellectual life of Russia and that of the rest of  the world. Now, there has to be a lot of catching up in this  respect. Exchanges for students and academic staff must be  expanded. That is the only way in which understanding between  peoples can grow and knowledge and experience can be used for  the good of all transcending all borders.    It is also important that Russians themselves see the  results  of cooperation with other countries with their own eyes. With  that in mind, models for this kind of cooperation must be  created in the individual regions of Russia. The Murmansk  region, which one of the authors of this article represents in  the Russian Parliament as a democratically elected deputy, can  serve as an example in this respect. This Russian region, which  was previously hermetically sealed off, is now being extensively  opened up for direct contacts and cooperation with neighboring  states and other countries. To provide active support for this  process by promoting specific economic and investment projects  means demonstrating that our partnership is reality.    After World War II, Germany achieved a peaceful  reconciliation with its neighbors by way of democracy and the  free market economy. This not only facilitated the unification  of Germany, but also opened up opportunities for the economic  and cultural blossoming of the whole country. Today, Russia has  the same opportunities. The transition is difficult and will  require time. The Russians themselves know that best of all.  However, through that transition, Russia can finally develop  its potential and find its role in the international community.</p>

			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: PADRES SIGN CLEMENTS TO ONE-YEAR DEAL  </P> <P> Padre reliever Pat Clements signed a one-year, $245,000 contract Tuesday,  becoming the only eligible Padre player to forego arbitration.  </P> <P> Catcher Benito Santiago, third baseman Mike Pagliarulo, and pitchers Calvin  Schiraldi and Mark Grant all exercised their rights to file for arbitration.  </P> <P> Jack McKeon, Padre manager-vice president/baseball operations, said that he is  hopeful of reaching agreement with each of the four players. The two sides will  exchange salary figures Friday, and if the Padres are unable to reach agreement  with any of the four players, arbitration hearings will be scheduled Feb.  1-Feb. 15.  </P> <P> Clements, who earned $205,000 last season, is expected to compete with Dan  Murphy, Eric Nolte and Rafael Valdez for the final spot in the bullpen.  </P> <P> "His status might depend on whether we want one left-hander or two left-handers  in the pen," McKeon said. "Really, he's in the same role as last year, just  vying for a position."  </P> <P> Clements, who was 4-1 with a 3.92 ERA last season, said: "I've always been a  middle man, and I really don't see my role changing. I just want to be a part  of this team, because I think we're going to be as good as anybody in the  league." BOB NIGHTENGALE  </P></p>

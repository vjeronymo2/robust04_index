			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Maurice Lubatti] </F>   [Text] Geneva, April 5 (AFP) -- Apparent swings in policy  regarding the enclave of Gorazde and the non-Serb population in  the Banja Luka region suggest there could be a crisis of  authority among the separatist Bosnian Serbs, diplomats at the  Conference on Yugoslavia said here Tuesday.    "Just when there appeared to be a process of normalisation  under way, with some spirit of reconciliation among the Bosnian  Serb authorities, everything has been thrown into question with  this upsurge in tension," a negotiator here said on condition of  anonymity.    A week-long Serb onslaught on the eastern Bosnian enclave of  Gorazde, and a last-minute reversal on the proposed evacuation  of several thousand non-Serbs from the northern town of Prijedor  following a massacre last week, have thrown the spotlight onto  possible divergences among the Serb leadership.    Differences have long been known to exist between separatist  hardliners, mainly in the army and in the Serbs' Banja Luka  stronghold, and supporters of Radovan Karadzic, leader of the  self-proclaimed Serb Republic based at Pale, just outside  Sarajevo.    These differences are seen as the most likely cause of the  latest developments, the most astonishing of which was  Karadzic's volte- face over the evacuation of up to 6,000  Moslems and Croats from Prijedor, scheduled to take place on  Tuesday.    On Sunday Karadzic gave written orders authorising UN and  Red  Cross officials to proceed with the evacuation, demanded by the  non-Serb population of the region which had been terrorised by  Serb militants.    Then on Monday he vetoed the agreed figure of 6,000, saying  that such a large-scale evacuation was unncessary since, he  said, measures had been taken to protect civilians in Prijedor.  The operation was postponed as a result of the reversal.    The fighting in the Gorazde region comes after a ceasefire  was agreed between Bosnians and Serbs in Sarajevo.    Rivalry between Serb civilian and military authorities is  also seen as the likely explanation for such incidents as the  theft of parcels at Banja Luka, or the confiscation of food  supplies destined for the northern enclave of Maglaj.    The commander of Bosnian Serb forces, General Ratko Mladic,  seen as the most militant of hardliners, currently spends the  bulk of his time in the Banja Luka sector rather than at Pale,  diplomats noted.    Unconfirmed reports here indicate that Mladic has fallen out  with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Karadzic's sponsor in  the Bosnian conflict.    European Union negotiator Lord Owen said last week that at  his last meeting with Milosevic he had found the Serbian leader  more amenable to a negotiated settlement to the conflict.  Serbia has been severely hit by economic sanctions imposed on  Belgrade in May 1992.</p>

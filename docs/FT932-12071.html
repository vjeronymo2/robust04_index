			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Milosevic turns on Bosnia allies WESTERN diplomats this week had the unusual task of interpreting what appeared to be the first public dispute between President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and Serb leaders in Bosnia. In a letter on Monday to the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament, Mr Milosevic criticised their refusal to endorse the Vance-Owen peace plan. He accused the Bosnian Serb leadership of making 10m citizens of Serbia and Montenegro bear the burden of tighter United Nations sanctions. The Bosnian Serbs had rejected the plan because it left Serbs in Bosnia surrounded by the enemy. 'Milosevic's letter was part of a political move to get a signature on the agreement,' says a western diplomat, who believes that the Serbian president is prepared to turn on his allies to win the favour of the international community. Mr Milosevic's conversion may have stemmed in part from the fact that Russian voters endorsed President Yeltsin's policies in a referendum on Sunday. The outcome of the vote was a shock to Serbian leaders, who had assumed that Mr Yeltsin would be defeated and that a more supportive government would come to power in Moscow. Mr Milosevic in the past has excelled at changing positions to suit the crisis of the moment. In January 1992, he suddenly became a man of peace after six months of war and destruction in Croatia. He engineered the ousting of Serb leaders from the rebel state of Krajina, in Croatia, who opposed the plan drawn up by Mr Cyrus Vance, the international mediator. He also played a conciliating role in Geneva at the beginning of this year when he twisted the arm of Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, to make him endorse the constitutional principles section of the Vance-Owen peace plan. Part of his tactics in the past included a vicious smear campaign against the Krajina Serb leadership in the Serbian media. Such a campaign has so far not materialised against Bosnian Serb leaders, but this week state-run Television Serbia, which has spewed out anti-western propaganda for months, toned down its coverage and came out in support of the Vance-Owen plan. It even cast Lord Owen, previously vilified for saying that it might be necessary to bomb Serb targets in Bosnia, in a favourable light and presented him as fighting to defend Serbian interests. In the first sign that Bosnian Serb deputies were ready to heed the most powerful man in Serbia, yesterday their self-styled assembly agreed to meet on May 5 to reconsider the Vance-Owen maps which would split Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous regions divided on ethnic lines. Diplomats believe the Serbian president will also succeed in persuading Mr Karadzic to approve the Vance-Owen maps. But the question remains whether any Serbian leader is prepared to implement the plan. The proposal calls for Serb forces to give up between one third and one-half of the territory they have conquered over the past year. 'If Serbia and Montenegro want to re-enter the family of nations, the signatures must be followed up by implementation of the plan,' said the diplomat. 'Bosnian Serb forces must be ready to stop the violence. They are not responsible for all the killing, but they have the preponderance of force,' he added. But despite his readiness to exert pressure on Bosnian Serb leaders, Mr Milosevic has so far not indicated that he is prepared to follow up on the peace plan.</p>

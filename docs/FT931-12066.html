			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading A MODERATE day's trading in the derivatives market was dominated by the closing of the trading account in the underlying equity markets and mounting concern over possible imminent rights issues, writes Christopher Price. In futures, the March FT-SE contract opened positively at 2,833, helped by good overnight industrial news. It reached its high-point of 2,838 around 10am. However, with growing concerns over the number of companies said to be considering a rights issue, and traders anxious not to be long ahead of the new account on Monday, March drifted. It hit its low of 2,812 at around 1pm when it also dipped below fair value. Then strong US durable goods figures prompted a rally and March closed at 2,822, a fall of 14 on the previous session, and around 10 points ahead of its fair value level of around 7. In traded options, 29,662 contracts were traded, with the FT-SE 100 making up 4,796 and the Euro-FTSE 4,292. BAe was the top stock option at 1,864.</p>

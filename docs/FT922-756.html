			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (32): Why the wheat traders are agog - Life in a sleepy market town THE WHOLESALE market in Sohna, a small town in the Gurgaon district of Haryana, lies dormant for most of the year. But for two months in the autumn when the kharif (summer) crop comes to the market and in May and June when the rabi (winter) crop is sold, the ramshackle marketplace hums with activity. This year, the market's artis (middle-men) are agog at the change in its sales pattern. In previous years, whenever wheat was brought to the market, all but the superior 'desi' varieties were automatically bought by the Food Corporation of India, the government's procurement agency. In May, when tractors were busy bringing in trolley-loads of ordinary wheat which the corporation would normally have bought for official stocks, its small office in the market was deserted. 'They (the officials) have little to do. They know they cannot compete with the traders this year,' said an arti. The sale of wheat is a complex business, and it takes the whole day to sell a trolley-load. As the wheat cascades down to the cemented floor, once the sides of the trolley are opened, the arti's employees start to get busy. Women with cane strainers sift the grain carefully to separate it from the chaff. It is an elaborate exercise that is done manually by throwing the wheat into the air on tray-like sifters, so that the grain separates from the chaff and dirt. Gradually, a big pile of the cleansed wheat builds up with the small mound of chaff besides it. This operation takes three or four hours. Then, a small group of traders begins to wander from one arti's stall to another, carefully studying the quality of the grain by sniffing it, pouring fistfulls from one hand to another and even tasting it. 'They see whether the grain is broken or diseased. Only the full grain heaps fetch the highest price,' explains the arti. Then they start bidding and, in an kind of impromptu auction that follows, the price slowly rises while its farmer-owner stands by anxiously. In previous years, Dharampal, a farmer who owns seven acres in the village of Indri, sold his grain to the official agencies at the minimum support price. 'Some farmers grow desi wheat and the traders came only for this superior quality. This year, they are buying everything,' he says. The bids started at well above the support price at Rs330 a quintal and in a matter of minutes had reached Rs380. 'This is best price I have ever got,' says Dharampal, beaming with satisfaction. He is happy to have brought his wheat to the market rather than wait for it to rise. 'Many farmers are holding on to their wheat. I have to sell now because I must repay my debts,' says Dharampal. The richer farmers, he says, can afford to wait for the price to rise in two or three months, but he had to sell as soon as his wheat was harvested. The wheat crop in Sohna has been a good one, says Dharampal. The winter rain, unlike the monsoon, did not play truant and, besides, he has a working tube-well to provide water. He uses urea as a fertiliser in small quantities since it is expensive (he does not know why fertiliser prices have gone up, although he is aware of the 'subsidy' on it). But he sees no reason for shortages because, he says, the harvest has been as good as in the past two years. Dharampal does not know why he is getting such a good price for his wheat. He speaks of 'God's grace' and looks to the heavens in gratitude. He is not aware of any ganging up by the farmers and traders, though he has heard of Mahendra Singh Tikait, the militant farmers' leader in Uttar Pradesh, who is fighting for a better deal for his community. Militancy has not reached sleepy Sohna. The arti is also puzzled at the change this year as, he says, the traders used to buy only the desi variety or damaged grain that the official agencies would not touch. 'The farmers have got a good price this year. The government is now picking up diseased wheat only. and not too much of that.'</p>

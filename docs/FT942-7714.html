			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Change of control at Celtic Gold Shares in Celtic Gold have been suspended at the company's request on news that Claddagh Gold, its main shareholder, intends to sell its 54 per cent stake to English Trust. At the same time Celtic, the mineral and exploration company, announced a rise in 1993 pre-tax losses from IPounds 160,321 to IPounds 302,002 (Pounds 298,980), after exceptional charges of IPounds 266,493 (IPounds 129,953) relating mainly to gold exploration properties written off. Mr Herb Stanley, executive chairman, said English Trust, an investment management and corporate finance group, had indicated that it planned board changes once the sale was completed. In addition, English Trust would arrange a share placing in Celtic to raise IPounds 520,000 at 17p per share on a 1-for-6 basis. The company planned to dispose of Clare Calcite, its wholly owned subsidiary, and also contemplated entering into talks for the acquisition of a substantial financial services company.</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / EU urged to focus on making industry more competitive Competitiveness should be at the top of the European Union's political agenda, leading European industrialists urged yesterday. The European Round Table, which groups 40 top industrialists, called for the creation of a US-style Competitiveness Council. The group was joined by Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, when it launched its report. It calls for a European Charter for Industry to serve as a counterweight to pan-European social policy. The move comes a week before the Brussels summit of EU heads of government, which will focus on a white paper on competitiveness, growth and unemployment finalised by Mr Delors. The industrialists' blueprint puts more emphasis on deregulation and cutting costs to industry from legislation and bureaucracy than recent drafts of the Commission white paper. But both urge big increases in investment, particularly in infrastructure and information networks, cutting employment costs and improving training. The report endorses Mr Delors' call for more co-operation within industry on research and development. Mr Floris Maljers, chairman of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group and head of the working group that produced the report, said the Competitiveness Council should have a mandate to report regularly to the EU on industrial issues. He said non-wage costs, such as employers' social security contributions, amounted to 44 per cent of total employment costs in Europe, against 28 per cent in the US and 24 per cent in Japan. 'Work is there, but not at these prices,' the report says. 'In effect, Europe has imposed a tax on jobs. It is time to find a better system.' The report adds that higher productivity will have to precede higher wages. Mr Maljers warned against the environment and energy taxes being considered in the Commission white paper. 'Some of these costs will have to go from production to consumption,' he argued. Mr Maljers said the proposed council and the Charter for Industry had two main aims: to record industry's views on the conditions for restoring competitiveness; and to look over EU and national legislation in the light of the need for competition. The council would have a small, highly qualified membership made up of industry, government and scientists. The action plan's suggestion that Ecu200bn (Pounds 152.40bn) a year of additional investment, worth 4 per cent of European output, is needed to obtain the 3.5 per cent growth needed to relieve unemployment, is close to Mr Delors' estimates.</p>

			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE VILLAGERS TO LEAD BON DANCING WORKSHOPS  </P> <P> Six dancers from the central Japanese village of Gujo Hachiman are in Los  Angeles to lead a series of Bon dancing workshops in preparation for  September's Los Angeles Festival.  </P> <P> The dancers will teach their street "Gujo Odori" dance to members of local  dance guilds in preparation for a large performance of street dancing that  organizers hope will feature hundreds of Los Angeles dancers and participants  in addition to about 50 dancers from Gujo Hachiman. The large-scale event is  planned for the Santa Monica Pier on Sept. 15 or 16.  </P> <P> "The dancing is very easy to do; this is real simple stuff," said L.A. Festival  spokeswoman Lauren Deutsch. "There should be tons of people participating. . .  . I don't know what the capacity of the venue is -- maybe a thousand, maybe two  thousand. But with Bon dancing, the more the merrier."  </P> <P> Deutsch noted that Gujo Hachiman is known for its all-night Bon dancing, which  is held every summer, and that more than 10,000 people participate each year.  </P> <P> The Gujo Odori is one of Japan's three major folk dance styles, and festival  officials cited two local Japanese legends that explain its origin. According  to one legend, the dance was started by a feudal lord in about 1624 to  encourage communication between farmers, townspeople and warriors of Gujo  Hachiman. The other legend says that another feudal lord started the dance  around 1758 and that it has been practiced each summer since then.  </P> <P> All dance workshops are free and open to the public. They are scheduled as  follows:  </P> <P> Today: L.A. High School for the Performing Arts, Cal State Los Angeles, P.E.

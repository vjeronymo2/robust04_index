			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Fewer on state training projects THE NUMBER of people on government training and employment programmes has fallen 12.3 per cent since the spring of last year, refuting the widely-held view that the unemployment figures are being substantially depressed by such schemes. The figure comes from the Department of Employment's Labour Force Survey, which was yesterday published on a quarterly basis for the first time, instead of annually. The main reason for fall in the number of people on government schemes is demographic - with fewer young people in the population going on to Youth Training, the scheme for 16-18 year olds. The government will take some cheer from the figure showing that 3m people were receiving job-related training in spring this year, a rise of 66 per cent compared with spring 1984 and a fall of only 100,000 or 4 per cent compared with spring last year.</p>

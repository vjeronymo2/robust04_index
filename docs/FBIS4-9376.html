			<p>CSO     [Editorial Report] After several weeks, the issue of who  will fill the vacant parliamentary seat of The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) in Kisela Voda district south of  Skopje has been resolved, according to the 5 April issue of the  Skopje daily NOVA MAKEDONIJA. Zore Temelkovski, the candidate of  three of the four parties in the governing coalition--the Social  Democratic Alliance of Macedonia (SDSM), the Liberal Party (LP),  and the Socialist Party (SP) -- won 2,431 votes in the 3 April  runoff election. The other two candidates were Zoran Sindiliev  of the Democratic Party (DP), who received 1,641 votes, and  Branislav Sinadinovski of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary  Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity  (VMRO-DPMNE), who received 1,467 votes. Turnout for the election  was light: Of 13,172 registered voters, only 5,822 (44.2  percent) cast ballots. According to NOVA MAKEDONIJA, both the DP  and the VMRO-DPMNE have charged that the election was unfair,  citing among other irregularities a "sudden change" in electoral  boundaries. The number of registered voters in the district was  said to have changed from 13,035 in the first round to 13,172 in  the runoff.    After a campaign punctuated with "desecrations" of party  posters and fist-fights among the youthful fans of the rival  parties (NOVA MAKEDONIJA, 16 March) the first round was held on  20 March. NOVA MAKEDONIJA of 22 March reported that the winner  was Temelkovski, with 1,802 votes (about 30 percent). The  runner-up, Sindiliev, received 1,473 (about 25 percent), and the  third-place candidate, Sinadinovski, garnered 1,154 (about 19  percent). Another 20 percent was split among eight candidates,  with the nationalistic parties winning 483 votes.    According to the same NOVA MAKEDONIJA report, the DP and the  VMRO-DPMNE charged that the election results were unfair because  people had been allowed to vote without showing their personal  identification papers as the election law stipulated. Although  the Supreme Court rejected their appeals, the electoral  commission decided that voters would be obliged to produce their  identity cards in the second round of voting on 3 April (VECER  31 March).    The governing coalition's victory brings its total seats in  the 120-member parliament to 74, including those held by the  Party for Democratic Prosperity (PDP), an ethnic Albanian party.  The distribution of seats is as follows:    VMRO-DPMNE -- 32,    VMRO-Democratic Party -- 1,    SDSM -- 28,    SDSM-LP-SP -- 1,    PDP -- 22,    PDP-People's Democratic Party -- 1,    LP -- 18,    LP-SP -- 1,    SP -- 4,    Party of Yugoslavs -- 2,    Party for the Full Emancipation of Romanies -- 1,    DP -- 4.    There are five independents. The foregoing numbers are drawn  from a NOVA MAKEDONIJA series on political parties published  between 22 January and 8 February, as well as press articles  from 1993 and earlier.    According to the FYROM Constitution, the quorum for Assembly  proceedings is a majority of the total membership (61);  decisions are made by a simple majority of those present, which  must, however, amount to at least one-third of the total  membership (40); certain laws, such as those involving changes  to the country's borders, declaring war, and amending the  Constitution, require a two-thirds majority (80).</p>

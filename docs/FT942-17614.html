			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Money out of chatterboxes: Phone companies need Britons to speak more to each other at home 'The problem with television is that people must sit and keep their eyes glued on a screen; the average American family hasn't time for it.' So said the New York Times in 1939; the rest is history. In the case of telephones, however, ingrained habits and perceptions about the cost of calls have proved remarkably enduring in the UK and much of Europe. The typical home telephone in the UK is used for less than four minutes a day, according to figures released by British Telecommunications this week. In Agatha Christie's detective novels, set in inter-war England, the phone was in the hallway, used for the imparting of brief, telegram-length messages. Sixty years later there are far more phones, but for most people they serve the same function. There is a marked sexual bias to domestic calling patterns: men make twice times as many work-related calls as women. But women make twice as many calls to relatives and run up larger phone bills - except among the under-24s, where BT's figures show that it is men who spend most on social calls. The statistics suggest that increasing the usage of the telephone line should be the overriding goal for telecoms companies, and a far higher priority than seeking to outwit each other in battles with regulatory authorities over pricing and competition issues. The modest use of home telephones affects not just the profits of telecommunications companies. It also has a vital bearing on the prospects for the much-touted 'information superhighways', intended to provide a plethora of new telecoms services in the home. If the British home phone were engaged for 14 minutes a day instead of four, BT could spend Pounds 1bn a year on building a UK-wide fibre-optic superhighway, lose a quarter of its domestic customers to Mercury and the fledgling cable companies offering telecoms services, and still turn in larger profits than today. Such thinking explains why BT's forthcoming advertising campaign, to be launched next month, will focus on two messages: the real cost of a phone call, and how it can improve the quality of life. It may also explain why Mr Stafford Taylor, BT's new head of personal communications, says BT's mission is to get friends and relations to speak to each other - a far cry from the old days, when BT was a nationalised utility, and it took weeks even to get a phone connected. Comparisons between the UK and the US illustrate the scope for growth. In the US, the typical home phone is used for 18 minutes a day. Americans spend twice as long on the line to relatives than the British and more than four times as long chatting to friends. But the sharpest contrast is in 'telebuying': American households spend an average of six minutes a week purchasing goods and services via the telephone, compared with half a minute in Britain. Culture, geography, even variations in climate partly explain such international differences. Americans live further apart than Europeans; their service industries are more geared to the phone. Within Europe, the Scandinavians and Italians spend far longer on the line than the British, according to BT - possibly because colder weather keeps the Danes and Finns indoors, while Italian families are more communicative than their English counterparts. Nonetheless, marketing and perceptions of price also account for British reticence on the phone. The price of calls has fallen by about 40 per cent in the UK in the last decade, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development studies show that the price of residential calls is similar in the US and the UK. Yet British perceptions have not changed: the typical caller overestimates by three times the cost of making a call. The same disparity applies to mobile phones. A study* by the Manchester School of Management, based on a survey of 500 university employees, reveals gross overestimates of the price of mobile services. Ironically, the prices volunteered by the respondents as 'reasonable' were almost identical to today's actual prices. The average price volunteered for a mobile handset was Pounds 190; Pounds 77 was considered reasonable, which is about the going rate for a bottom-of-the-range model. On average, respondents thought that peak-rate calls cost 57p a minute and off-peak calls 35p; they considered 24p and 14p, respectively, to be reasonable - within a few pence of what Vodafone and Cellnet, the two largest operators, charge. Unsurprisingly, only 5 per cent of those surveyed had a mobile phone or pager. There was also little enthusiasm for the concept of constant contactability - 71 per cent said they did not want to be available by phone at all hours of the day. But barely one in eight said they would 'never' want to make or receive calls when out and about, and only 18 per cent thought that society was a better place before the arrival of mobile phones. It is fair bet that if the price was low enough, and known to be so, almost everyone would buy a mobile phone. More effective marketing would seem a prime requirement for tapping that latent demand. US telecoms giant AT&amp;T spends about 10 times as much as BT on advertising as a proportion of revenues. BT's figures might lead it to use advertising to persuade men to make more social calls and women to work more from home. But if the US is any guide, phone companies and consumers alike would gain most from a fierce, well-publicised price war. Consumers would have the actual cost of calls drummed into them; line usage would rise; phone company profits might be boosted - in the cause of getting people to talk to each other. *Manchester School of Management, PO Box 88, M60 1QD.

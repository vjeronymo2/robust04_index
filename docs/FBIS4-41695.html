			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia and the CSCE are applying similar efforts to  settle the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Russian presidential  representative Vladimir Kazimirov stated at a news conference in  Yerevan Monday. At the same time, the Russian peace settlement  plan envisioned more guarantees ensuring the mechanism for  cease-fire than the one proposed by the CSCE, he said.    Kazimiriov dismissed speculation that the CSCE and Russia  had  differences over the settlement issue. Russia should coordinate  its efforts with the CSCE, he said. Work is going on to convert  the Russian plan into a true agreement, a legal document which  could be signed at a top level, rather than a schedule of  immediate measures, he said.    Kazimirov said the main priority of the Russian plan was to  develop a mechanism to establish a cease-fire, which is  essential for moving towards a Nagorno-Karabakh peace settlement.    Kazimirov also met Armenian President Levon Ter- Petrosian.  He told Interfax after the meeting that he was satisfied with  its results. "Much has been clarified," he said.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Rises for directors average 5% this year COMPANY DIRECTORS' pay rises have averaged 5 per cent in the past 12 months and are expected to slow to an average of 4 per cent in the coming year, a survey by Reward Group and the Institute of Directors says. The survey is believed to be the largest to date covering directors' pay. It is published in the wake of the government's appeal to senior executives to award themselves low pay rises and its announcement that public-sector workers face a pay ceiling of 1.5 per cent. It shows that 16 per cent of directors expect no increase. Mr Blenyth Jenkins, IoD corporate affairs director, said: 'It is clear from this survey that the large and apparently unjustified increases which have recently attracted so much media attention are wholly unrepresentative.' The survey of more than 6,000 directors shows that women directors averaged 7.1 per cent increases over the same period but continued to earn less than their male peers. Pay for managing directors working in London is nearly 20 per cent above the national median while their counterparts in the south-west are paid 13 per cent below the national median. More than half of all directors received pay rises of 5 per cent or less and 35 per cent had rises of 4 per cent or less. Of those, 14 per cent received no pay rise and 1 per cent accepted pay cuts. The number of directors driving company cars has dropped from 84 per cent to 79 per cent over the past 12 months. Pay appears to increase with company turnover and individual responsibility levels. Managing directors of companies with turnover of more than Pounds 200m are paid an average of Pounds 107,500 plus a bonus worth Pounds 18,000. More than 90 per cent have a company car. The average salary for managing directors of companies turning over between Pounds 20m and Pounds 250m is now Pounds 78,045, plus a bonus worth Pounds 11,000. More than 95 per cent have a company car, 29 per cent of them Jaguars. Managing directors of companies with turnovers of up to Pounds 25m are paid an average of Pounds 46,000, plus a bonus worth Pounds 6,800. More than 95 per cent have a company car, with 13 per cent driving a Mercedes. The Directors' Reward Survey. Reward Group, Reward House, Diamond Way, Stone Business Park, Stone, Staffs. ST15 OSD.

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / ANC meets to draw up firm policies THE AFRICAN National Congress (ANC) begins a four-day policy conference in Johannesburg today in which it will attempt to flesh out its view of the policies to be pursued by a future democratic government in South Africa. Although the aim of the conference is to produce policy guidelines rather than details, it should provide valuable information about ANC intentions and, as it will be attended by about 700 delegates, will be a useful barometer of grassroots militancy. The conference takes place against a background of strained relations between the ANC and the government following the stalemate earlier this month at the constitutional talks held under the auspices of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa. Yesterday, the law and order minister, Mr Hernus Kriel, said that the government's 'honeymoon' with the ANC was over. In response to ANC claims that President F W de Klerk condoned township violence when the victims were black, the minister said: 'It can be expected that in the future there will be reaction against unfounded attacks on the government and especially on the state president.' The business community will be watching to see the extent to which the ANC has shed its socialist baggage. Indications are, however, that many difficult questions, like nationalisation and taxation policy, may be referred to specialist committees for study.</p>

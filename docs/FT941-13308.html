			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Time running out for the bond market bulls It is now more than three months since the 30-year US Treasury bond yield hit a low of 5.78 per cent and bounced back up by half a percentage point. Recently the long bond yield has fluctuated quietly around 6.3 per cent. Time is running out for the bulls who have counted on US Treasuries to regain and surpass their price peaks. More recently there has been a sharp break in the Japanese bond market where the 10-year yield jumped from 2.96 per cent to almost 3.40 per cent in a few days in the middle of this month. The latest on-off reflation package has upset the JGB market with its threat of massive extra borrowing although, in a funny way, the bond market can gain some comfort from the government's disarray, because the flood of paper is being postponed. Together the US and Japan account for 60 per cent of the capitalisation of the worldwide government bond market, so there is increasing evidence for calling the turn in the global bull market. European bonds, however, still have something going for them. UK gilts looked as though they were suffering something of the same January reaction as JGBs, but increasing optimism about a fall-off in the rate of issuance next year has allowed long gilt yields to claw their way back almost to the December 31 lows. Today's auction of Pounds 2 3/4 bn of a 16-year gilt will give a clue to the robustness of demand. As for the Continental countries, they are lagging in the economic cycle and with short-term interest rates having quite a way to fall, there is still scope for domestic money to shift into the bond markets. All the same, after dropping from 7 1/4 per cent to 5 1/2 per cent last year, the 10-year yield on German bunds does not have all that much further to go, and indeed has itself backed up a little this month. The global deflation story, which has had bond investors salivating, looks rather tired now. Although the weakness of the oil price has been holding down inflation, many other commodity prices have been picking up. Global economic growth is slowly increasing now. Rapid expansion continues, in fact, in the emerging economies, which will soon be large enough to have a significant effect on commodity demand. Central governments have been pumping large amounts of liquidity into the international economy. True, this infusion does not show up in the broad money figures, which indicate growth of only about 3 per cent averaged across the Group of Seven economies. This is because the liquidity has disappeared into the booming securities markets and thereby largely into repayment of short-term corporate debt. It is worth noting, though, that narrow money has recently been growing at an annual rate of 10 per cent in the US and 6 per cent in the UK (and broad money growth, too, is now accelerating in the UK). Eighteen months ago a short-term interest rate of 3 per cent may have been justifiable in the US, but it is now inappropriate when this Friday's statistics may well show that money GNP has recently been growing at 7 per cent year-on-year. Inflation is, of course, steady; but it only responds to monetary acceleration with a time lag of something like two years. However, having got here, the US Federal Reserve has no easy way back. A sharp hike in short-term interest rates might perversely cause a rapid acceleration in broad money growth as investors moved back into deposits, and unpredictable damage would be done to the value of long-term assets; equities would be vulnerable to a rising yield ratio. But a cautious edging up in rates might be little better, because investors would assume it was only a taster for the real thing. If the Fed persists with masterful inactivity it will remain in a comfortable position for the time being, perhaps for the rest of the year. But doing nothing will not be a soft option indefinitely; the US bond market will sweat increasingly about the inflationary implications for a year or two out. But whatever the immediate effect on market sentiment of a rise in short-term rates, logically an anti-inflationary stance by the Fed will favour bonds in the medium term; that would be the friendly advice of the Bundesbank, anyhow, if only it were to be asked.</p>

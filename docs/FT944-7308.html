			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Clarke signals 'wise men' changes Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday reappointed the Treasury's six-man panel of independent economic forecasters for one year while paving the way for future changes. The Treasury announced that two of the 'wise men' - Professor David Currie, head of economic forecasting at the London Business School, and Prof Wynne Godley, professor of applied economics at Cambridge University - would serve until the end of 1995. The other four existing members were appointed until the end of 1996. These are Mr Andrew Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research; Prof Tim Congdon, managing director of Lombard Street Research; Mr Gavyn Davies, chief UK economist for Goldman Sachs; and Prof Patrick Minford, professor of applied economics at Liverpool University. In future the panel will produce two reports a year, compared with three annually since it was set up in December 1992. This will bring it into line with the Treasury, which by law has to produce two economic forecasts a year. The Treasury said the chancellor's goal was to change the membership of the panel over time with appointments normally of three years. In practice a third of the panel will change every year in future. The names of the first two new members would be announced during 1995. The two-year appointments announced yesterday would ensure some continuity until the end of 1996, when there would be a further change of membership. The panel was set up after sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism to promote greater openness in economic policy making. Its members were prone to squabble in the early days but, after initial hesitation, Mr Clarke pronounced it useful. However, the changed terms of reference and moves to turn over its membership were seen in Whitehall last night as a sign that the forecasters had earned only 'two cheers' from the chancellor.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Greenspan confident rate cut will trigger second-quarter upturn MR Alan Greenspan, US Federal Reserve chairman, said yesterday he believed recent interest rate cuts would turn the stagnant economy around by the second quarter, but left the door open for further monetary easing if needed, Reuter reports from Washington. 'We expect the amount of monetary ease in the pipeline is adequate to turn the economy on to the path of sustained recovery,' Mr Greenspan said in testimony to the House of Representatives' budget committee. Mr Greenspan said he expected the economy to pick up in the second quarter and gain steam as the year progressed. 'There should be a quickening in the pace of activity as the year goes on,' he said, adding: 'We are, of course, continuing to evaluate whether some additional insurance in the way of further monetary ease would be appropriate.' The US economy is beset by rising unemployment and overall lower industrial activity, although economists say the recession has been relatively shallow in most of the country. President George Bush's prospects for re-election in November are closely linked to the economy's performance. The Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee met yesterday afternoon to discuss the course of monetary policy. The committee will report on its deliberations in a week's time. The Fed startled financial markets on December 20 when it cut the discount rate at which it lends money to banks by a full point. The cut was aimed at stimulating spending. Mr Greenspan told the budget committee it was apparent some 'strong forces' had been working against a typical economic recovery in the US. But he said it looked unlikely overall economic activity would slide into a new morass of recession. The economy is uneven, 'but it does not appear that we are tumbling into another significant contraction in overall activity,' he said.</p>

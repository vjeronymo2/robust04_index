			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Fabius defiant in blood scandal FRANCE'S ruling Socialists yesterday rallied behind party leader Mr Laurent Fabius vowing they would not let him be made a scapegoat over Aids-infected blood transfusions, Reuter reports from Paris. Mr Fabius, who was prime minister in 1985, when more than 1,200 haemophiliacs were infected by transfusions from state blood banks, told party colleagues he would not resign. The opposition has demanded that Mr Fabius and former health ministers Mr Edmon Herve and Ms Georgina Dufoix stand trial.</p>

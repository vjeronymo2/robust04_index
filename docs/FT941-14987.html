			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / High Christmas sales confirmed The first hard evidence that shops and supermarkets enjoyed their best Christmas and new year since the economy went into recession came in a survey published yesterday. Sales volumes increased in December and in the first five days of this month at the highest year-on-year rate since April 1990, according to a Confederation of British Industry distributive trades survey. Mr Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's deputy director of economic affairs, said: 'The optimism among retailers before December proved to be justified last month. But it is likely that the buoyancy of trade was in part due to keen pricing by retailers in the run-up to Christmas which successfully attracted consumers into the high street.' The survey showed that the rise in sales was broad-based, with only off-licences reporting volumes down on a year ago. The most notable gains were recorded by chemists and grocers, with footwear and leather retailers and booksellers and stationers also reporting above average growth. Furniture and carpet stores reported modest increases in sales compared with a year ago. The balance of retailers reporting an increase in sales compared with a year ago, less those reporting a decrease, was 34 per cent compared with 23 per cent in November and minus 4 per cent in December 1992. But the CBI warned that the rate of sales growth was expected to moderate in the early part of this year. Expectations for this month were the weakest since May last year. Official retail sales figures tomorrow are expected to confirm the pick-up in consumer spending in December. Wholesalers were surprised by an increase in sales volumes that was substantially higher than expected. Orders placed with wholesalers' suppliers also increased strongly in the year to December, although stock levels were considered to be excessive. Christmas results for car traders were less encouraging. Sales last month were down slightly on a year ago, although the CBI expects a return to year-on-year growth for traders this month. The expected increase in sales is the strongest since March last year. The survey was conducted between December 15 and January 5 and covered 15,000 outlets in retailing, wholesaling and motor trades. CBI Survey of Distributive Trades, December 1993.

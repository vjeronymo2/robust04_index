			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: BZ Trust to reduce commission charges BZ Trust, the fund management unit of the BZ banking group in Zurich, has agreed to reduce the commission it charges for managing the three investment companies controlled by the group. BZ has come under public criticism for the massive commissions earned in the past year, although BZ officials insist that no investors have complained. In the first eight months of the fiscal year, it earned SFr132.7m (Dollars 90.2m) for managing BK Vision, a quoted company that specialises in holding banking shares. In the first six months, it earned SFr140.4m from Pharma Vision, another quoted company which specialises in pharmaceutical shares. The performance related commission structure has been based on the market capitalisation of the companies rather than their net asset value. However, a significant part of the commissions paid arose because the prices of the Vision shares moved in the past two years from discounts of roughly 10 per cent against net asset value to premiums of a similar order. Mr Kurt Schiltknecht, president of BZ Trust, said that as of the fourth quarter of last year, commissions have been based on the lower of market value and net asset value. The result in the fourth quarter was to reduce BZ Trust's total commission income by between SFr150m and SFr200m.</p>

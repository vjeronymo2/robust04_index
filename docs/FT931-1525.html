			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Squeeze costs exporters Pounds 1bn in lost credit cover: Uncertainty persists over state reinsurance policy ACUTE EXPORT credit capacity shortages and uncertainty over future government policy on political risk reinsurance have led to at least Pounds 1bn in potential exports failing to win credit cover in recent months, according to Mr Colin Foxall, managing director of NCM, Britain's leading export credit agency. Mr Foxall said yesterday that uncertainty over the plight of reinsurance for short term export credit cover could result in up to 20 per cent of requests for cover being turned down - worth up to Dollars 4bn in exports a year. NCM accounts for 80 per cent of short-term credit insurance for UK exporters, providing cover for more than Pounds 14bn of exports in 1992. 'The shoe is pinching in a number of areas, and it is inhibiting us in supporting exporters,' Mr Foxall said. For example, NCM has had to turn down requests from Siemens Plessey for cover on sales of radar to China worth Pounds 10m, forcing the company to seek alternative protection against non-payment. 'We are anything but alone in this,' said Mr Keith Johnson, a director at Siemens Plessey and deputy chairman of the British Exporters' Association. 'We understand there are significant other contracts awaiting reinsurance from the market, where there appears to be no more capacity, or the government,' he said. He asked why the government had chosen to encourage trade with China through three ministerial visits in one year without ensuring reinsurance cover could be arranged. Mr Foxall and Mr Johnson join voices ranging from the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Export, to NSM's competitor, Trade Indemnity, in demanding that the government abandon plans to withdraw from reinsurance at the end of 1994. Britain would then be alone in Europe in forcing the commercial market to meet short-term reinsurance needs. They argue that withdrawal is misguided when the government has pledged to encourage exports as a means of lifting the economy out of recession. Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, said last autumn the government was committed to boosting Britain's share of world trade from 5.3 per cent to 6.3 per cent by the end of the decade, adding about Pounds 10bn to exports at 1993 prices. Mr Terry Bridgman, director of Trade Indemnity, added this week: 'British industry stands to lose hundreds of millions of pounds of export orders. The reinsurance market is prepared to play its part, but can only do so within balance sheet limitations. Ministers are failing fully to appreciate the urgency of the matter.' Unavailability of export credit cover does not inevitably mean that an export is lost, but acts as a powerful deterrent. The search for cover can result in delay, which can lead to the loss of a contract. Companies with overseas subsidiaries can also switch a bid to a country where cover is more readily available, resulting in a loss of jobs and exports from the UK.

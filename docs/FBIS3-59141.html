For, in America  things are really better at the moment, as Goethe once wrote.  The recession that will make itself really at home in Germany  this year, has already bidden farewell to the United States.  The country is at an enviable (and very rare) point in the  economic cycle, where everything is right. The economy is  growing, inflation is going down, interest rates are at a  20-year low, the dollar is on its way up, the deficit is  declining, and jobs are mushrooming.    In Germany, once called "model Germany," almost all the  indicators are pointing in the opposite direction. Here,  unemployment is growing, together with debts and the budget  deficit; inflation is only beginning to fall below the 4-percent  mark; interest rates seem to be too high to boost the economy --  and too low to maintain the external value of the German mark:  Since April 1993, the mark has gone down 20 pfenning against  the dollar.    And this is why Helmut Kohl might remember Walter Rathenau's  words when he meets Bill Clinton: "Not the world, but the  economy is our fate." With these words, the foreign minister,  who was murdered by the Nazis, anticipated several cubic meters  of political literature: A purse that is doing all right is a  nice pillow to rest on for those in power. But if the man in  the street gets the feeling that his material existence is  suffering in line with the economy, the ballot paper turns into  a letter of dismissal. Whether chancellor or president, with  the economy going down, they may have to go.    George Bush had to experience this. In March 1991 he was  still the glorious winner of the Gulf War (with an approval rate  of 91 percent), and in November 1992 he was the loser in a  domestic war called "presidential elections." "Not the world,  but the economy," was, therefore, the unwritten motto of this  year's State of the Union Address, which the president gives on  Congress' return from winter recess. Of the total 11 pages,  only one and one-half were on foreign and security policy; the  rest concerned domestic and economic policy.    The speaking notes were full of success figures: 1.6 million  new jobs in the private sector alone during Clinton's first year  in office; the tackling of the seemingly eternal budget deficit,  that -- according to Clinton -- will be only 180, instead of 300  billion next year; the cutback on bureaucracy; the removal of  trade barriers in North America; the plans for a general health  insurance. Today, the "state of the nation" looks as if Clinton  might come out with flying colors in the 1996 election year --  at the height of an economic upswing, the most secure basis for  reelection that the Democrats know.    But there is another reason why things are better in  America,  and this has something to do with the electoral system. In  practice, this system creates more frequently clear-cut  majorities than the German one. In a majority voting system you  tend to have two parties, one in power, the other in opposition.  Proportional representation, on the other hand, creates many  parties, and thus the need to form coalitions. This obviously  does not bring about any clear mandates for change, but  compromise cabinets maintaining the status quo. In good times,  the Germans, the Europeans, were quite well advised with this  system. But when there are fires burning everywhere, coalition  governments are not an effective fire brigade.    Clinton is fortunate enough to have his Democratic Party  controlling both houses of Congress. He managed to get many  things underway during his first year: "Weariness of politics,"  is a term unknown to the Americans -- even if it did seem at one  point that they might fall into the trap of a demagogic outsider  like Ross Perot. Beside, Clinton has managed to embody the  state of his union as perfectly as Kohl did in the eighties.    Leaning toward the "left," he offers voters a national  health  insurance and laws to control firearms -- both long overdue.  Speaking to the "right," in his State of the Union Address he  promised an additional 100,000 police officers, stricter laws  against relapse offenders, more liberal choice of schools, and a  welfare reform that would speed up people's return to the labor  market. More state here, less there; more welfare here, more  freedom there -- Clinton seems to have come up with a mixture  that smells strongly of achieving a majority.    And that is why the chancellor might very well have an  attack  of nostalgia during his visit to Washington -- all the more so,  as almost two-thirds of Americans think that Clinton will be a  "better president" during his second year in office. But one  enemy stays with him, Clinton himself -- with his affairs and  lapses. More than half of the voters say: "Every time I am  beginning to feel good about the President, something happens  that speaks against him."</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Cott challenges the big boys The soft drinks market is among the bloodiest battlefields in the global war between national and retailer-controlled brands. Cott Corporation, an upstart Canadian company, is giving Coca-Cola and Pepsi - long considered two of the most impregnable brands - their stiffest competition in many years. Cott has signed supply agreements with 90 retail chains around the world, including Wal-Mart, the biggest US retailer, and the UK's J. Sainsbury. It recently began shipments to Japan's second biggest retailer. But nowhere has Cott made bigger inroads or provoked a more aggressive response from Coke and Pepsi than in its home market of Ontario. Coke closed half its Canadian bottling plants in a drive to match Cott's costs. Cott's chairman, Mr Gerald Pencer, is an entrepreneur whose last venture - a Canadian trust and loan company - ended in failure. Background, Page 18</p>

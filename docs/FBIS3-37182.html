			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In Kiev the police arrested 35 members of the  Ukrainian Self-Defense Organization (USDO) on charges of  belonging to paramilitary units. This was announced on Sunday  in Lvov by the chairman of the local branch of the Ukrainian  National Assembly (UNA), Andrey Shkil.    The Ukrainian National Assembly is an ultra-nationalist  organization formed in 1990. USDO paramilitary units were  formed under UNA auspices in early 1992. The same year its  members joined military actions in Moldova on the side of the  self-proclaimed Republic of Trans-Dniester on the pretext of  protecting ethnic Ukrainians in the area. In early 1993 about  100 USDO fighters joined hostilities between Georgians and  Abkhazians on the side of Georgians.    Addressing the 2nd regional conference convened by the UNA  and USDO, Shkil said that the arrests in Kiev had been followed  by searches at his organization's headquarters and at the flats  of 3 USDO activists. The police confiscated various documents,  identity cards of candidates for parliamentary elections, and  registration lists.    With reference to the arrests Andrey Shkil declared, "This  was the first day of reprisals against the UNA. We are  beginning to inspire fear, because we have become a powerful  force." The UNA/USDO was prepared for such confrontation when  it was taking its decision to join the election campaign, he  said.    "We'll come to power anyway, even if all our members are  arrested," he declared.    The press center of Ukraine's Security Service told  Interfax-Ukraina that the Service is aware of the measures the  police took recently toward the UNA/USDO. "But this is a police  matter," spokesmen for the Service stressed.    USDO's commander in chief, Yuriy Shukhevich, told  journalists: "We are ready to fight anywhere -- in the Crimea,  in the Donetsk coal mining area, in Moscow, in St.Petersburg --  wherever a war is on."    The UNA/USDO conference demanded that its members be freed,  and declared that it views their arrest as the beginning of  repression on the eve of elections.    Shkil also said: "We shall not issue declarations concerning  developments in the Crimea. We are men of action: the Crimea  will be either Ukrainian, or depopulated."    On Sunday the UNA\USDO leadership published data on their  membership: there are 510 UNA/USDO members in Lvov Region.  Besides, there are 388 USDO "fighters" and 286 candidates for  "fighters" in Lvov Region. 865 men are viewed as reservists.  400 more members of the organization are known to live in  Ternopol, Povno and Western Ukraine.</p>

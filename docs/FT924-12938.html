			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Arts: Venture to St Pancras USING the Victorian Gothic vastness of St Pancras Station to show specially commissioned work by a selection of contemporary artists is an exciting idea, which has been brought to fruition in an exhibition organised by Camden Arts Centre. Until November, work by 12 European artists can be seen in a two part show at the station and the gallery. Northern Adventures, however, is a project that fails to fulfil its promise, partly because of attempting to include too much in its brief, and partly because of the very grandeur of its setting - St Pancras is a hard place to co-opt. What is perhaps most disappointing is how little effort the invited artists appear to have made to do so. To be fair, what appears to be a somewhat tentative intervention is partly explained by the station authorities' duty to protect the listed structure: the piece by Antoni Malinowski, for example, now a subtle curving of painted canvas seeping along the ground from the edges of an entrance archway, was originally a much more adventurous concept. Part of the problem also has been an attempt by the organisers' to hasten the venerable station into the European age. 'Common Knowledge,' the piece by Jane Mulfinger which uses the glass panels of the ticket booths to display jokes about 'funny foreigners' in a variety of languages seems ill placed in a station from which the furthest destination that I could discover is Leeds. Indeed, the whole ambience of St Pancras is that of a Britain of some other, more innocent age, no later than the 1950s, still firmly rooted in the industrial past celebrated in the iron girders which hold up the station roof and proclaim themselves the work of 'The Billerley Company, Derbyshire, 1867'. St Pancras also seems immune from some of the worst of modern station tat. Its kiosks are modest, its refreshment room functioning soberly despite a surface patina of plastic. Here, picking up the mood, Sonia Boyce has printed tablecloths with quotations from Brief Encounter. Also taking a suburban theme are pieces from Maya and Stuart Brisley. Hers is a poem reproduced on a steel plate in red and black, his a model of a house made of black steel mesh. Both works have a brooding quality, a sense of doom. 'It isn't right to remind people of death like that all the time,' a station worker said. bag The best piece in the exhibition is one that is both its most and its least accessible. Cornelia Parker has produced a set of six postcards of work made in the station hotel, itself forbidden to public access. The photos, richly coloured and beautifully composed, show mysterious installations, some of which make use of the Gothic patterning of the hotel decor - soot making trefoil patterns on floorboards, white chalk repeating decorative motifs on the grey slates of the roof. Parker's work is clever, a wise response to a difficult setting. Parker pitches it just right, conscious of the works' location in a setting which must inevitably make them look small. She is also the only exhibitor to address any of the features or problems of the area in which the station is situated: one card shows call girls' advertisement stickers scattered inside the station clock, another shows half-lemons suspended in a window (local residents are used to discovering these, discarded by junkies who use them as a mean of enhancing their fix.) After dark in the exhibition's final week, Anne Bean and Peter Fink will project a piece on the station facade, shrouded in plastic while restoration work is carried out beneath. Perhaps their skill with projected and other sources of light and flair for dramatic effect will bring 'Northern Exposures' the finale its setting deserves.

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Park Food's seasonal loss rises - Sales of hampers advance 16% over 'crucial' Christmas period Park Food Group, which specialises in the sale of Christmas hampers, yesterday announced an increase in losses for the six months to September 30, due to the seasonal nature of its business. However, it revealed positive news on Christmas sales. Pre-tax losses were Pounds 4.74m, compared with Pounds 3.22m, as a result of higher expenditure on marketing in the run-up to Christmas. Turnover advanced 26 per cent to Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 9.1m). There were stronger contributions from two peripheral businesses which produce airline travel kits and cash vouchers for high street stores. Mr Peter Johnson, chairman and a front-runner in the battle for Everton football club, said that hamper sales, which account for 75 per cent of group turnover, increased by 16 per cent over the crucial Christmas period. The company claims a share of almost 40 per cent of the Pounds 300m UK market for hampers. Mr Johnson said firm orders were already up by 20 per cent so far this year. 'I am confident that profits for the full year will show a satisfactory improvement.' His optimism was demonstrated by a 25 per cent increase in the interim dividend to 2.5p. Directors are also recommending a 2-for-1 scrip issue. In the second half of the year, Park Food will gain a maiden contribution from Handling Solutions, the promotions management company acquired in mid-December for Pounds 9.3m. Handling Solutions made a profit of Pounds 1.8m for the year to October 1993. With financing costs of 4 per cent for the Pounds 8.5m cash portion of the acquisition, the company said it would produce a positive contribution for the three months to March 1994. The company, which is involved in promotional services, direct mail, packaging and distribution, should also provide synergistic benefits. Park Food has no gearing, and benefits from interest on substantial cash balances from mail-order clients. At the interim stage net interest received was Pounds 1.06m (Pounds 1.37m). Mr Johnson said he would not rule out further acquisitions this year.</p>

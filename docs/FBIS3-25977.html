			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By So Lai-Fun] </F>   [Text] There were positive signs from China yesterday  regarding a British offer to substantially raise the amount of  capital to be injected into the Chek Lap Kok airport and its  associated railway. The offer to pump more than $60 billion  into the Provisional Airport Authority and the Mass Transit  Railway Corporation to facilitate an early agreement with  Beijing on the projects was endorsed by the Executive Council  [Exco] yesterday.    Details of the multi-billion-dollar bid to kick-start the  vast infrastructure plan were revealed exclusively in the South  China Morning Post. Governor Chris Patten said the new offer,  discussed during a three-hour session of Exco, would address all  Chinese concerns, given the healthy state of Hong Kong's  reserves. "I hope that (China) would find this an excellent  Lunar New Year present for Hong Kong, for China, for everyone,"  Mr Patten said.    Chinese sources welcomed the prospect of a much bigger level  of capital investment in the two corporations by the Government  and a Hong Kong affairs adviser, Tsang Yok-shing, added a note  of optimism. Mr Tsang returned from Beijing after presenting  Chinese officials with proposals from the Democratic Alliance  for the Betterment of Hong Kong that require the territory to  inject $90 billion of the $99.2 billion total cost of the two  projects. Mr Tsang, alliance chairman, said he believed that if  Britain agreed to raise the level of capital investment and  sought consultation with China for any borrowings by the two  corporations exceeding $5 billion, the airport financing problem  could be resolved.    A mainland official stressed that China remained flexible on  the amount of capital injection although it insisted that the  overall financing arrangements should be considered as a  package. Noting that China was always flexible on the level of  government fundings, he said: "The British side should at least  explain to us why they could not accept our proposal.    "There should not be any different understandings over the  definition of government borrowings... That's what we have  discussed all the way after the signing of the Memorandum of  Understanding on the airport," the official said. He said the  land issue was also negotiable as China was flexible on whether  it would allow the 62 hectares of airport railway land to be  counted outside the annual land disposal quota of 50 hectares.  However, the official stressed that the Airport Consultative  Committee should be given a more important role to monitor the  costs of the whole programme.    Mr Patten said the Government would pass the new proposal to  the Chinese side as soon as possible and he would like to see an  early meeting of the Joint Liaison Group Airport Committee. But  the increase in capital injection is understood to be contingent  on China allowing the 62 hectares of land along the airport  railway to be counted separately from the 50 hectares sold by  the territory every year under Annex Three of the Joint  Declaration.</p>

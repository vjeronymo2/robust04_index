			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Letter: Lord Jay backs Kinnock call for revaluation of D-Mark Sir, I write to support strongly Mr Neil Kinnock's letter (July 16) urging a British lead for an agreed revaluation of the D-Mark against other ERM currencies. A move to a competitive level for sterling is inevitable if this country is to survive, and a postponement for one, two or more years (as after 1925) will merely prolong the misery of 10 per cent unemployment for that long. Since both Italy and France equally suffer from 10 per cent unemployment - now the standard for EMS countries with over-valued currencies - an agreed adjustment of the D-Mark to its true level is much the best solution. It is pure nonsense to say that a fall in the sterling rate would require even higher interest rates. The freeing of the exchange rate in 1931 enabled the War Loan conversion from 5 per cent to 3.5 per cent and drop in the Bank Rate to 2 per cent in June 1932: and this fall in interest rates generated a building boom and steady real growth throughout the 1930s. The fall in interest rates was helped by the realisation that a competitive exchange rate would correct the balance of payments deficit; which is still true and is being ignored by the opponents of realignment. It is also untrue that realignment would provoke a damaging rise in price levels. The move of sterling to a competitive level in 1949 was followed by a rise of the RPI over the year of less than 2 per cent, and in the longer term, as Sir Alec Cairncross has shown (in 'Sterling in Decline'), a redress in the whole imbalance between the sterling and economic worlds, which was a major cause of the comparative stability enjoyed in the 1950s. Similarly, the plunge in sterling in early 1985 was not followed by any uprush in prices. The arguments being advanced against early revaluation simply ignore the practical experience. So why prolong the agony for no good purpose? Douglas Jay, House of Lords, London SW1A 0PW</p>

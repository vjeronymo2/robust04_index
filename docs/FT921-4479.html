			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Protesters set sail for East Timor MORE than 100 Portuguese and Australian protesters sailed from Darwin for East Timor yesterday, ignoring US and Australian warnings that their plan to lay wreaths at the site of a massacre of pro-independence demonstrators might provoke a stern response from Indonesia. The protesters, on board the Portuguese car ferry Lusitania Expresso, have been barred from Indonesian waters, and will face a naval blockade. The protest is intended to demonstrate Portuguese sovereignty over East Timor, which was invaded by Indonesia in 1975, and annexed the following year. The annexation has not been recognised by the United Nations. Portuguese President Mario Soares meanwhile strongly criticised the US and Australia for having double standards over the annexation and the continued abuse of human rights in Lisbon's former colony. Indonesia has admitted that at least 50 East Timorese demonstrators were killed in November, when troops opened fire on a funeral march in Dili, the capital. Witnesses say the death toll may have been much higher. The massacre has been criticised by western governments, although protests have been muted since an Indonesian inquiry recommended disciplinary action against several army officers. However, the Australian and US governments have urged the protesters to avoid provoking Indonesia. Mr Soares, in an interview with the daily newspaper Publico, said the international community 'cannot have two weights and two measures' regarding human rights abuses and Indonesia's actions in East Timor. 'Unhappily, there are great countries that have a very clear position regarding human rights in one case and not in others. This is unfortunately the case of the United States,' Mr Soares said.</p>

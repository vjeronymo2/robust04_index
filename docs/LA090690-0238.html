			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. SEEKS TO OPEN FLOW OF SOVIET OIL;  </P> <P> TRADE: THE COMMERCE SECRETARY AND A GROUP OF CORPORATE EXECUTIVES WILL VISIT  NEXT WEEK TO OFFER AMERICAN EXPERTISE.  </P> <P> Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said today that he and a group of  corporate chief executive officers will tour the Soviet Union next week to  discuss bolstering that country's lagging oil production and improving trade.  </P> <P> "There's a tremendous amount to be done," Mosbacher said at a news briefing.  </P> <P> "They're the biggest oil producer in the world.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of new methodologies and a lot of new equipment that's been  developed in this country over the last decade," he said.  </P> <P> Soviet oil production has been paralyzed by aging equipment and a choking  bureaucracy. But the United States believes that it can tap a new source of  energy if it provides the Soviets with a mix of management advice, hardware and  pointers on drilling techniques.  </P> <P> "They're producing all they can now," Mosbacher said. "There's a good chance  some of the (U.S.) group might be going to the oil fields."  </P> <P> Fifteen influential business executives are to make the trip, which starts  Saturday and includes a visit to Helsinki, Finland, to meet President Bush  after his summit with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> Among the 15 are Lodwrick Cook, chairman of Atlantic Richfield Co.; James  Kinnear, president of Texaco Inc., and Chesley Pruet, president of Pruet Oil  Co. of El Dorado, Ark.  </P> <P> Mosbacher said the trip was being planned before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of  Kuwait, the seizure of the sheikdom's oil fields and the dramatic increase in  world petroleum prices.  </P> <P> He also insisted that promises of technical and economic aid to the Soviets are  not a "quid pro quo" for their cooperation in the U.N.-sanctioned blockade of  Iraq.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL ROUNDUP  </P> <P> In other games:  </P> <P> Village Christian 6, L.A. Baptist 0 -- L. A. Baptist limited Village Christian  to 11 first-half yards in an Alpha League opener at Monroe High.  </P> <P> On their first possession of the second half, the Crusaders scored on a  nine-play, 50-yard drive capped by a five-yard pass from sophomore quarterback  David Treanor to J.B. McLeod. Treanor was starting in place of injured Mark  Vail.  </P> <P> L. A. Baptist (0-6) threatened on the next possession, marching to the Crusader  six-yard line. A fourth-and-goal run from the six-yard line, however, fell two  yards short. On the next play, Village Christian's Myles Brown ran 96 yards for  an apparent touchdown, but it was called back because of a clipping penalty.  ROB SONNER  </P></p>

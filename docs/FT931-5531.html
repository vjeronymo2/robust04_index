			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Not honourable THE PRIME MINISTER deserves a modest commendation, but not a medal, for the changes to the British system of honours that he announced yesterday. It is right that knighthoods should cease to be automatically awarded to time-serving Tory backbenchers or nearly superannuated civil servants - that, indeed, all gongs will in future be pinned only on the chests of those judged to deserve them. It is consonant with John Major's view of a 'classless society' that the lesser decorations, such as the British Empire Medal, until now reserved for what were formerly called the lower classes, should be abolished. There is sense in the proposition that anyone can write in to say that so and so has performed a social service very well and ought to be rewarded; a sound honours system exists to allow a society to thank those whose valued actions have not yielded personal wealth or power. It is also true to say, as Mr Major did, that the independence of the judiciary is protected by excepting High Court judges from the new rule of merit, although the same effect might have been better achieved by dissociating them from knighthoods altogether. All of this is unexceptionable, so far as it goes, which is no great distance. The prime minister retains his immense and opaque power of patronage; his reference to the existing arrangements for scrutiny of candidates is hardly reassuring. This is particularly so in the case of the retention of honours for political services, which are not taken up by the Labour party. Too much support for the Tories is currently paid for by government issue of silken ribbons and the chance to wear ermine. Yet reform of the House of Lords is beyond Mr Major's agenda. Mr Major has missed an opportunity to bring an antiquated system properly up to date. He appears to understands the importance of maintaining respect for the honours system, if it is to have continuing value. But the reformed arrangements retain an unnecessarily antique and hence backward-looking lustre. He should have been more radical.</p>

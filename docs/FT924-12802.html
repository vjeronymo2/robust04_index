			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / International Company News: S Africa rescues gold mine with R30m loan THE South African govern- ment is to assist the troubled Harmony gold mine, with a commercial loan up to a maximum of R30m (Dollars 10.7m). In recent years the government has followed a strict policy of not offering state aid to marginal mines unless they have potential to become viable. Harmony is by far the largest of South Africa's marginal gold producers threatened with closure because of the weak gold price. Harmony did not return to profit during the September quarter as predicted three months ago. Mr John Turner, chairman of Rand Mines gold division, said this was because the grade of ore predicted in the rationalisation programme had not been achieved. He said, however, that recent productivity measures and the state aid should ensure the mine's survival. The mine incurred operating losses of R7.9m in the quarter compared with R47m in the June quarter, which included extraordinary retrenchment costs. The other three mines in the group reported improved results for the September quarter compared with preceding three months. ERPM reduced its net losses to R3.4m from R6.07m, Durban Deep lifted net profits marginally to R1.06m from R1m and Blyvooruitzicht earned net profits of R1.5m compared with losses of R274,000, The state appears to have been persuaded to assist Harmony by the great lengths the mine is going to ensure its own survival.</p>

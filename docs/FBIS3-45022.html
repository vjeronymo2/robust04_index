In his welcoming remarks, Mesfin said that "we in the  transitional government attach a very special importance to our  relations with the People's Republic of China."    He said, among the reasons for it, the Ethiopian people have  always "considered the support and the assistance of the  People's Republic of China as exemplary in international  co-operation."    "The Ethiopian peasants in numerous parts of our country  have  very fond memories of Chinese experts and the work they have  left behind will always remain as a monument to the friendship  between our two peoples," he said.    "It is not only here in Ethiopia that the People's Republic  of China and its people are held in a very high esteem. In the  developing world in general, the People's Republic of China is  viewed in a special light and is regarded as a true friend of  their peoples and a genuine supporter of their causes," he added.    In his reply speech, Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen hailed the achievements the Ethiopian  transitional government made during the past two year.    Qian Qichen said "as an important country in east Africa,  Ethiopia is firmly committed to good-neighboring and regional  peace, and has played a positive role in promoting a political  settlement of the Somali question, thus winning wide acclaim  from the international community."    Ethiopia actively advocates that African countries, under  current unfavorable international political and economic  situation, unite to strengthen themselves and advocate the  African economic integration, he said, expressing deep  appreciation of it.    "To consolidate and strengthen unity and cooperation with  African countries is an important component of China's foreign  policy," the Chinese vice-premier said, adding China supports  the African countries in their efforts to strengthen themselves  through unity and cooperation and respects their desire to  choose the road of development suited to their respective  national conditions.    The Chinese vice-premier and foreign minister arrived here  today on a two-day visit to Ethiopia at the invitation of  Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin. During his first day  of visit, he held talks respectively with Ethiopian Foreign  Minister Seyoum and Chairman of the Constitution Drafting  Commission Kifle Wedajo.</p>

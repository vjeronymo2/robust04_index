			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Economy: Experts at odds on pound's value THE relative value of the pound is not something on which economists easily agree. The latest slide in sterling has done little to narrow their differences, and the arguments about whether the UK's currency is overvalued or undervalued continue. Last year, before the UK left the exchange rate mechanism and floated the pound on the foreign exchanges, the Treasury plus a number of City and academic economists argued that the pound was correctly valued at a central rate of DM2.95. Their main argument was that the price of tradeable UK goods was roughly on a par with European goods, converted at the exchange rate prevailing then. Others argued that DM2.95 was too high, and was pricing UK goods out of the international marketplace. They pointed to the size of the UK's visible trade deficit in the middle of a recession as evidence that manufacturing industry was unable to compete against Europe. The latest drop in the pound to around DM2.38 puts sterling about 15 per cent below its old ERM floor of DM2.778. Predictably enough, some of those economists who thought the pound was correctly valued before devaluation now argue that the exchange rate has slipped too far and will lead to higher inflation. Others are looking for it to fall even further before industry can regain international competitiveness. Mr Bill Martin, chief economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, believes that the pound needs to fall to roughly DM2.00 and to parity against the dollar, over the medium term, before the country can deliver reasonable growth levels and relatively low unemployment. Low inflation would be delivered by the government acting to restrain consumer spending. But Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist at Kleinwort Benson, says there is already evidence to suggest that the UK currency is heavily undervalued against the European currencies, if fairly valued against the dollar. 'You only have to look at some of the industry location decisions which are being taken at the moment, such as Hoover's decision to close its factory in Dijon, in France, and concentrate on its factory in Scotland,' he says. Economists will continue to disagree as long as different ways exist of assessing the currency's value. Those who argued that sterling was appropriately valued at DM2.95 when Britain was in the ERM were using the 'purchasing power parity' valuation method. This states that the correct exchange rate between any two currencies is the one that equalises the price of the same traded item in both countries. The problem with this method is that it ignores other economic fundamentals, apart from export prices, which determine whether a currency is valued at a sustainable level on the foreign exchanges. Thus Mr Martin argues that the PPP method gives a misleading view of a currency's value. It is all very well for the companies that have survived to price their goods on a par with Europe and the US, but that ignores those companies that went out of business in the 1980s, unable to compete with the pound at that level. The other method for assessing the value of a currency is to use macroeconomic models to estimate the exchange rate at which the economy can return the trade account into balance in the medium term. The two methods tell very different stories. For example, the PPP method suggests that the D-Mark is overvalued, while the second method suggests that the currency, given Germany's large trade surpluses during the 1980s, was undervalued. It is probable that they will continue to tell a similarly inconsistent story about sterling as the latest drop in the currency makes its mark on the economy.</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Mercedes may make buses in Shanghai MERCEDES-BENZ is negotiating with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation to build up to 1,000 buses a year for the Chinese market. The Daimler-Benz vehicles subsidiary, already in negotiations on a similar deal with the Jing Da automotive company in Beijing, said it might be possible for production of semi-knock-down kits to start on the Shanghai site before the end of the year. Mr Bernd Gottschalk, Mercedes director responsible for commercial vehicles, signed a letter of intent at the end of May, and attended opening talks in Shanghai last week. The signing follows an earlier visit to the city by Mr Gerhard Liener, Daimler finance director, which also foreshadowed the recent announcement by the group's AEG subsidiary of a joint venture to build metro railway carriages there. Mercedes said it wanted to erect a purpose-built production plant and train Chinese workers to ensure quality standards were maintained. The aim with the Jing Da project, talks about which appear to be progressing more slowly, is a start-up capacity for 500 buses a year, expanding quickly to 1,000.</p>

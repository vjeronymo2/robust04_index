While this safety zone is in effect, no vessel traffic will be allowed into or out of Sunset Cove. This safety zone is necessary to protect pleasure craft and personnel aboard these vessels from injury due to potential hazards associated with the fireworks. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This regulation is effective between the hours of 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. on July 9, 1994.

Due to the date when this office received the application, there was not sufficient time to publish proposed rules in advance of the event. Publishing a NPRM and delaying the event would be contrary to the public interest since the fireworks display is for the centenial celebration of this weekend. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background and Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On July 9, 1994, the town of Onset, Massachusetts, plans to sponsor a Onset Fire Works Centennial Celebration between the hours of 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. Approximately 200 spectator boats are expected to attend this event. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A safety zone is needed to prohibit spectator vessels from transiting or anchoring in the area over which the fireworks will be launched. The safety zone will include all waters from the Shell Point Beach south to buoy C ``1'' then southwest to a danger buoy at position 41 degrees 44.13 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; North and 70 degrees 39.83 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; West then northwest to the mouth of Sunset Cove, between the hours of 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. on July 9, 1994. While this safety zone is in effect, no vessel traffic will be allowed into or out of Sunset Cove. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies of DOT is unnecessary. These regulations will be in effect for only a short period, specifically for one hour on one day. The entities most likely to be affected are pleasure craft wishing to view the fireworks from the water. These vessels will still be able to view the fireworks from the water but will be required to do so at a distance more than 300 yards from the staging area, which will not cause them undue hardship. The effect on commercial traffic is negligible due to the minimal amount of commercial vessel traffic in that area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Small Entities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominate in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). For the reasons outlined in the Regulatory Evaluation, the Coast Guard expects the impact to be minimal on all entities. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

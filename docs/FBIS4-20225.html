			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi Message of U.S. Forza </F> Italia Clubs"]    [Text] (ANSA) New York, April 26 -- A guarantee that a new  Italian coalition government led by Forza Italia would be in the  centre was given late last night by phone from its leader Silvio  Berlusconi in his message to American Forza Italia convention in  New York.    Speaking from Milan, the Italian media magnate told the  American National Association of Forza Italia Clubs (ANFIA), "I  have read many articles from the United States that depict us as  being a rightist coalition sustained by neo-fascists.... I want  to assure you that Forza Italia is the pivot of the coalition.  We are leading it and our presence guarantees that it is in the  centre."    Berlusconi, tipped to be the next premier, went on to tell  his supporters, gathered here to inaugurate the official  founding of ANFIA at the Mayfair Baglioni Hotel, how the  contribution of the American people will play a role in the  foreign policy of his eventual government.    Representing Berlusconi at the convention was newly elected  MP Mauro Bortoloso, who spoke of Forza Italia's commitment to  extending the vote to Italian expatriates. In order to make  such a vote more valid, he added, it was necessary to correct  the way events in Italy have been presented abroad.    There are an estimated eighty full members of the three  Forza  Italia Clubs presently established in New York, New Jersey and  Connecticut. The role of the association, as explained by  general secretary Roberto Comelli, is to make a direct appeal to  Italians in America "to build an efficient community, an  authoritative partner to give efficient support to a winning  Italy." It is hoped that eventually 100 clubs will soon be set  up in New York state alone.    While in New York, Bortoloso led a Forza Italia delegation  which made stops at City Hall and the World Trade Center, for  discussion with various American political figures of Italian  descent.</p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / EC inflation declines, jobless rise THE LATEST drop in the European Community's average inflation rate was welcomed yesterday by EC officials. However, they are increasingly concerned about the steady rise in unemployment. Consumer prices fell on an annual basis from 4.8 per cent in May to 4.5 per cent last month, with only Greece going against this downward trend, according to Eurostat, the EC statistics office. But at the same time, unemployment is expected to average 9.5 per cent this year and to rise further next. EC officials express some dismay that sluggish Community growth, forecast at only 1.75 per cent this year, may continue into next year as a result of German interest rates. However, the Commission is still officially predicting an expansion in the EC economy of at least 2.25 per cent in 1993. This is preventing many EC governments making an early start to curb public borrowing and expenditure, as they are required to do by the economic and monetary union provisions of the Maastricht treaty. But, even in the extremely unlikely event of a renegotiation of the Maastricht pact, most Commission officials see no prospect of moderating the 'economic convergence' criteria set down in the treaty last year. They say such a move would prove unacceptable to Germany. Also, in recent meetings of EC finance ministers, most other governments have supported a long-haul approach to improving efficiency in the EC economy, even though cutting industrial subsidies and removing rigidities in the labour market are politically hardest to achieve at a time of low growth and rising joblessness. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, has said the best riposte, at the Community level, to the criticism that Maastricht's Emu provisions are 'deflationary' is to channel more aid to southern EC states. These would, as in the recent past, buy more investment goods from the north. This, in essence, is the macro-economic strategy behind the new cohesion fund for poorer Mediterranean countries plus Ireland, which the Commission is due to propose formally next week.</p>

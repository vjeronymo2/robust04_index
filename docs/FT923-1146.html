			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Travis Perkins warns on second half TRAVIS PERKINS, which describes itself as equal fourth in the builders' merchant market, saw a near-4 per cent fall in pre-tax profit, from Pounds 5.47m to Pounds 5.26m, in the first half of the year. However, Mr Tony Travis, chairman, warned that the second half might not match the first because of the cost of branch closures. Last year's pre-tax total was Pounds 14m, including Pounds 5.8m of property sales. Property was only likely to contribute Pounds 2m this year, after Pounds 720,000 (Pounds 600,000) in the first half. Turnover slipped to Pounds 151.6m (Pounds 156.1m) and operating profit to Pounds 4.85m (Pounds 5.02m). Mr Travis described the results as 'pretty dull, but quite an achievement in the present market'. The share price gained 11p to close at 144p. The operating margin was held at 3.2 per cent, whereas the 15-year average was between 6 and 7 per cent. A 1 per cent decline in gross margin, from 29.5 to 28.5 per cent, was offset by cuts in overheads. The group employed 3,250 people at the end of June, 11 per cent down on June last year and 1,400 fewer than three years ago. Further jobs would be shed in the second half. Interest payments roughly doubled to Pounds 305,000, although the group ended the first half with some cash in hand. Mr Travis said the average overdraft was between Pounds 3m and Pounds 4m. The group has had little debt since the all-paper merger of Travis &amp; Arnold and Sandell Perkins in 1988. The number of branches had fallen from a peak of 169 after the merger to about 145 by the end of this year. The group claims nearly 5 per cent of the national builders' merchant market, but perhaps twice that in the main regions in which it operates: London, the south and the Midlands. Mr Travis said the 1 per cent fall in interest rates would do little to help the group this year, although it was a step in the right direction. The falling value of the pound might help reverse the decline in imported timber product prices. 'As a distributor we have been living on a percentage on products that have been falling in price for two-and-a-half years.' Timber products accounted for 33.2 per cent of first-half sales. Building products' share was 38.1 per cent and plumbing and heating equipment 24.2 per cent. Bad debt charges remained high at 1.1 per cent of credit sales (80 per cent of sales are on credit), although this was an improvement on 1.4 per cent for 1991. Earnings per share fell to 3.6p (3.8p). The interim dividend is maintained at 2.5p.</p>

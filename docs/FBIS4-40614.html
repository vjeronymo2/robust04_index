			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast; passages within quotation marks </F> recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent M. Lillevyali] The State Duma is in  its own way a microcosm of our society and we went there today  to put a question to some of the elected representatives: How  do you feel about the president's edict on new means for  fighting crime?    [Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of Communist Party of Russia] "I  take a dual position here. On the one hand, I would support any  measures aimed at stopping gangsterism. But on the other hand,  they must be within the law."    [Yekaterina Lakhova, leader of Women of Russia faction] "The  president's edict cannot exceed the Constitution and cannot  exceed federal law. All those who drafted the edict, and I  understand that it was the president who drafted the edict, the  people who drafted the edict, drafted a completely  unconstitutional edict. I am very concerned by some of the  individual formulations -- the legislative committee discussed  them yesterday -- that tally directly with 1937 formulations."    [Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of Liberal Democratic Party  of  Russia] "They should have added our program. An emergency  should be introduced in certain regions of the country. In  certain cases, we should resort to the court martial system and  throw the Armed Forces into the fight against crime. The  militia cannot cope. It needs to be given the right to hold  additional weapons. The right of the citizen to bear arms  should be defended. That is the only way. It would be  temporary. The country's leadership introduced such an edict in  1947. It was very effective."    [Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of Yabloko faction]  "Introducing  the atmosphere of a free-for-all and giving some people the  chance to break all sorts of laws in order to tackle other  criminals will not in any way solve things."    [Lillevyali] We would like to finish with the point of view  of a professional lawyer -- the chairman of the State Duma  Security Committee, Viktor Ilyukhin.    [Ilyukhin] "It is first unconstitutional and contradicts the  Constitution. Second, it torpedoes the complete judicial system  now in existence. As a lawyer, I have every reason to question  the ability of judicial bodies, which have always been guided  only by the Constitution and only by the law, to implement it.  What will the reaction of the court be when a sentence is  passed on the basis of the edict and not the law?"</p>

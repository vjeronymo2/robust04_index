			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV/VIDEO  </P> <P> Sullivan on 'Murphy Brown': Former "CBS This Morning" co-anchor Kathleen  Sullivan is in Los Angeles taping the season finale of CBS' "Murphy Brown."  </P> <P> Sullivan plays herself in the episode, which has Frank (Joe Regalbuto) asking  Murphy (Candice Bergen) to get him a date for Corky's (Faith Ford's) wedding.  The episode will air during the May ratings sweeps. Sullivan's contract with  CBS doesn't end until November and, with the sudden firing of Brent Musburger  last weekend, there are rumors that she just might find another role at the  network with CBS Sports before spring is out.

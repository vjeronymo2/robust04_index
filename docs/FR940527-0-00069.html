The costs allowed for a Fellow's room and board will be the amount the Fellow's university reports to the Foundation as the cost of room and board for a graduate student if that student were to share a room at the student's university. If no graduate housing exists, then costs for regular shared student housing will be used. If no campus housing exists, the equivalent room and board costs at neighboring universities will be used. Stipends for room, board, and books will be prorated for Fellows enrolled in programs less than full time. The Foundation will not reimburse Fellows for any portion of their master's degree study, if any, that Fellows may have completed prior to the commencement of their fellowships. Nor will the Foundation reimburse Fellows for any credits acquired above the minimum number of credits required for the degree. If a Fellow has already taken and paid for courses that can be credited toward the Fellow's graduate degree under a fellowship, those must be credited to the degree; the remaining required courses will be paid for by the Foundation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;2400.53 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Certification for stipends. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to receive a fellowship stipend, a Fellow must submit in writing acceptance of the terms and conditions of the fellowship; evidence of admission to an approved graduate program; certified copies of undergraduate and, if any, graduate transcripts; a certified payment request form indicating estimated expenses for tuition, fees, books, room, and board; estimated income from any other grants or awards; information about the Fellow's degree program, including the number of required credits and the availability of a thesis option; a statement of the university's willingness to accept the transfer of 6 credits toward the Fellow's degree requirements for the Fellow's satisfactory completion of the Summer Institute (see &sect;2400.74); and a full plan of study over the duration of the fellowship, including information on the contents of required courses. Junior Fellows must provide evidence of receipt of their baccalaureate degrees, and Senior Fellows must provide evidence of their continued full-time employment as teachers in grades 7&hyph;12. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;2400.54 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Payment of stipends. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Payment for tuition, fees, books, room, and board subject to the limitations in &sect;&sect;2400.50 through 2400.53 and &sect;&sect;2400.60 through 2400.61 will be paid to each Fellow at the beginning of each term of enrollment upon the Fellow's submission of a completed Payment Request Form provided by the Foundation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;2400.55 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Termination of stipends. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Foundation may suspend or terminate the payment of a stipend if a Fellow fails to meet the criteria set forth in &sect;&sect;2400.40 through 2400.44 and &sect;2400.61, except as provided for in &sect;2400.62. Before it suspends or terminates a fellowship under these circumstances, the Foundation will give notice to the Fellow, as well as the opportunity to be heard with respect to the grounds for suspension or termination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;2400.56 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Repayment of stipends. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) If a Fellow fails to secure a master's degree, to teach American history, American government, or social studies on a full-time basis in a secondary school for at least one school year for each academic year for which assistance was provided under a fellowship, to secure no fewer than 12 credits for study of the Constitution as indicated in &sect;2400.43(b), or to attend the Foundation's Summer Institute on the Constitution, the Fellow shall repay all of the fellowship assistance received plus interest at the rate of 6% per annum or as otherwise authorized and, if applicable, reasonable collection fees, as prescribed in Section 807 of the Act (20 U.S.C. 4506(b)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) If a Fellow resigns a fellowship, the Foundation will seek to recover all fellowship funds which have been remitted to the Fellow under a fellowship. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart G_Special Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;2400.60 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Other awards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fellows may accept grants from other foundations, institutions, corporations, or government agencies to support their graduate study or to replace any income foregone for study. However, the stipend paid by the Foundation for allowable costs indicated in &sect;2400.52 will be reduced to the extent these costs are paid from other sources, and in no case will fellowship funds be paid to Fellows to provide support in excess of their actual total costs of tuition, required fees, books, room, and board. The Foundation may also reduce a Fellow's stipend if the Fellow is remunerated for the costs of tuition under a research or teaching assistantship or a work-study program. In such a case, the Foundation will require information from a Fellow's university about the intended use of assistantship or work-study support before remitting fellowship payments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

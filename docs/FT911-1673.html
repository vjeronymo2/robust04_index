			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / London hospitals prepare to operate under funding reforms: The story behind the political storm over opt-out trusts BRITAIN'S cities have many examples of Victorian public buildings erected in the grandiose style considered appropriate in an age of empire. They include government offices, town halls - and hospitals. The mid 19th century saw the start of Britain's biggest ever hospital building programme, with the capital the natural location for many substantial new hospitals. That was the start of the 'London problem' - the overconcentration of hospital facilities in the capital - that has burdened health planners throughout this century and surfaced again this week in the political storm over job cuts at Guy's in south London. London has eight teaching hospitals like Guy's, either on their original city-centre sites or within a few miles of them. A shift in the capital's population from the inner city to the suburbs and Home Counties has put increasing pressure on health facilities in many outer districts, while casting a logical question mark over the continued existence of so many big central-London hospitals. Generations of politicians have avoided pushing the 'London problem' to hard conclusions - there are more votes to be lost than won from closing world-famous institutions. The new funding arrangements contained in last month's health reforms will make it harder for those conclusions to be avoided. All hospitals now pay capital charges on their land, buildings and equipment. The high overhead costs of the big London hospitals will be reflected in prices when contracts are negotiated with purchasing health authorities. That will prove a strong incentive for health authorities outside the capital to treat patients locally. There is widespread recognition that a new plan for London's hospitals is required. The case for rationalisation, however, is clearer than any visible mechanism for securing it. There is no single health authority for London - it comes within four health regions - and gathering information on a capital-wide basis is a source of perpetual frustration for health strategists. The London hospitals straddle a vague line between serving their local communities and acting as national research and training institutions. There is uncertainty about the degree to which this ambiguous position contributes to differences in medical staffing patterns - and consequently costs - between London and the rest of the country. In theory, at least, rationalisation could be left to the government's new internal market and the competitive contract-based funding system. As Mr Peter Griffiths, chief executive of the Guy's and Lewisham Trust, told his staff when announcing the job cuts last week: 'If contracts are not won, then the trust has no future.' Many doctors and managers fear that an unrestrained scramble for contracts would lead the London teaching hospitals into greater financial woes, possibly destroying some specialist facilities by forcing concentration on high-volume activities. The latest attempt to impose order on London's hospital structure is being made by the King's Fund health service charity. It has assembled an influential group of health specialists to draw up a strategy for the future of the capital's hospitals, taking account of such factors as the high level of social deprivation in inner London and probable future shifts in treatment patterns. The commission is due to begin publishing its findings in the autumn. Opposition speakers, meanwhile, yesterday continued to blame the financial difficulties that have led to the proposed job cuts at Guy's and the Bradford Hospitals trust on the government's health reforms. Mr Robin Cook, shadow health secretary, told a British Medical Association meeting yesterday that it would be a 'scandal' if the government allowed more hospitals to become self-governing trusts while it remained unwilling to publish their business plans. 'The public,' he said, 'has a right to know if in the search for commercial success the business plan of their local opt-out hospital means cuts in services.' Ministers say the application documents and business plans prepared by potential trusts are internal working documents of a sort required in any organisation. Opponents are convinced that they cannot lose by continuing to press for their publication. They believe that will demonstrate that the government either knew many of the first 57 trusts would be financially unviable, or granted self-governing status on the basis of vague and insufficient information.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Bundesbank discounts money supply figures German money supply grew at 17.6 per cent a year in February, a slight reduction on the 21.2 per cent rate in January, but still far above the Bundesbank's 4-6 per cent target. The figure, for the broad M3 measure of money supply including time and savings deposits, was immediately discounted by the central bank as a continuing reflection of the extraordinary growth in December and January, exaggerated when calculated on an annual basis. For the first time the bank published a figure for the growth in money supply compared with the previous quarter, which it put at 4.1 per cent for February, according to preliminary calculations. There was general confidence in the financial markets that the high money supply figures, expected to remain in double figures for some months, would not divert the Bundesbank from its strat-egy of gradual interest rate cuts. Some analysts warned, however, that the special factors which caused December's figure to rise by 8.1 per cent, before the January record, are still having a big effect on M3: they include a surge in house buying and building, and the refusal of traditional bond investors to return to that market from short-term deposit accounts. The Bundesbank pointed out that bank credit to enterprises and individuals actually declined - new loans totalled DM9.9bn (Pounds 3.85bn) in the month compared with DM12.8bn a year earlier, although total lending rose in the past six months at a seasonally adjusted 10 per cent annualised rate. Bank credit to the public sector increased rapidly, by DM6.7bn, and public authority deposits with the Bundesbank declined by a further DM2.5bn, showing that the deficit financing of the public sector continues to have a strong expansionary effect on money supply. The most important factors distorting money supply in December were massive repatriation of capital from outside Germany, because of the abolition of tax benefits for accrued interest funds in neighbouring Luxembourg; and a surge in borrowing for house purchases, with the imminent expiry of special tax allowances for buying old properties. What happened in January was that the repatriated funds failed to return to the bond markets, as expected, because of turbulent conditions and a turn upwards in long-term interest rates. The money remained in relatively short-term deposit accounts and financial instruments. Nor has house-purchasing activity declined significantly, because the expectation that the steady decline in interest rates is coming to an end has encouraged more borrowers to take out mortgages. Opinion among analysts is divided between those who believe the distortions in the M3 figures make them largely irrelevant, and those who believe they point to long-term inflationary potential. 'The number was better than some had feared,' said Mr Julian Jessop of Midland Global Markets Research, 'but it doesn't matter what M3 does, neither for German monetary policy, nor for the market. The real issue is inflation, and that is likely to turn out at 3.1 per cent for this month, and could be below 3 per cent in April. This means the Bundesbank could cut its rates when the policy-making council meets on April 28. The Bank of France yesterday cut its key intervention rate by 0.1 percentage point to 6 per cent, writes Alice Rawsthorn. The reduction, following Wednesday's cut in the German repo rate, reflected the Bank of France's eagerness to keep pace with the Germans, but its modest scale illustrated the bank's concern about the weakness of the franc.</p>

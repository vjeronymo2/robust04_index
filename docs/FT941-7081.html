			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Talks smothered by cry of outrage: Hebron's massacre may help secure a settlement if it prompts Israel to deal more flexibly with the PLO The massacre of Palestinians during prayers at a mosque in the occupied West Bank town of Hebron yesterday is more than an enormous personal tragedy and a blow to Middle East peace hopes. Carried out by an American-born Jewish settler on a Friday in the Moslem holy month of Ramadan, the killings are also laden with symbolism which can be used by Islamic extremists throughout the region to stir emotions against Israel, established Arab regimes and their western allies. The attack could not have been more critically timed to cut the ground from under the embattled Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, whose leadership has been under increasing assault from within his own community since he agreed an outline peace accord with Israel last year. Few debates are more anguished than that raging over the future of the Palestinian people. After more than four decades of struggle, bloodshed, occupation and exile, the Palestinians appeared to be on the brink of decisions which could decide their place in the Middle East. Having said 'no' to every proposed solution since the formation of the state of Israel in 1948, PLO leaders have begun to say 'yes' to proposals which fall painfully short of the aspirations they nurtured for so long. On September 13 in Washington the PLO signed a declaration of principles with Israel which provided for mutual recognition, and a series of signposts pointing in a number of different directions. Not only did the two sides disagree about where they are heading, but within Israel, and the wider Palestinian community, the range of opinions multiplied and diverged still further. Yesterday's murders will have stirred a deep well of Palestinian emotion. But the strength of the declaration of principles still rests on the unstated fundamentals on which it was built. First, the Palestinian acknowledgment that the Arab inability to impose a military solution on Israel had been made absolute by the collapse of the Soviet Union. Second, that Israel wanted to rid itself of the Gaza Strip, a territory where the decline in living conditions has given birth to a more virulent form of Palestinian militancy which campaigns under the flag of radical Islam. To combat those forces after withdrawal, Israel needed the PLO. Perhaps, after yesterday's killings, Israel needs the PLO even more. The coincidence of interest between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and Mr Arafat, brought the two sides together secretly in Norway and, ultimately, the two men to a public handshake in Washington. But behind the international applause, the flames of an internal Palestinian debate had been fanned into a blaze from which a new unity of purpose might be forged, or an even bigger disaster ignited. Hero, or traitor? Pragmatic, wise, national leader, or vain, incompetent autocrat? The praise and accusations have swirled around the head of Mr Arafat for the past five months. In Tunis recently, as he sat in front of a wall-size colour photograph of Jerusalem, gun on hip and ball-point pens tucked into the sleeve pocket of his olive uniform, Mr Arafat appeared an unlikely subject for such strong emotions. He was worried about the slow pace of negotiations with Israel, anxious about deadlines already missed, cheerfully dismissive of criticism ('that's Palestinian democracy at work'), and no more forthcoming in private about his intentions than he is in public. Many Palestinians, including some who have worked most closely with him, would recognise the description. Mr Arafat plays his cards famously close to the chest. Purportedly representing nearly 5m Palestinians, some 2m living under occupation, only the tiniest number might claim at any one moment to know what is in the chairman's mind. Only three others are said to have been fully aware of the secret Norway negotiations with Israel. When Dr Haidar Abdel Shafi, the widely respected leader of the Palestinian team during 10 rounds of talks with Israel, arrived in Tunis last August for further instructions, it was to be told a deal had already been struck behind his back. It is hardly surprising Dr Shafi later returned to Tunis at the head of a delegation with a petition demanding Mr Arafat should be more accountable. Or that Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, who was such a successful and prominent spokeswoman for the Palestinians after the Madrid peace conference in 1991, should have decided to pursue another career. Of the 18 members of the PLO executive committee, its highest policy-making body, a maximum of 10 now attend meetings. Palestinian intellectuals, writers and journalists have unleashed a chorus of protest against their leader: 'You cannot change an elephant into a lion by sending it a letter,' roared Professor Edward Said recently. 'Yet what we have is an intolerable mess: it cannot be allowed to continue.' Unless Palestinians faced up to the leadership crisis they could be resigned 'to a life of permanent oppression, without land, without a voice in shaping the future, without hope, even with pride, as the leadership stumbles from incoherence to incompetence'. While Prof Said, a leading member of the Palestinian American community, has adopted a scatter-gun approach to Mr Arafat's failings, other critics have been more selective, if no less damning. Some, including radical Palestinian groups based in Damascus, believe the September 13 agreement represents total capitulation to Israel. For them it is a betrayal of everything Palestinians have ever fought for, and yesterday they again demanded a return to armed struggle. Others, such as Dr Shafi, dislike the agreement, but would like to see if it can be improved. Still more say they fear Mr Arafat is incapable of sharing power, will not delegate, and ultimately will frustrate Palestinian ambitions for an open, democratic system of self-government following Israel's military withdrawal or redeployment in the West Bank and Gaza. In short, he will be like most other Arab leaders. Since September 13, Mr Arafat has had little ammunition with which to fire back. Today he may have even less. The Israelis did not begin to withdraw troops from Gaza and the West Bank enclave of Jericho as scheduled on December 13, and Mr Rabin said earlier this week that it could be at least another month before the pull-back begins. Support among Palestinians for the peace process had declined sharply even before yesterday's events. That, too, is Mr Arafat's fault, according not just to Mr Rabin, but also to the group of Palestinians around Abu Mazen (proper name Mahmoud Abbas) who masterminded the negotiations in Norway. The Abu Mazen group ('We are known here as the Jewish agency,' he said recently with a smile) believes Mr Arafat has wasted valuable time by trying to insert into the Washington accord more symbols of a nascent state. Abu Mazen has concluded that, because agreement is almost impossible on many long-term theoretical issues, such as a future state or the status of Jerusalem, the Palestinians should take whatever they can on the ground and work from there. A senior western diplomat in Tunis in regular contact with the PLO agrees, but argues that the delays are not solely Mr Arafat's responsibility. 'There is no doubt that, to answer all the criticism, Arafat has been trying in every way he can to show that an independent Palestinian state remains his eventual goal. But at the same time he is up against Rabin, who will not play a card unless he is assured of winning the trick. The Israelis want peace, but only on terms set by them, and Arafat is coming to realise what that means.' Mr Arafat's frustration shows through with frequent references to his determination to prevent the creation of a Palestinian bantustan - an entity with the outward symbols of statehood but none of the powers. 'The Israelis are tough, unbelievably tough,' he said recently. 'They make everything into a security issue, even small things which should be dealt with in just two lines. We need to reach agreements. We have to get back the momentum, because the whole process is losing support.' Abu Mazen believed, at least until yesterday, that the momentum and the support for Mr Arafat could be won back the moment the PLO leader took his first step on to Palestinian territory. 'There will be one million, maybe two millions there to greet him. Israeli Arabs will be there and Jews from the Meretz party and the Peace Now movement. It will be a bigger event than the September 13 signing. All the support will come back to Arafat, but he must get there as soon as possible,' he said. After yesterday it might appear less likely that Mr Arafat will be heading soon to the occupied territories. But much will depend on how the Palestinian leader reacts to the Hebron massacre. And that, in turn, may rest with Mr Rabin. Reports from Israel yesterday suggested that among many people there was a surge of shame and grief over what had occurred. For those most actively involved in seeking the implementation of the Washington accord, the killings were a tragic reminder of the need for speed and a swift withdrawal of Israeli troops from Palestinian centres of population, such as Hebron. The massacre further underlined the explosive potential of the Jewish settlements spread throughout the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan Heights. If those factors contribute to a more flexible and generous Israeli approach to negotiations with the PLO, Mr Arafat and the September 13 agreement could survive in better shape than seems possible today. Close aides of Mr Arafat and western diplomats in Tunis equally have no doubt that he could walk away from the agreement, should he conclude that Palestinian national rights could not be secured under the present deal, or that too large a part of popular opinion was turning against him. 'Yassir Arafat is the only truly national leader we have,' a close aide said recently. 'There is no one else, despite all the criticism. Only he had the courage and the stature to sign the September 13 agreement. No one else could have got away with it. He also can break the agreement, if that is what is necessary, knowing how appalling the consequences will be, not just for the Palestinian people, but for Israel, and the rest of the Middle East.'</p>

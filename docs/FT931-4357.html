			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Lucas seeks top successors LUCAS INDUSTRIES yesterday moved to sort out the succession problem which has made the UK engineering group one of the City's prime targets for takeover speculation. The Midlands-based car and aerospace components group, said it would appoint a new chief executive as soon as possible and hoped a new non-executive chairman would be nominated to take over from Sir Anthony Gill, the 62-year-old chairman and chief executive, by the time of November's annual general meeting. Lucas also announced the appointment of three non-executive directors - Mr Richard Giordano, 58, former chairman and chief executive of BOC; Sir Alistair Morton, 55, chief executive of Eurotunnel; and Mr Paul Bosonnet, 60, deputy chairman of BT. Mr Giordano will take over the chairmanship of the board's nominations committee, which is considering a shortlist for the post of chief executive. This suggests he is the leading candidate to take over from Sir Anthony, who had agreed in October that he would stay on for another two years as chairman. Lucas said yesterday that the search for a new chairman and a chief executive this year was designed to reassure the City, which was concerned by recent botched succession plans. In February last year, Mr Tony Edwards, head of the aerospace division, was made chief executive designate. In March Mr David Hankinson, then finance director who had been considered for the top job, left with compensation of Pounds 352,000. In August Mr Edwards was told the board did not consider him to be suitable for the post as chief executive, and in October he moved to rival TI Group. Sir Anthony denied then any reluctance to hand over the reins and the group yesterday insisted that his departure was not being brought forward because of concerns that he might clash with a new chief executive. The new board appointments will replace Sir Colin Southgate, Thorn EMI chairman, and Mr Philippe Souviron, chairman of Bankers Trust (France). Lucas shares touched a five-year low of 78p in September, valuing the group at Pounds 550m. Lucas reported a fall in annual pre-tax profits from Pounds 82.8m to Pounds 22.5m in October but the shares have since recovered to 142p, fuelled partly by takeover speculation.</p>

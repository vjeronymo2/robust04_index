			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Government to test Pounds 1.5bn of services against market CENTRAL government activities ranging from running the national lottery to providing the Department of the Environment with economists could be contracted out to the private sector under plans announced yesterday by Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister. This marks a fundamental shift in Whitehall's approach to the range and scale of activities considered for contracting out. Publishing a white paper on the Citizen's Charter initiative, Mr Waldegrave said some Pounds 1.5bn of services - about 10 per cent of central government running costs - would be tested against the market in the coming year. Previous market-testing moves have resulted in an average 25 per cent saving. Catering, information technology and internal audit could also be contracted out. Mr Waldegrave emphasised the importance he attached to carrying out opinion polls to discover people's views on public services. From early next year, polls are expected every six months. Another novel element in the white paper is the establishment of a 'complaints task force'. It will advise on improving public access to complaints procedures, and consider how methods of redress might be simplified. In effect, it replaces earlier plans for panels of lay adjudicators to offer arbitration services. Mr Waldegrave said about 90 per cent of the targets set in the original July 1991 charter had been met or were 'in train'. The most prominent failures to meet standards came from British Rail. While Mr Waldegrave promised further charters, including ones covering patients' dealings with their doctors, and for further and higher education, he made it clear the emphasis would shift towards upgrading standards. The much-delayed Courts Charter, guaranteeing national standards of service and facilities for court users such as jurors or victims in England and Wales, finally appeared yesterday. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow public services minister, said the basic idea of the Citizen's Charter was good, but she was sharply critical of the 'farce and hype' surrounding the white paper. The Consumers' Association noted signs of improvements for consumers since the original charter was launched, but standards had to be 'set and judged by citizen-consumers themselves, not the government and service providers'.

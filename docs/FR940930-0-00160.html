			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA today codifies the exemption from tampering liability for conversion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline or diesel-fueled vehicles to clean fuel vehicles if the converted vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply with the applicable clean fuel vehicle standards and the conversions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed in compliance with EPA's conversion regulations being promulgated today. Section 247(e) states that such conversions shall not be considered as violations of the tampering prohibition in Section 203(a)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since conversions involve changes to vehicles/engines that have previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been certified as meeting applicable emission standards, conversions are typically subject to the tampering prohibitions of CAA section 203(a)(3), which prohibit tampering with emission control devices. The initial guidelines established by EPA regarding the enforcement of tampering prohibitions are contained in the two documents entitled ``Mobile Source Enforcement Memorandum No. 1A'', dated June 25, 1974, and ``Fact Sheet: Conversion of Vehicles and Engines to Operate on Natural Gas or Propane'', dated November 1, 1991. In the 1990 amendments to the CAA, section 203 was amended to limit the scope of the tampering provisions of section 203(a)(3). As amended, an exemption to the tampering provisions of section 203(a)(3) is provided where a conventional vehicle is converted ``*&blank;*&blank;* for use of a clean alternative fuel and if such vehicle continues to comply with section 202 standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when operating on the alternative fuel *&blank;*&blank;* and if in the case of a clean alternative fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle (as defined by the Administrator), the device or element is replaced upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completion of the conversion procedure and such action results in proper functioning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the device or element when the motor vehicle operates on a conventional fuel.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the general exemption for clean fuel conversion from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tampering prohibitions, section 247(d) creates a special exemption for conversions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed pursuant to EPA's regulations issued under section 247. Thus, if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversion is performed in compliance with the regulations issued today, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversion will not violate the tampering prohibition of section 203(a)(3). For any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversions that are not performed in compliance with today's regulations (e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installation of a not-certified conversion configuration), liability for tampering will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined based on section 203(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Issues related to the conversion of vehicles to alternative fuel use are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed in the NPRM and FRM on gaseous-fueled emission standards, (FRM: published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on September 21, 1994), hereafter referred to as the Gaseous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fuels Rule. The conversion provisions in the Gaseous Fuels Rule apply to all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversions regardless of fuel type and hence form the basis for the certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures established in today's rule for vehicles converted to CFVs except where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> superseded by the requirements of today's rule. The Gaseous Fuels Rule provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a vehicle conversion will not be considered tampering if the vehicle has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> converted to a configuration which has been certified by EPA as meeting applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standards. For vehicles converted to use fuels for which no standards exist,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the provisions of Memorandum 1A apply, and EPA will not consider a modification to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified emission control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> configuration to be tampering if the emissions from the vehicle are not increased as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of the modification. Consistent with the Gaseous Fuels Rule, today's rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides that in order to be considered clean fuel vehicles, conversion configurations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of vehicles/engines must include all of the hardware necessary to allow a vehicle to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operate on a fuel other than the fuel for which the vehicle or engine was originally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Requirements for Clean Fuel Fleet Vehicle Conversions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 247(b) of the CAA directs EPA to promulgate regulations governing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversions of conventional vehicles to CFVs that ``*&blank;*&blank;* will ensure that a converted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle will comply with the standards applicable under this part to clean-fuel vehicles.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the conversion provisions in the Gaseous Fuels Rule will require that emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from converted vehicles meet the applicable emission standards whenever  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers certify conversion configurations, those provisions are not intended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fulfill all of the requirements of section 247 of the CAA. Therefore, in addition to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general guidelines for converted vehicles discussed in the section above and in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gaseous Fuels rule, today's rule establishes that certification must be obtained from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA before a converted vehicle can be sold to the public as a clean fuel fleet vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following sections describe the regulations which are promulgated by today's rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to satisfy the requirement of section 243(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

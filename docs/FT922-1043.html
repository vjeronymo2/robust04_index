			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: German issues fall on disappointing money supply data GERMAN government bonds fell steeply following the release of worse-than-expected German money supply figures which dashed hopes of an easing in German interest rates by the end of the year. The M3 money supply rose 9 per cent in May on an annualised basis, up on April's figure of 8.9 per cent and well above the market's expected range of 8.5 to 8.8 per cent. The latest figures were seen as very disappointing, killing hopes of a slowdown in German money supply growth. The Bundesbank's stated target range for M3 growth is 3.5 to 5.5 per cent. The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 88.01, plunged to a low of 87.63 on the news, before picking up to trade at around 87.67 by late afternoon. The German money supply figures also took their toll on some of the other European bond markets, pushing down Dutch and French government debt prices. Dealers said the fall in French government bonds was accentuated by reports that the French referendum on ratifying the Maastricht Treaty could be brought forward from September to July. On the Matif futures exchange in Paris, the September bond futures contract closed at 107.06, down 0.16 from Monday's close. The futures contract fell from its high of 107.34 to reach a low of 106.82 after the release of the German money supply data. UK government bond prices fell as the release of worse-than-expected German money supply figures led to concern that German interest rates were likely to remain high for some time and thereby reduce the chances of an easing of UK interest rates. Supply concerns also continued to trouble the gilt market before today's auction, when the Bank of England plans to sell Pounds 2.75bn of the 9 per cent Treasury stock due 2012. Trading in the futures market was reasonably active, with a volume of 35,000 contracts. The Liffe gilt futures contract opened at 97.21 and slipped to 97.14 by late afternoon. In the cash market, long-dated issues fell more than a quarter of a point with the benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 falling from 115 15/16 to 115 19/32 , yielding 9.39 per cent. US Treasury prices were little changed yesterday after the big afternoon auction of two-year notes. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/32 at 101 25/32 , yielding 7.838 per cent. There was a similar slight negative bias at the short end of the market, where the two-year note was down  1/32 at 100 7/32 , to carry a yield of 4.986 per cent. Trading in the morning session was dominated by the manoeuvrings of dealers before the sale of Dollars 15bn in two-year notes. Demand for the new paper was not expected to be strong, which depressed prices at the short end. Some traders had noted that two-year prices had been artificially buoyed in recent days by expectations that stock markets worldwide were heading for a substantial correction and the subsequent modest recovery in Tokyo and New York equity markets meant the two-year auction might be beset by weak demand. The sale of the two-year notes, however, passed with little fuss, averaging a yield of 5.11 per cent amid solid retail demand. JAPANESE government bonds drifted lower ahead of today's auction of 10-year government debt, but traders said the market was well-supported by hopes of an easing in interest rates. The benchmark No 129 issue opened with a yield of 5.37 per cent and ended the day at 5.385 per cent, while the September futures contract fell from its opening of 102.46 to close at 102.38. Dealers expect the finance ministry will auction about Y800bn of 10-year bonds today. The bonds issued at last month's auction carried a coupon of 5.6 per cent.</p>

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Marketplace law and justice for all: On Tuesday, the FT starts weekly coverage of the European Court of Justice When the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled in 1990 that a British Act of Parliament could be suspended until the question of its compatibility with European Community law had been tested, it brought home to the British people the supremacy of EC law over English law. That case - which involved a challenge by Spanish fishermen to the UK government's attempts to prevent them fishing in British waters - made clear to everybody what Lord Denning, the former Master of the Rolls, recognised in 1974, that 'the Treaty (of Rome) is like an incoming tide. It flows into the estuaries and up the rivers. It cannot be held back.' That EC law takes precedence over national law has long been apparent, but what has been less appreciated is the crucial role that the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has played in shaping the rules and regulations which govern the Community and the wider European marketplace. The task of interpreting this growing body of law falls to the ECJ and its sister court, the Court of First Instance. Brussels looks to the ECJ to ensure the even-handed implementation by EC states of internal market legislation. Member states, individuals and companies look to it to check the growing power of Brussels, to review the legality of acts and decisions of the European Commission and the Council of Ministers, and to goad them into action where they have neglected their obligations under the Rome Treaty. The Court's role is central to the Community's well-being. And yet it remains the quiet man of the Community's institutions. Europeans still confuse it regularly with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and the International Court of Justice in The Hague. In the 1960s and early 1970s it was widely seen as the only Community institution which functioned efficiently. In a creative period spanning 15 years, during which the fundamental principles of the direct effect of Community law and its primacy over the national laws of the member states were established, the Court was willing to, and did fill, the vacuum created by the inaction of the Commission and the Council. Since the end of the 1970s the activist, primarily because it recognises that the other Community institutions are now operating more effectively. But its role in shaping and interpreting EC law has not diminished. Lord Slynn, Britain's judge in Luxembourg until March this year, wrote recently of the important developments made by the ECJ over the past decade. On the procedural level, he said it had: developed its jurisprudence to cover the European Parliament; ruled that national courts have an obligation to give effective remedies to complainants under Community law no less favourable than those available under national law; recognised in the landmark Francovich case last year that there is a right to compensation for EC citizens injured by a member state's failure to give effect to Community law obligations; and ruled that administrative agencies as well as courts must give precedence to Community law. There had also been fundamental developments in substantive law, Lord Slynn said. The ECJ had made great strides towards the elimination of sex discrimination in the employment and pension fields. In the 1990 Barber case the Court ruled that men and women should receive equal pensions as well as equal pay for equal work, and that individuals have an enforceable right to non-discriminatory benefits even though national legislation may exempt pension schemes from the equal pay laws. The Court had also rooted out discrimination on the grounds of nationality so far as students and workers are concerned; and developed rules relating to competition. The ECJ's impact on the day-to-day operations of companies doing business in Europe has been no less important. The opportunities offered to business by European integration are immense. But to take full advantage of a wider European market characterised by the European Economic Area, and closer trading links with the countries of eastern Europe, companies need to understand the rules and regulations of the marketplace. This week, to reflect the vital role the Court will play in creating a framework for business in the single European market, the FT is launching a weekly column covering developments in Luxembourg. This year alone, in just three areas - competition, state aid to industry and anti-dumping laws - the ECJ and the Court of First Instance (CFI) have handed down a number of important decisions affecting business. In cases involving 14 PVC manufacturers, the CFI found that the procedure followed by the Commission in deciding to fine the companies for operating an alleged cartel bore so little resemblance to the requirements of its own procedural rules that it should be treated as never having been made. The Court's criticisms were so far-reaching that they could result in many other decisions taken by the Commission over the past 35 years also being treated as invalid. The judgment opened up the possibility of several appeals,particularly by companies fined in the past for breach of EC competition rules. In the state aid field, the short-cut procedure adopted by the Commission in investigating the allegation of an illegal state payment by the British government to British Aeropsace when it bought the Rover car group gave the ECJ the chance to set out the proper procedures to be followed by the Commission in such matters. The Court ruled that the failure of the Commission to take evidence from Rover and BAe had deprived both of their right to be heard. It set aside the Commission's decision to order BAe to repay Pounds 33m to the UK government. The new column, to be written by the barristers of Brick Court Chambers, Brussels, will appear every Tuesday when the European Court is sitting. The FT is making this commitment to coverage of the ECJ because it recognises the increasing importance of EC law. As Ferdinand Mount says in his book, The British Constitution Now, the Spanish fishermen's case reinforced 'the dawning awareness that the European courts, gradually, informally, but ineluctably, are themselves coming to make up a loose-knit sort of supreme court for us.'</p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSTON FIRM STUNS HOLDERS, GOES ON BLOCK;  </P> <P> INSURANCE: AMERICAN GENERAL, THE NATION'S FOURTH-LARGEST INSURER, ACTED TO FOIL  TORCHMARK'S LOWER OFFER. BIDDING MAY REACH $7 BILLION.  </P> <P> American General Corp. stunned shareholders and one suitor Wednesday by putting  itself up for sale, in an auction expected to fetch $7 billion for the nation's  fourth-largest insurance company.  </P> <P> The company's stock price jumped sharply higher after the announcement at  American General's annual shareholders meeting, where the anticipated event had  been a showdown with hostile suitor Torchmark Corp.  </P> <P> Harold S. Hook, American General's chairman, said the company decided to put  itself up for auction because it was vulnerable to a possible takeover at a  discount price and wanted to realize the maximum value for its stockholders.  </P> <P> American General stock finished up $7.50 at $47.625 a share as the most  actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> Company officials and analysts said they expected the bidding for American  General to reach about $7 billion, or more than $55 per share.  </P> <P> Birmingham, Ala.-based Torchmark had made an unsolicited $6.34-billion, or $50  per share, cash and stock buyout offer for American General in March. But  Torchmark later withdrew the offer, opting instead to wage a proxy fight to  elect its own five nominees to the 15-member board.  </P> <P> Since then each company has been vigorously urging shareholders to support its  board nominees.  </P></p>

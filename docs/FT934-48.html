			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Buckingham Pounds 6m disposal Buckingham International, the property, hotels and nursing group which announced interim pre-tax losses of Pounds 62.5m and a breach of banking covenants in September, is to raise Pounds 6.4m with the sale of its nursing homes division. The division, which is being sold to Unicare, a private nursing homes operator, produced profits before interest of Pounds 1.1m for the year ended November 1. The business has a book value of Pounds 6.7m. The group also announced that the first in its planned disposals to reduce debt of Pounds 95.5m had been delayed. The sale of its Portuguese hotels subsidiary which owns and operates the Holiday Inn in Lisbon, failed to meet its December 29 deadline. The company said the buyer was still keen, but more time was needed to negotiate with holders of Buckingham International's loan stock 1995, part of the security for which is the Lisbon Holiday Inn. The deadline to complete the sale of Morlaix de Portugal Investimentos Hoteleiros e Turisticos had been extended to February 28.</p>

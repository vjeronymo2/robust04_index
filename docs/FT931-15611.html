			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Leading Article: A last task for Mr Bush JUST AS the Gatt's Uruguay round had been given up for dead, US and European Community trade negotiators have rushed to Geneva in a last effort to bring the six years of negotiation to a conclusion. They are right to do so. Mr Bush, in particular, has nothing to lose by pushing them hard in his remaining week in office. He would, on the contrary, be doing a favour to his own reputation, to his successor, to his country and to the world. It is not that a completed Uruguay round would resolve the world's trading problems, nor even that any deal reached in the US president's remaining days could ensure success for the round. But without such a deal, failure would seem certain. If nothing has been decided by January 20, when Mr Clinton takes over, the conflicting priorities of his administration, combined with the looming expiry of the 'fast track' authority, are likely to make agreement too difficult and, above all, too late. First evidence of a last push came when the EC commissioner newly responsible for trade policy secretly met Mrs Carla Hills, his US counterpart, outside London on January 2. They agreed that time was too short to continue pressing for a complete Uruguay round package, and decided to focus, instead, on more limited objectives. A substantial US-EC agreement on market access - that is, on lower tariffs on manufactured goods - was to be the focal point of these negotiations. The US wants the EC to join in abolishing a number of tariffs altogether. The sectors proposed are pharmaceuticals, non-ferrous metals, wood and paper products, and - most controversially - electronics, where EC anxieties about Japanese exports remain high. For its part, the EC wants the US to tackle its tariff peaks. These include glass and ceramics, but the most sensitive is textiles, where some US duties approach 40 per cent. The EC's case is strong. Lowering high tariffs is economically far more important than reducing low ones. Negotiators talked yesterday of 'exceedingly difficult' talks. But these are at least within traditional areas of Gatt activity. Negotiators must also remember what is at stake. Success will recreate momentum. Failure would risk all that has been achieved in six weary years, including the package of farm subsidy cuts agreed in Washington a month ago, which narrowly averted an international trade war. Market access negotiations between the US and the EC would not be the end of the story. Other countries must participate and other areas of the negotiation need to be resolved. Japan and Korea should, for example, open their markets to rice imports. The round is now on borrowed time. An outline agreement on most issues needs to be on the table when President Clinton takes over. If he vetoes it, so be it. But at least the round would not have perished by default.</p>

			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Companies are told of franchise pitfalls COMPANIES that consider franchising their activities should not underestimate the resources needed to establish a franchise network, according to a report published today by the City University Business School. Franchising does not provide a cheap or easy means of expansion and companies that undertake it should be wary of setting unrealistic goals, the survey of companies with franchise networks discloses. It was compiled by the business school's NatWest Centre for Franchise Research Three of the companies surveyed had developed franchising businesses relatively easily, four had faced teething troubles and five had experienced significant difficulties. Franchising involves one company, the franchisor, providing the use of its brand name and operating methods to other businesses - franchisees  - usually in return for a down-payment and a proportion of turnover. Britain's 18,600 franchised outlets made sales worth Pounds 4.8bn in the 12 months to June last year, according to the British Franchise Association. The franchisors interviewed emphasised the importance of being able to support their franchised concerns by having company-owned outlets in which to train franchisees and to monitor and develop their businesses. The need to train those awarded franchises to a high standard was also emphasised. Companies awarding franchises must be prepared to make changes in their business to accommodate franchised outlets and to educate staff about franchising, they said. Selecting franchisees was the most frequently mentioned difficulty. Poor choices had shown no interest in the business or refused to follow the awarding company's methods. Others had committed frauds or lacked ability to run the business. Large Firms and Franchising. City University Business School. 071-920 0111. Pounds 25.</p>

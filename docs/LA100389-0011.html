			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSIAN GULF HAS THE WEST BY THE JUGULAR NO LONGER  </P> <P> The general public should be forgiven for not giving much thought these days to  President Jimmy Carter's statement in his 1980 State of the Union address,  popularly labeled the "Carter Doctrine":  </P> <P> "Any attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region  will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States and  such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including military  force."  </P> <P> The Iran-Iraq war is over, the Ayatollah Khomeini is dead, the Organization of  Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has long lost its sting and the Soviets  have withdrawn from Afghanistan and show no sign, if they ever did, of making a  grab for Iranian or Saudi oil fields.  </P> <P> Yet the doctrine lives on, with a whole industry of scholars, soldiers and  policy-makers supporting it, doctored into longevity by Ronald Reagan's sharp  buildup of American naval and air power. And President Bush's propensity to let  sleeping dogs lie keep's the doctrine's life-spirit intact.  </P> <P> Public opinion has already absorbed the more benign atmosphere, but top  policy-makers appear to be failing to acknowledge not just the changed Soviet  attitude but the equally profound changes in the power of the oil industry and  of Islamic fundamentalism. This is extraordinarily intellectually silly, not to  say costly to the taxpayer.  </P> <P> The policy-makers need to be confronted with a few hard facts:  </P> <P> The Persian Gulf, and in particular the infamous Strait of Hormuz, the narrow  waterway that is its entrance, is no longer the "jugular" of the Western  economies. The rapid construction of overland pipelines is reducing its  importance by the day. Besides, as the Iran-Iraq war revealed, it was not  feasible to block the strait by sinking ships in its entrance. Its waters run  too deep and its currents are too strong. Moreover, the war showed that large  modern-day tankers are not especially vulnerable targets. Their very size makes  them difficult to sink and crude oil is not particularly flammable. It's  nothing more than a myth that shipping got through during the war because of  the presence of American, British, French and Dutch naval forces. Attacks on  shipping actually increased by 60% in the year following the beginning of naval  patrols.  </P> <P> The oil market has totally changed since the huge price rises of 1973 and '79.  Indeed, so slack is the market that the Iran-Iraq war made no notable impact on  oil prices, even though insurance rates rose sharply for ships transiting the  Gulf.  </P> <P> OPEC no longer has the power to play on Western fears about oil prices. And  nothing in its achievements suggests it ever should have been otherwise. The  price hikes of '73 and '79 certainly happened, but we now know they were  accelerated and exaggerated by a speculative panic concerning future supplies.  The OPEC countries themselves have learned that they are as much the losers  when they help push the Western economies into recession.  </P> <P> Certain oil gurus earned large consulting fees predicting that oil prices were  unlikely to come down and that the dependence on Persian Gulf oil would  continue indefinitely. In fact, in real terms, oil prices are not much  different from what they were before the price rises, and by 1985 dependence on  the Gulf nations' oil could not have been more different than it was in 1980.  The United States was down from 30% to 7% of all oil imports, Western Europe  from 60% to 35% and Japan from 70% to 59%.  </P> <P> Conservation, more technologically proficient extraction policies, new  discoveries and the substitution of other energy sources were the successful  legacy of the price antics of '73 and '79.  </P> <P> The third leg of the oil threat has been the long-held belief that Moscow has a  greedy strategic eye on the oil-producing states. The invasion of Afghanistan  rang the alarm bells, convincing many that it was the first step in a long-term  Soviet drive to the Gulf.  </P> <P> But as Prof. Robert Johnson argues in a long and thoughtful analysis in the  current issue of Harvard's International Security, this is simply not true.  "The Soviets must assume the Iranians would resist any military advance. And  they've been reminded in Afghanistan that local forces operating in mountainous  terrain can put up a very considerable resistance."  </P> <P> Some argue that the Soviets could take power through "invitations" from local  regimes. Yet experience has shown that radical regimes in the Middle East  usually repress local Communist parties, are highly nationalistic and may be  Islamic-fundamentalist.  </P> <P> Even before perestroika, it was never very clear why the Soviets would want to  take these kinds of risks. In the late 1970s, the CIA argued that Soviet oil  production was about to go into rapid decline and the Soviets would have to  look elsewhere for oil. The decline has not happened, and the Soviet Union  remains the world's largest oil producer.  </P> <P> The final argument for Western worriers has been the view that Iranian  fundamentalism might come to dominate a significant part of the Gulf. But if  Iran failed with Iraq, which has the Arab world's largest Shiite community and  therefore the one most sensitive to Khomeini's brand of Islamic fervor, the  chance of success elsewhere is, to say the least, unlikely.  </P> <P> The Carter Doctrine was born of anxiety and hyped by panic. Calmer times now  suggest that it be quietly buried -- the deeper into the Arabian sands the  better.  </P></p>

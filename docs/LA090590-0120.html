			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: MEETING CHALLENGES -- AND WINNING;  </P> <P> HONORS: PAMELA POLAGI, WHO IS BLIND, HAS BEEN NOMINATED FOR A CIVIC AWARD IN  RECOGNITION OF HER DETERMINATION IN OVERCOMING OBSTACLES.  </P> <P> Pamela Polagi does not give up easily.  </P> <P> When Seffi, her German shepherd and companion for the past nine years,  developed back problems, Polagi overruled the vets.  </P> <P> "The doctors wanted to put her to sleep, but I said no," she said. "Just  because she could not be of service as a working dog, I still didn't want to  give her up as a companion. She still had the will to live, and still followed  me around."  </P> <P> Polagi, who is blind, has brought the same attitude to her work as an insurance  claims representative at the Automobile Club of Southern California office in  Arcadia.  </P> <P> Even though she was reeling from the recent deaths of her parents, Polagi in  1980 mastered a complicated computer system for the blind while the rest of her  colleagues were still using typewriters.  </P> <P> Then, four years ago, the insurance claims department shifted all its records  to computers, and Polagi had to learn to use equipment compatible with other  employees'.  </P> <P> In July, a co-worker nominated Polagi for the eighth annual "Mainstream  Milestones" awards sponsored by the Los Angeles Junior Chamber of Commerce. The  event was established to honor disabled adults in a business or professional  occupation, said Catherine Lepone, co-project leader for the awards. Winners  will be announced in November.  </P> <P> Sally Brake, assistant manager of the Automobile Club's Los Angeles district  office, said she nominated Polagi because of her determination.  </P> <P> "She succeeded in her challenges, and I admire people that do that," Brake  said.  </P> <P> Polagi, a 37-year-old Temple City resident, has worked for the Automobile Club  for 17 years. In 1973, she took a two-week job-training program at the Braille  Institute in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "I told them I wanted to work with people. Back then, blind people usually were  placed in a job taking dictation. I didn't want that."  </P> <P> The institute paid her a token $100 a month for her work as a receptionist in  the sales department of the Automobile Club's Pasadena office. After seven  years, Polagi said, she was ready for more responsibility.  </P> <P> She uses an IBM personal computer that scans accident and injury forms. A voice  synthesizer attached to the computer tells Polagi which questions to ask  customers. She types the information into the computer, and can print it out on  a specially constructed Braille printer.  </P> <P> In her spare time, Polagi and her twin sister, who is also blind, sing at  weddings for friends.  </P> <P> "I get by," she said. "I don't think I'm great. I've never gotten over stage  fright. I still have to convince my knees to stop shaking."  </P></p>

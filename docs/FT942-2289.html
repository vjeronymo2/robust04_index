			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up STRATEGY Having caught the top of the emerging market bubble before the storm broke at the start of the year, reducing allocations in, for example, Hong Kong, Thailand, Turkey and Poland, Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets now believes that the time is right to move back in. Mr Arnab Banerji, F &amp; C's chief investment officer, notes that the downturn in performance experienced this year has left exceptional scope for outperformance henceforward. He remains bearish on Hong Kong, favouring South Korea and Taiwan. In Latin America Argentina and Peru feature, while he is neutral on Brazil for the time being. Elsewhere, F &amp; C favour Portugal, and have slightly increased allocations in South Africa and Zimbabwe. CAIRO An acceleration of the country's privatisation programme is planned, with the sale of assets worth up to EPounds 3.2bn between now and the end of the year, Reuter reports. Mr Atef Obeid, the Public Sector minister, said the reform programme now had its own momentum and slowing down was out of the question. He said the government had exceeded its privatisation targets for the period up to March 1994, selling assets worth EPounds 3.5bn and offering for sale assets worth EPounds 6.2b. JAKARTA Indonesia's total foreign investment approvals reached Dollars 5.1bn in the first five months of 1994 and should exceed Dollars 10bn for the full year, the Antara news agency said. HARARE Zimbabwe has said that it intends to speed up the privatisation of those state-owned companies which are a drain on the economy. Last month the government said that it would commercialise the operations of the Dairy Marketing Board, the Cold Storage Commission and the Cotton Marketing Board.

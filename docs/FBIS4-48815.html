			<p>BFN     [Text] President Nelson Mandela has repeated his offer to  minority parties to include their members in public service and  diplomatic posts. Mr. Mandela first made the offer in his  election victory speech. During talks in Cape Town with PAC  [Pan-Africanist Congress] President Clarence Makwetu he asked  for the names of PAC officials who could fill government posts.  Members of the NP [National Party], the IFP [Inkatha Freedom  Party] and the DP [Democratic Party] are also being considered  for government posts. Earlier it was announced that 6,000 APLA  [Azanian People's Liberation Army] members were to be included  in the SANDF [South African National Defense Force], although  the PAC had ignored the deadline for inclusion.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Those applicants described in Part V (1) of the Preferential Hierarchy For Determining Designations will be designated on a noncompetitive basis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> if <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  all preaward clearances, responsibility reviews, and regulatory requirements are met. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) All applicants described in Part V, (2), (3), and (4) of the Preferential Hierarchy For Determining Designations will be  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> considered on a competitive basis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for such areas, unless a waiver is granted, and only information submitted with the Notice of Intent, as well as preaward clearances, responsibility reviews, and all regulatory requirements will be considered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Special employment and training services for Indian and Native American people have been provided through an established service delivery network for the past 18 years under the authority of JTPA section 401 and its predecessor, section 302 of the repealed Comprehensive employment and Training Act (CETA). The DOL intends to exercise its designation authority to preserve the continuity of such services and to prevent the undue fragmentation of existing geographic service areas. Consistent with the present regulations and other provisions of this notice, this will include preference for those Native American organizations with an existing capability to deliver employment and training services within an established geographic service area. Such preference will be determined through input and recommendations from the Chief of DOL's Division of Indian and Native American Programs (DINAP) and the Director of DOL's Office of Special Targeted Programs (OSTP), and through the use of the rating system described in this Notice. Unless a non-incumbent applicant in the same preferential hierarchy as an incumbent applicant grantee can demonstrate that it is significantly superior overall to the incumbent, the incumbent will be designated, if it otherwise meets all of the requirements for redesignation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) In preparing application for designation, applicants should bear in mind that the purpose of JTPA, as amended, is ``to establish programs to prepare youth and adults facing serious barriers to employment for participation in the labor force by providing job training and other services that will result in increased employment and earnings, increased education and occupational skills, and decreased welfare dependency, thereby improving the quality of the work force and enhancing the productivity and competitiveness of the Nation.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Waiver Provision <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the JTPA Amendments of 1992, section 401(1) (designation to receive a 2-year grant) states: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The competition for grants under this section shall be conducted every 2 years, except that if a recipient of such a grant has performed satisfactorily under the terms of the existing grant agreement, the Secretary may waive the requirement for such competition on receipt from the recipient of a satisfactory 2-year program plan for the succeeding 2-year grant period. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is implementing this waiver provision for the next two-year designation period (PY 1995&hyph;96). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All incumbent grantees who have performed ``satisfactorily'' both programmatically and administratively under their present grant may receive a waiver for the next two-year designation period. The responsibility review criteria at 20 CFR 632.11(d) of the current regulations serves as the baseline instrument to determine ``satisfactory'' performance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A waiver may be requested by submitting an Advance Notice of Intent (ANOI) by October 15, 1994. A list of grantees granted waivers will be published no later than November 15, 1994. Grantees, including tribes serving areas in addition to their reservations, NOT meeting the waiver requirements set forth in the above paragraph will be subject to the competitive process published in this solicitation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Incumbent grantees receiving a waiver will be required to submit only a Standard Form (SF) 424 ``Application for Federal Assistance'' for currently designated service area(s) by January 1, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nonincumbent applicants who qualify for Preferential Hierarchy Status 1 may apply by January 1, 1995 for and may be designated to serve their Hierarchy 1 service area(s). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tribes and organizations participating in the employment and training demonstration project under Pub. L. 102&hyph;477 qualify for waiver consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is an initial approach to the waiver process. It is subject to change in the future resulting from experience and the Department's desire to make the process equitable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Advance Notice of Intent <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the Advance Notice of Intent process is to provide section 401 applicants, prior to the submission of a final Notice of Intent, with information relative to potential competition. While DOL encourages the resolution of competitive request at the local level prior to final submission, the Advance Notice of Intent process also serves to alert those whose differences cannot be resolved of the need to submit a compete final Notice of Intent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the Advance Notice of Intent process is not mandated by the regulations, participation in the advance process by prospective section 401 applicants is strongly recommended. The Advance Notice of Intent process allows the applicant to identify potential incumbent and non-incumbent competitors, to resolve conflicts if possible and to prepare a final Notice of Intent with advance knowledge of potential competing requests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be emphasized, however, that the Advance Notice of Intent process does not ensure that all potential competitors have been identified. Some applicants may opt not to submit an Advance Notice of Intent; others may change geographic service area request in the final Notice of Intent. Therefore, as noted above, final submissions should be prepared with these possibilities in mind, unless a waiver has been granted. Although the regulations permit incumbents to submit no more than a Standard Form 424 ``Application for Federal Assistance'' (SF 424) for their existing geographic service areas, this choice may not be in the incumbent's best interests in the event of unanticipated competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BANE SEEKING REELECTION TO ASSEMBLY DESPITE  CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> State Assemblyman Tom Bane (D-Tarzana) said Thursday he plans to seek  reelection in 1990 to his ninth consecutive term, confident he can blunt the  political impact of a controversy over his administration of a medical  foundation.  </P> <P> The 76-year-old Bane, who chairs the powerful Assembly Rules Committee, rated  his reelection prospects as "very good." In his 1988 reelection race, he beat  Republican Bruce Dahl with nearly 73% of the vote.  </P> <P> But Bane acknowledged he "wasn't helped" politically by a months-long  controversy earlier this year over his operation of a national lupus foundation  and his wife's role as chairwoman of the state lupus appropriations board.  </P> <P> Last June, a coalition of lupus support groups asked the state attorney  general's office to investigate the state board's allocation of $800,000 to a  physician friend of the Banes, claiming the doctor improperly carried out state  lupus research contracts. The groups also asked that the assets of the National  Lupus Erythematous Foundation be frozen, saying the foundation was not  providing funding for lupus research or patient services.  </P> <P> However, state investigators in November concluded that money was not misspent  by the state lupus board. They also said funds had not been improperly spent by  the foundation, although they recommended it be disbanded due to inactivity.  </P> <P> To date, no other Democrat or Republican has announced plans to challenge Bane  next year.  </P> <P> Bane said he plans to mail copies of newspaper articles about the attorney  general's findings to all constituents who complained to him by phone or mail  after the controversy surfaced.  </P></p>

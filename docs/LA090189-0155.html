			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> RESCUE OF PYGMY WHALE ATTEMPTED  </P> <P> Scientists struggled today to revive a pygmy sperm whale that beached itself  near Monterey, the first of its kind rescued on the West Coast in 20 years.  </P> <P> Researchers from the Joseph M. Long Laboratory at UC Santa Cruz stayed up all  night caring for the 6-foot-long whale, found by swimmers at Pajaro Dunes on  Thursday.  </P> <P> Graham Worthy, a marine biologist and a whale expert at the lab, said the whale  has only a 1-in-10 chance of surviving. The young whale, believed to be 1 to 2  years old, suffers from "cookie-cutter" shark bites and long scratches, or  "rake marks," probably inflicted by an adult of its species.  </P></p>

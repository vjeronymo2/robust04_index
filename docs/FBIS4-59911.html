			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 18 May (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has  stated that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher briefed  him on all the events of the past two days in his talks with  officials in Syria and Israel. He affirmed the importance of  reaching an agreement between the two sides in this regard.    At the news conference he held together with the U.S.  secretary after their talks, which lasted 45 minutes, President  Husni Mubarak affirmed the importance of continuing the peace  process until they reach their conclusion and peace is  established in the whole region.    He said that we are working very hard together with the  Americans to resolve the complicated problems between Syria and  Israel with the objective of reaching a final solution.    President Husni Mubarak said that Syria and Israel are both  working for peace, but the problem between them needs some time  to be resolved.    On the situation in Yemen, President Mubarak said: I have  repeatedly warned against the use of force and pointed out that  force cannot resolve the problem. Since the beginning, I have  advised that the forces should be separated and that a dialogue  should be started. The Yemeni president did not accept this  advice and maintained that there can be no dialogue with these  people.    President Mubarak said that it is very difficult to predict  what will happen in Yemen.    On his part, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  said:  I have once again come to this country, which has exerted great  efforts, just as President Husni Mubarak has done his best, to  help the Palestinians and Israelis sign an agreement.    He added that Syria plays an important role in establishing  peace in the region and that Egypt is always ready to give all  the necessary help on all levels.    President Mubarak made a statement at the beginning of the  news conference in which he welcomed U.S. Secretary of State  Christopher. He said: Christopher told me about the efforts  that have been made in the talks between Syria and Israel,  "because it is very important that the two parties reach a peace  agreement as they realize their dire need for peace." He  stressed that the two sides want to continue their negotiations,  noting that this is the appropriate time to resolve the problem.  He said that the current developments in Gaza and Jericho were  discussed, adding: "I am personally following the situation  there. The morale of the citizens is very high, and the police  and people are happy because they wish to solve the problem.  They want to build their homeland after 27 years [of  occupation]." It is very important to continue the peace  process until the end so that peace may prevail in the entire  region. He said: We will work hard toward this goal along with  the United States to resolve this very complicated problem and  to reach a final agreement between the Syrians and Israelis.    Christopher then made a statement in which he thanked  President Mubarak. He said: I am happy to return to this land  and meet the man who contributed such a great deal toward the  signing of the agreement between the Palestinians and Israelis.  He said: When I was in Jericho yesterday, I was reminded of  President Mubarak and saw that dreams have come true. I also  remembered him when I saw that real progress has been made. He  said that he remembered President Mubarak because he contributed  a great deal toward this goal, stressing that Egypt is worthy of  utmost appreciation for the role it played in this respect.    Christopher said: Our feeling on the importance of achieving  peace in the region has been revived. We hope to build on what  has already been achieved in Gaza and Jericho. This is a sign  for the people of the region and we hope to build on what has  been achieved in Gaza and Jericho. This achievement is a sign  for the people in the region as to what peace can achieve.    Christopher said he spoke with President Mubarak about the  Syrian track, noting that President Mubarak is fully aware of  developments on this track. I told President Mubarak that we  have started down the road but it is still long, and Egypt wants  to help make progress on this track. He said: I am happy to  exchange views with President Mubarak who always receives his  guests warmly and always plays an effective role in establishing  peace in the region.    In response to a question on whether he received a message  from Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat regarding yesterday's  crisis, Christopher replied in the negative. He said: I  understand that contact took place between 'Arafat and Israeli  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in Oslo, but I have no details  about their discussions. Anyway, let me tell you that it is  important for 'Arafat to keep his commitments to the Washington  ceremony, putting an end to (?violence) and terrorism in the  region. He said: "I believe that it is important for him, in  his capacity as an important leader to whom the world looks up,  to realize the consequences of his deeds. I hope that this  situation will be cleared up and hope to receive a report on  this issue because the United States believes that compliance  with obligations is fundamental under the circumstances.    Answering a question on whether Syria and Israel are close  to reaching agreement based on what he has heard from Secretary  Christopher, or whether there still is a gap between them,  President Mubarak said: I can safely tell you that what I have  felt this time around is that the two parties are working for  peace. I have already said that it is a complicated problem  that needs time, but as long as the talks continue, there are  great hopes for peace.    On whether he received any messages or envoys from north  Yemen, President Mubarak said: I have not received any messages  from the Yemeni president about sending an envoy. However,  about four or five days ago, I asked him to send a special envoy  to Cairo, so he sent his foreign minister. I held extended  talks with him. I also stated publicly that the use of force is  not a form of unity, but a form of occupation because unity  needs the willingness of both sides to achieve it. [passage  omitted]    With regard to the stand of Egypt, the Arabs, and the United  States on the crisis in Yemen, President Mubarak affirmed that  it is difficult to predict what will happen in Yemen. He said:  All I can say is what I have said many times before, that  battles and war are an endless condition in Yemen. We have much  experience in the region. War will not resolve the problem, but  will cause more hatred, even after the war ends.    He added: I advised right from the beginning that the forces  should be separate, that the forces of the north should be  distanced from the forces of the south, and that dialogue should  start. But they did not accept this and now there is no other  way but a cease-fire to remove the forces from the battleground  so there can be a dialogue. The president of Yemen ha said that  there can be no dialogue with these people. I believe that this  will not go anywhere in the future. [passage omitted]    Answering a question posed to President Mubarak on the  message he would like to send to Syria after helping with the  achievements between the Palestinians and the Israelis,  President Mubarak said: I do not wish to compare the situation  of the Syrian track with that of the Palestinian track.  However, I can tell you that the Syrians want to resolve the  problem and find a comprehensive solution to it. There is no  basis for comparison between one case and the other.    On whether President Mubarak is ready to play a similar role  to the one he played in the Palestinian track, the president  said that they are ready to help if the situation requires their  help. He pointed out that the U.S. secretary of state held  discussions with the Syrian officials and exchanged viewpoints  with them, in addition to listening to various ideas. He is  trying to help the two sides.    The president said: When I meet with President al-Asad, I  will raise all these issues with the objective of making some  progress in that direction.    Christopher answered the same question, saying: We are at a  very early stage of this process. The issues presented before  the Syrian and the Israeli sides are very difficult, as are  their sub-issues. The road ahead is still very long and I do not  wish to make any predictions now on whether anything in  particular will happen in the near future.</p>

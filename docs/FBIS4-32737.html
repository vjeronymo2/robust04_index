			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ex-Yugoslavia/Italy: Martino in </F> Belgrade"]    [Excerpts] (ANSA) Belgrade, June 28 -- Italian Foreign  Minister Antonio Martino arrived in Belgrade today, greeted by  the head of diplomacy for the Yugoslav Federation (Serbia and  Montenegro) Vladislav Jovanovic.    With Jovanovic, Martino immediately went to meet the  president of the Serb Republic, Slobodan Milosevic. On the  calendar were talks with the Serb Bosnian leadership and in  particular with Foreign Minister Aleksa Buha.    Martino arrived here from Zagreb, the second stop of his  peace mission to the former Yugoslavia which kicked off in  Sarajevo Monday [27 June].    In the Bosnian capital, the Italian diplomatic chief met  with  Premier Haris Silajdzic, while in the Croatian capital he  conferred with President of the Republic, Franjo Tudjman.    The Serbian press was playing up the Martino mission and the  influential BORBA newspaper spoke of "Decisive Hours for Peace",  while the broad circulation POLITIKA today said on its front  page that it would be the upcoming G-7 summit to give new  impetus to peace and the paper underscored the optimism exuded  by the Italian foreign minister.    Martino is touring the Bosnian crisis area in preparation  for  the G-7 summit in Naples on July 8-10 at which Russia, seen as a  major player in attempts to solve the crisis, will be included  in the political part of the discussions.    Furthermore, reliable diplomatic sources in Belgrade said  today that Vitaliy Churkin, the special representative of  Russian President Boris Yeltsin for the handling of affairs in  the former Yugoslavia, would be arriving here on Wednesday [28  June]. [passage omitted]    In addition to Churkin, there were rumors that a special  envoy from United States President Bill Clinton would also be  arriving here Wednesday.    Charles Redman, handling matters pertaining to the former  Yugoslavia for the Clinton administration, and Churkin, might  well present to the Serbian and Bosnian Serbian leadership the  conclusions to be reached today in Paris by the Contact Group,  experts from the United States, Russia and the European Union,  represented by France, Germany and Britain. These conclusions  will have to do with the partition of Bosnia and with steps to  be taken against any side which eventually does not accept this  plan.    It is taken for granted that Redman at least, and possibly  Churkin too, will continue the present mission by also going to  Sarajevo and Zagreb.</p>

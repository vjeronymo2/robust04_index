He had been asked about the  reaction of the head of the government to a letter from  economists Anders Oslund (Sweden) and Jeffrey Sachs (United  States) in which they decline "to further assist the Russian  Government".    According to Sergeyev, the head of the government believes  that "the mechanical transfer of western economic methods to  Russian soil has caused much more harm than good".    "The reform course drawn up by the Russian Government and  approved by the president naturally incorporates some elements  of Western market economics, but it primarily takes account of  particular features of our state and people and of traditions in  Russia", Valentin Sergeyev concluded.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sarah Womack, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>   [Text] The Foreign Office [FO] today dramatically produced  a "forged" letter from Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd to Defence  Secretary Malcolm Rifkind -- and said it was the work of the  Iranian intelligence service.    An FO spokesman said the letter, dated April 18 this year,  purported to show British policy in Bosnia was anti-Muslim.    Another document was also published, allegedly from a  disaffected member of the Foreign Office's staff.    "Members of the Iranian Embassy in London have been involved  in attempting to distribute forged documents purporting to show  that Britain's policy in Bosnia was directed against the  Muslims," the spokesman said.    Referring to the forged letter from Mr Hurd to Mr Rifkind,  he  added: "It is a crude attempt to copy Foreign Office form and  style, and fails miserably."    Release of the documents at a news conference today came  after Iran's explusion earlier of British diplomat Hamish Cowell  from Tehran, in a tit-for-tat response to Britain's explusion  last week of the first secretary at the Iranian Embassy in  London, Vahid Belourchi.    Belourchi was asked to leave because of the false  allegations  about British policy in Bosnia contained in the two documents.</p>

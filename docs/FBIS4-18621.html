			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna April 7 SAPA -- Foreign Minister Pik Botha on  Thursday [7 April] told the International Atomic Energy Agency  in Vienna South Africa had committed itself to a safer world and  called on other United Nations member states to do the same. He  was speaking at a ceremony at which South Africa presented the  agency with a symbolic plough, made from a dismantled nuclear  device.    "We have dismantled our nuclear devices," said Mr Botha. "We  have signed the Nonproliferation Treaty, the safeguards  agreement and we have associated ourselves fully with the ban on  chemical and biological weapons."    Mr Botha said the peace and security of the planet depended  particularly on the will of advanced, industrialised powers with  access to vast stockpiles of nuclear weapons and which consumed  a large portion of the earth's resources.    "The technologies which the industrialised nations have made  available to the world have improved the quality of life of a  large proportion of humanity, although for the most part they  remain out of reach of the poor, developing countries," he said.    "Some of the dramatic technological advances have also  brought unintended negative consequences in their wake."    Poorer countries were faced with a two-fold problem, said Mr  Botha. "They cannot enjoy the advantages of modern technology,  but at the same time must face the negative consequences which  that technology has brought with it."</p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Check-off rules change could cut membership by 20% AFTER Labour's fourth consecutive election defeat the unions are looking elsewhere for any scrap of influence they can find - with employers, in the European Community, and even with the post-Thatcher Conservative party. But while the unions seek every opportunity to talk to the government there is not much evidence that anybody in government is listening. There have been some discreet delegations from the Trades Union Congress to Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, and to the Treasury, without obvious results. The unions were not consulted recently when the government proposed a shake-up of how industrial tribunals operate. More important, in spite of Mrs Shephard's claim that the war with the unions is over, she will this autumn introduce a bill which could be more devastating in its effect on union membership and finances than anything produced in the Thatcher years. The TUC conference in Blackpool will today and tomorrow debate union legislation past and future. But overhanging that debate will be one jargon phrase: 'automatic check-off'. Nearly 80 per cent of union members are covered by check-off, the automatic monthly deduction of union dues from pay packets by employers. Almost all employees give initial written permission for the deduction to take place, and can stop it whenever they wish but there have been some abuses of the system, especially in the construction industry, which prompted Mr Michael Howard, when employment secretary, to decide to place reform of check-off in the bill. The reform requires each employee to give written permission for check-off within 12 months of the bill becoming law and subsequently every three years. Every time a union increases subscriptions the member will have to be informed. This may not sound like a revolution but it could cut union membership, already in sharp decline, by more than 20 per cent at one blow. Professor Paul Willman of the London Business School, an expert on union finances, believes that unions could lose around 1m members or 15 per cent of the total. But when Wandsworth council in south London decided to abolish check-off for 2,000 members of the local-government union Nalgo, the drop in membership was closer to 30 per cent. Regular reconsideration of check-off is tantamount to regular reconsideration of union membership. Many people who have short-term grievances against their union will now have an easy way to withdraw. Check-off has grown quickly since it was introduced in the 1960s, and now covers about three quarters of union members with the rest paying via direct bank debit or to a shop steward. Some public-sector unions such as Nupe have almost 100 per cent of their members on check-off, and the two big general unions, the GMB and the TGWU, both have more 90 per cent. They all stand to be badly affected by drop-outs. Even worse hit will be unions which have a transient membership such as Usdaw, the shopworkers union, which recruits many part-time workers. After painful rationalisation most of the big unions are now back in the black, but the change may push many back into the red and may give another twist to economy-driven union mergers. The best placed unions will be those such as Bifu, the banking union, which has more than 50 per cent of its staff on direct debit. Other unions will try to follow Bifu's example. Employers have shown no great enthusiasm for the change, and the Engineering Employers' Federation has actually opposed it. as Many employers hold the money on deposit for unions for quite long periods, earning useful interest. But some officials fear that the slowly increasing number of employers considering union de-recognition will find it easier to push ahead if check-off, a symbol of employer acceptance of unions, is constantly being called into question.</p>

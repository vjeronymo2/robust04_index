			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Cookery: How to demolish the Easter egg mountain - Although the holiday is over, Philippa Davenport has kept back a cracking treat not chocolate ones but fresh. In days when Lenten fasting was a serious business with no eggs consumed (openly, at least) for a full 40 days, cooks had their work cut out to cope with the accumulated stocks. The Easter Sunday binge was not enough in itself to demolish the egg mountain. The giving of eggs to those who did not keep their own poultry helped of course. Even so most cooks were kept busy cracking into the nest egg throughout the whole of Easter week and the week after. One seasonal recipe that appeals to me is a Genoese pie filled with eggs, herbs, soft cheese and chard. Some modern versions replace the chard with globe artichokes but the traditional combination is exquisite. If speed is of the essence a lovely, if more obvious, solution is a souffle. One of the best is made with spinach, best of all when served with a jug of anchovy sauce. This makes a rich and ritzy first course or a four-star supper dish. It also makes a splendid vegetable accompaniment for plainly cooked fish or gammon. For those sad souls who do not appreciate anchovies, stay your hand with the sauce and garnish the souffle instead with flat mushrooms fried, sprinkled with toasted pinenuts and a little chopped dill. Mushrooms, incidentally, tend to be outsize and cut-price after a bank holiday when they have been left to grow on unpicked. Another surplus. Mushrooms do not stop growing, of course, any more than hens stop laying, just because of the rules of church or state. GENOESE EASTER PIE (serves 6) 4lb chard; 6 eggs;  1/2 lb curd cheese;  1/2 lb cream cheese; 2 1/2 oz freshly grated Parmesan cheese; 2oz butter; 1-2 garlic cloves; 2-3 tablespoons fresh chopped marjoram; 1 packet filo pastry; olive oil, preferably Ligurian. Separate the ribs of chard from the green leaves, stripping off membrane and any stringy bits. Chop the ribs and shred the greenery. Boil the ribs for five minutes, add the greenery and cook until tender. Drain and squeeze dry. Slice the garlic and fry it in 2 tablespoons of oil to flavour the oil. Discard the frazzled garlic and saute the chard for three to four minutes. Season well with salt, pepper and some of the Parmesan, and cool. Oil the interior of a 10-inch paella pan, cake tin with springclip sides or similar metal container. Line it with a sheet of filo painted with oil, letting the surplus hang over the rim. Add a further nine sheets of oiled filo, angling each slightly differently. Put the cooled chard into the tin. Cover it with the marjoram and curd and cream cheeses beaten together. Make six hollows in the mixture. Slip nuggets of butter into them, then whole raw eggs. Season with pepper and sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan. Cover with another 10 layers of filo, oiled and angled as before. Cut off the tips of the pastry points that overhang the tin. Then roll the remaining overhang up and inwards towards the centre of the pie making a rope-like twisted ridge all round the rim. Lay the trimmings across the centre and brush all the top of the pie with more olive oil. Slide the pie on to a pre-heated baking sheet and bake at 375`F (190`C) gas mark 5 for 45-50 minutes, turning up the heat at the end if necessary for a rich golden finish. Cool to tepid before serving. SPINACH SOUFFLE WITH ANCHOVY SAUCE (serves 3-4) 12oz spinach; a small garlic clove, sliced; 1oz butter;  1/2 oz flour; 1/2 oz freshly grated Parmesan cheese; 7 fl oz milk; 3 large eggs (preferably size 1). For the sauce: 1 x 50g tin of anchovy fillets; a knob of butter; scant 1/4 pt double cream. Steam the spinach until tender. Squeeze it dry and chop it finely. Scald the milk with the garlic to flavour it lightly then strain the milk and discard the garlic. Make a white sauce with the butter, flour and hot milk. Draw the pan away from the flame and beat in the cheese, the spinach, and finally the egg yolks, one at a time. Season generously. Whisk the egg whites to firm shiny peaks. Stir a couple of spoonfuls into the spinach mixture then fold the spinach mixture into the rest of the egg whites. Turn the airy amalgam into a souffle dish that has been buttered and dusted with a little extra grated Parmesan cheese and bake at 375`F-400`F (190`C-200`C) gas mark 5-6 for 20-25 minutes. For the sauce, put the anchovies into a small pan with a hazelnut sized nugget of butter. Warm gently crushing the anchovies with a spoon to speed their disintegration. Add the cream, bring to the boil and simmer briefly until slightly reduced and thickened.</p>

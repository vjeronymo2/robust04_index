			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The first deputy chairman of the Georgian gas  department, Tamaz Gagua, gave an interview to Georgian radio  today. Here is an excerpt from that interview.    [Begin Gagua recording] Our republic needs 23-24 million  cubic meters of gas per day for the normal functioning of  enterprises in winter. We still do not have the opportunity to  buy gas in such quantities. Until today we were receiving  11.5-12.0 million cubic meters, which is about 45 percent of the  demand.    However, since we were not fulfilling contractual  obligations  -- as you know, all the gas comes from the Republic of  Turkmenistan -- we received a harsh notice yesterday morning.  It said that due to a failure to fulfill contractual  obligations -- what they meant was the non-payment of a large  debt in respect of a gas transit service -- the gas supply would  be terminated at 1800 hours yesterday.    This was followed by a message from Moscow. It was based on  Turkmen information. The message was signed by a deputy  chairman of the Russian joint stock company Gazprom, (Revizov).  It said that at the request of Turkmenistan the gas supply to  Georgia would be terminated at 1800 hours.    You can easily imagine what the consequences would have  been.  We did our best to put off the implementation of such harsh  sanctions. After intensive talks with our colleagues we reached  an agreement with them that these sanctions would not be  implemented. However, the supply of gas was sharply reduced.  Yesterday morning we were getting up to 12 million cubic meters  of gas a day, while now we are being supplied with 8.5-9.0  million.    By a decision of the republic's deputy prime minister a  government delegation has been set up and will fly, probably  tomorrow, Sunday [23 January], to Turkmenistan for talks. We  hope that this issue will be solved positively next week and  that the supply of gas will be resumed at the pre-reduction  level. [end recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] A number of Arabic newspapers linked to the  reactionary countries in the region have for some time suggested  that the Islamic Republic of Iran is very eager to restore ties  with the Egyptian Government. It is nothing new to say that  these newspapers have adopted Zionist stances. For many years  the Arab reactionary countries have been funding with their  petrodollars not only hireling newspapers and propaganda  trumpets, but also the bullets that are fired at the breasts of  the Muslim Palestinian revolutionaries. These hireling  newspapers of the reactionary countries in the region  occasionally fabricate news that Tehran wishes to resume ties  with Cairo.    By publishing these venomous reports, international Zionism,  which dictates stances to these agent newspapers, seeks to  achieve several goals. Fabricating such reports is designed to  suggest that officials in the Islamic Republic of Iran are not  serious about their hostile position toward Zionism and that the  desire to restore relations with the Camp David regime in Cairo  indicates that they are inwardly inclined toward normalizing  relations with the Zionist camp. Such moves would distort the  image of the holy Islamic republican regime in Iran, which is  one of Zionism's main goals. Another objective behind the  attempts of these hireling newspapers is to dishearten the  Muslim revolutionaries in the Arab world and to quell the  confrontation with Zionism and the agent governments in the  region. They also aim to suggest that the leaders of the  Islamic revolution have reached this conclusion too, and so they  want to recognize the Camp David government in Cairo, and,  consequently, may reconsider their position on the Zionist  entity. The third goal is to legitimize the Zionist entity in  Islamic public opinion and try to make the international Islamic  revival look like a futile attempt that leads nowhere.    Since we consider that the Islamic Republic of Iran is the  base of the international Islamic revival, spreading doubts and  despair among the Islamic public about this regime's positions  is considered the most important issue in the Islamic world.  Portraying the Islamic revival movement as futile offers the  greatest support for Zionism.    Islamic revolution leader Ayatollah Khamene'i's unequivocal  and firm stand on important international and Islamic world  issues, particularly those dealing with confronting America and  supporting the Muslim Palestinian and Lebanese revolutionaries  against the Zionist entity that occupies Palestine, has always  been the main factor in confronting and foiling the media  schemes of the enemies of the Islamic revolution.    Regarding the resumption of ties between Tehran and Cairo,  the Islamic revolution leader adopts a firm and unequivocal  stand on this issue, exposing the true nature of this regime  which is hostile to Islam and dominates Egypt. He defined the  Islamic Republic's foreign policy to our diplomatic  institutions. The London-based Arabic newspaper AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT claimed recently that Iran's first vice president  discussed with Syrian officials during his recent visit to  Damascus the resumption of ties with Cairo. The paper also  claimed that the Syrian officials expressed satisfaction with  the progress of these talks during their meeting with the  Egyptian prime minister. The first vice president's office  refuted these claims and said that the Iranian and Syrian  officials did not discuss ties between Tehran and Cairo.    Naturally, adopting a firm and decisive stand on the  traitorous Egyptian Government requires genuine faith in this  issue; such a government will fall because it is separated from  its people, is subservient to satanic forces, and is hostile to  Islam. The foreign diplomatic agencies of the Iranian Islamic  Republic adopt firm and honest stances in the excercise of  foreign policy. Even Westerners themselves realize that the  Cairo regime is dying and believe that the situation of the  Mubarak government is very similar to that of the shah's  government in 1978. By accusing the Islamic Republic of Iran  of having a desire to resume ties with the Egyptian Government,  the hireling newspapers and media that serve the reactionary  countries in the region seek to save the Camp David rulers in  Cairo from the crushing blows that the domestic opposition is  dealing them.</p>

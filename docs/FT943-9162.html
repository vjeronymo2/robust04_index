			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Lac spurns Royal Oak's bigger offer Lac Minerals, the Canadian mining group trying to fend off unwelcome predators, has rejected a CDollars 2.4bn (USDollars 1.73bn) takeover bid from Royal Oak Mines, the much-smaller Vancouver-based gold producer. Royal Oak earlier this week raised its cash-and-shares offer from CDollars 2.2bn, mainly by improving the cash component. But Lac yesterday produced a long list of objections, claiming the bid is 'inadequate and not in the best interests of Lac and its shareholders'. Lac has also received an unsolicited bid from American Barrick, the Toronto-based gold producer. Although the Barrick offer is worth slightly less than Royal Oak's, it has the advantage of including Barrick's relatively liquid and well-regarded stock. It would come as no surprise however, if Barrick sweetened its offer within the next week or two. Mr Jim Pitblado, Lac chairman, said yesterday that 'there is significantly greater value for shareholders in keeping Lac independent than there is in Royal Oak's revised offer'. He noted that 70 per cent of the offer comprises paper based on Royal Oak's 'low-quality, short-lived and high cost assets'. In addition, 'the highly leveraged balance sheet of the proposed combined company would leave it with no ability to finance its exciting development opportunities'. But Mr Victor Flores, who manages a gold fund for United Services Advisors of San Antonio, Texas, which owns a sizeable block of Lac shares, predicted that, following the spate of bids, the battle for Lac could be close to a conclusion. 'If anyone else wants to make an offer, they'd better do it pretty quickly,' Mr Flores said. Lac hopes that several US gold-fund shareholders will back its fight for independence on the grounds that they want a diversified portfolio and are already at or close to their prescribed limits on American Barrick shares. But Mr Bill Martin, who runs a gold fund for Benham Capital Management in San Francisco, said that the decision would probably come down to 'the best price you can get for Lac'.</p>

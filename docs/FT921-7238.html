			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Leading Article: An excess of prudence ONCE AGAIN the British clearing banks are revealing depressingly large provisions for bad and doubtful debts. And once again they are seeking to reassure shareholders and depositors with the thought that their capital position is strong by international standards. All very comforting, until you recall that this is not saying much. The capital base of some of the biggest US money centre banks remains dismally weak, while Japanese bank capital is both fragile and uniquely vulnerable, under the forthcoming capital adequacy rules of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), to the mood swings of the Nikkei index and the domestic real estate market. And although the British banks may be better placed, there is still room for speculation about the ability of the UK banking system to finance an economic recovery. No depositor in Britain need worry about a big clearing bank going to the wall. But customers do have to worry this year about the impact of bad debts on the availability and cost of credit. In any downturn in the credit cycle the banks invariably widen the spread between the interest they charge on loans and the interest they pay on deposits; and they justify this by pointing to the deterioration in their customers' creditworthiness. Yet this time, they are prey to unfamiliar pressures arising from the extraordinary build-up of indebtedness in the personal and corporate sectors in the 1980s, combined with government policy that perpetuates high real rates of interest in a protracted recession. Problems compounded These problems are compounded by disintermediation - the process whereby the banks' largest corporate customers by-pass the banking system by going direct to the money and debt markets for funds. There are fewer corporate customers from whom to extract increased margins. Yet bank lending is still sufficiently important within the wider financial system for this increase in margins to put a brake on recovery. If the banks fail to pass on base rate cuts in full, the transmission mechanism between looser monetary policy and economic recovery becomes more tenuous. A bigger interest rate cut is needed to generate any given increase in economic activity. Nor is the threat posed by bad debts to bank capital entirely negligible. In today's conditions it would not be easy to raise fresh equity capital. So whether the banks are able to finance a recovery depends largely on how quickly they can build up retained profits through increased lending. The problem here is that creditworthiness is a subjective concept: a sound borrower is one to whom lenders will lend. This leads to a vicious circle. If the banks fail to advance credit they undermine the creditworthiness of their own customers. Bad debts multiply, with adverse consequences for profits and capital. Bank profits Confronted with this situation in the US the Federal Reserve has, in effect, made bank profits a target of monetary policy. It has repeatedly cut interest rates and relaxed bank reserve requirements in order to reactivate bank lending. And to good effect: there are now signs of an upturn in the housing and car markets. In contrast the UK authorities are unable to re-establish the creditworthiness of bank customers by cutting interest rates because they are boxed in by the exchange rate mechanism. In the short run this is neither here nor there, in the sense that sluggish growth of broad money and bank credit is probably more a reflection of weak demand than credit constraints. But it could soon become more serious. In a recent circular Mr Giles Keating of Credit Suisse First Boston concludes, after testing the credit crunch hypothesis on various assumptions, that recovery is at risk unless base rates fall later this year to 8 per cent. In other words the UK is waiting on the Bundesbank. It is an uncomfortable predicament; and while the odds are on a serious credit crunch being averted, many small to medium sized businesses around the country will feel the squeeze before the year is out.</p>

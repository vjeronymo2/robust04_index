			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Pilkington Pilkington has such a wretched recent history that it is hard to give it the benefit of the doubt. Yesterday's dividend cut may thus be widely seen as vindicating the view that the payment should have been trimmed last December when the German car industry was already heading for serious trouble. If Pilkington's judgment was wrong then, there is no reason why it should be any better now. Protestations that it is getting to grips with its cost base and determined to reduce its debt without a large rights issue ring hollow when the company still seems subject to such drift. At such moments, though, obsession with past mistakes is dangerous. It can obscure the turn. There is also room for a more positive view. Mr Roger Leverton, the new chief executive, is starting to make his presence felt. The acquisition of Heywood Williams' glass distribution business will help. So will Italy's SIV - assuming it can be bought at a reasonable price. Even so, Pilkington's recovery cannot be anything other than painfully slow. It will probably be three years before dividend cover is anything like reasonable. Despite the planned disposal of the US Sola business and its high operational gearing, the company will struggle to reduce its near 90 per cent gearing. A more radical programme of disposals - even extending to the lucrative southern hemisphere - may be needed. With the shares up over 80 per cent since last October, the market must be betting either that Mr Leverton will persuade his masters of this necessity or that a bidder will end up doing it for him.</p>

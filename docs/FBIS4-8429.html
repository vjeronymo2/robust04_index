			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO--Jozef Oleksy, speaker of  Poland's Sejm or lower chamber in the National Assembly,  Wednesday [13 April] questioned the ability of the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to prevent Serbian forces  from continuing attacks against Bosnian Muslims.    Speaking at the Japan National Press Club, Oleksy, vice  chairman of the Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland  (SDRP), said, "our question is whether NATO's air raids can have  any effectiveness as a warning against Serbia."    Oleksy is a political rival of Polish President Lech Walesa.  Oleksy, a former communist cabinet minister in charge of trade  unions, opposed Walesa's Solidarity prodemocracy movement until  the SDRP's predecessor, the Polish United Workers' Party, was  ousted from power by the Solidarity-led coalition government.    Oleksy's remarks came two days after NATO Secretary General  Manfred Woerner warned Bosnian Serbs not to retaliate in the  aftermath of air strikes against Serbian forces besieging the  Bosnian enclave of Gorazde.    NATO jets, in two rounds of air raids Sunday and Monday,  destroyed Serbian tanks and armored personnel carriers, the  first NATO bombing raids on ground positions in the  organization's 45-year history.    "The situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is evidence that the  European security system does not have the ability to resolve  wars stemming from ethnic disputes," said Oleksy, who is  visiting Tokyo at the invitation of the House of Representatives.    However, he voiced some support for the air strikes, saying,  "although it may be hard to support the air raids  unconditionally, sometimes we should not avoid invoking military  means in view of the uncompromising attitudes of (Serbian)  fighters and the complicated situation."    He also expressed a desire to see NATO accept Poland as a  full member. Poland is now only qualified to join NATO meetings  under the "Partnership for Peace" scheme pushed by the U.S.  administration of President Bill Clinton and the 16-nation  alliance.    The partnership scheme is designed to draw former Warsaw  Pact  adversaries closer to NATO without guaranteeing such countries  would receive NATO defense if attacked by an enemy.    Russia has balked at proposals to give full NATO membership  to Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and three Baltic states  of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, while expressing interest in  joining the partnership.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava June 23 (CTK) -- Only representatives of  the Permanent Conference of the Civic Institute (SKOI) will be  placed at the list of candidates of the KDH (Christian  Democratic Movement), KDH Chairman Jan Carnogursky said after  the last round of talks about the KDH slate today.    The leading figure of the SKOI is former Czechoslovak  Interior Minister Jan Langos.    The governing KDH (18 deputies in the 150-seat Slovak  parliament and 8-10 percent in polls) had conducted talks with  several right- wing and centrist parties about their possible  joint slate.    "It was not possible to wait any longer," Carnogursky said  about the National Democratic Party (NDS) whose representatives  showed interest in the KDH slate in early June. However, two  weeks ago, they received a similar offer from Premier Jozef  Moravcik's Democratic Union (DU) and stopped the talks with the  Christian democrats.    The final version of the KDH slate will be approved on July  9, Carnogursky reported.    The elections will be held on September 30-October 1.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Compromises were made during the People's Palace  proceedings on 8 March. Differences on five out of the 12  points were settled by the Constitutional Act Commission. The  plenary session later added the finishing touches and accepted  the decisions. Oscar Kambamba Kasungu has details on the  proceedings.    [Begin recording] [Kasungu] [Words indistinct]  constitutional  draft texts are being debated upon one by one in line with the  wish expressed by the commission on 7 March. Thus, the High  Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT] settled  five out of the outstanding 12 points at the 8 March plenary  session. They include Article 107 on the Bank of Zaire, which  stipulates that the Bank of Zaire is the country's Central Bank.  It is the issuing bank and monetary body, the state's cash  controller, and the government's economic, financial, and  monetary adviser.    Another issue discussed was Article 113b on the revision of  the Constitutional Act, which must be approved by more than half  the members of the HCR-PT and the government. With regard to  the appointment of regional governors and deputy governors,  Article 46, which has been amended, stipulates that they will be  appointed and dismissed by the head of state through a system of  balanced power sharing. Article 47, which stipulated that  governors and deputy governors were appointed by decree has  therefore been scrapped. The gendarmerie, the civilian guard,  and the security services come directly under the government's  jurisdiction.    The government is also in charge of state management but is  accountable to the High Council of the Republic on that. There  will be cooperation with the head of state on national defense  and the diplomatic sector. Appeals and contentions should be  regulated by decree as stipulated in Article 83. Some  councillors were displeased with the postponement of the 7 March  session, so the HCR- PT chairman gave reasons for the  postponement.    [Monsengwo] We are making an effort to proceed by consensus  if possible. There are certain issues which can be solved  through majority or minority votes, but there are, indeed,  others which cannot be solved that way. This is why I would  like to appeal to councillors to let us try and understand one  another as much as possible, avoid frustrating each other, and  avoid blunders which could jeopardize not only the serenity of  our debates, but also the progress of the HCR-PT. Above all,  let us avoid those things in the interest of the nation. [end  recording]</p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSED AIRPORT NOISE LIMITS CRITICIZED ON BOTH FRONTS;  </P> <P> VAN NUYS: THE ORDINANCES COULD BAR HALF OF THE JETS. AIRPORT OPERATORS SAY THE  LIMITS WOULD HURT BUSINESS, BUT A HOMEOWNER ACTIVIST SAYS THEY DON'T GO FAR  ENOUGH.  </P> <P> Aircraft operators at Van Nuys Airport are organizing to fight two proposed  ordinances to be considered tonight that would clamp down on the noisiest jets,  but homeowner group leaders say the suggested regulations would bring little  relief from jet roar.  </P> <P> One of the ordinances to be considered by the Los Angeles Board of Airport  Commissioners would ban takeoffs and landings of the noisiest jets over the  next eight years. The other would immediately bar additional noisy jets from  being based at the private aviation facility.  </P> <P> The immediate ban would permit no additional jets that generate 77 or more  decibels on takeoff to be based at the airport -- a standard that is not met by  half of the 90 jets now based there. The ban "will be a severe hardship" on the  charter and aircraft servicing businesses that operate at Van Nuys, said Rick  Voorhis, president of the Van Nuys Airport Assn.  </P> <P> "What about someone who has put a deposit on a plane that doesn't meet the 77  d.b.a. rule?" he asked. "It's not fair."  </P> <P> And the gradual phasing out of the noisiest jets will "shrivel up much of the  businesses at the airport," said Voorhis, who said his group represents more  than 200 businesses and individual pilots operating at the airport.  </P> <P> But the two proposed ordinances are "too little and way too late, considering  how much noise this airport causes," said Gerald A. Silver, president of  Homeowners of Encino.  </P> <P> He has led efforts for a complete ban on planes that generate 74 decibels or  more. "The airport people are just throwing us a bone."  </P> <P> A study of airport records indicates that an outright ban on planes that  generate 74 or more decibels would affect no propeller-driven planes and would  bar "only about 25% of jet operations, and with that the neighborhood would  grow much quieter," Silver said.  </P> <P> Airport commissioners are to consider both proposed ordinances at a meeting at  7 p.m. at the Airtel Plaza Hotel.  </P> <P> Airport Manager Charles Zeman said he is expecting a "contentious meeting,  based on what I've heard about the noise regulations."  </P> <P> The Department of Airports staff has suggested that only the ban on basing more  noisy jets at the airport be contained in an interim ordinance. It would go  into effect immediately and last six months.  </P> <P> The remainder of the noise regulations, contained in a long-range ordinance,  would be opened up for comment for six months, then brought up for final  action.  </P> <P> Under the proposed ordinance, starting next January, the maximum noise level  would be set at 85 decibels -- a level that airport officials said would affect  only a handful of older craft.  </P> <P> Between next January and January, 1998, the maximum level would gradually be  lowered to 77 decibels.  </P> <P> That would force out about half of the 90 jets now based at the airport,  according to airport officials. About 800 non-jets are also based at Van Nuys.  </P> <P> At present, the airport has only one noise regulation -- banning takeoffs by  airplanes generating more than 74 decibels between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.  </P> <P> Under the proposed long-range ordinance, that nighttime ban would be moved up  to 10 p.m., but not until January, 1996.  </P></p>

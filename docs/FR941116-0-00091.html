			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fourteen entities filed comments in response to the NPR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding user fees: C V International, Inc.; Tampa Port  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Authority; Seariders International, Inc.; the Inter-American  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Discussion Agreement; <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  Puerto Rico Maritime Shipping Authority;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Matson Navigation Company, Inc.; The Joint Carrier Group; <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Hanjin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Shipping Co., Ltd.; Cari-Freight Shipping Co. Ltd.; Caribbean  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Shipowners Association; Lykes Bros. Steamship Co., Inc. (``Lykes'');  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transportation Services Incorporated; and the Japan Conferences. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The National Industrial Transportation League (``NIT League'') <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  filed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> late comments, which are also being considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Conferences represented by the Inter-American Discussion Agreement are: the Inter-American Freight Conference; Brazil/Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands Conference; River Plate/Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands Conference; and the Inter-American Freight Conference-Pacific Coast Area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Appendix A to this document. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Conferences are: the Trans-Pacific Freight Conference of Japan, the Japan-Atlantic and Gulf Freight Conference, the Japan-Puerto Rico &amp; Virgin Islands Freight Conference, and their member lines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The NIT League is a voluntary organization said to represent some 1,400 shippers and groups/associations of shippers conducting industrial and/or commercial enterprises, large, medium, and small, throughout the United States and internationally. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenters represent a variety of industry interests:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual ocean common carriers, ocean freight conferences and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other aligned agreement parties, ocean freight forwarders, NVOCCs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a tariff publisher, a shipper's group, and a port authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generally, the commenters oppose the Commission's proposed fee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases as being unfair and burdensome on the industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On specific fee increases, Lykes and the NIT League object to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed fee for special docket applications. They argue that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the increase from $25 to $86 is out of proportion and unfair. Both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> urge that the Commission consider a more modest increase to avoid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a chilling effect on potential applicants. Lykes suggests a fee of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $50 or $60.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NIT League opposes proposed fee increases for filing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petitions, formal and informal complaints, and for providing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to the public. The League argues that the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fees do not represent a reasonable value for the service provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that no public policy is served by such fees. The ultimate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect, it claims, could be to discourage petitioners or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complainants from raising valid claims or causes with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Japan Conferences oppose the proposed fee increase for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special permission applications. They submit that the fee for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special permission applications was recently increased to $100 from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $90, and that they are experiencing an increasing need to seek  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special permission authority to deviate from the Commission's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tariff filing regulations. Further, they argue that these requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefit shippers and consignees, not carriers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The only other specific fee increase to elicit a comment is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed registration fees for the Commission's Automated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tariff Filing and Information System (``ATFI''). Lykes believes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed fees are disproportionately high because it discerned no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appreciable increase in the procedures for requesting additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logons for ATFI.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The general statements opposing the proposed increased fees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are unpersuasive. As pointed out in the NPR, it has been over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eleven years since the Commission last reviewed its costs in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing these services. The proposed fee increases only reflect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the increased costs to the Commission in providing these services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission also does not agree with those comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggesting that the proposed increase for special docket  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications is too high and unfair, and would have a chilling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect on potential applicants. The proposed increase is justified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a cost basis. In cases where the amount to be refunded or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waived is less than the filing fee, an applicant can request a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waiver of the fee under FMC rules, as revised herein. Therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we do not see the revised fee having a chilling effect on potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NIT League's comments opposing the increases for filing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petitions, formal and informal complaints, and for providing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to the public also are unpersuasive. As with every  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed increase, the proposed increases for these services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflect only the increased cost to the Commission in providing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services. These fees should not create an undue burden nor cause  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a chilling effect on potential complainants. As noted above,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective complainants may request a waiver of the specific fees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the Commission's rules, if they believe an applicable fee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> causes an undue hardship.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

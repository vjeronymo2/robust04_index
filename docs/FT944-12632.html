			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Banks seek to counter EU rules Leading City investment banks fear a European Union directive aimed at cushioning securities firms against shocks in the financial system will force them to hold more capital than competitors in other countries. They are asking the Treasury to interpret the Capital Adequacy Directive, which takes effect in January 1996, in a manner which will allow some firms to hold less capital than that required by Brussels. Mr Kit Farrow, director-general of the London Investment Banking Association, whose members are the City's biggest firms, said: 'These issues are particularly acute for London, given the nature of the business here. 'It is in the UK where the trading activity is more developed. Even Continental banks tend to run their trading books out of London. It may not be very difficult for them to book the business elsewhere rather than in London.' London firms have been particularly critical of the directive, which they say reflects a political compromise between member states where securities industries vary greatly. It is understood to have been heavily influenced by German universal banks, which typically have much more capital than is required by regulators and which do not take large trading positions. The directive says the 'trading book' of an investment bank should be separated from the 'banking book', with a more liberal regime applying to the former. Current UK rules do not make such a distinction and view the risk activities of investment banks in their entirety. In particular, the association is concerned about the directive's rules which, unlike those applied by UK securities regulators, do not lower the capital requirements for firms with diversified portfolios. Also, the directive does not reduce capital requirements for holding securities which offset each other's risks. The association today will receive a boost from publication of the Bank of England's quarterly report, which is highly critical of the directive. The article, by Professor Richard Dale of Southampton University, does not represent the view of the Bank. Yet The Bank will release its own interpretation of how the directive will apply to the securities activities of banks later this month. Prof Dale says: 'The idea of segregating one part of a bank's business - its securities trading operations - and applying separate and distinct definitions of capital and capital adequacy to the different parts, appears to make little prudential sense.' He says the directive encourages banks to use their deposit base to subsidise their riskier securities activities, giving the securities activities of universal banks an advantage over non-bank securities firms.

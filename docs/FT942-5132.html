			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Spain writes off N-power stations Spain has finally written off five partly-built nuclear power stations, whose construction was frozen 10 years ago, at a cost of Pta730bn (Dollars 5.3bn), under a new law aimed at reorganising the domestic electricity sector. The legislative initiative, which was approved by the government at the weekend and will now be debated by parliament, adjusts Spain's electricity industry to meet Brussels' competitiveness guidelines. In line with similar norms in other EU states, it breaks up the powerful domestic utilities, which both generate and market electricity, into separate production and distribution units. One of the controversial aspects of the new law concerns the phasing out of the nuclear power sector, which currently represents some 35 per cent of all domestically produced energy and which had attracted large investments on the part of all the main domestic utilities 25 years ago. The nuclear build-up, modelled on that in France, was stopped in 1984 when the Socialist government, meeting a groundswell of opposition to such energy, ordered a moratorium on all new reactors. The shortfall engendered by the freeze will to a great extent be made up by natural gas and in particular by a new pipeline linking Spain to the Algerian gas fields via Morocco, scheduled to be operational in 1996. The Pta730bn debt bill accumulated by the utilities which own the unfinished nuclear power stations is to be paid off by a charge that will be incorporated into the domestic tariff. The government claimed that the charge, representing 3.54 per cent of the total electricity charge paid by consumers, would not involve any extra cost, as it has already been levied over the past 10 years that the moratorium has been in force.</p>

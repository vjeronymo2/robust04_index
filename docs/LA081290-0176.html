			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: WATCH OUT FOR DEFLATION, NOT INFLATION  </P> <P> It was easy last week to see inflation ahead for the U.S. economy, but the  reality may be just the opposite.  </P> <P> Despite rising oil prices, the real trend in a slow economy is much more likely  to be deflation. Other than oil, the price of many things will decline.  </P> <P> That's not an especially pleasing prospect. Along with lower prices, deflation  means falling wages, profits and real estate values.  </P> <P> But whether you're planning investments or household expenditures, it's best to  face reality. And reality is that rising oil won't lift other prices, but will  eat up what little discretionary purchasing power the American consumer has  left.  </P> <P> Figure it out. There are no big wage hikes in the U.S. economy, so consumers'  disposable income isn't rising -- and consumer debt has been up to the limit  for some time. So the extra $5 to $10 a week for gasoline and heating fuel will  come out of other purchases.  </P> <P> Corporate profits will be under pressure, an obvious downer for stocks, says  Charles Clough, chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.  Deflation also means interest rates will be coming down, which should make  today's high-interest government bonds attractive, although nothing today is a  sure bet.  </P> <P> The real story is that the 1990s will not be a rerun of the inflationary 1970s.  At that time, when oil prices rose in 1973-74, prices of everything else were  already rising. It was an economy stretched tight in the aftermath of the  Vietnam War. President Nixon imposed wage and price controls in 1971; the price  of bread rose sharply in 1972 when the United States sold grain to the Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> Then the 1973 leap in oil prices blew the lid off. An inflationary spiral  followed as business passed along fuel increases to customers and employees  tried to keep up living standards by demanding higher wages.  </P> <P> Things are different today, even if some businesses don't recognize it. Many  airlines are trying to hike fares 5% to 10% to cover fuel costs. But those fare  hikes may not survive in a slow summer for air travel.  </P> <P> Just a month ago American Airlines was forced to withdraw a proposed ticket  surcharge for airport costs because competitors wouldn't go along. It's hard to  raise prices when customers are already staying away.  </P> <P> The deflationary effect will be seen in consumer decisions small and large.  McDonald's reports slackening sales growth in U.S. markets. Movie box office  receipts are lagging in what was billed as a "blockbuster" summer.  </P> <P> More significantly, house prices are declining in many parts of the country and  commercial property values are falling. "We've seen declines in assets, we're  about to see them in profits and wages," says an investment manager.  </P> <P> "On wages, both our attitudes and our bargaining power are different today,"  says Daniel Mitchell, head of the Institute of Industrial Relations at UCLA. In  the 1970s we were shocked and offended that foreign oil producers could affect  American living standards, and we demanded to be "protected" through rising  paychecks.  </P> <P> Today we are no longer shocked, and we understand that inflation does not  "protect" living standards. In any case, most workers -- union and nonunion  alike -- don't have the leverage to demand more pay.  </P> <P> Deflation is not pretty. Unemployment will rise to more than 6%, from today's  5.3%, in the coming recession, says Mitchell. That's not as bad as the 1970s in  percentage terms, but it still means 7 million to 8 million Americans out of  work.  </P> <P> Unfortunately the government won't be able to alleviate unemployment through  public works programs. There is no spare spending capacity; the slow economy  and savings and loan bailout have already boosted the federal deficit to  historic totals -- at least $250 billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1,  from $225 billion in the current fiscal year. And with the cost of military  action in the Middle East, deficits are likely to keep growing.  </P> <P> That means that the Treasury, which last week sold $32 billion of debt  securities at interest rates of 8% (for three-year maturities) to 8.87% (for 30  years), will be selling more debt than usual in the years to come.  </P> <P> There are fears that the Treasury will have to offer even higher rates in the  future -- which would push down the value of today's bonds. But experts are  divided, with some arguing that the decline of private credit demand in a  recession will offset increased government borrowing and thus reduce the need  for higher Treasury rates.  </P> <P> It's a bleak prospect either way, and it contains a bitter lesson. For years  economists and politicians have debated whether the federal deficit makes any  real difference. Well, we're about to find out how it limits flexibility in  hard times, preventing government spending to repair America's infrastructure,  or a lowering of taxes to revive the economy.  </P> <P> Technically, the deficit also argues against lower interest rates, which will  discourage foreign capital from buying Treasury bonds. But you can bet that  when more Americans lose their jobs, the Federal Reserve will lower interest  rates.  </P> <P> Over time the economy will revive. And maybe we'll have learned another lesson.  </P></p>

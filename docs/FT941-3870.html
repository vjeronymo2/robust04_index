			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Monday: February's producer price figures in the UK will be scanned for signs of inflationary pressures. Although the month-on-month increase is likely to be 0.3 per cent, the annual rise is expected to drop to 3.5 per cent from January's 3.7 per cent. Tuesday: The Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey will be a prelude to the following day's retail sales figures. The two do not always show the same picture; last month, the CBI said the balance of retailers reporting an increase in sales was the lowest for 12 months, while retail sales rose 0.6 per cent. Wednesday: UK average earnings figures, published alongside the unemployment statistics, are expected to show an increase in the year to January of 3 per cent. It has remained at this rate for several months. The public sector borrowing requirement is normally large at the end of the tax year. February's total is expected to be Pounds 6.7bn, but the total for the financial year is still expected to undershoot the forecast Pounds 50bn. Friday: February's sterling M4 lending may have picked up to Pounds 1.8bn, from January's extremely low Pounds 100m.</p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGRY ROMANIANS MARK AN ANNIVERSARY;  </P> <P> EASTERN EUROPE: THOUSANDS BEMOAN THE MEAGER RETURNS SINCE LAST YEAR'S  REVOLUTION TOPPLED A DICTATOR.  </P> <P> Thousands of Romanians returned Sunday to the scene of their daring stand  against tyranny a year ago, not to celebrate the revolution that ousted Eastern  Europe's most depraved dictator but to mourn its failure to ease their  suffering.  </P> <P> Protesters raising paper torches and lighted candles converged on Opera Square  in an eerie evening vigil to remember the revolution's martyrs and to denounce  the new Romanian government as little improvement over the one that was toppled  last December.  </P> <P> The daylong event swelled at times to include as many as 10,000 people taking  part in flag waving, chanting of anti-government slogans and denunciation of  President Ion Iliescu.  </P> <P> Shouts of "Resign!" and "Down with Iliescu!" echoed through the dark, muddy  streets, along with demands for a convertible currency and reforms that will  put food back on store shelves and turn up the heat in dilapidated urban homes.  </P> <P> Police stood by quietly at crowd-control barriers but made no effort to  interfere with the rally, called by opposition forces in remembrance of those  who fell in the fight against repression.  </P> <P> Several speakers addressing the assemblage from a second-floor balcony of the  Opera House called on the crowd to kneel in the icy remnants of a recent  snowfall to pray for the souls of those who died to bring democracy to Romania.  </P> <P> Huge crowds commemorating last year's uprising were also reported in several  other Romanian cities. In Bucharest, 2,000 protesters marched through the  streets Sunday accusing the government of betraying Romanians' hopes for  freedom and prosperity.  </P> <P> Anniversary demonstrations had been expected to continue throughout the month,  marking last year's tumult that culminated in the capture and execution on  Christmas Day of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his hated wife, Elena.  </P> <P> But leaders of the recently fortified opposition in Parliament and the Civic  Alliance movement have appealed for calm and called off many public gatherings  for fear they could erupt in violence.  </P> <P> Sunday's protest in this birthplace of the revolution was the venting of  pent-up frustration with a repressive system that seems to have remained  despite the death of its chief architect.  </P> <P> "Our revolution has been confiscated," lamented Simona Martin, a 28-year-old  manufacturing worker from the town of Lugos. She said she had rushed to  Timisoara a year ago when word that protesters had been fired on spread  throughout the country.  </P> <P> "All the people on this square think as I do, that none of what we fought for  has happened. It's very sad," she said. "But we know we are a minority. We are  probably no more than 20%."  </P> <P> It was in Timisoara on Dec. 16, 1989, that long-simmering resentment of  deprivation escalated into an anti-Communist revolt that drove out Ceausescu in  less than a week.  </P> <P> The spark for that revolution was Bucharest's persecution of Laszlo Tokes, a  popular ethnic Hungarian pastor based in Timisoara. Violent clashes broke out  between demonstrators who gathered at Tokes' house and soldiers called in to  quell the spreading unrest. Inflated reports of deaths in the tens of thousands  sent shock waves of horror through the nation, fanning anger into full-fledged  revolt.  </P> <P> More than 1,000 Romanians died in the struggle to oust Ceausescu, fighting  bloody clashes with die-hard enforcers of the Securitate secret police who  defended the dictator to the end.  </P> <P> Iliescu, once a high-ranking Communist before falling out of favor with  Ceausescu in the early 1970s, came to the political fore after the revolution  to create the National Salvation Front and head an interim government. Iliescu  won resounding endorsement as president in national elections on May 20, and  the front captured two-thirds of the seats in Parliament.  </P> <P> The front rode to victory on the strength of its support among the peasantry  and fears among factory workers that their jobs were at risk if they voted for  a more radical approach to rebuilding the country's devastated economy.  </P> <P> But living conditions remained pitiful, and a sudden change in reform tactics  by the government of Prime Minister Petre Roman has alienated many of those  Romanians who thought they were gaining security by voting for the front.  </P> <P> Disenchantment with the gains of the revolution has been feeding a wave of  anti-government protests and strikes that Front opponents hope will topple the  Bucharest leadership in the same way that unrest forced Communists from power  in neighboring Bulgaria last month.  </P> <P> Union representatives in Timisoara said 50,000 workers from 11 factories were  striking on Saturday, and the numbers were expected to grow once business  resumes today. Pilots and navigators with the national airline, Tarom, have  also joined the protest action, idling much of the fleet and raising prospects  of a military takeover of air transport.  </P> <P> The government has also been fighting against calls for a nationwide general  strike to protest price rises and poor supplies of heat and electricity.  </P> <P> Under pressure from the broadening movement against his leadership, Iliescu  agreed to negotiate today with Radu Campeanu, head of the National Liberal  Party and one of the opposition figures who challenged Iliescu for the  presidency in May.  </P> <P> Announcement of the meeting has fueled speculation that Campeanu, who heads a  new coalition of opposition parties in Parliament, may gain a top government  post.  </P> <P> By bringing in Campeanu and other opposition leaders, the front could appease  some of the political factions that have so far refused to work with the  government to improve living standards.  </P> <P> Failure to address the opposition's concerns could ignite a second revolution.  </P> <P> "The refusal of the current compromised leadership to relinquish power could  generate an uncontrollable explosion of discontent," warned a statement issued  by Civic Alliance, an increasingly influential union of opposition groups.  </P> <P> Civic Alliance ended a three-day conference in Bucharest over the weekend with  an appeal for early elections and a "government we can trust" in the interim.  </P> <P> Marian Munteanu, a student leader who was badly beaten in June when Iliescu  summoned vigilantes to put down anti-government protests, said Civic Alliance  was holding off on calling for any further demonstrations for fear of violence.  </P> <P> "We know there are irresponsible people in this country who may want to turn it  into a blood bath," Munteanu said.  </P> <P> Tokes, the Hungarian pastor whose plight inflamed the revolt a year ago,  appealed to fellow anti-government protesters to continue "to sweep away the  old structures" while renouncing violence.  </P> <P> "My advice would be to be calm and to fight by political means. Don't let  yourself be provoked," he cautioned protesters on the eve of the anniversary  observances.  </P> <P> At an ecumenical service outside his church, Tokes called for "a second  revolution -- a revolution of human rights, of dignity, but without bloodshed."  </P></p>

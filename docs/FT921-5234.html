			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: BBC buys Noddy books BBC Enterprises, the commercial arm of the BBC, has bought the rights to Enid Blyton's Noddy books from the administrator of Maxwell Communication Corporation. The 24 Noddy titles, published by Queen Anne's Press, were part of Macdonald, MCC's UK book subsidiary. Price Waterhouse, appointed MCC's administrator last year after the collapse of the late Mr Robert Maxwell's business empire, last month sold the rest of Macdonald. However the buyer, Little Brown, a US publisher specialising in art books, declined to take the Noddy titles. The BBC has commissioned a Noddy cartoon series from Cosgrove Hall, the cartoon-making arm of Thames Television, which currently holds the franchise for London weekday broadcasting.</p>

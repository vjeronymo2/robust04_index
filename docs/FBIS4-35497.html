			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister has said funds for the  indigenization program of the Indian Navy has been increased  despite the reduction in the defense budget during the last few  years. Mr. Narasimha Rao was speaking at the naval dockyard in  Bombay today after commissioning the submarine INS [Indian Naval  Ship] Shankul. The submarine has been built by the Mazagaon  Docks Limited in collaboration with a German firm. Mr. Rao  described the induction of INS Shankul -- the second  indigenously built submarine -- as another landmark in maritime  history of the country and its quest for self-reliance. The  prime minister said the Indian Navy has been on the path of  indigenization since the early 1980s and sustained, hard, and  collaborative work has helped India reach the status of a  submarine building nation. Mr. Rao said India's naval strength  will essentially be for its self-defense and to protect its  large offshore production assets -- fishing and exploitation of  seabed resources -- in the exclusive economic zone. He said, we  neither wish to control the ocean around us nor deny others  their legitimate use or equitable access to the seas.    The chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral V.S. Shekhawat,  accorded the acceptance of INS Shankul into the navy. The  Maharashtra governor, Dr. P.C. Alexander, and the state chief  minister, Mr. Sharad Pawar, were among those who attended the  function.</p>

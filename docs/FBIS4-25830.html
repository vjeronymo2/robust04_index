			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 15 (XINHUA) -- China's economy grew  steadily last month, with soaring prices being put under control  and production of state-owned enterprises improved, the State  Statistical Bureau (SSB) announced here today.    The SSB index showed that the added value of Chinese  industries increased by 17.3 percent in May in comparison with  the same month last year. Production of state-owned enterprises  turned for the better -- up 5.6 percent on May last year, and  0,6 percent above the previous month.    During the first five months of 1994, the total added value  of industries amounted to 619.6 billion yuan, 16 percent more  than in the same period of 1993.    A bumper harvest of summer crops is expected by SSB  officials, who cited favorable weather condition and farmers'  growing enthusiasm.    Effective macro-economic control measures clearly helped  push  down soaring investment in fixed assets in May. The index  indicates that state-owned enterprises invested 67.6 billion  yuan in the month, down 16.3 percent from April.    Investment by state enterprises was 204.4 billion yuan for  the first five months, up 34.2 percent over the same period last  year.    From January to May, the volume of retail sales totalled  590.7 billion yuan, a rise of 25.2 percent over last year in  money terms, which means an actual increase of 4.5 percent if  inflation is allowed for.    In May alone, the figure was 121.4 billion yuan.    Exports totalled 9.45 billion U.S. dollars in May, 31  percent  up on the same month last year, while imports totalled 9.7  billion U.S. dollars, a rise of 11.2 percent.    In the first five months of this year, China's imports were  worth 39.28 billion U.S. dollars, 18.1 percent higher than in  the same period of 1993, while exports jumped by 24.1 percent.  The trade deficit in the first five months was 1.79 billion  U.S. dollars.    SSB officials said that in May, China's financial conditions  were "basically normal".    The government's revenue increased by 33.7 percent in May  over the same month of last year, while expenditure rose 20.2  percent.    New bank savings amounted to 113.4 billion yuan, 79.4  billion  yuan more than in May 1993.    A total of 8.5 billion yuan was withdrawn from circulation  in  the month.    The SSB figures showed that pressure from soaring prices was  slowly eased. Retail sale prices went up by 18.9 percent over  May last year, with the increase rate down 0.6 percent from  April.    Economists pointed out that it is still very important to  bring soaring prices under control. To maintain fast and  healthy economic development, China should further implement  macro-economic control policies, impose tighter control of  prices and sustain proper economic growth.</p>

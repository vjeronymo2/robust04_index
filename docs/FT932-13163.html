			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / International Company News: Japan banks weakened by appraisal losses on shares JAPAN'S leading banks yesterday announced large appraisal losses on their securities portfolios as the effects of the weakness of the stock market continued to echo through the financial system. The losses, including Y39.7bn (Dollars 358m) at Mitsubishi Bank and Y45.6bn at Sanwa Bank, and calculated at the close of the financial year last month, would have been higher but for a rise in Tokyo stock prices following the government's decision to pump extra pension and postal funds into the stock market. Several banks announced downward revisions of their forecast profits. The results, to be formally announced next month, will reflect the stock appraisal losses, as well as the increasing burden of provisions and write-offs of non-performing loans. Daiwa Bank indicated that pre-tax profits would fall about 10 per cent from the forecast Y46bn, while Nippon Credit Bank, a long-term credit bank, said profit was likely to have fallen 60 per cent over the year to Y28bn, down from a previous forecast of Y37bn. Mitsubishi Bank said its profits 'will show some decrease'. Other banks to record large appraisal losses for the period were the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan with Y39.5bn, the Bank of Tokyo, Y36.8bn; the Industrial Bank of Japan, Y36.3bn; and Sakura Bank, Y35.2bn. The finance ministry expected banks to write down their portfolios every six months, although the rule was waived for the Bank of Tokyo and the leading trust banks last September, when stock prices were particularly weak. Mitsui Trust and Banking, and Yasuda Trust and Banking have yet to announce their losses, while Toyo Trust and Banking reported a Y22.8bn write-down, Sumitomo Trust and Banking, Y19.6bn; Chuo Trust and Banking, Y14.3bn; and Mitsubishi Trust and Banking, 10.5bn. Japanese banks are fortunate that the decline in interest rates over the year has lifted their operating profits, but rates are close to bottoming and the banks will be under increasing pressure this year if share prices resume their fall. The 21 leading banks are expected to announce that non-performing loans at the end of March were about Y15,000bn, up from Y12,300bn in September. The new figure, representing about 4.8 per cent of total loans, does not indicate the true burden. In calculating this figure, the banks do not count the fast rising number of loans on which interest rates have been cut to almost zero in an attempt to support a troubled company. Unofficially, Japanese banks' bad loans are estimated at Y30,000bn, but they are being discouraged from large-scale write-offs by a nervous finance ministry.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aabha Dixit: "Yours Insincerely"] </F>   [Text] In less than two weeks the United States  administration has come perilously close to undoing the progress  made over the last few years in its bilateral relations with  India. In an unusual burst of letter writing, the U.S.  president, Mr Bill Clinton, has raised the familiar ghosts that  haunted U.S.-Indian relations in the past.    In the first instance he replied to a Pakistani propagandist  based in Washington, Mr Ghulam Nabi Fai. This allowed Islamabad  to go to town releasing the contents of the letter. Mr Clinton  then shot off a second letter within the fortnight to an obscure  California congressman, Mr Gary Condit, reviving the phantom of  "the threatened position of Sikhs in the Indian Union."    The timing of the two letters sent by Mr Clinton to persons  with known links has raised eyebrows in New Delhi about the real  intention behind his move. U.S.-Indian relations in the first  year of the Clinton presidency have not made rapid progress.  This is partly due to the U.S. president's preoccupation with  domestic issues.    On the foreign policy front Mr Clinton was concerned with  the  bigger question arising out of the dissolution of the Soviet  Union and the inherent instability in Russia. South Asia was  given a separate existence by the state department. But the  inability of the administration to either fill the post of  assistant secretary of state for the area or send an envoy to  New Delhi reflected the interest Washington has shown in the  region during the past year. By creating a separate bureau south  Asia may have won some individual standing within the system.  But in doing so, the region has also been made vulnerable to the  whims and fancies of one individual.    In the earlier system the region was placed within the near  east bureau. Any major policy initiative went all the way up the  ladder to the deputy secretary of state. It meant the personal  prejudices behind individual decision making were put to  scrutiny.    The absence of a clear cut policy for south Asia has been  evident throughout the first year of the Clinton presidency.  Administration officials have made confusing statements. No  particular interest in India has been shown, save to look at it  through the prism of the administration's global interest of  drawing nuclear hold outs into the nuclear nonproliferation net.    The Indian Space Research Organisation-Glavkosmos  controversy  sparked the first major rift between Washington and New Delhi.  The United States unveiled its missile and space technology  denial policy through Mr Clinton's speech at the United Nations  in September 1993. India had no option but to oppose  Washington's attempts to unilaterally choke the supply of high  technology to countries trying to develop space vehicles. Such  development challenged Washington's commercial supremacy in the  field.    The issue is delicately poised even today. Russia is  vertically split on the question of supplying cryogenic rockets.  Suggestions have been made that India be admitted to the missile  technology control regime as a full participating member. The  United States has argued this would require the consent of the  member states.    The second obstacle to improving bilateral ties is  Washington's policy of preaching on Kashmir. The architect of  this policy is the newly appointed assistant secretary of state,  Ms Robin Raphel, who returned from New Delhi to take up the new  job. Ms Raphel, in her new avatar as the prima donna of  subcontinental affairs, has been exhibiting an imperiousness  wholly out of place with the underlying principles of  Washington's envisaged "new world order."    The third contention concerns the reprocessing plant at  Tarapur. The United States insists that notwithstanding the  extension of the safeguards agreement with the International  Atomic Energy Agency, India cannot run the plant without earning  U.S. displeasure and possible retaliation. Not only does the  U.S. diktat go against the terms of the international agreement,  it speaks volumes on the confidence the United States has in the  IAEA safeguards system which the United States itself insisted  on creating in the Fifties.    The fourth thorn troubling U.S.-India relations is  Washington's attitude towards Pakistan's attempts to destabilise  India and its aggressive pursuit of a nuclear weapons programme.  During the last year of the Bush administration, Islamabad's  responsibility for the abysmal situation in Kashmir was  recognised. Pakistan was issued a series of warnings to stop  backing Kashmiri militants. If it failed it would be placed on  the infamous list of terrorist states.    The exit of Mr George Bush got Islamabad off the hook. The  Clinton administration was curiously unable to act upon the  evidence already at hand. It sent signals to Pakistan that  terrorism and covert destabilisation were not high enough on its  agenda to merit instant reaction. This resulted in the attempt  of Pakistani-sponsored militants storming the Hazratbal mosque.    That effort failed. Islamabad, confident Washington would  not  punish it for its covert support to Kashmiri militants, has now  launched a major propaganda offensive to keep Kashmir alive at  international fora. Washington's escape hatch of pursuing an  "even handed policy" in the subcontinent prevents the United  States from publicly "advising" Ms Benazir Bhutto of the  dangerous consequences of brinkmanship.    Also intriguing is Washington's response to Islamabad's  attempts to make its nuclear weapons status public. The Clinton  administration is compelled by domestic political considerations  to get the better of the legislative branch in the conduct of  foreign policy. It therefore generally supports the repeal of  the Pressler Amendment. Islamabad has been seeking the  amendment's abolition, arguing it gives New Delhi a veto over  the future state of relations in the subcontinent. In a bid to  entangle both India and Pakistan into a bilateral nuclear  nonproliferation deal, the U.S. administration has pursued the  flawed concept of the five nation deal. This has been resisted  by New Delhi.    Mr Clinton's letters come at a time when the U.S.  administration is taking an interest in foreign policy issues  after a successful tour of Russia and east Europe. In Ukraine,  Belarus and Kazakhstan, the United States has successfully  pushed a "money for denuclearisation" strategy. It appears to  have made some progress in this direction. Conditions in south  Asia are not similar and therein lie possible clues to the  motives behind the letters.    This is not the first time interested congressmen and  political lobbyists have written to a U.S. president. It is  arguable whether U.S. presidents have replied to all letters as  a matter of "courtesy." It is also doubtful Mr Fai and Mr Condit  corresponded with the president for the first time.    Mr Fai is a regular participant in Pakistani television  programmes beamed via satellite. He has actively sought the  support of influential people in Washington for Islamabad's  cause. He almost certainly would have written to various  administrations in the past, if not received a reply. One  wonders if Mr Clinton would reply to every letter Indians wrote  him.    The case of Mr Condit is even more intriguing. He is an  obscure politician roped in by Islamabad to take up issues at  its behest. By selectively harping on the human rights of a  particular community, Mr Condit has sought to revive the  Khalistan movement. Mr Clinton fell for the bait and replied in  the same vein, ignoring that human rights excesses are common to  all countries. In India or even Punjab it is not Sikhs alone  whose human rights have been trampled upon.    Punjab has beaten back the challenge of militancy. If human  rights excesses have occurred, legal mechanisms exist for people  to seek redressal. Punjab is not Bosnia. The press briefing of  the U.S. spokeswoman threw up an even more bizarre viewpoint.  She is reported to have said Washington could ask the state  government directly about its human rights excesses.    All this leads to the question why Washington took the  calculated risk of issuing the controversial letters. Two  factors could perhaps have influenced the course of action. One,  the personal predilections of the assistant secretary of state  who obviously had some axes to grind following her stay in New  Delhi. Two, Washington must have realised some countervailing  pressure had to be put on India for refusing a comprehensive  south Asia nuclear and missile deal with Pakistan.    With a year to go before the nonproliferation treaty review  conference, Washington is getting restless. Universal  application will continue to elude the treaty in its present  form. The upshot of such countervailing pressure is they could  derail the train of economic cooperation India and the United  States have put together over the years. This is an issue in  which the United States has more at stake than ordinary  commercial interests.</p>

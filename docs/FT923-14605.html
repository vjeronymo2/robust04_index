			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (23): Excellent management - Consultant's Critique 'EIGHT software houses - they must be insane.' That was my first response to hearing about Lloyds Bank. However, I was very impressed by how well Peter Dailey had made it work. The project ran to time and to budget. By managing the external resources so well, Lloyds has retained complete control of all the important facets. The IT staff are familiar both with the components and the inter-relationships. The system has become an enabling technology. Although it started as a secure funds transfer mechanism, it can be extended to a wide range of transactions. The bank finds itself with a potential electronic mail system, an electronic data interchange network, and so on. The inherent security is a distinct advantage over the traditional solutions in these areas. The key points from this case study are: Excellent management. What could have been a nightmare has been a great success. Awareness that developing a technology can both meet a particular need and provide a base for future services. Recognition that the job is not finished when the customer receives the software. Support, training and an upgrade strategy are all vital for success.</p>

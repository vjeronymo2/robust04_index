			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] will relax the current safety standard and certification  system for commercial electrical goods. MITI will reduce the  number of items subject to the "government certification system"  which makes it mandatory for the government to check whether  commercial electrical goods meet the safety standard and expand  a "self-certification system" which leaves the makers of  commercial electrical goods free to manufacture them if their  goods are found to meet the government-set safety standard. MITI  plans to allow about 100 items including washing machines be  manufactured under the new self-certification system. MITI  intends to put the new self-certification system into effect  within this year after concluding that technological progress  has reduced the danger of accidents. MITI intends to take these  measures to help Japanese enterprises lighten their burdens and  make it easy for foreign firms to gain access to the Japanese  market. Nonetheless, Japanese enterprises will take greater  responsibility for the safety of their goods.    Currently, the Consumer Goods Safety Law sets the safety  standard for passenger helmets and other goods, whereas the  government sets the safety standard for commercial electrical  goods including gas appliances. Hence, no Japanese makers are  allowed to manufacture and sell their commercial electric goods  unless their goods meet the safety standard. To manufacture and  sell commercial electric goods under the self-certificate  system, makers are required to file their registrations with  MITI and then to obtain model certificates from the Japan  Electric Goods Research Institute and other  government-designated research institutes after passing MITI's  on-site inspection of their plants.    At the present, 282 commercial electrical goods items are  subject to the government certification system. MITI plans to  apply the self-certificate system to about one hundred  commercial electrical items, whose manufacturers guarantee that  those commercial electrical goods meet the government-set safety  standard. The Electrical Goods Safety Study Panel (an advisory  body for chief of the Public Utilities Department in the Agency  of Natural Resources and Energy) will hold a meeting in July to  compile a list of specific commercial electrical goods which can  be manufactured under the self-certification system.    Such gas appliances as gas bathroom heating valves,  gas-heated pressure pans and pots will be kept under the  government certification system. MITI, however, will study the  possibility of shifting the government certification system to  the self-certification system for other consumer gas appliances  including gas hot water heaters. The Consumer Goods Safety Law  puts six items such as passenger helmets, baby beds, pressure  pots and roller skates under the government certification  system, but MITI will study the possibility of shifting them to  the self-certification system.    The "safety standard and certification system in Japan is  complex and the system has been criticized by other nations as  Japan's nontariff barrier." Preparations for enactment of the  property liability law have made headway and a system is being  created whereby consumers are kept from suffering damages from  defective goods. MITI has decided to increase the number of  electrical consumer goods that can be manufactured under the  self-certification system with those developments taken into  consideration. The relaxation of the government safety standard  and certification system will be incorporated in another package  of external economic measures that the government will map out  in June this year.</p>

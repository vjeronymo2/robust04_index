The aim of the study societies is to learn from Secretary  Kim  Chong-il and disseminate and study his works, the declaration  said, adding that their formation means signalling the advent of  a new era which is guided by his idea and theory.    It declared that the process of activities of the societies  for the study of Kim Chong-il's works would be a process in  which independence of man would be held dearest, people would  cooperate with each other and unity based on love and trust be  expanded throughout society.    It is none other than Secretary Kim Chong-il who fully  inherited and developed the revolutionary cause of chuche and  opened a new horizon of revolutionary struggle, the declaration  said, and went on:    Secretary Kim Chong-il is an illustrious leader who has  faithfully carried forward and developed the leadership and  exploits of President Kim Il-song.    He defined the revolutionary idea of President Kim Il-song  as  Kimilsongism, an integral system of ideology, theory and  methodology based on the philosophical principle of chuche.    Drawing himself on the inheritance of the revolutionary idea  of President Kim Il-song, he has further enriched the  ideological and theoretical content of the chuche idea in  compliance with the requirements of the present times and the  new stage of development of the revolution.    One of the great exploits of secretary Kim Chong-il, the  leader of the Korean revolution, is that he has strengthened the  politico- ideological unity and cohesion of the masses of people  and brought their creative ingenuity into full play by  strengthening the party and enhancing its leadership role.    Inheriting President Kim Il-song's politics of love and  trust  in comrades and the people, Secretary Kim Chong-il loves the  revolutionary forerunners, comrades and people and shapes  politics of love and trust throughout society.    As it is the maxim of President Kim Il-song that one should  believe in the people as in heaven, so Secretary Kim Chong-il  regards the people as the greatest beings and takes it as his  creed to respect and regard them as heaven.    The societies for the study of works, putting main emphasis  on activities for the study and dissemination of the works of  Secretary Kim Chong-il in keeping with their nature and tasks as  academic study organizations, will conduct activities such as  lectures and organization of seminars on his works, invitation  of delegations and dispatch of visiting groups to Korea and  periodic publication of information.    They will build themselves into groups which will be the  first to personify the looks of an ideal society, the  everlasting future of mankind, in which the masses of people are  welded together by love and trust, and foster their  socio-political organism, the seed of love and trust of the  collective, within them. And the societies for learning from  Secretary Kim Chong-il in different areas will keep in contact  and cooperate with each other, share the same mind, demonstrate  their advantages to many people and thus rally them in the  societies.    The declaration called for forcefully advancing, upholding  the idea and theory of Secretary Kim Chong-il, with the pride of  walking together with broad sections of people a road where a  new prospect is visible.</p>

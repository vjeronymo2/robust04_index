			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Armenta in San Cristobal de las Casas, </F> Chiapas State for the "Vector 21" newscast -- live relay]    [Text] On Tuesday Indians from the zone of Sononusco,  Chiapas State, seized five municipal offices to protest the  alleged embezzlement of public funds, corruption, and lack of  social plans. Approximately 40 people, initially identified as  members of the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party], blocked the  road between Teopisca Municipality and San Cristobal de las  Casas. Alleged PRD members also seized municipal offices in  Cacahuatal.    The two mobilizations followed the seizure of municipal  offices in Mapastepec, Huehuetan, and Tuxantan by civilians.  Their demands are the same -- more credits for rural areas,  more public projects, and distribution of land, among others.  It is also stated municipal presidents have abused their  authority and are acting through political bossism.    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] Municipal presidents  have been accomplices to murder. One of our comrades was  killed, reportedly while trying to escape. Relatives said the  municipal president told him he could leave, but it was later  claimed the prisoner was shot while trying to escape. We came  to Teopisca in case the people need protection because we...  [pauses] if things are not solved now in Teopisca, tomorrow or  the day after we will bring in 1,000 people for further support.  The governor wants us to work throughout the municipalities, but  no solutions are proposed. We have put up with this problem for  quite a long time, and no solution has been found. To the  contrary, the municipal president now gives us the finger,  mostly to our women, and that is not right. We have stopped the  people even though they wanted to drag him out and tie him up.  We know that is a crime and things might get out of hand so we  opted not to do that, but we will not put up with this  situation. We have an audience with the governor in Tuxtla  Gutierrez scheduled for 15 February and, if no solution is  proposed on the 15th, we will adopt other decisions or measures  on the 20th to solve the problem as best we can.

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Midland Bank Midland Bank looks more comfortable now that the merger with HSBC is complete. It no longer has to worry about capital; the restructuring of the UK branch network is largely accomplished; and, since it provided early against losses, it should benefit sooner than other banks from declining provisions. There may not be much more room to cut costs, but, as long as Midland continues to keep them under control, any extra business which recovery brings should yield productivity gains which will help raise operating income. That, at least, is the theory. The question is whether Midland can deliver. The merger will certainly help bring new business in areas such as trade finance and treasury. HSBC's information technology will give Midland a competitive edge in branch banking. But the other message from its annual results is that conditions are still pretty difficult in the market place. UK provisions actually rose during the second half. Trading profit was helped by higher treasury earnings since sterling's devaluation, as well as by Midland's hedged interest rate position which allowed it to benefit from lower UK rates. Both will contribute in 1993. Neither will compensate indefinitely for lack of loan volume.</p>

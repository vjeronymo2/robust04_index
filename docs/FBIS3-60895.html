Interior Minister Nahit Mentese, in a telephone interview  with state television, said reports that Ocalan might have been  killed or wounded had reached Ankara, but it had not yet been  possible to confirm the truth of them. Prime Minister Tansu  Ciller told the press there might be "surprising developments"  concerning terrorism.    There were reports a few weeks ago, which the authorities  here could not confirm, that Ocalan had been arrested in Syria  on the orders of President Hafiz al-Asad.    Turkey has often complained that Syria, and Iran, give help  to the PKK in its decade-long fight in south-east Turkey for a  Kurdish state. Since 1984, more than 10,500 civilians, rebels  and troops have been killed in the fighting.</p>

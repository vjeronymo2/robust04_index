			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Serafim Bykhun] </F>   [Text] Kursk June 3 TASS -- Former Vice-President Aleksandr  Rutskoy arrived in the Kursk region. Kursk residents learned  about his arrival beforehand. Local reports said that Rutskoy  intends to visit Kursk to see his mother who will be celebrating  her birthday.    However, Rutskoy is not the kind of a man to restrict his  visit by ties of kinship only. The first thing he did upon  arrival was to meet workers of the "Khimvolokno" joint stock  society, which was followed by a series of other meetings,  prompting his political opponents to declare that Rutskoy has  begun his "election marathon".    Talking to his fellow countrymen, Rutskoy declared that he  had not betrayed the president. "I have been and continue to  defend the interests of the people who were driven to poverty."  he said.    In Rutskoy's opinion, the Constitution, parliament and power  in the country are invalid, since no one repealed a decision of  the Constitutional Court, a law on a referendum and a law on  elections and a resolution adopted by the Congress of Russian  People's Deputies.    When asked about the former socialist system in the Soviet  Union, Rutskoy said directly that "what was called socialism in  this country was not socialism at all. We must cast aside all  `ism' suffixes and look for another way," he said.    Rutskoy unveiled his plans which were already outlined in  appeals circulated before the beginning of his meetings with the  people. He said that at first, it is necessary to unite all  social-patriotic forces of the "Derzhava" movement in order to  be well-prepared for the forthcoming presidential elections and  etc.    In conclusion, Rutskoy promised to create civilized society  and guarantee life worthy of every citizen if the Derzhava  movement won the forthcoming elections. However, Rutskoy never  mentioned that he intends to run for the presidency.</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Government Bonds: Gilts follow Treasuries' fall in auction aftermath UK GOVERNMENT bonds plummeted yesterday morning, responding to the sharp fall in the US Treasury bond market on Friday afternoon. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent Treasury stock due 2003/07 opened at 110 9/32 and fell to a low of 109 1/2 before recovering in the afternoon. Traders said the disappointing UK credit business figures released yesterday, which were slightly higher than market expectations, may have helped to depress prices. The gilts market is this week waiting for the release of several important economic indicators which could determine whether the Bank of England decides to cut the base rate. These include the producer prices index for April today, the unemployment figures on Thursday, and the retail prices index on Friday. THE US government bond market remained unsettled yesterday in the wake of Friday's frenzied sell-off, but prices at the long end did gain ground on the back of some sporadic buying. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue was up 1 7/32 at 98 13/32 , to yield 8.264 per cent. The two-year note was up  1/16 at 100 5/16 , yielding 6.808 per cent. Trading activity was exceptionally light. Dealers and investors continued to digest the implications of the dramatic fall in prices which followed last week's difficult auction of Dollars 37bn in government securities. With a large chunk of that paper still to be distributed, analysts were not expecting any significant recovery in bond values in the near term. The day's only economic news had little impact on sentiment. The Federal Reserve reported that industrial production rose 0.1 per cent in April, after falling a revised 0.6 per cent in March. THE Italian government bond market jumped yesterday following the one-percentage point cut in the discount rate at the weekend. The cut, from 12.5 to 11.5 per cent, followed the cabinet's approval of L14,000bn in spending cuts and revenue increases to curb the public deficit. Yields fell across the range of maturities as retail buyers scrambled to buy bonds. The yield on the 12.5 per cent bond due 2001 fell from 13.35 per cent to 13.07 per cent. The Bank of Italy's decision to cut the reserve requirement on the net increase in banks' and credit institutions' foreign currency deposits, with effect from the June reserve month, was seen as a bullish factor by the market. The move should free around L5,000bn of funds for use by the credit system. The cut in the Italian discount rate buoyed hopes of interest rate cuts in the Spanish and French government bond markets The Spanish bond market saw strong buying interest among the shorter-dated maturities. The yield on Spain's 13.45 per cent government bond due April 1996 fell from 11.91 to 11.82 per cent as foreign buyers moved in, hoping to benefit from an expected cut in the intervention rate. The Bank of Spain left its key money market rate unchanged at 13.5 per cent at its repurchase tender for central bank certificates. Traders said that this was disappointing, but did not rule out the possibility of an interest rate cut soon. Other European government bond markets opened weak in the wake of the US Treasury bond market's fall on Friday. The German market was haunted yet again by the rumour that Bundesbank president, Mr Karl Otto Pohl, may step down. Bund prices fell after the US decline, with the longer maturities taking the brunt of the fall. Despite some buying interest in short and medium-dated bunds, they ended almost unchanged on the day. JAPANESE government bonds rallied as a fall in short-term interest rates rekindled hopes of a cut in the official discount rate. The overnight unsecured call rate was cut from 8 3/16 to 8 1/16 per cent, while the rate on three-month certificates of deposit fell from 7.9 to 7.83 per cent. The fall was interpreted by some traders as a possible sign of the Bank of Japan easing monetary policy. The yen weakened against the dollar due to the lower interest rates, and traders said the Bank of Japan intervened to buy yen and sell dollars yesterday. The bond rally was short-lived, and JGB prices closed almost unchanged as attention later in the day focused on a number of Euroyen issues, including one of Y50bn by the World Bank. The benchmark No 129 JGB opened with a yield of 6.635 per cent, moving to 6.605 per cent before closing in Tokyo at 6.63. Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking arm of the Barclays group, has obtained a seat on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange through its newly-acquired German investment bank, Merck, Finck, writes David Lascelles, Banking Editor. Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (S-E-Banken) will use the trading name Scandinvanian Bank for its branch in London. S-E-Banken bought Scandinavian Banking Group, the London consortium bank, last year and its licence is being surrendered.</p>

This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section also requires the Director to enter into memorandums of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understanding with such governments when requested regarding such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consultations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V.

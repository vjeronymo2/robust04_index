			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In June 1991, NMFS implemented swordfish regulations, consistent with the ICCAT recommendations, that included a minimum size limit of 41 lbs. (18.6 kg) dressed weight or 31 inches (78.7 cm) carcass length. The regulations include a trip allowance for undersized swordfish in an amount not exceeding 15 percent of the total number of swordfish landed. NMFS and the majority of the swordfish industry recognize the importance of minimizing the catch and mortality of undersized swordfish and remain committed to that objective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although large swordfish are the preferred target of U.S. swordfish vessels, harvest of some undersized swordfish is unavoidable in most cases. Under current regulations, undersized swordfish in excess of the trip allowance must be discarded, despite the fact that many of these fish are dead prior to being brought aboard the vessel. This results in waste of the resource. Further, if discards are not accurately reported, loss of information critical to proper stock assessment, in general, and to evaluation of the minimum size limit, in particular, also occurs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS, in cooperation with Blue Water Fishermen's Association, other members of the swordfish industry, National Fisheries Institute, and Second Harvest National Foodbank Network (Second Harvest), proposed implementing a pilot program to address these issues. Under the pilot program, voluntary participants selected by NMFS will be allowed to land, in excess of the 15 percent allowance, undersized swordfish that were dead prior to being brought aboard the vessel. Reporting and marking requirements will ensure the integrity of the program. Undersized fish retained in excess of the trip limit would be donated through Second Harvest to needy individuals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the November 1992 ICCAT meeting, the U.S. delegation discussed the proposed pilot program. It was agreed that the program was consistent with current ICCAT recommendations for swordfish and that it would be useful for evaluating the effectiveness of the minimum-size regulation. The United States will provide ICCAT with all data collected from the program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second Harvest is a tax-exempt organization that solicits surplus products and distributes them through a network of more than 45,000 qualified recipient organizations that provide food to millions of needy, ill, or infant Americans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further information is available from the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice of the proposed rule on the Atlantic Swordfish Fishery (58 FR 68109, Dec. 23, 1993). This final rule makes some modifications to the proposed rule. The modifications are made after consideration of public comments, to make the responsibilities of program participants more clear and to ensure the enforceability of the regulations. These minor modifications are explained in the Description of the Program section of this preamble. NMFS realizes that there is a need to develop guidelines for donation programs for bycatch. A task force will be formed by NMFS to look into this issue. Information obtained from this pilot study, and task force meetings will begin the process of addressing NMFS standards for bycatch donation programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Program Objectives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Improve Scientific Information Regarding Catch, Mortality, Discard Rate, and Biological Characteristics of Undersized Swordfish <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The program will provide an alternative source of data for estimating discards in excess of the trip allowance for undersized swordfish; discourage unreported discarding of dead undersized swordfish; and provide an opportunity to obtain additional information (e.g., age, size, sex) about undersized swordfish. This is important in maintaining catch per unit of effort indices for small swordfish, which are critical to ICCAT stock assessments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Avoid Waste of a Valuable Resource <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Dead fish that would have been discarded will be donated, through an organized, controlled program, to needy individuals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Encourage Tagging and Release of All Live Undersized Swordfish by the Participants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations require the owner or operator of a vessel to make a reasonable effort to tag and release live swordfish. In addition, the regulations encourage the participants to tag small bluefin tuna, bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna, and sharks when possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIFE ON A FAULT;  </P> <P> RESIDENTS GET EDGY WHEN THEIR WORLD DOESN'T WANT TO HOLD STILL  </P> <P> Danny Grimes wakes up every day over a fault zone. He dresses in his Whittier  apartment and drives west, along the same zone, to his job in Hollywood. Even  there, he is still not out of it.  </P> <P> Any day, any time, an earthquake can occur underfoot. It happened the morning  of Oct. 1, 1987, destroying everything in his apartment "except the dirty  dishes in the sink." It happened again Monday, first with a 4.5-magnitude quake  and then a 4.3 aftershock.  </P> <P> Grimes did not have to be told that it was the Elysian Park Fault.  </P> <P> "It scared me so bad I was shaking like an alcoholic with the DTs," he said  Tuesday. "My heart can't take another earthquake. I got a job offer in New  York, and I wasn't considering it very seriously until yesterday morning."  </P> <P> The longtime Whittier resident is just one of many thousands who live along the  broad swath of the Elysian Park Fault, a crack or series of cracks about 10  miles below the earth's surface, slicing through many of Los Angeles' most  densely populated communities.  </P> <P> The poorly mapped fault zone, more than five miles wide, runs beneath Whittier,  Montebello, Commerce, Boyle Heights, downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood, Elysian  Park, Beverly Hills and Santa Monica. It roughly follows the base of the Santa  Monica Mountains, north of the Santa Monica Freeway.  </P> <P> Until recently, the fault was an overlooked geological blemish. But now  seismologists are calling the fault one of the more important in the region,  capable of generating a quake of 7.0 magnitude or greater.  </P> <P> It is a notion that sits poorly with Ursula Urias, a Montebello resident since  1958. The quake two years ago knocked glasses from cabinets and sent ripples  like ocean waves across her concrete patio.  </P> <P> "I thought it was an explosion. I thought the atom bomb had hit," she recalled,  laughing. "This one (Monday) was not as loud -- a small bomb."  </P> <P> </P> <P> What Comes Next?  </P> <P> Urias worries about what comes next. Like most residents on the fault line, she  endures with nervous contentment, perhaps even a little pride, in her home over  the fault. Every place, she said, has its drawbacks -- tornadoes, hurricanes,  tidal waves. She emigrated from East Germany, where they have The Wall.  </P> <P> "You take a little earthquake any time," she said philosophically.  </P> <P> Many residents expressed surprised that a fault runs beneath their homes and  businesses. According to Caltech seismologists, the fault does not necessarily  mean that property directly above will suffer the worst of the damage in a big  quake.  </P> <P> The main force of the quake, occurring eight or 10 miles under the surface, may  often be directed in a diagonal thrust to the surface and the hills or  mountains shaken most severely would be several miles from the quake epicenter.  </P> <P> Even so, some residents of the fault zone took the news with worried looks.  </P> <P> "That's just great," said Art Lira, owner of Montebello Copy Center on Whittier  Boulevard.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Press Begins to Shift  </P> <P> During Monday's first jolt, the shop's 10,000-pound printing press -- a piece  of equipment normally moved only with a forklift -- began shifting on the  floor.  </P> <P> "I started screaming," Lira's wife Lillian said. "It was terrible. But what can  you do? We've been here 16 years. All our friends are here."  </P> <P> Judith Federico, 44, of Beverly Hills moved with her husband from Indiana seven  years ago. She doesn't regret it. Yet.  </P> <P> "Our friends told us we were crazy, but we are not worried," she said,  expressing some concern over the possibility that earthquake insurance rates  may climb. "They have to live with floods and tornadoes, we have to live with  earthquakes. We will still try to buy a house here."  </P> <P> Dentist Alan Lewis, whose small office has withstood 47 years of wobbling  terrain at the busy intersection of Brooklyn Avenue and Soto Street in Boyle  Heights, likens the danger of quakes in Los Angeles to "snow in Chicago."  </P> <P> Lewis had even had tremors hit while he was drilling away inside a patient's  mouth. But it has never caused a problem -- at least to the dentist.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Get Back to Work'  </P> <P> "I just smile, look around to make sure the building isn't falling down around  me, and get back to work," he said.  </P> <P> A few residents said the quakes are no problem at all. Jessie Jacquez, who has  lived in Montebello for 28 years, said she didn't budge when Monday's hit, even  when a neighbor outside screamed.  </P> <P> Jacquez was too engrossed in a video of the movie "Witness." "It was a good  part -- I didn't even get up," she said, "It was a very good movie."  </P> <P> Oscar Reta, 68, of Commerce said he and his wife must also be getting  accustomed to the jolts. His wife went back to bed after Monday's first shaker.  But still, quakes have haunted his nights.  </P> <P> "I've dreamed about big earthquakes -- telephone lines going down, cars piling  up, people going wild, running," Reta said. "I used to have them pretty often.  I don't know why."  </P> <P> </P> <P> School at Epicenter  </P> <P> At the epicenter of Monday's quake -- according to the best estimates that  seismologists could determine on Tuesday -- was Bandini Elementary School in  Commerce.  </P> <P> The school has been hit before. It was so badly damaged during the 1987 quake  that its main building was closed for the remainder of the 1987-88 school year,  principal Raymond Rivera said.  </P> <P> Students were taught in portable classrooms until the building was reopened  this February, he said. They were introduced to regular monthly earthquake  drills, which seemed to help them cope on Monday. Nearly every student dropped  to the floor and got under a desk. Only a few cried.  </P> <P> In teacher Luz Hernandez's first-grade class, a few well-drilled students  wondered whether the jolt was even real. "At first they were asking me, 'Was it  a practice one?' " the instructor recalled with a smile. "They were saying,  'How did Mr. Rivera make (the classroom) move?' "  </P> <P> Like other schools in the Montebello Unified District, Bandini has installed an  emergency storage shed. It contains water, hard hats, medical supplies,  portable restrooms, flashlights, crowbars and other items.  </P> <P> Rivera hopes he never has to use them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Principal's Nightmare'  </P> <P> "I think that's every principal's nightmare," he said, "that you're going to  have a biggie and it's going to happen during school time."  </P> <P> Fred Hayman, founder of the renowned Giorgio Beverly Hills fashion store 27  years ago, called Monday's quake "a warning for the people who live along this  fault to be prepared. I plan to reinforce and refortify my home."  </P> <P> Commerce resident Harold Villegas had just parked his car in Montebello on  Monday when the whole vehicle began to shake. It shook so violently it struck  the car in front of him, setting off the other car's burglar alarm. He didn't  know what was happening until he saw people running out of a nearby building.  </P> <P> But Villegas considers the inconvenience a small price to pay to live in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> "I haven't been shaken hard enough to think about relocating," he said. "L.A.'s  the place. It's great here!"  </P> <P> Staff writer Davan Maharaj contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THRUST FAULTS  </P> <P> A thrust, or dip-slip, fault such as the Elysian Park Fault is deeply buried  and those neighborhoods directly over it may not suffer the most destructive  effects of an earthquake. The main force of the quake, occurring eight or 10  miles under the surface, may often be directed in a diagonal thrust to the  surface, and the hills or mountains shaken most severely would be several miles  from the epicenter. The dip-slip fault may lie along a mainly horizontal or  shallow-dipping plane. When a quake occurs, the upward thrust of one side of  the fault (depicted above) produces elevation gains in "folds," or mountains,  while ground on the other side of the fault sinks.  </P> <P> The Elysian Park Fault has not been completely mapped. Scientists believe it  generally follows the hill line west from the Whittier area through downtown,  the Hollywood Hills and the Santa Monica Mountains to the coast, but its  precise position is unknown in a number of areas.  </P></p>

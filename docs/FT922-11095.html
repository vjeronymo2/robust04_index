			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / UK Company News: Bank of Scotland expands in NZ - Sector surprised by such a move in current economic conditions BANK OF SCOTLAND is increasing its involvement in New Zealand retail banking by acquiring a controlling interest in two banks, Countrywide and United, which are to merge. The move has caused some surprise in banking circles as there had been speculation that Bank of Scotland, whose chief executive is Mr Bruce Pattullo, might withdraw from New Zealand following intense competition in the retail banking sector in the current recession. Countrywide is to buy the United Bank for NZDollars 182.5m (Pounds 56.7m). Bank of Scotland, which has owned 40 per cent of Countrywide for the past three years is to increase its stake to 60 per cent of the combined operation. It is acquiring the 20 per cent shareholding in Countrywide owned by General Accident, the Scottish insurer. Bank of Scotland will also fully underwrite the purchase of United Bank and provide bridging finance. Countrywide is listed on the New Zealand stock exchange and is expected to make a cash issue to help fund the expansion. The merger will create New Zealand's sixth biggest trading bank, with assets of Dollars NZ350m and a 150 strong branch network. Both Countrywide and United were previously building societies before they gained banking licences. Both have large mortgage portfolios, assets which made them attractive targets for takeover. It is understood that both the Hong Kong Bank, which is seeking to expand in New Zealand, and the ASB Bank, which is controlled by Australia's Commonwealth Bank, investigated buying the United Bank. These banks would not comment yesterday. United has been owned for the past two years by the financially troubled State Bank of South Australia, which bought it in July 1990 for NZDollars 150m. The State Bank was advised to sell it among other assets by JP Morgan, the investment banker. Mr Ted Johnson, group general manager of State Bank, said he was 'well pleased with the result which completed the downsizing of the bank." United has traded profitably since the State Bank takeover and reported a NZDollars 16m net profit in 1990-91. Mr Peter Clapshaw, chairman of Countrywide, said the directors had asked Bank of Scotland to increase its interests to give 'solidity' to the share register, and to provide it with a fully commited majority shareholder. General Accident, which will receive NZDollars 27.1m from Bank of Scotland for its 20 per cent stake in Countrywide, said the disposal is in line with its current policy of concentrating on its core business of insurance, writes James Buxton. In New Zealand and Australia GA's insurance business is handled by New Zealand Insurance which it acquired in 1988 for Pounds 264m, a year after it took the Countrywide stake. Initially it suffered heavy losses. However, last year NZI sharply reduced its losses and produced an 'excellent result' in New Zealand, while NZI Bank, having cut its deficit to Pounds 800,000 in 1991, pulled out of banking in February this year, giving up its license.</p>

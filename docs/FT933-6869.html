In the latest instance, the judge was even moved to question whether the whole matter might not have been more effectively examined by the regulatory authorities than the criminal system. That strikes at the heart of the current problem. The SFO has failed to manage the investigation of complex fraud in an effective way.

Since the Financial Services Act has not so far proved equal to the task, the case for wholesale reform grows stronger.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Seven samurai defer to Hosokawa: Mr Hosokawa will take office having explained little about his political ideas WHEN THE seven samurai, Japan's seven opposition party leaders, gathered yesterday, it was appropriate that they deferred to Morihiro Hosokawa, scion of a feudal ruling clan and still sometimes called 'my lord' by his loyal constituents. Mr Hosokawa, 55, has struggled to turn his cultivated elegance into a party political personality, but one reason for his appeal is the obvious difference between a self-consciously thoughtful individual and the abrasive confidence of many other Japanese politicians. If all goes according to plan in the next few days, Mr Hosokawa will become prime minister, but he will take office having explained little about his political ideas, other than that he wants 'reform' and a 'new way of political thinking.' His stay in office could be short, as the seven samurai are a strange mix of people and ideas, and could fall out permanently over issues ranging from a rice market opening to nuclear power development. They issued a vague statement yesterday, which was general enough to keep all happy but resolved none of their disagreements on policy detail. In the end, Mr Hosokawa was preferred to Mr Tsutomu Hata, the leader of the Japan Renewal party, supported by several opposition parties, but thought to have uncomfortably close ties to the Liberal Democratic party. Mr Hata's defection from the LDP brought down the government, and his party is confident his turn as prime minister will come. Inevitable comparisons were being made yesterday between Mr Hosokawa and his grandfather, Prince Fumimaro Konoe, prime minister from 1937 to 1939, and again from 1940 until just before the attack on Pearl Harbour in 1941. Prince Konoe had thought himself capable of containing the Japanese military, but overestimated his powers of influence and underestimated the consequences of aggression in China that he had approved. Having formed the Japan New party only a year ago, Mr Hosokawa has been carried quickly by circumstance to within reach of the leadership. But he has taken time to mature politically, beginning his career as a journalist on the left-leaning Asahi Shimbun, where he had the bracing experience of being taken hostage by student activists. In 1971, representing the LDP, he was elected to the upper house of the national parliament and was re-elected six years later, serving as a member of the faction run by Mr Kakuei Tanaka, the former prime minister. Mr Hata's JRP is an extension of the Tanaka faction, and when many Japanese want 'political reform,' they mean an end to the rough and ready, money-fuelled Tanaka-style politics that has dominated the LDP. Mr Hosokawa switched to local politics in 1983, when elected governor of Kumamoto prefecture, in the south, where he enhanced his family's reputation as the local version of royalty. He is an 18th generation Hosokawa and keeps up the regal image, and his distance from mere politics, by playing tennis with members of the Imperial family Encouraged to take a third term in 1991, Mr Hosokawa declined, saying that politicians are corrupted if they remain in the same powerful job for too long. As governor, he once suggested the water be turned off in central Tokyo so that politicians and bureaucrats would better appreciate the need for decentralisation, a favourite theme of most provincial leaders. But Mr Hosokawa was generally regarded as a mild man of considered opinions. The gentleman politician's renewed interest in national politics is best explained by his wife, Kayoko, who said he inherited high standards of personal discipline from a family tutor who liked to berate him with: 'How can you become the head of a samurai family?' 'At this point in his life, he doesn't really have any ambition for honour or power or success. The motivation to become a politician is not that he wants to be a great man, but that he can see a mission created for him by history,' Mrs Hosokawa explained. The problem with Morihiro Hosokawa is that he has not been able to explain the mission apparently motivating him, though supporters say a detailed explanation could lead to the collapse of his coalition. The past few weeks have shown that he does have fine political timing, as he let other parties call him to the leadership and left open the possibility that he would join the LDP in a coalition. Mr Hosokawa's priority is political reform, but even his coalition partners have private reservations about the proposals they publicly support. When the serious talk starts, he will face the possibility of a quick split and a new election. Like his grandfather, Mr Hosokawa could find that he has overestimated his political skills, in this case by underestimating the difficulty of controlling a coalition including socialists, the religious right wing, and a few hardened ex-LDP backroom operators who have their own ambitions.</p>

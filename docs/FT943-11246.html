			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / US finds big money in the airwaves The US government netted over Dollars 617m (Pounds 398m) last week in the Federal Communications Commission's first auction of the airwaves. The Federal Communications Commission previously gave away radio band licences through lotteries or hearings. However last year it was granted congressional approval to auction exclusive rights to a range of new frequencies for paging, telephone and voice and data communication systems. First under the hammer were a set of 10 nationwide licences for personal communications services, or 'narrow band services' including advanced paging and wireless data transmission systems. Paging Network of Virginia was among the biggest winners at the end of bidding on Friday after five days and 47 rounds. It outbid 26 competitors to acquire three licences - the maximum permitted for single ownership - bidding Dollars 80m for each of two frequencies allowing the greatest capabilities and Dollars 37m for a smaller band. Capability is determined by band width. KDM Messaging Company - backed mainly by US cellular giant McCaw Cellular Communications - bought two of the five biggest bands at Dollars 80m each, while Nationwide Wireless Network grabbed one at the same price and another for Dollars 47m.</p>

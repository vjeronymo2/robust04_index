			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 17 TASS -- President of Russia's  breakaway Chechen Republic Dzhokhar Dudayev accused Russian  authorities of "political blackmail" after the Russian Transport  Ministry suspended all regular flights to Chechnya since the  latter failed to guarantee safety of aircraft over Groznyy.    "The action has shown the world community once again that  the  Russian leadership does not adhere to any principles, except to  those of political blackmail and terrorism", Dudayev said.    A source in the Chechen Information Ministry told TASS by  telephone that the action is assessed in the republic as a  declaration of an air blockade of Chechnya ordered by Russia's  political leadership.    The Chechen Foreign Ministry's statement circulated on  Friday, qualified the decision to suspend flights as "not  corresponding to the norms of international law and delivering  serious damage to the relations between the two countries".    The statement suggested the flights to Chechnya be resumed  and qualified the reference to the alleged lack of flight safety  as not corresponding to reality.</p>

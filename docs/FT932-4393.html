			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: Federated makes swift recovery - Nikki Tait reports on the turnround at the US retailing group WHILE plenty of US companies have emerged from bankruptcy protection, few have gone on to achieve much in the way of fame and fortune. Could Federated Department Stores - which takes in some of the nation's best-known department store chains, including Bloomingdale's, Abraham &amp; Straus and Jordan Marsh - prove an exception? The retailer's recuperation period has been surprisingly swift. Just three years ago, Federated was floundering under Dollars 7.5bn of debt, due to the antics of Canadian property developer, Mr Robert Campeau. It filed for bankruptcy court protection in January 1990 and pundits predicted that it would take years for the complex case to be worked out. In the meantime, they declared, a fire-sale of assets might prove inevitable. They were wrong. Federated emerged, largely intact, from corporate purgatory in early-1992. In the 12 months ended January this year, it made a small Dollars 133m profit before extraordinary items and accounting-related charges, despite the tough retail climate. Sales totalled around Dollars 7bn. Now, Standard &amp; Poor's is talking about returning the group's debt to 'investment grade' status within a year. 'The first annual meeting of the new Federated . . .' crowed Mr Allen Questrom, chairman, at the recent shareholders' gathering. The executive, who rejoined Federated from Neiman Marcus shortly after the bankruptcy filing, paused to let the words sink in. 'That sounds awful nice,' he added. But if Federated's crisis has passed, enabling the ongoing company to flourish in America's highly competitive retail environment is still a challenge. For a start, borrowings remain huge. At the end of January, net borrowings were in excess of Dollars 2.25bn, putting the debt-to-equity ratio at 110 per cent. That, moreover, is after a large share offering last May and a couple of debt refinancings. Last year net interest charges consumed almost Dollars 200m. Still, in the eyes of Mr James Zimmerman, Federated's chief operating officer, the balance sheet situation is less problematic than certain other aspects of the business. 'The debt situation is satisfactory,' he says, pointing out that the current average borrowing cost now stands at a lowly 7.5 per cent. Instead, Zimmerman calls costs the 'number one priority'. Here, Federated lags behind many of its retail competitors - even other traditional department stores, whose cost base (and associated service levels) substantially exceed those of the powerful discounters. Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, for example, took 34.2 cents out of every dollar of sales at Federated in 1992. Many department store groups have ratios of under 30 per cent, while discounters squeeze below 20 per cent. The Cincinnati-based retailer, acutely aware of the problem, has been juggling the back-office facilities which support its multi-chain group. All credit operations are now run from Cincinnati, for example, while the back-office functions for two of the store chains - Abraham &amp; Straus and Jordan Marsh - have been consolidated. The latter move, say analysts, should shave around 0.35 per cent off the SG&amp;A to sales ratio this year. But, in reality, many of the longer-term cost-savings may come from fast-advancing retail technologies - such as improved electronic stock control, which can cut out paperwork and increase the speed and efficiency with which inventories are replenished. Like other retailers, Federated knows the potential which more advanced systems can offer: 'We're just leaping forward on the technology front,' says Mr Zimmerman. The downside is that expenditure on improved technologies adds to capital investment needs, and Federated, like many companies which have been through the bankruptcy mill, is still constrained by obligations to its bankers. Nevertheless, it successfully won a Dollars 460m increase in the anticipated capital spending programme for the 1993-95 period. Total spending over that period should now total about Dollars 1.2bn. About half the money will go on refurbishing existing stores. Only three new outlets will be added in the current year - it currently operates 217 - but the pace should then increase to between four and eight new stores a year annually from 1994 onwards. Mr Questrom even talks, in vague terms, about exploring acquisition possibilities somewhere down the road. Even so, this level of expansion needs to be seen in context. May Department Stores, running chains such as Lord &amp; Taylor and Kaufmann's, recently announced a Dollars 4.6bn spending programme for the next five years, involving the opening of 100 new outlets. But having come this far, Mr Questrom remains bullish. He notes that the SG&amp;A ratio has come down by 2.5 percentage points over the past three years, and thinks a similar advance should be possible in the next few years. Stock turn has increased from 2.33 times in 1990, to almost 2.9 times in 1992. And Federated says that profit margins - as measured by earnings before tax, interest, depreciation and amortisation - should reach 11 to 13 per cent between 1995 and 1997. Considering that they stood at 5.8 per cent in 1990, that would be no mean progress. Perhaps the biggest plus for Federated is the shifting dynamic in the retail sector. A few years ago, discount retailers were all the rage, and some pundits wondered whether the traditional department stores had much of a future. Now, as the economy starts to improve and the department store operators have become more competitive at marketing their wares, the trend seems to be going in the other direction. In fact, Mr Questrom can even afford to be gracious towards some of the specialty fashion chains which, until recently, appeared to have had a steal on his customers. 'These concepts are always changing', he remarks, benignly. 'We can move from left to right.' That flexibility, he argues, should serve the department store segment well as demographics change, the population ages, and customer demands shift from high, affordable fashion to more sophisticated items, such as quality cosmetics and 'larger-size' clothing.  ------------------------------------------------------             Stores in the Federated group*  ------------------------------------------------------                                 Sales        Number                              (dollarsbn)    of stores  ------------------------------------------------------ A&amp;S/Jordan Marsh                 1.42         15/20 Bloomingdale's                   1.11            15 The Bon Marche                   0.783           39 Burdines                         1.18            43 Lazarus                          0.957           39 Rich's/Goldsmith's               0.884           24 Stern's                          0.655           22  ------------------------------------------------------ *1992 figures  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

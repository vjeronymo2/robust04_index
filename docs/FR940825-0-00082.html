			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bid and proposal costs, and independent research and development costs of non-profit organizations_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Revised &sect;74.27(b) carries over virtually intact the current provisions at &sect;74.174(b) (1) and (2) which address allowable bid and proposal costs, and independent research and development costs. Because OMB Circular A&hyph;122 does not cover them, HHS has chosen to continue to address these subjects in part 74 to fill an important policy gap, especially in view of HHS's expansive funded research and development activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Application of part 74 to the ``entitlement programs''_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Part 74, as amended, continues to apply to grants to the States for the programs listed in 45 CFR 92.4(a) (3), (7), and (8), which are commonly referred to as the ``entitlement programs.'' As discussed under General, above, this is a temporary provision until new policies are developed, as indicated at 45 CFR 92.4(b), for subpart E of 45 CFR part 92, to cover those programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Retention of Longstanding HHS Policies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to adopting the language of OMB Circular A&hyph;110, this amendment of 45 CFR part 74 retains certain longstanding HHS policies which neither are contained in nor conflict with the Circular, and which we believe are necessary to continuing, sound administration of the awards process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Revised &sect;74.22(h)(2) references the HHS claims collection regulations in 45 CFR part 30 rather than OMB Circular A&hyph;129 because those regulations are more relevant to the delinquent debts of recipients of HHS funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Revised &sect;74.25(k) specifies which HHS officials have the authority to grant requests for prior approvals of revisions in budget or program plans under this Part. This provision is not changed in any substantive way from the current provisions at &sect;74.101(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Revised &sect;74.26 defines the term ``affiliated'' in relation to the applicability of OMB Circular A&hyph;133 to hospitals affiliated with institutions of higher education. The revised section also provides recipients of HHS awards with instructions on where to submit copies of audit reports. This provision is changed from current &sect;74.62(c) only to update the location to which audit reports must be sent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Revised subpart E contains special additional requirements for awards to commercial organizations. We have deleted the previous requirement that property acquired by commercial organizations under an HHS award becomes Government property. Experience has shown that no need exists for this requirement; therefore, we believe the costs of administering such a requirement cannot be justified. Henceforth, property acquired by commercial organizations under an HHS award will be treated in the same way as property acquired by other grantees as provided at revised &sect;&sect;74.30 through 74.37.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Other Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have made a number of editorial and key technical clarifications of the Circular's provisions throughout the rule as amended. They are designed to make the rule more understandable to the many and varied HHS awarding agencies and recipients. In some instances, we have recognized some of the text in the longer sections of the Circular for easier reading and reference. However, we have not deviated from the substantive requirements of the Circular. In addition, we have made changes related to the following provisions which do not vary in substance from the intent or provisions of the Circular.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definitions, revised &sect;74.2_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Following OMB's approval to continue part 74's applicability to the ``entitlement programs,'' we have added definitions of ``State,'' ``local government,'' ``Indian Tribal government,'' and ``Government.'' These definitions are consistent with the definitions set forth at 45 CFR part 92. We have also expanded the definition of ``Recipient'' to embrace these entities. We have added a definition of ``discretionary award'' to distinguish these types of transactions from the ``entitlement program'' type of award.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To improve the utility of the rule, we have added definitions for the following organizational entities: the Office of Management and Budget (OMB); the Office of Grants and Acquisition Management (OGAM) of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Management and Budget, which replaces the OPAL of the current rule; and the Departmental Appeals Board, which is responsible for adjudicating certain disputes that arise between HHS and recipients of HHS funds (see revised subpart F).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Circular defines the phrase ``Federal awarding agency'' at  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .2 as the Federal agency that provides an award to a recipient. In making certain features of the Circular apply more particularly to HHS, we have added a definition of ``HHS awarding agency'' to refer to those organizational components of HHS with authority and responsibility for making and administering HHS awards. Having established this definition, we have replaced the term ``Federal awarding agency,'' which appears throughout the Circular's provisions, with the term ``HHS awarding agency,'' whenever we mean the HHS organizational component making the award. In those places where we have inserted the term ``HHS'' in place of ``Federal awarding agency,'' we mean to encompass not only the awarding agency, but also, other HHS components; e.g., the Office of Inspector General.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

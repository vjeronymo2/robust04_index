			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Italy's Corruption Scandal: A tale from two cities Rome: The wreckage wrought on the body politic May 1992 The effects of the scandal reach the capital. Milan's magistrates ponder whether to ask parliament to waive immunity on the outgoing Socialist minister of tourism and a recently re-elected Socialist deputy who is also the brother-in-law of Bettino Craxi, the long-time leader of the Socialist party and former prime minister. Craxi is widely expected to head the government being formed in the wake of last months' national election stalemate. Jun 1992 The outgoing minister for public works is served notice by Rome's magistrates that he is under investigation. Craxi agrees to withdraw candidature for prime minister. Giuliano Amato, former Socialist treasury minister and head of the special commission looking into Milan scandal, forms government. Jul 1992 Chamber of Deputies agrees to waive parliamentary immunity on five MPs. A total of 13 MPs and former ministers are now under investigation by Milan magistrates. Nine more are being investigated in other parts of the country. Dec 1992 Craxi is told he is under investigation by Milan magistrates. Parliament agrees to waive immunity of Socialist deputy leader and former foreign minister Gianni de Michelis so that Venice magistrates can investigate allegations against him. Socialist party executive postpones decision on Craxi's leadership. Jan 1993 Craxi served with second notice by Milan magistrates, who ask parliament to waive his immunity. The plight of Mr Craxi and the Socialist leadership again raises question mark over fate of Amato coalition, in which Socialists are principal partners alongside Christian Democrats. Rome magistrates investigate purchase by Treasury of buildings in Rome. Forty-four people, including senior civil servants and a former treasury director-general, are charged. Police raid offices of Socialists. Feb 1993 Claudio Martelli, Socialist justice minister, resigns after being told he is under investigation in Milan. The number of separate investigation notices to Craxi increases to six. Craxi resigns as party leader after 16 years in the job. Gabriele Cagliari, president of Eni, told by Rome magistrates he is under investigation. Two under-secretaries in Budget and Interior ministries are warned. Prominent figures in parties other than Socialists are increasingly involved in investigations. Health minister Francesco De Lorenzo resigns after deputies vote to remove immunity. Finance minister Giovanni Goria resigns. Although not under recent judicial investigation, he has been embroiled in another long-running investigation. Tension rises as magistrates in Rome, Milan and other cities order a wave of arrests. Republican party leader Giorgio La Malfa resigns immediately after being informed he is under investigation. More than 50 deputies and senators are now caught up in the various investigations. Mar 1993 A hitherto obscure television programme presenting court cases becomes mass viewing. Craxi says magistrates are in co-ordinated plan to decapitate Socialist influence. Amato's four-party coalition agrees on legislation that would transfer the investigation of illegal political funding from magistrates to politically appointed regional prefects. There is public uproar, Milan magistrates object, Environment minister Carlo Ripa di Meana resigns in protest, and President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro refuses to sign the government's decree that would open way for a political solution. Amato wins backing of coalition parties after turbulent parliamentary debate, but widespread protest continues. Amato leaves proposed legislation with a divided parliament. More than 1,000 senior politicians and businessmen are now under investigation, but this is likely to prove to be only the tip of the iceberg. Milan: The sword hanging over the business community Feb 1992 The beginnings of what will become known as 'the Milan corruption scandal' is revealed almost accidentally. A Socialist apparatchik is caught taking a L7m (Pounds 3,200) kickback for a cleaning contract at an old peoples' home. Milan's magistrates have been on trail of corruption ever since. May 1992 The scandal enters its third month with the charging of two leading figures in the construction industry. Six other prominent people in the industry have already been charged. Most notably, Enzo Papi, managing director of Fiat's big building subsidiary, is detained. In all, 26 businessmen, municipal officials and local politicians have now been arrested. Jun 1992 Number of accused prominent businessmen and politicians rises to more than 40. Police announce that a prominent Socialist killed himself after going to see authorities investigating alleged city hall corruption in Milan. Jul 1992 Salvatore Ligresti, the king of construction in Milan and one of Italy's richest men, is arrested and shares in companies under his control fall sharply. Seventy-six local and national politicians have been either charged or are under investigation and focus is shifting to industrialists. Scandals claim second suicide victim with death of head of Como-based building group. Dec 1992 The lira, already buffeted by turmoil in the ERM, for the first time comes under pressure because of Italy's political uncertainty. The government unfreezes L10,000bn (Pounds 4.4bn) in payments overdue to construction companies for public works contracts. Disbursement had been delayed by corruption inquiries. Jan 1993 Magistrates announce that Paolo Berlusconi, the younger brother of media magnate Silvio Berlusconi, will be put on trial. He is latest of 35 businessmen and politicians who magistrates say will go to trial. Magistrates widen investigations to include reorganisation of chemicals industry in 1990. Under investigation are Eni, the state oil concern, the Ferruzzi Group's Montedison, and Anas, the state road building authority. The number of persons arrested since the beginning of the scandal passes 100. Feb 1993 Financial markets are rattled by fears of political chaos. Heavy selling of shares, and the lira slides. Intervention restores calm to markets. A total of 105 businessmen, politicians and civil servants are said to have confessed to taking part in a system whereby public contracts were awarded on the basis of illicit payments to fund party organisations. Latest line of investigation centres on the electricity generating industry. More arrests, increasingly involving prominent business figures. Two top Fiat executives are arrested in their Turin homes, one of whom is the group's chief financial officer. Magistrates announce that Raul Gardini, former head of Ferruzzi-Montedison, is under investigation. Mar 1993 Milan magistrates order arrests linked to reconstruction work in 1987 Valtellina floods disaster. Two officials of state road-building agency Anas among those held. Italy's credit ratings begin to be affected. Standard &amp; Poor's announces downgrading after Moody's places the country's debt under review. The move by Moody's provokes rebuttal from Bank of Italy and Treasury which accuse agency of failing to take account of measures to tackle public sector deficit. Gabriele Cagliari, president of Eni, arrested. Share prices fall, and Bank of Italy forced to support lira. Calm restored to markets. Chairmen of four big Eni subsidiaries arrested, and police raid group's operating headquarters. Head of Sace, the state-run export credit guarantee agency, arrested.</p>

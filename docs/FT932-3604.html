			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / China's Investment Revolution: Emigrant entrepreneurs seize new opportunities back home IN September 1893 the imperial authorities in China issued an edict encouraging successful Chinese emigrants to invest in their homeland. The edict proclaimed that the overseas Chinese would in future be welcomed back to China - a reversal of previous policy which had not recognised those who had left China's shores. Now, 100 years on, China is once again wooing the overseas Chinese to participate in developments at home. And the Chinese diaspora, many of whom are removed from China by several generations, are responding. While investment in China by US, Japanese and EC interests has been increasing substantially, it is the financial resources of the overseas Chinese which are now beginning to transform many parts of China. Just how much of China's foreign investment is accounted for by overseas Chinese is hard to gauge. But its influence is plain to see. Guangdong province in the south has been transformed by capital flowing in from nearby Hong Kong. Businessmen from Taipei are overrunning Fujian, the mainland province just across the water from Taiwan. The vast resources of the overseas Shanghainese - some of them the entrepreneurs primarily responsible for the emergence of Hong Kong in the 1950s and 1960s - are now returning home. Traditionally the overseas Chinese have always been great savers. Taiwan, with 21m people, has foreign exchange reserves of nearly Dollars 90bn. Singapore, three quarters of whose 2.8m people are Chinese, has reserves of more than Dollars 40bn. The Chinese dominate the economies of south-east Asian countries. In Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines it is the Chinese - though often only a small minority - who control trade and run the biggest companies. Mr Liem Sioe Liong, an Indonesian Chinese, runs the Salim group, believed to be the biggest in the region with an estimated annual turnover of Dollars 8bn. Mr Liem, who left China as a penniless teenager, is now investing millions in China, much of it in property in areas round his birthplace in Fujian province. Mr Robert Kuok, a Malaysian Chinese, has a business empire mainly involved in commodities and hotels. Mr Kuok is investing in building hotels and commodity processing facilities in various parts of China. Chinese businesses are traditionally family-run, secretive enterprises. A web of Chinese family concerns stretches throughout east Asia and, increasingly, into China. For the most part the overseas Chinese avoid China's cumbersome bureaucracy: in many cases they strike informal deals with local groups, often based on family connections. For some there is a strong emotional attachment to the homeland. But most investments are made for hard-headed commercial reasons. They, like so many others, are intent on making the most of the opportunities available in such a vast market.</p>

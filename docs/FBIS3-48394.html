The ministers decided to readjust the government's long-term  atomic energy policy in an effort to push the country into the  level of advanced nations as soon as possible, the officials  said.    At the same time, the government will preprare for possible  mutual nuclear inspection with North Korea by setting up a body,  tentatively named "The Atomic Energy Control Center," the  ministers agreed. The center is to be established soon under  the Science and Technology Ministry.    The meeting, presided over by Deputy Prime Minister and NUB  Minister Yi Yong-tok, also decided to make efforts to find a  breakthrough through exchange of special envoys with Pyongyang  and make active efforts to reach within this year "the  reconciliation and cooperation stage," the first stage of the  government's three-stage unification formula, by improving the  inter-Korean relations.    The second stage is "the Korean Commonwealth stage," while  the third is "the unified Korea stage."    The government reaffirmed its position that for a solution  to  the North Korean nuclear issue, Pyongyang has to return fully to  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, accept International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection and agree in principle to mutual  nuclear inspection with the South.    Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Yi told the 14 ministers  who  attended the meeting to consult at any time with the NUB before  making their policies related to unification in order to  maintain a consistent government policy on North Korea.</p>

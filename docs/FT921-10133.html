			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour urges pre-Budget incentives  -Economy LABOUR yesterday called on the government to introduce investment incentives for industry before next month's Budget as it sought to pin the blame for the recession firmly on Conservative policies. Its concerted attack included attempts to undermine the credibility of Mr John Major, the prime minister, on economic issues and to cast doubt on the government's ability to engineer a recovery. In particular, the assault targeted the government's repeated contention that present economic difficulties are worldwide. The government responded by branding Labour gloom-merchants and asserting that the worst of the domestic recession was over. Current policies would help to produce low inflation, low interest rates and improved confidence, which were the preconditions for a sustained recovery. In another heated clash with the prime minister, Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, recalled that on Tuesday Mr Major wrongly included Japan among countries whose economies were in recession. Mr Major was 'imagining recovery at home while inventing recessions abroad'. He added: 'There are economies that are slowing - ours is in reverse because of your policies.' Mr Major said growth in Japan 'has slowed or is slowing'. He added that Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, had now acknowledged the 'downturn' in the world situation. He asserted that Labour's policies would result in higher taxes and inflation, and lead to 'perpetual recession'. At an earlier Labour press conference, Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, had questioned the government's ability to steer the economy out of the doldrums. 'It is because the prime minister cannot admit he is wrong that he cannot take action to put the economy right,' he said, using a graph to indicate how the government had repeatedly erred in its economic forecasts. He challenged Mr Major to 'overrule the chancellor over investment incentives now demanded' by industry in a series of Budget submissions. The prime minister's 'claims about a worldwide recession' were simply an attempt to 'shift the blame from the government's own responsibility for economic failure'. Mr Brown returned to this theme in a strongly-worded address in the Commons, during which he stated 'there is no world recession' and claimed Mr Major was condemned by his own words as economically illiterate. Turning to the government's forecasting record, he compared Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, with the weatherman Mr Michael Fish. But whereas Mr Fish was remembered for his mistake over predicting the 1987 hurricanes, the chancellor was utterly reliable. 'He will always let you down,' he said. Mr Brown sought to contrast the positive economic message produced by a number of Tory-leaning newspapers with the more cautious words delivered to shareholders by senior executives of the companies which owned the newspapers. The truth was that the government was conjuring up a recovery which did not exist with a publicity machine which did not even believe in it, he said. Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, forecast that a Labour election victory would be followed by a run on the pound, and challenged Mr Brown to say how he would deal with the situation. Would Labour put up interest rates to maintain the existing parity or would it devalue, he asked. When Mr Brown did not respond, Mr Lilley said that every Labour government had in fact done both. Mr Kenneth Warren (C Hastings and Rye), chairman of the Commons trade and industry committee, called on the chancellor to consider how to raise returns on investment in manufacturing industry and criticised the tough treatment of small business by banks. A Labour motion condemning government economic mismanagement was defeated by 187 votes to 292.</p>

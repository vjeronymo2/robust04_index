			<p>BFN     [Text] The UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] Command in  Zagreb has withdrawn its request for an air corridor over  Bulgaria. The wording of the statement gave as the reason the  delicate nature of the cargo to be transported. The message was  given to the Bulgarian ambassador in Zagreb. According to our  reporter Vladislav Stoychev, the news was made known in  parliament through Nikolay Slatinski, chairman of the National  Security Commission.    I would remind our listeners that prior to this development  a  letter from the commander of the Blue Helmets addressed to the  government was handed over to the Chairman's Council of the  National Assembly. The letter requested an air corridor for a  Ukrainian aircraft that was to carry Finnish Blue Helmets over  the route from Skopje to Helsinki and back.    We have a direct link with our reporter Vladislav Stoychev,  who has further information from parliament:    [Stoychev] Regarding the UNPROFOR request for an air  corridor over Bulgaria, the parliamentary forces today addressed  a question to the Foreign Ministry asking whether similar  flights had taken place previously. A short time ago Yunal  Lyutfi [spokesman for the Movement for Rights and Freedoms  parliamentary group] informed journalists of the preliminary  results of the inquiry, received from an unnamed source in the  Foreign Ministry. The reply stated that -- here I quote --  hundreds of violations of Bulgarian airspace have been  registered under all the governments formed since the adoption  of the present Constitution. [no reference to close of quotation  as heard] This evidently refers to flights not approved by the  National Assembly, as required under the Constitution. Lyutfi  said that at the moment the foreign minister is also carrying  out a check on violations of Bulgarian territorial waters.</p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> TREND TOWARD A 'CITY CALLED CALIFORNIA' SEEN IN ELECTION RESULTS;  </P> <P> POLITICS: A HISTORIAN SAYS REGIONAL CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE NORTH AND SOUTH ARE  GIVING WAY AS THE STATE UNIFIES ECONOMICALLY, POLITICALLY AND CULTURALLY.  </P> <P> California politicians pondered without particular conclusion Wednesday the  dramatic success of Northern California candidates in Tuesday's primary, but  historian Kevin Starr said the balloting reflected a significant trend toward  the economic, political and cultural unification of urban North and South.  </P> <P> "It's a wonderful shift, a very important shift," Starr said.  </P> <P> No longer is the San Francisco Bay Area smarting about being surpassed by  metropolitan Los Angeles as the state's economic and political power base. And  Southern California "doesn't have the cultural chip on its shoulder" it used  to, said Starr, a Northern Californian who regularly commutes to a teaching job  at USC.  </P> <P> Increasingly linked by transportation and communications, the San Francisco-Los  Angeles-San Diego corridor is emerging as "a city called California," added  Starr, author of California histories titled "Inventing the Dream," "Americans  and the California Dream" and "Material Dreams." Politically, Berkeley and  Santa Monica have more in common than Berkeley does with some of its East Bay  neighbors a few miles away in Alameda and Contra Costa counties, he said.  </P> <P> As old animosities and points of pride fade, Southern Californians find  themselves comfortable voting for Northerners, Starr said. Northern  Californians who take the time to get to know Southern California recognize it  as a dynamic, maturing world capital to which they are inextricably linked  economically, he said.  </P> <P> Former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, is the first Northern  Californian to carry a major party banner for governor into a general election  campaign in 24 years -- since Democrat Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr. of San  Francisco ran unsuccessfully for a third term against Republican Ronald Reagan  in 1966.  </P> <P> If elected, Feinstein also would be the first California chief executive to  jump directly from local government into the state's top elective office since  Republican James Rolph Jr. was elected governor in 1930 while serving as San  Francisco mayor. Her opponent in the Nov. 6 general election, Republican Sen.  Pete Wilson, also is a former mayor -- of San Diego -- and would be the first  governor from that city in modern times.  </P> <P> Back in 1974, Pat Brown's son Jerry came along to win the governorship back for  Democrats, but by eschewing his San Francisco-Sacramento boyhood home ground  and consciously choosing Los Angeles as his political power base, first winning  election to the Los Angeles Community College Board of Trustees.  </P> <P> Today, as she goes against Wilson, Feinstein heads a ticket dominated by  Northern Californians, including Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy; Arlo Smith, the San  Francisco district attorney who was an upset winner over Los Angeles County  Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, and state Sen. John Garamendi of Walnut Grove, who  defeated Southerners Bill Press and Conway Collis for the nomination to be the  state's first elected insurance commissioner. Bill Honig, who was elected to a  third term as state superintendent of public instruction Tuesday, is from the  San Francisco Bay Area.  </P> <P> The Republican slate more closely reflects the growing GOP power base in  Southern California, but appointed state Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes, who was  nominated for a full term, is from Sacramento. Wilson served in the capital as  a member of the state Assembly in the 1970s, and Marian Bergeson of Newport  Beach, the party's nominee for lieutenant governor, is an incumbent state  senator who is respected by the Sacramento power Establishment.  </P> <P> The success of the Northerners captured the imagination of Sacramento political  veterans Wednesday. But they declined to find dramatic patterns in the tea  leaves.  </P> <P> "I guess we suffer the inevitable beltway mentality," said Robert Forsyth, an  aide to Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles). "We tend to  discount L.A. -- to assume that because Reiner's L.A., Reiner gets it."  </P> <P> Reiner was far better known than Smith, his San Francisco counterpart, going  into their contest for the nomination for attorney general, but he also was  plagued by far higher negative views among those familiar with his  controversial career. The underdog Smith campaigned tirelessly throughout  Southern California while Reiner made only token campaign forays into the  North.  </P> <P> Forsyth and others attributed the success of other Northerners to  characteristics of the individual candidates and contests rather than the  strength of their geographic base. Feinstein ran as a candidate who could rise  above geographic differences and bring disparate parts of California together.  "Nobody thought I would get a plurality of votes in Southern California, but I  did," she told a San Francisco news conference Wednesday. "Our destinies are  intertwined."  </P> <P> If nothing else, the election demonstrates that being from the North is not, in  itself, a barrier to statewide success. And the fact remains, Forsyth said,  that "it would be fantasy to think that a Northern Californian could win  without Southern California money. The money is still in the Los Angeles area."  </P> <P> Feinstein's edge over Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp of Los Angeles was  remarkably uniform throughout much of California. Some of her biggest margins,  with 56% of the vote, came not in her home city of San Francisco, but in  Alameda County across the bay and in Sacramento.  </P> <P> Another Sacramento expert who declined to be identified said Feinstein's  success gives even more power to Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San  Francisco), a close ally of Feinstein's. But the expert said the primary's  other big legislative winner is a Southerner, Assemblyman Richard D. Katz  (D-Sylmar), who helped write and lead the campaign for Proposition 111, the  $18.5-billion transportation finance measure approved by voters Tuesday. Katz  also was a major figure in promotion of Proposition 112, the successful  legislative ethics program, and an initiative banning the trophy hunting of  mountain lions in California.  </P></p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Curing communism's farming blight - Russia's reforming agriculture minister talks to Leyla Boulton RUSSIA'S AGRICULTURE minister, Mr Viktor Khlystun, came to office last November with a mission to reform Russian agriculture. But far too much of his time is still taken up with day-to-day management of the moribund farming system build up over seven decades of communist rule. Although he has no concrete results to show for it, he says market reforms begun in January have already changed people's psychology. 'You don't need to chase drunk tractor drivers around any more,' he says. 'But what is happening now is only the beginning: to talk of the effectiveness of reform so far is premature.' Despite the familiar scramble to 'save' the harvest, which according to the minister will improve to about 96m tonnes of grain, he is confident that there will be no hunger in Russia this winter as scare-mongers at home and abroad like to predict. 'We can't sell what is produced. We have 300,000 tonnes of meat in cold store. Consumption per head will fall compared to last winter, but only because of a drop in the population's purchasing power (following price liberalisation in January)' he says. His very early estimate is that Russia will have to import 17m tonnes of grain in 1992-93 on top of 3m tonnes already committed by the neighbouring former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan. But this 46-year-old former land-use specialist has made it a very definite priority over the next year to alter the structure of imports to increase the share of protein feed so that less imported and domestic grain is wasted on feeding livestock. He also wants to encourage domestic farmers to grow more soyabeans and lupins, which are the components of more economical protein feed. The balance-sheet of what has actually changed in Russian agriculture over the past year remains modest. The poor storage, processing, transport, and distribution systems, identified by a World Bank report as accounting for the loss of a third of what is produced, are only just beginning to be tackled. Although he makes no attempt to hide the short-comings, Mr Khlystun says in his own defence that 'you cannot create a new storage system in eight months'. His task in this instance is complicated by the fact that the government is trying to build up domestic capacity to manufacture storage facilities rather than purchase ready-made storage complexes offered by foreign companies. And as long as privatisation is slow and de-monopolisation is absent, the distribution of food is likely to remain chaotic. The minister bemoans the fact that proper wholesale markets are still lacking. As an example of what is going wrong, Mr Khlystun points to the situation in the far north Arkhangelsk region, where meat processing capacity is worked flat out but state trading organisations are not bringing meat into the shops because of a lack of incentive to sell it. Despite a series of negotiations with foreign companies, foreign investment in new processing and distribution capacity has not materialised, not to mention capital from Russian business sources. With food processing declared a priority for the government's attempts to institute an industrial policy next year, Mr Khlystun says financial incentives will also be on offer although nothing has materialised yet. Parliament has continued to block legislation allowing the free purchase and sale of land. But, apart from calling for 'more explanatory work' to win over recalcitrant deputies under the control of a powerful old state farming lobby, Mr Khlystun says that a presidential decree is being prepared to set up a land bank system that will allow the use of land as collateral. Although Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi was recently given the task of overseeing agricultural reform, the bulk of the responsibility and the funds for it remain under the control of the agriculture ministry. Asked to help one of the thousands of private farmers trying to make it in a hostile environment, Mr Khlystun was able to demonstrate that the central government still has some clout in the provinces despite the erosion of the old administrative-command system. Everybody from the district administration boss to the two chiefs of the local farming association and an assistant to the regional governor showed up to sort out the farmer's problems on the day I visited the the farm. But there are thousands of other farmers who remain at the mercy of local authorities which may or may not enforce central government reforms, and of semi-official organisations who may or may not be honest in transferring state credits for private farming. Although he once admitted at a news conference to being embarrassed whenever he was driven past poorly-stocked food shops, Mr Khlystun finds some comfort in the long-term view. He believes the reforms will succeed in making Russian farming more efficient and vastly improve food supplies - but it may take ten to 12 years.</p>

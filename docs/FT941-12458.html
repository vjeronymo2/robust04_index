			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / How to Spend It: You simply must discover the right niche - Mail-order catalogues are no longer needed just for bringing boring essentials into your home - these days even the most quirky commodities can be bought by post 'Inessential shopping is bliss', says the actress Joan Collins in My Secrets. I am with her. What more delightful way to spend the day in central London than with a visit to Joseph and on to Harvey Nichols followed by a snack at Joe's Cafe and sharing some chit-chat with your best friend? It is the essential shopping that gets one down. The search for a giant pack of washing-powder, bottles of mineral water . . . these are not the stuff of exciting sorties. It is for purchases such as these that mail-order was tailor-made. But the truly surprising thing is that mail-order is no longer used just for bringing most of life's more boring essentials to the door - these days even life's most inessential quirky commodities can be bought by post. Almost every month brings yet another catalogue carefully aimed at some newly-identified slice of the market. These are known as niche catalogues and whether you are looking for an exclusive fishing rod, some vintage clothing or a fine string of pearls, someone, somewhere will bring it to you. Newest of them is Sam Walker. Those who are familiar with the shop at 41 Neal Street, Covent Garden, will know it as a purveyor of highly desirable vintage clothing. There are summer linen jackets to conjure up summer days on the village green, Chesterfield coats that Noel Coward might have worn, snap-brimmed felt hats straight from Brief Encounter. As the vogue for vintage clothing grew, somehow Sam Walker seemed able to keep tabs on sources and now he has launched a mail order service which offers a combination of old clothing - reconditioned, of course - and some special Sam Walker brands that are made today in the mood and style of times gone by. The catalogue looks as if has been found in some dusty, pre-war attic. The graphic style is almost pure Boys' Own. There are plus-fours straight from a 1920s golf course (from Pounds 25), tweed and corduroy jackets (Pounds 49), four-quarter tweed caps (Pounds 25) and slightly caddish striped linen summer blazers (Pounds 195). Sam Walker's own branded shoes, all in impeccably nostalgic mood, range from Wingtip Brogues (Pounds 65) to Chukka Boots (Pounds 75) and cricket shoes (Pounds 65). An authentic all-purpose Gloverall duffle coat - remember Jack Hawkins in The Cruel Sea? - in navy, tan, bottle green, black or cranberry red ranges from Pounds 109 to Pounds 125, depending on size. There is also a range of Aero leatherwear - Charles Lindbergh-style, Long-shoreman and cyclists' jackets and proper jackets. Nostalgic man, of course, requires nostalgic accessories and Sam Walker provides them - fogeyish waistcoats, pocket watches, wristwatches (in particular there is a sturdily plain and elegant Tali wristwatch based on a 1920s design for Pounds 49.95), braces, sunglasses (all based on 1920s, 30s, 40s and 50s styles) and cufflinks. Telephone 071-240-7800 for a free catalogue. Racing Green has grown and grown since last I mentioned it. Besides the new store at 193-197 Regent Street, London W1, where all those who like to see their merchandise before they write the cheque can browse, there is a new, expanded catalogue. Those who had a disappointing experience with Racing Green in its early days might like to know that it was originally overwhelmed by its success and had trouble keeping up with orders. Now there is a new warehouse and a computerised stock system which seems to function well. The spring catalogue has been launched (ring 0345-331177 for a free copy) and all the old favourite are there - the button-down poplin shirts (Pounds 27), the city top (Pounds 19) in lots of new colours, cotton twill shorts for men and women (Pounds 25) and in good safari colours for Africa lovers, the T-shirts (Pounds 11) in masses of colours. There is a lot that is new, too - a simple summer cotton dress in mole, burnt orange or china blue as well as chambray (Pounds 35), a blue and white checked or striped jean shirt for men (Pounds 35), a soft linen trouser suit for women (Pounds 99 for the blazer, Pounds 49 for the trousers) and some good cotton rib basics that could double as underwear or outerwear. Myko is a new name to mail order and it seems to have defined as its niche the minimalist, pared-down look. Beautifully photographed with a slim, carefully-edited selection of what it calls 'body basics' it could be the answer to clothing needs of the health club, gym, fitness addict, as well as those who just like lounging around in comfort. It is designed, too, to appeal to the minimalist travellers. Those whose natural instincts lead them more to the baroque school of travelling may find it a little too pared-down for their more fulsome needs but they are easy to pack and being of a limited colour palette (mainly cream, white or black) everything will work with everything else, making up a small capsule wardrobe. There is a linen collection of palazzo pants (Pounds 34.99), puff-sleeve body (Pounds 24.99), micro-shorts (Pounds 14.99) and sleeveless vest (Pounds 14.99). Then there is a linen tube dress (not easy to wear unless you are young, slim and beautiful but then that is presumably the point of all that gym-going) and a collection of micro-shorts and leggings, fitness bras and leotards for the the fitness enthus-iast. Prices are extremely good - there is nothing more than Pounds 39.99 (ring 0764-679479 for a copy of the catalogue). Many of you will be familiar with Brooks Brothers clothing. Much of it is loved the world over but certain items have a cult following and those whose sartorial identity is dependent on them cannot always rely on getting to America often enough to satisfy their needs. Smart Italian bankers in London, for instance, who feel inadequately dressed unless they are sporting soft Supima button-down shirts or, off-duty, pure cashmere cardigans and twill sports shirts - often pinched by their girlfriends - have discovered the ease with which they can shop for these essentials by mail. Simply ring (908) 225-4860 between 8.30am and 4.30pm (New York time) or fax (908) 225-1520 for a free copy of the catalogue. The company will deliver almost anywhere in the world and the prices are listed clearly and concisely. But, for the fisherman's hat in beige, trimmed with a fine blue and Bordeaux stripe, which the same Italian bankers consider de rigueur for weekending in Chelsea - baseball caps are totally demode - only a visit to the US will do. Good to know some things still reward a little effort.</p>

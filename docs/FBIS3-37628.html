Nazarbayev did not conceal his doubts as to the "sincerity  of  Russia's kind feelings" for its CIS partners. The claims by  some Moscow officials that Russia has special interests in these  states and their bid to set up military bases there, the  Kazakhstani leader stressed, do not inspire trust. He therefore  proposed first looking into Moscow's real intentions in such  countries as Georgia, Tajikistan, or Azerbaijan.    In President Nazarbayev's opinion, after the breakup of the  USSR everything on Kazakhstan's territory is its property, so  Russia has no say in the use of the scientific laboratories at  the Semipalatinsk test range or the space installations.    In Washington, Nazarbayev kept himself emphatically  independent of Moscow's policy, surprising even Bill Clinton.  The U.S. President made an unsuccessful attempt to win his  interlocutor over to the plan to pump Kazakhstani oil not  through Iran and Turkey but via the Black Sea port of  Novorossiysk. Another $85 million in backing was promised for  this project. However, the guest stuck to his guns. Fearing  domestic instability in Russia, he said that he prefers to have  more reliable outlets to warm seas -- the Persian Gulf or the  Mediterranean.    This involves a major contract with the U.S. Chevron company  equivalent, according to Nazarbayev, to the "Alaskan field," and  also a newly-created Caspian Shelf consortium to explore for and  extract oil and gas, which includes the U.S. firm Mobil Oil.  The Russian Foreign Ministry has already sent a protest note  regarding the illegality of the decision to start drilling work  on the Caspian seabed, since the other littoral countries had  not given their assent.    However, there is every indication that Almaty ignored this,  and in New York Nazarbayev once again confirmed that the highly  promising project will be implemented.    En route home Nursultan Nazarbayev made a stopover in Paris,  where he briefed Francois Mitterrand on the results of his  successful visit to Washington. There are no plans for a  stopover in Moscow.</p>

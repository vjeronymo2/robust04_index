			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Berlin -- Russia continues to demand a joint  farewell ceremony for all troops of the World War II anti-Hitler  coalition in Berlin. It would be sensible to say farewell to  the troops of Russia, the United States, Great Britain, and  France in a joint ceremony in Berlin, the supreme commander of  the Western Group of Russian Forces, Burlakov, told journalists  in Berlin on Friday [29 April].    Burlakov is not content with the planned farewell ceremony  in  the Weimar national theater and at the monument to the Russian  Forces in Berlin-Treptow, which is to be attended by Russian  President Boris Yeltsin and Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The main  reason for his objection is the proximity of the former  Buchenwald concentration camp near Weimar. It would be a  sacrilege "to dance in that place." [passage omitted]    Burlakov said he is "very concerned" about housing and the  troops' reintegration in their home country. While withdrawal  from German territory is on schedule, housing construction lags  far behind. A total of 48,824 families have left Germany  without having apartments to got to in Russia. Under the  housing program funded by Germany, of the planned 32 housing  estates with 34,982 apartments, only six estates with 9,080  apartments have been built over the last nine months.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [HOLOS UKRAYINY commentary: ``The Kremlin Fog''] </F>   [Text] There is no doubt that the appeal by Russian  designers, scientists, and specialists from the Atomic Energy  Ministry to citizens and governments of world states appeared at  the Kremlin's directive. Its goal is to intimidate the world  with the dangerous state of Ukrainian nuclear warheads.  However, concealed behind the pathos and demagoguery of the  authors of the appeal is blatant deception meant for  dilettantes. It is stressed in the appeal that the danger lies  in the ``absence of systematic technological servicing,''  ``failure to replace components in time,'' and ``conducting  repairs not provided for by the specifications.'' However, it  is... Russian specialists, who are supposed to watch and fulfill  all of this together with our specialists. Yes, yes, precisely  Russian. In accordance with the interstate agreement on  scheduled and repair servicing of intercontinental ballistic  missiles located on the Ukrainian territory. As Ukraine's Vice  Prime Minister V. Shmarov pointed out at a recent news  conference dealing with the ratification of START-1 by the  Ukrainian Supreme Council, this agreement is presently being  fulfilled, and there is no reason to be concerned about the  state of the intercontinental ballistic missiles.    Nor are the Russian scientists sincere when the write the  following in their appeal: ``Those politicians who maintain  that nuclear munitions may be dismantled in Ukraine are not  telling the truth.'' Not a single politician made any such  statements anywhere. On the contrary, that same Valeriy Shmarov  said at that same news conference that the nuclear warheads may  only be dismantled at manufacturer plants, more specifically, in  Russia.    Therefore, the appeal by Russian designers and scientists  confuses the vile and the holy. Striving to obtain, as soon as  possible, our intercontinental ballistic missiles, in addition  to the already obtained operational and tactical nuclear  weapons, to start selling nuclear weapons components in the  West, and to earn further billions of dollars, the authors of  the appeal, on the directive from the Kremlin, are trying to  obscure the issue.</p>

			<p>BFN     [From the "Vesti" newscast; Kokoshkin remarks recorded  throughout]    [Text] [Video shows Chernomyrdin visit to China] First  Deputy  Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin, who has just been with  Chernomyrdin in China, has continued to strengthen our military  contacts, to expand the exchange of servicemen and vessels  which, he said, aroused no suspicion on the part of our common  good friend, India. Military-technical cooperation with Beijing  is based on the fact that Chinese combat equipment is originally  based on our weapons.    [Kokoshin] They are seen by the Chinese army and the Chinese  navy as the most suitable for them to produce.    [Peslyak] There is a world-wide struggle for the armaments  market but the Chinese side itself wants to develop, for  example, combat aircraft construction on the basis of Russian  achievements, starting from small beginnings.    [Kokoshin] At this stage it is a question of, specifically,  supplying a batch of SU-27s.    [Peslyak] Kokoshin said that at present the development of  not only Russia's military but also its civilian technologies is  being paid for from the defense budget, not to mention that this  expenditure is to a large extent social expenditure since it  provides for closed military and scientific townlets.    [Kokoshin] Today expenditure on defense research and  development is money being spent on strengthening Russia's  position in the world economy.</p>

			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Observer: Penang party-goer Surely Kenneth Clarke deserves a well-earned Christmas rest? He has licked Britain's balance of payments problem, conquered inflation and got the economy growing at more than 4 per cent a year. Time to relax. Not a bit of it. While the nation rests, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer will be back at work on Wednesday, holding his regular monthly monetary policy meeting with the governor of the Bank of England. Then he is off for a fortnight's business trip to the Far East, where he will be in Penang on New Year's eve. Not a bad place for a party, according to aficionados.</p>

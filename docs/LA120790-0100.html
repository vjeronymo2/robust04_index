			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: UPSCALE HOUSING IN O.C. STILL LESS THAN HOMES IN U.K., JAPAN  </P> <P> In a recent wire service story about executives hunting for homes, a writer in  Vancouver, Canada, compared the prices of upscale "executive" homes in suburban  Chevy Chase, Md., with those in "Los Angeles' Orange County."  </P> <P> Obviously, either the writer needs a geography lesson or Orange County needs a  better publicist.  </P> <P> The story said that executive housing in Orange County, which hasn't belonged  to Los Angeles for 102 years, carries a median price tag in the $500,000 range.  </P> <P> That may sound like a lot, but it's cheap compared to the cost of executive  homes in Tokyo and London, which at well over $1 million are among the world's  most expensive. In contrast, executive homes in Pittsburgh and Belfast,  Northern Ireland, are among the cheapest at less than $225,000.  </P></p>

Both of them reaffirmed the position of wanting to conclude  the negotiations in the auto sector by the time of the  Japan-U.S. summit in February. But debate on setting numerical  targets is still ongoing with no differences in views being  narrowed.    Under Secretary Garten said: "We are not seeking managed  trade. Nor are we seeking to set the numberical targets as  objective criteria." But he added, "We need criteria to measure  the degree of progress made" if trade balance in the auto  sector, which remains a large factor in Japan's huge trade  surplus, is to be improved.    On the other hand, Okamatsu emphasized once again that Japan  would continue to reject the setting of numerical targets as a  way of measuring the degree of foreign products' entry into the  Japanese market.    Regarding the fact that the United States is pressing Japan  to open its market, citing higher shares which foreign products  hold in other major nations, Okamatsu insisted that "foreign  products' share in the United States is not much different from  their share in Japan" if the products from NAFTA member nations  are excluded. He thus called on the United States to rethink  its idea on criteria.</p>

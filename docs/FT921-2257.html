			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Ukrainian confusion on nuclear options UKRAINIAN leaders yesterday angrily denied reports that they had reversed their decision to halt the shipment of tactical nuclear missiles to Russia. They said they were ready to have the weapons dismantled in Russia as originally planned, but only on condition this took place under international supervision, for which no provision has been made. The denial of both Russian and Nato reports underscores the tense relations between Ukraine and Russia and the confusion surrounding the control of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union on the eve of a crucial meeting of leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States in Kiev. Mr Anatoli Zlenko, the Ukrainian foreign minister, said that 'no-one has revoked the decision of the president.' President Leonid Kravchuk last week announced that Ukraine was halting the transfer of the weapons to Russia because it had no guarantees that they were being dismantled. On Wednesday, President Boris Yeltsin, the Russian leader, was quoted as saying Ukraine had reversed its decision, and this was backed up by a Nato spokesman. Yesterday western diplomats in Moscow were treating the Ukrainian insistence on international monitoring as a face-saving gesture. They believe Ukraine has indeed submitted to the necessity of returning the missiles to Russia by July because of pressure from western states, particularly the US and Canada. One western defence attache said: 'I think we can say that this was a false alarm. Once the US and Canada, which have been the most sympathetic to the Ukrainian position, had made it clear they wouldn't wear it, then they are bound to carry out what they had promised.' Ukrainian officials admit it was a mistake for Mr Kravchuk not to consult western powers before making his announcement. Western states, including the US, Britain, and France, have promised technical assistance in the dismantling of the nuclear missiles on Russian territory, although there is no provision for international supervision of the process.</p>

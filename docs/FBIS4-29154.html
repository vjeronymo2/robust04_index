			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Doan Duy Thanh, chairman of Vietnam Chamber </F> of Commerce and Industry by an unidentified radio correspondent  on the former's recent visit to the UK, France, Belgium, and  Italy; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Summary] [Doan Duy Thanh] The visit to Western European  countries by the Vietnamese delegation of the Chamber of  Commerce and Industry was aimed at increasing contacts with our  counterparts in the UK, France, Belgium, and Italy to enable a  better exchange of working experiences. The chambers of  commerce in these countries have been established for nearly a  hundred years. Therefore, we need to exchange management and  organizational experiences with our colleagues in those  countries. We also went there to look for import-export and  trading counterparts.    [Correspondent] "Despite being very far away from us, the  government and people of these Western European countries have  sympathized with and lent great material and spiritual support  to Vietnam. What is their current understanding and evaluation  of the renovation undertaking in Vietnam? Is there anything new  in their assistance to Vietnam?"    [Doan Duy Thanh] It is possible to say that these countries  highly evaluate the Vietnamese renovation. They always say that  Vietnam can become a country with a strong economy. They also  say that the direction taken by Vietnam is correct. In  particular, they highly evaluate our political stability because  an economy cannot succeed without political stability.    These four countries have enjoyed time-honoured relations  with our country. They all want to help us. For example,  England is the first country to sponsor their importers and  exporters in doing business with Vietnam. France has helped  Vietnam a lot in dealing with the Paris Club and the IMF.  However, the businessmen in these four countries do not  thoroughly understand Vietnam's economic situation. On our  trip, we tried to help them with their misgivings by clearly  presenting Vietnam's difficulties, problems, and favorable  conditions for business.    [Correspondent] "Dear comrade, the UK, France, Belgium, and  Italy all are developed countries. According to you, what can  Vietnam learn from these countries?"    [Doan Duy Thanh] Those countries have a lot of experience in  business management. They also possess a high level of  technology in many areas. They can help us and we can learn  from them in the fields of the capital market, business  consultancy, the introduction of a share holding system, banking  services, auditing, computing, tourism, port and airport  management, and so forth.    [Correspondent] Could you brief us on the commercial  cooperation between Vietnam and those countries and the  prospects for that cooperation in the future?    [Doan Duy Thanh] Our development has been very good in  recent  years. Regarding trading, it is possible to say that our goods  have penetrated all markets. We spotted Vietnamese goods in  France, Italy, Belgium, and the UK. With new favorable  conditions, I think Vietnamese goods will definitely do better  in the Western European and European Common markets.    [Correspondent] "Thank you, comrade."</p>

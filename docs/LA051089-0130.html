			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Fierce thunderstorms whipped the Mississippi Delta, battering the area with  high winds. Thunderstorms and hailstorms also socked the Carolinas, Georgia,  the Ohio Valley and Oklahoma, the weather service said. Mississippi's storms  spread to Louisiana by late morning, pelting the towns of Mira and Benton with  golfball-sized hail. The weather service clocked winds at Mira at 62 m.p.h. At  the state prison in Parchman, Miss., a corrections officer suffered a broken  leg when the watchtower she was in collapsed in high winds, officials said. A  second guard suffered a minor injury. About 80 staff homes and three mobile  homes were damaged.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUBARAK REPORTEDLY GOING TO SYRIA  </P> <P> Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was expected to travel to Syria today, a sign  of improvement in relations between the two Arab nations, which have been at  odds since Egypt signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, a Beirut daily  newspaper reported Monday.  </P> <P> The leftist As-Safir newspaper, quoting Arab sources in Cairo, said that  Mubarak would pay a two-day visit to Syria starting today and would meet with  President Hafez Assad.  </P> <P> Mubarak's expected visit to Damascus followed talks with Syrian Vice President  Abdel-Halim Khaddam held in Cairo on Saturday, the sources said. Khaddam  delivered a message from Assad to Mubarak during his 24-hour trip to Egypt.  </P> <P> Egyptian-Syrian ties started to warm last year after Cairo recognized a  Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip declared by  Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Syria  considers itself a defender of the Palestinian cause.  </P></p>

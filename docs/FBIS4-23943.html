			<p>BFN     [Text] Manica Province Governor Artur Canana has described  as inconceivable the allegation made by the National Democratic  Party, Panade, that the provincial government is infiltrating  foreigners into Mossurize, Manica, and Barue Districts to  register and vote for the Mozambique Liberation Front in the  upcoming multiparty elections. Artur Canana said the government  is not interested in promoting such infiltration, reiterating  that it wants peace. Panade issued a communique two weeks ago,  accusing the Manica Province government of allowing foreigners  to enter the country and register in those districts.</p>

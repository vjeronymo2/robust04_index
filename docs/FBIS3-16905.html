It wants to be an equal  partner, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko told a news  conference in Lvov, western Ukraine, on Monday.    The minister made a stopover in Lvov on his way from the  Czech Republic to Poland where he will discuss the Partnership  for Peace Programme.    Zlenko pointed out that Ukraine is interested in expanding  regional and sub-regional cooperation, particularly with the  Carpathian region, and joining the Visegrad group which unites  Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary.    The minister said that the opinion that Ukraine is not  welcome in Europe is wrong, adding that after Poland he will fly  to Brussels to sign an agreement on cooperation with the  European Union. "Ukraine can and will cooperate with Western  states. It has a potential for equal cooperation. There is  also a reciprocal interest among the European powers," he said.</p>

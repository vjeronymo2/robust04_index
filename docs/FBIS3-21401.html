			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ibrahim Humaydi: "Command Decision in PFLP; Will </F> Move Home in 1998"]    [Text] One of the questions that received different  responses after President Hafiz al-Asad's meeting with Bill  Clinton in Geneva last month is the fate of the 10 Palestinian  factions that make Damascus their headquarters and the effect of  that meeting on those factions' presence in the Syrian capital,  especially since they oppose the Gaza-Jericho Agreement between  Israel and the PLO. That agreement is supported by the American  administration, which has put its weight behind it, considering  it a "first step" toward a resolution of the Arab-Israeli  conflict.    Since the middle of last month, reports have circulated  about  the possibility of these organizations moving from Damascus to  countries like Sudan or Iraq after the cordon nations are closer  to agreement with Israel. Analysts see a connection between  Syrian-Israeli progress, and those factions' effectiveness  against the agreement and the peace process, in light of  President Clinton's announcement that the summit talks had  touched on the matter of the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC], led by Ahmad Jibril, and  the rest of the opposition forces located in Syria, such as the  PFLP and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine  [DFLP], led by George Habash and Nayif Hawatimah.    High-level PFLP sources report its firm intention to move  gradually from Damascus into the occupied territories, and that  it strongly rejects any possibility of moving to any other Arab  or regional capital, such as Baghdad or Tehran.    These sources added that leaders in the Front see factors  that will require moving the command decision from abroad into  the territories. "That is because the Gaza-Jericho Agreement  will be applied in the occupied territories and our opposition  to it will be there. What is meant by gradual steps is that we  need some time to establish this. All the Front's weight and the  decision-making center will be in the territories by the Sixth  Conference in 1998. However, now, we are still balancing matters  between the two areas, so that we can ensure participation  abroad with those who are in fact located at home."    These high-placed sources see a connection between  implementing the Oslo Agreement and a mechanism for the Front's  action at home, which could lead to "radical changes in methods,  since we are working in two directions. In any event, the work  will remain directed against the Israelis." In the first  direction, the Front's mission is to escalate military action  and "violence" against the Israeli forces remaining in the  occupied territories, because what will happen is re-deployment  and not withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. At the same time, PFLP  cadres will oppose the self-governing-administrative authority,  "by democratic, non-violent means." They will take part in all  self-governing organizations except "the one that will have a  political, leadership role, so that we will not be  responsible--legally and politically--for implementing the  agreement in the eyes of the people." They will pursue all  avenues of action, except for "military action."    The sources denied any link between the changes that are  ongoing in the Front's mechanism for action and the development  of the Arab-Israeli negotiation processes. They said that "the  Fifth Conference, which decided the question of shifting the  weight to the occupied territories, was held before the  appearance of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement, or rather, came  in a stage of stumbling in the peace process." They pointed out  the lack of any uneasiness among PFLP members located in  Damascus after the Geneva summit. "We are allies of Syria, but  we do not agree 100 percent on political positions. It will be a  long time before we feel direct repercussions from the peace  process."    While predictions continue about PFLP offices moving to  another place in light of visits made by Front officials to  several regional countries, these same sources stress that there  is no plan to stay away from the occupied territories  geographically. "Our decision is always to move closer to the  battlefield and not away from it."</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market excited by ICI news THE SHOCK news that ICI was considering demerging its businesses overshadowed the chemical group's disappointing interim results and sent the share price soaring. Opening at 1095p, the stock rose rapidly, touching 1229p before declining in hectic dealings to close a net 76 ahead at 1171p with a hefty 14m traded. Chemicals observers were most excited by the prospect of the proposed ICI Bio group, which would include ICI's pharmaceutical, agrochemical, seed and specialty chemical businesses, believing it would pave the way for further merger or acquisition opportunities in these industries. For this reason, Fisons, long tipped as a potential partner for ICI's drugs and agrochemical interests, rose 10 to 173p with a substantial 9.5m dealt. While details of the plan are scarce, Mr Martin Glen at Lehman Brothers says he would put an initial value on the new ICI of 1250p, giving ICI Bio an earnings per share of 15p and the new ICI one of 10p. The excitement overshadowed ICI's interim report, which pointed to continuing tough trading conditions and, somewhat ironically, the poor showing by the pharmaceutical and agrochem divisions. Lehman cut its forecast for this year by Pounds 50m to Pounds 800m and for 1993 by Pounds 80m to Pounds 920m. Kleinwort Benson is on similar ground, forecasting Pounds 805m and Pounds 920m respectively. Marks placing Traders were impressed when the market absorbed a very large placing of 21.15m shares in Marks and Spencer without too much problem yesterday. The shares were placed by Cazenove at 305p on behalf of trustees in the Marks and Spencer pension fund, which was reacting to professional advice against pension scheme investment in shares of its own company. On turnover of 43m, Marks finished 8 lower at 311p. Legislation requires a pension fund to reduce any equity holding in its own company to less than 5 per cent by March 1994. Before yesterday's placing, Mark's pension fund held 24m shares in the company, representing about 7 per cent of its total assets by value. It retains a holding of 2.85m shares. The last set of interim figures from Midland Bank, now under the control of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking (HSBC), caused only the merest flicker in HSBC shares, which eased 1 1/2 to 335 1/2 p on 8.2m turnover. Lloyds Bank, reporting first-half figures this morning, gained 5 to 424p, but National Westminster dipped 5 to 325p and Barclays 3 to 319p. Dealings commenced in TransAtlantic, the life assurance company which took over Sun Life. The shares were initially quoted below the 190p mark but gradually improved to end a very quiet debut session at 195p. Widespread bad publicity regarding water quality inspired some persistent selling of Thames Water, 7 off at 405p. Other poor performers in the sector included Anglian Water, 6 down at 388p, North West, 5 cheaper at 412p, and Yorkshire, 9 weaker at 428p. Suggestions that James Capel, the agency broker, had been recommending a switch out of the Scottish generators into National Power and PowerGen triggered some big activity in the sector. National (239p) and PowerGen (251p) added 4 each, but Scottish Power retreated 5 to 184p and Scottish Hydro eased to 204 1/2 p. Heavy US buying of BP died away, the shares slipping 2 1/2 to 214p after an initial level of 218p. Turnover reached 9m. Shell also ran into a flurry of small but persistent selling, closing a net 3 off at 466p. Lasmo was heavily traded, with 7.9m shares changing hands, and the stock was finally a shade off at 133p. Bad publicity over the group's oil and gas acquisitions in Kazakhstan saw British Gas dip 2 1/2 to 246 1/2 p on turnover of 8.5m shares. Cable and Wireless ran up strongly to close 12 higher at 537p, with the market said to be responding to a bullish view of the stock adopted by broker Strauss Turnbull. MicroFocus forged ahead 45 to 1715p, with demand stimulated by the strong performance of Wall Street in recent sessions. British Aerospace staged a strong rally after the heavy selling induced by worries about the group's long-term strategy. Stimulated by a handful of buy notes, notably one from leading research house County NatWest, the shares climbed 11 to 206p, with dealers still aware of hints that GEC may be lurking in the background as a potential predator. Property shares were again under pressure as an abundance of stock hit the leading issues. Hammerson 'A' tumbled 26 to 213p, Great Portland Estates 7 to 110p and British Land 3 to 168p. MEPC lost 17 to 226p, with turnover boosted by a late trade of 4.4m shares at 210p, believed to have been a bed and breakfast, or tax-related, deal. Hotel group Forte bounced after positive comments to analysts that some parts of the hotel market were showing signs of resilience, and also news of a large contract awarded to its subsidiary Gardner Merchant. The shares rallied 6 to 150p. The brewing and drinks sector was generally weak, with Grand Metropolitan losing 8 to 415p after a small downward revision in its profits forecast by Lehman Brothers. The US securities house remained positive on the stock, however, saying that any weakness in GrandMet's US food operations is likely to be offset by benefits in the international spirits trade. Guinness slipped 12 to 532p, while Bass shed 7 to 538p. Allied-Lyons' performance was relatively more positive, after this week's decision that its brewing deal with Carlsberg will go ahead in spite of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's modifications to the agreement. The shares finished just  1/2 off at 615p. Regional brewer Gibbs Mew, an unlisted security, jumped 30 to 168p on an 'unsolicited approach' by Brierley Investments, which said it is considering making an offer, although no price or terms have been indicated. Hepworth, the building products group, added 4 at 310p after interim figures above City forecasts. But expectations of a big bounce in the building materials sector proved premature. RMC remained under constant pressure and fell 12 to 489p. Mirror Group Newspapers held at 69p but turnover, which stalled on Wednesday after a series of heavy trading sessions, began to pick up again. By the close of business yesterday some 3.3m shares had changed hands, with a block of 1.2m traded late in the session at 68p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (8).

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Political Asylum for Bettino?"] </F>   [Excerpt] Tunis -- If he wanted it, [former Italian  Socialist leader] Bettino Craxi would be given political asylum  by Tunisia. And, with asylum in his pocket, he could say  farewell for ever to Milan, the Clean Hands judges,  investigations, and possible prosecution. Thus the Tunisian  Government would be granting the former Socialist leader -- and  former head of the Italian Government -- the understanding that  he deserves as someone "persecuted" by Italian justice, and  therefore the right to live undisturbed in Hammamet.    The possibility of "asylum" being granted to Craxi was  publicized yesterday by Italian press agencies, who were  reporting a statement made by a "Tunisian Government official  source" --not further identified--who was quoted in the last  issue of the weekly JEUNE AFRIQUE. The statement in question is  very curt, almost resentful, and rather undiplomatic. The  official source said the following: "If Bettino Craxi requests  political asylum, we will give a response. Tunisia is free to  grant political asylum to whomever it chooses, just as European  countries are. In such a case, the extradition agreement we  have with Italy would not apply."    As a matter of fact, Italy and Tunisia maintain rather  friendly relations, and these have resulted in bilateral  agreements in many fields, including judiciary matters. The  offenses for which Craxi is being indicted are all covered by  the treaty.    The source, whose statements were denied by the Tunisian  Government a few hours later, made further "revelations" to the  weekly, explaining, among other things, the meticulous and  strict security service established around the Craxi family's  home, in the following words: "We do not want to have a new  Abu-Jahad case on our hands (Abu-Jahad, a key aide of Yasir  'Arafat, was killed in Tunis by an Israeli commando -- LA  REPUBBLICA editor's note): After all, an assassin might be  hiding among the journalists."    However, as reported above, the source was disowned almost  at  once. Tunisian diplomats stressed that, so far, the Tunisian  authorities have made no offers of political asylum to Bettino  Craxi, nor has indeed the former Italian Socialist Party  secretary submitted any such request to this north African  country's government.

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / International Company News: Zucchi keeps its head down on expansion - Haig Simonian examines the Italian textile group's strategy for beating the downturn FALLING first-half net profits at Zucchi, Europe's leading producer of household textiles, look set to threaten the Italian group's six-year record of earnings and dividend growth. Net earnings for the first six months of 1992, to be announced this month, will probably be down by between 25 and 30 per cent on reduced sales, warns Mr Manlio Alberto Zucchi, operations director. However, Mr Zucchi, whose two uncles, Giordano and Manlio, are the company's chairman and managing director respectively, hopes recovery in the second half will be strong enough for full-year profits to dip only slightly to L28bn-L30bn (Dollars 22.4m-Dollars 24m), against L34.9bn last year. Sales should exceed L600bn, after climbing 5.8 per cent to L599bn in 1991. Zucchi has grown fast since 1986, when it bought Bassetti, its bigger rival, from the Marzotto textiles group, which took around 23 per cent of Zucchi in return. Two years later it acquired Mascioni, a textile finishing group, also from Marzotto, followed by Jalla in France in 1990. Last June, Zucchi expanded again, buying the household textiles activities of Eliolona, another Italian manufacturer. Zucchi now controls almost 27 per cent of the highly fragmented Italian market for household textiles such as towels, sheets and bedlinen, while in France its share has risen to 11 per cent, thanks to Jalla. However, like other Italian textiles producers, Zucchi has been hit by rising domestic costs at a time of slackening demand. Preliminary figures suggest a 10 per cent fall in Italian demand for household textiles in the first four months of this year, and imply a bigger drop for the first half. That could take Zucchi back to the tough early 1980s, when demand for household textiles fell by around 30 per cent. Adding to its troubles are restructuring plans, which, though ultimately cost-saving, will depress profits initially. There is also the burden of digesting Eliolona and its minority stakes in Standardtela and Standardtre, two textiles and thread producers in which Zucchi has the majority. Zucchi has also come under fire for last year's decision to use the tax-saving device of buying the beneficial interest on share dividends to boost 1991 profits by around L5.5bn to L6bn. Similar financial engineering should lift profits by around L5bn this year. Analysts fear the practice may be banned by the Italian tax authorities. Stripped of such special items, Zucchi's net earnings would have fallen slightly in 1991, Mr Zucchi admits. Adverse reactions from investors contributed to the group's decision not to continue the practice next year. 'We'll have to find some other way to save money,' he says. Zucchi's hopes of beating the downward market trend are based on improved marketing and production. Buying Eliolona's household textiles activities, which also include licences to manufacture under the Benetton name, will expand its range and market share. Gaining full control of Standardtela and Standardtre should help reduce overheads by concentrating production on fewer sites. Already, almost all the towelling sold under the Zucchi and Bassetti brands is made at a single Zucchi plant. The group has also just commissioned a study on the relative advantages of manufacturing in either a low-cost European Community country such as Portugal, eastern Europe, or a cheap-labour market - such as India or Pakistan - to cut costs. So far, it is not convinced of the merits. In spite of relatively high Italian labour costs, Mr Zucchi says that manufacturing sophisticated household textiles has become increasingly capital-intensive. Finishing and printing textiles require sophisticated technology and know-how. 'Going abroad is only worthwhile for some products,' he says. On the sales side, Zucchi wants to expand in Europe. Apart from France, it has been growing in Spain, where it now has a 2 to 3 per cent market share and Bassetti is well-established. 'We see it (Spain) as a future market for growth. It's like Italy 25 years ago, with no obvious dominant producers and very similar tastes,' Mr Zucchi says. With the market highly fragmented, buying market share through takeovers has been rejected in favour of organic growth, which might include local production. The company also hopes to expand in Germany and recently bought a small retail chain to test the waters in Greece. Even the depressed UK has been considered. 'We looked at two possible acquisitions, and decided not to go ahead,' Mr Zucchi says. While the company was attracted by relatively cheap purchase prices and the low cost of UK labour, it was deterred by antiquated and labour-intensive plant. The domination of the UK market by big retailers was another disincentive. 'The market is controlled by the distribution side. Only around 20 to 25 per cent of sales are under a manufacturer's brand name. The rest is either sold under retailers' own labels or as unbranded imports. Manufacturers just aren't known to the consumer,' he notes. Astute use of brands in a sector in which trademarks are seldom prominent has been Zucchi's strength. While Bassetti is placed slightly up-market from Zucchi, both are familiar names in Italy. 'That has always helped us make money in circumstances where others have failed,' says Mr Zucchi. 'Internal competition between Zucchi and Bassetti has stimulated innovation, helping us to develop brand names in a segment of the market where that is not usually the case.'</p>

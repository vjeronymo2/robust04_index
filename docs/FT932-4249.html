			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Unions call for role in forum THE TRADE union movement made a plea yesterday for greater recognition of the role it can play in developing a long-term strategy to boost industrial competitiveness. In evidence to the House of Commons Trade and Industry committee the Trades Union Congress said that since the demise of the National Economic Development Office last year there had been no national forum to discuss industrial competitiveness. The TUC said: 'For the government to talk only to employers is to narrow the focus of debate, and is more likely than not to lead to the kind of corporatism they seek to avoid.' Mr Roger Lyons, general secretary of the MSF technical union, told MPs that 'the most successful companies listen to their employees. But the Department of Trade and Industry does not seem to want that information'. The committee, investigating the competitiveness of UK manufacturing, also heard evidence from the Engineering Employers' Federation. Illustrating the degree of common ground between unions and employers on the need for a long-term industrial strategy, Mr Neil Johnson, the Federation's director general, said the government should take a 30-to-40-year view of the direction of industry and technology. It should then set policy, preferably on a cross-party basis, to create a framework in which normal market decisions can be made. 'This is not to suggest a return to the days of picking winners and losers,' he said. Mr Johnson welcomed the department's recent more positive attitude to the manufacturing industry. At a federation briefing on its own industrial strategy proposals, launched six months ago, Mr Johnson praised prime minister Mr John Major's support for manufacturing in a recent speech.</p>

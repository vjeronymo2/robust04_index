			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Portugal increases global FRN in response to strong demand The first global offering of D-Mark floating-rate notes, launched by the Republic of Portugal yesterday, met strong demand from international investors, prompting an increase in the size of the transaction from an initial DM2bn to DM2.5bn. The five-year issue, arranged by Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and UBS, was priced to offer a discounted margin of 10 basis points above the London interbank offered rate (Libor). Dealers said that the pricing of the deal was attractive because FRNs priced at a margin above Libor are still relatively rare. 'The lesson of this year has been that Libor-plus deals go well and sub-Libor deals don't work,' said one trader. Banks like to buy FRNs priced above Libor because banks can fund themselves at a lower level. Around 15 per cent of the transaction was placed in the US, according to one lead manager and, given that the deal was not denominated in dollars, the proportion of US placement was considered respectable. 'Some people had expected it to be a lot less. At that level, it is certainly worth making it a global deal,' said one underwriter, adding that similar levels had been achieved for some dollar offerings. The deal was quoted at its reoffer price of 99.834 towards the end of the day's trading. Mr Manuel Pinho, director general of the Portuguese Treasury, said that the deal virtually completes Portugal's Es400bn foreign borrowing programme for 1994. The proceeds have not been swapped. 'We do not need the funds immediately, as we have a large cash position,' said Mr Pinho. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae's recent debut global bond offering will be followed shortly by two more global deals by US government agencies. Freddie Mac's Dollars 1.5bn five-year global issue, currently roadshowing in Asia, is likely to be launched in mid-July, with market participants suggesting a launch spread of around 18 basis points over the five-year Treasury yield. In addition, the Federal Home Loan Bank System will kick off its is expected Dollars 5bn global debt programme with a global bond offering, likely to total around Dollars 1bn, arranged by Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley. Elsewhere, Finland is considering launching a deal in the international markets, though a currency and maturity have yet to be chosen. Credit Foncier de France has launched an Ecu250m five-year revolving credit facility, arranged by JP Morgan. The facility will be used to back up its recent Ecu750m euro-commercial paper programme.</p>

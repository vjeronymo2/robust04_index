			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / International Company News: Ciments Francais cuts losses Ciments Francais, the French cement company, sharply reduced its losses in the first half of this year, cutting the net deficit to FFr96m (Dollars 18.1m) from FFr373m in the same period in 1993, writes John Ridding in Paris. The group, which is a subsidiary of Italcementi of Italy, said the improved result, better economic conditions and its disposal of non-core assets should allow a break-even or close full-year result. First-half sales rose to FFr6.62bn from FFr6.58bn, while operating profits jumped to FFr715m from FFr501m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Amrit Manga] </F>   [Text] Most political parties have dropped their pretences  at diplomacy and have hauled out their electioneering artillery  in preparation for what promises to be a bruising battle for  power. But the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] has maintained a  noticeable subdued election profile. It is the only one of the  four major parties contesting the elections for both the  national and provincial assemblies that has not yet begun  campaigning in earnest.    In the past week, it tried to dispel speculation that its  low  profile is due to financial difficulties. Unlike other parties,  the PAC went along to the Independent Electoral Commission with  R[rand]70,000 in crisp notes to pay its deposit for registration  as a political party. But it has delayed the unveiling of a  detailed manifesto three times. This is now expected to be made  public next week. However, the PAC itself is attaching little  weight to such a programme. Its emphasis is on intense  campaigning at grassroots level.    This partly explains why the organisation has done little in  the way of election rallies and mass meetings to project a  public profile. This is except for its December national  congress in Umtata which ratified participation in the election.  But its low election profile may well be due to the controversy  surrounding the decision to contest the April polls. Not all in  the PAC, for example, agree that the armed struggle should be  suspended in preparation for participation in the elections.  But PAC officials disagree that the launch of the campaign has  been delayed and do not seem unduly perturbed by dissension in  the eastern Cape, arguing that it is limited to a few  individuals. The organisation, they say, has concentrated its  efforts at the grassroots level rather than the media.    In any case, the PAC's December conference satisfied itself  that tactical and strategic considerations debated by delegates  provide a sound basis for participation in the polls, the  officials say.    PAC foreign affairs chief Gora Ebrahim argues: "The  principle that the PAC has been pursuing all along is that the  election must be for a constituent assembly, whose primary task  must be draw up the new non-racial democratic constitution. The  PAC's national conference on December 16 1993 was satisfied that  the April elections would be for a constituent assembly to draw  up a new, non-racial, democratic constitution. It therefore  meets the PAC's primary demand and, on that basis, we will  participate in the coming election."    While the PAC is content with the primary objective of the  April elections, its decision to participate was not an  unqualified one. Ebrahim says his organisation will be sitting  in the constituent assembly but will not consider itself bound  by any of the constitional principles agreed upon by other  participants at the multi-party talks last year. "The PAC  congress has taken a decision that we are going into an election  for an unfettered constitutional assembly [CA]. We believe that  the elected people cannot be bound by an unelected group's  decisions."    Ebrahim adds that the PAC only considers itself bound by  those principles that are enumerated and enshrined in the 1989  Consensus Declaration of the United Nations. Included in this  declaration are basic principles binding parties to a  multi-party democracy, a universally accepted Bill of Rights, an  independent judiciary, regular elections etc. It does not  consider itself bound by principles providing limited powers for  regional government or those allowing for a Government of  National Unity (GNU).    "There are also other deals, struck between the ANC [African  National Congress] and the NP [National Party], that the PAC is  not bound by," says Ebrahim. Among these is the deal which  effectively resulted in the decision at multi-party talks for a  single ballot in the April elections, he says. Ebrahim added  that, as things stand, the PAC would not participate in the  Transitional Executive Council (TEC). But this is not an open  and shut case -- "We are still involved in talks with the  government and hope that obstacles in the way of the PAC joining  the TEC will be removed." One of these obstacles revolves around  the control over the security forces in the period up to the  elections.    The PAC believes the government remains in control of the  army and police while the TEC only has jurisdiction over  liberation armies and homeland security forces. It is of the  view that all armed forces, including the SA [South African]  Defence Force and the South African Police, should come under  TEC command.    Just how successful the PAC will be in getting its way is,  however, in question. It has, for example, already sacrificed  an important bargaining chip -- the armed struggle. And some  dissension in its ranks relates to the PAC's suspension of the  armed campaign without having secured the necessary changes to  the TEC Act.    There is also no certainty that the organisation will  participate in the GNU, which it remains opposed to in terms of  its own principles and understanding of what constitutes a  democracy. But there remains a possibility that the PAC will  join the GNU if it believes this will serve its strategic  interests. Participation in the GNU will depend on the same  process of debate and assessment that went into determining the  strategic value of participating in the multi-party negotiating  council, says Ebrahim.    "If we find that we can meaningfully make a contribution, we  will participate in the GNU." But a final decision will only be  taken when the GNU is established, says Ebrahim, cautioning that  the pros and cons of participation have not yet come up for  discussion.    This decision will be informed by the PAC's capacity to  influence the final constitution. And this in turn depends on  the support the organisation enjoys among South African voters,  Ebrahim explains.    But, if recent opinion polls are anything to go by, the PAC  is unlikely to muster the support of more than two percent of  the country's estimated 22.5-million voters.    While Ebrahim agrees that its clout at the CA will depend on  the support it can mobilise in the runup to the elections, he  disputes the accuracy of the opinion polls. "These polls do not  affect us in the least when we examine them against reports,  from delegates throughout the country, of our strength at the  grassroots level. We took a very firm decision to participate in  the elections despite these strange polls -- in our view, the  only thing that these polls will prove is how wrong they were."    Ebrahim says a PAC study has shown, that of an estimated 21-  million voters in the country, only four to five million were  committed or card-carrying members of political parties. "You  have between 15- and 16-million voters out there who make up the  floating vote. Our study shows that this floating vote will  vote on the basis of two considerations," says Ebrahim.    At one level, these voters' choice will be based on their  perception of different political organisations: "is it  principled, has it compromised, has it compromised too much, is  it involved in violence?"    "These are some of the questions the floating majority will  ask before they cast their votes," says Ebrahim.    "But the builk of this majority will cast its votes on  straightforward bread and butter issues such as security,  housing, employment, land, education and health. We have found  that the bulk of the people are literally doing shopping and  that is why people want to know what parties are offering. We  also found that there has been a fundamental change in the  thinking of our people in the post-February 1990 period. Prior  to this period, we found that people would support you for  simply opposing the regime. Today, they want to know what's in  it for them."    Ebrahim is confident that his party will capture a sizable  part of the floating vote because it has a strong message and  programme that addresses every one of the bread and butter  concerns. "We are not perceived in the townships as being  involved in violence and that is a major asset in those areas  where violence is endemic. We also know that no political  organisation in the world wins an election on the basis of its  membership -- more important is what's on offer. For all these  reasons, we think we stand an excellent chance of winning a  substantial majority," Ebrahim says without a hint of doubt.    He adds that it was against the background of these  considerations that the Umtata conference decided to contest the  elections, confident that the PAC has the ingredients to capture  the floating vote.    Its success will, however, depend on its election manifesto,  which is expected to be unveiled next week. Ebrahim would not  speculate on the manifesto's contents. Asked whether it would  focus exclusively on constitutional issues, given that the PAC  sees the elections as nothing more than an exercise in electing  a constituent assembly, Ebrahim said no. He says that, while  the PAC will be asking voters for a mandate to write a new  constitution, its manifesto will also focus on programmes to  deliver on bread and butter issues. It will therefore reflect  issues such as the PAC's economic policy.    While the manifesto will contain more than just  constitutional matters relevant to a mandate for a constituent  assembly, Ebrahim maintains that the PAC's goal is not  government office but seats in a constituent assembly.    He is cagey about PAC participation in a GNU if it wins a  substantial majority. He argues that this will partly be  determined by how long it takes to draw up the constitution,  which in turn will depend on the outcome of the election.    "It is possible that the constitution could be drawn up in  six weeks if the elections deliver a decisive majority to any  one party. But, even if there are many parties with a more or  less equal distribution of the vote, the election will ensure  that no party will be in a position to make exaggerated demands.  If, for example, a party wins 10 percent of the vote, it cannot  demand 90 percent of the vote in determining the form of the  constitution -- so it brings reality to the negotiations process  in terms of what is attainable."    Ebrahim argues that if parties emerge from the elections  without any one group enjoying a significant majority, the  constitution- making process could take a long time. "But,  assuming the PAC wins a significant majority and we are able to  draw up a constitution within six weeks, then we must decide  whether we will still be governed by an interim constitution for  another five years thereafter.    "It is possible," Ebrahim argues, "that the new constitution  will demand that we have an election after six months. Then  there will be need to continue with the GNU."    The other option for the PAC, if it does not obtain an  absolute majority, is to remain outside of the GNU as an  opposition. Ebrahim would not say whether it would then  function as a parliamentary resistance opposition. That would  depend on how the party is treated by the GNU, he says. "It is  not prudent for the PAC to say how it will function in the  post-April election period before the outcome of the election,"  says Ebrahim.    What is certain is that, if the PAC wins a majority and is  able to, together with minority parties, write up a new  constitution, it will ignore what it says is a deal between the  NP and the ANC to run the country through a government of  national unity.</p>

			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Arts: Iphigenie en Aulide The Theatre du Soleil seldom tours. It performs at the Cartoucherie in Paris (near the Chateau de Vincennes) and rarely anywhere else. Twenty one years ago its visit to London's Roundhouse Theatre made a great impact. Now the European Arts festival has brought the company for a week of performances (July 16-22) to perform Les Atrides, a tetralogy of Greek tragedies - Euripides's Iphigenie en Aulide followed by Aeschylus's Oresteia trilogy. Robin Mills, Bradford, has been especially converted for the purpose to become the Cartoucherie of the North. Excitement is high, and Iphigenie en Aulide - on which I report here - was greeted with an ovation. To me, however, the great event of the evening was simply Robin Mills itself. A large foyer space, transformed into an astonishingly festive bistro, serves a splendid array of food and drink. The auditorium was abuzz before it was even half-full, and the news that it might grow very warm over 140 minutes (no interval) simply added to the anticipation. You will have guessed by now that the performance disappointed me. The Theatre du Soleil's director Ariane Mnouchkine has formed a vivid pop multiculturalist performing style. Costumes, movement, music all show elements of numerous idioms. But if you've seen Kabuki theatre or Indian dance or any of a dozen other styles recently, you can't help seeing how merely cute the Theatre du Soleil's use of them is. Friends tell me that the company has changed; one chum who had been thrilled at the Roundhouse in 1971 said: 'They've forgotten everything that made them remarkable.' What saddened me most was that at the heart of this far-from-radical-now multiculturalism was standard bad old French hammy acting. Euripides, by the way, has been rendered into throughly obvious parlance by Jean and Mayotte Bollack. No simultaneous-translation device is provided and those with a mere smattering of French will need none. The actors speak deliberately and in wretchedly short phrases. Characterisation and utterance are in no way original. Iphigenie is white-voiced, doe-eyed and cloying, Clytemnestre switches from maternal excitement to distress with an overdose of larmes dans la voix, Achille is gauche, and so on. Some actors double roles, rather as the Greeks did, but here they just switch from one stereotype to another. Jean-Jacques Lemetre and his assistants accompany everything - monologues, dialogues and choruses - on a spectacular array of exotic instruments, but - once you're past the fun of a few Oriental twangs and so on - it's dismaying how near to Hollywood his technique is. Those may have been Asian cellos, but the tremolando accompaniment he produced from them for one tense moment after another was standard melodramatic kitsch. The chorus dance but never with any of the rhythmic intricacy or impetus of the Greek lyrics. The pleasure of the evening comes in its trappings: not just the foyer but also the bare wooden space itself, and the magnificently colourful costumes, make-up and wigs worn by all. That's the best side of French theatre for you. Too bad that the evening also showed the worst.</p>

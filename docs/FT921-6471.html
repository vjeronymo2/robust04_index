			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Scargill allegation is denied BRITISH COAL yesterday denied allegations by the National Union of Mineworkers that it was planning to suspend payments into its pension fund. Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the union, said the money saved from such a 'holiday' would make British Coal's accounts look artificially good. He said in a letter to Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the Commons social security committee, that he believed British Coal would use the large surplus in its pension fund to pay for a 'holiday', during which it would make no more contributions to miners' pensions. Mr Scargill added that British Coal had taken such a 'holiday' in 1989. According to Mr Scargill the fund now has an actuarial surplus of Pounds 1,450m. He told Mr Field: 'We have now been informed that British Coal is insisting on a substantial slice of this surplus in the form of another contribution holiday. 'If it is allowed to take it, this means that British Coal will have paid no contributions at all over the 10-year period from 1989 to 1999, while miners continue to pay their contributions.' British Coal said it had not yet received the actuarial report on the miners' pension fund. It had not decided how any surplus should be used. The European Commission has approved a Pounds 124.2m aid package for Britain's coal-mining areas. The package had been blocked by the commission pending government guarantees that the cash was being properly used.</p>

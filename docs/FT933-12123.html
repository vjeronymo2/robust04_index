			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Reuters likely to detail Pounds 400m share buy-back plan REUTERS Holdings, the international information and news group, is tomorrow expected to announce a share buy-back scheme while delivering its interim results. Following months of speculation about how Reuters will employ its cash mountain of Pounds 710m, the company is likely to disclose details of a plan to spend Pounds 400m buying back its shares. A source close to the company said that 'the speculation is not far from the truth'. Mr Mike Cooling, Reuters' head of corporate relations, did not deny the share buy-back plan: 'We can give no guidance on this matter.' The company has previously signalled it was considering ways of disbursing its cash pile, including a share buy-back plan. An increased dividend could also be paid. Such moves would also not rule out the possibility of acquisitions. A senior media analyst said the economic conditions were conducive to buying back shares. 'The dual rationale is that they have all this cash on their hands and the earnings per share would be considerably enhanced.' The analyst also attributed some of Reuters' recent share strength to the growing anticipation of a dispersal of cash in favour of the shareholders. Reuters's shares last week enjoyed steady progress, putting on 25p to close on Friday at 1404p. The share price has also been buoyed by expectations of interim pre-tax profits which most analysts tip to be between Pounds 210m and Pounds 220m against the previous Pounds 187m. One analyst said: 'It may be seen as a sign that Reuters cannot find anything better to do with its money; that there is nothing in the industry worth buying' and suggested it would be better for the company to target growth potential in an immature area of the industry. Reuters would face some tax and regulatory obstacles to a share buy-back as 35 per cent of its shareholders are in the US.</p>

			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Loss in translation The weak dollar has added an unwelcome element of uncertainty to the already shaky earnings outlook for UK companies. Real earnings growth looks elusive on cyclical grounds, but the latest batch of profit downgrades from brokers also contains a currency component. Dollar profits will suffer on translation into sterling. This will act as a brake on earnings in the second half of the year and possibly beyond. UK companies are more exposed than their continental European rivals. As the chart shows, some 40 per cent of UK quoted company earnings are, in one way or another, dependent on the US currency. Sales in the US market account for about 25 per cent of total profits reported by UK quoted companies. The balance is made up of profits from commodities priced in dollars and earnings in currencies which are closely linked to the dollar. Compared with last year, the translation impact of the weak dollar is not yet severe. Even if the dollar remains at around Dollars 1.90 against sterling, the average rate for the year as a whole is unlikely to be far from that of 1991. Until recently, however, the market was anticipating a currency benefit. This has now been stripped out. Among the bears, Morgan Stanley does not anticipate a dollar recovery until the second half of next year. On this basis alone it has trimmed its UK earnings growth forecast from 17 per cent to 13.5 per cent for 1993. The select group of UK companies which hedge translation exposures, such as TI Group and BOC, aim to iron out these fluctuations in earnings. But this brings no discernible lasting benefit to their share prices. Indeed, it is questionable whether a company should hedge a pure accounting phenomenon by taking a view on exchange rates. Investors might prefer to take the view themselves.</p>

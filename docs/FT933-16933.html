			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Myth of European 'competitiveness' Most Western industrialised countries (in which we should nowadays include Japan) are suffering from similar problems: recession or disappointing growth; high and rising unemployment; and worries about the stability of financial institutions. Yet so strong is the human instinct to blame everything on an external enemy or opponent that the only slogan under which statesmen can agree to discuss the problem is 'lack of competitiveness'. This was the theme of both Jacques Delors and John Major at the recent European Community summit in Copenhagen, although their remedies differed. By accident or good timing, a pamphlet has landed on my desk by John Horam, a former Labour minister, who has persuaded himself that the Tories are the lesser evil and now sits as Conservative member for Orpington. The pamphlet is called Making Britain Competitive. Much of what he writes, like most of what his leader said in Copenhagen, makes eminent sense. But in both cases their arguments are spoiled by being put in the competitiveness framework. The units that compete in world trade are - heaven be praised - individual businesses and not whole nations. One can talk about competitiveness at the national economic level only in a strictly limited sense. A country may have cost levels, at prevailing exchange rates, which are so high as to undermine solvency or to threaten jobs which would otherwise be safe. In this sense, the UK was uncompetitive - as some of us saw only with hindsight - at the old ERM exchange rate. Germany risks becoming so today. The UK competitiveness problem was dealt with, at least for a time, by devaluation. The D-Mark has risen against some European currencies, but has fallen heavily against the yen and modestly against the dollar. It remains to be seen whether these movements will be enough. Of course, the benefits of devaluation may be eroded by inflation, as regularly happened in the British case and could happen again. If it does - and it need not - then the UK will be seen to have a real competitiveness problem and one which cannot be tackled by monetary or exchange rate manipulation. But if most countries, not only the UK and/or Germany, are in a position where labour costs are too high for full employment, then it ceases to make sense to talk of competitiveness. For competitiveness is a relative concept; and we cannot all be uncompetitive against each other. The last international figure whom I remember making the point was Emile van Lennep, the Dutch secretary general of the OECD between 1969 and 1984. But Mr Van Lennep firmly rejected any diagnosis of the common problems of member countries in terms of competitiveness. 'Against whom should the OECD as a whole be more competitive? Against the developing world? Against the moon?' The problem was, and is, performance, not competitiveness. Since then, of course, many have asserted that there is, indeed, a threat from the non-OECD world, in particular the Asian developing countries and the former Communist countries of Europe. The real reason why these countries are unlikely to impose an insupportable threat to jobs in the West is that they do not export to line their bank vaults with yen, dollar and D-Mark notes, but in order to import. Western sales lost in home markets to these new competitors should be compensated by the extra purchases by these countries of western products. Indeed, with their urgent needs for imports from the West, it is inconceivable that the developing or former Communist countries should try to undervalue their currencies to maintain an export surplus. Their desire, for very good reason, is for the largest imports they can finance. These general thoughts may be cold comfort to western European steel, textile or coal producers who feel themselves threatened; but the threat is to staying in the same jobs at the same pay rates - not to overall job levels. John Major's exposition in Copenhagen was, in its statistical illustration, mostly in terms of the EC, on the one hand, and the US and Japan, on the other - in other words, the old rather than the new competitors. The estimates he cited purported to show that the EC had become more uncompetitive against both Japan and the US. This is shown in the top chart by the steeper rise of EC labour costs. Unfortunately, the figures contained a snag. For they were in terms of national currencies, which ignores exchange rate changes. The bottom chart takes them into account by expressing all costs in terms of a single currency, namely dollars. This transforms the picture. The EC still looks as if it has become more uncompetitive against the US. But both the US and the Community seem to have become more competitive against Japan. The latter country has obviously had some success in offsetting increased labour costs by improvements in other aspects of competitiveness. Even so, Japanese industry is clearly feeling the pinch, and American demands for yet further yen appreciation verge on the ludicrous. The charts should also show the futility of conducting international economic policy in terms of competitiveness. The area against which the EC has clearly lost competitiveness is the US. But the Clinton Administration is vociferous that the US is not competitive enough. The competitiveness approach soon deteriorates into a zero-sum game in which world output and employment seem quite wrongly to be fixed and in which one group can gain only at the expense of another. John Horam concludes his pamphlet by saying that competitiveness 'usually boils down in practice to mean higher standards, being better organised and more efficient, usually also more thoughtful'. Perhaps someone will think of a new slogan which will encapsulate these qualities - without suggesting that we need an interplanetary war to achieve them all over the earth. If the seemingly inexorable rise in European unemployment from one business cycle to the next does not merely reflect uncompetitiveness against other regions, then what does it represent? John Major gave basically the correct explanation in terms of excessive pay rises (now much less true in the UK), high social overheads, the Commission Working Time Directive and other regulations which make labour too expensive. All these things, however, would still be a threat to jobs if they were present in all countries and blocs to the same extent. What the exponents of the pricing-out-of-work hypothesis have still to explain is why the phenomenon should have got worse decade by decade since the 1970s. A first shot at an explanation is that the labour market has become more differentiated. Market-clearing pay differentials have widened out and are subject to more rapid change - a centralised pay norm would now help much less, even if we could get it. Evidence for this is the widening of pre-tax pay differentials among those who are in jobs. The changes are much more complex than skilled workers gaining at the expense of unskilled - the German apprentice system is itself looking dated. If there is to be a return to full employment, much more effort will have to be made by employers to find pay rates at which jobs can be offered and there will need to be an end to macho-style management which measures toughness in terms of staff cuts.</p>

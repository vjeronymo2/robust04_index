			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> GILBERT SWEEPS PAST PUGH IN VERMONT  </P> <P> Brad Gilbert, after trailing 2-5 in the first set, did not lose another game en  route to a 7-5, 6-0 victory over Jim Pugh in the final of the Volvo  International tennis tournament Sunday at Stratton Mountain, Vt.  </P> <P> Gilbert, seeded third, rebounded after double-faulting twice to lose the  seventh game of the first set. The victory gave him his second singles title  this year, the 14th of his career and the $114,000 first prize.  </P> <P> "I'm playing well right now, and I'm just hopeful of gearing up for the U.S.  Open, which is the most important tournament for me," said Gilbert, who hoisted  his 8-month-old son Zachary above his shoulders after winning the match.  </P> <P> It snapped a 10-match winning streak for Pugh, of Palos Verdes, who gained his  first singles title three weeks ago in Newport, R.I.  </P> <P> "I was down a break in the third in my first match and my second match," Pugh  said. "I feel very fortunate to have made it this far, so I'm not that upset."  </P> <P> With the tournament marked by upsets, particularly to top-seeded Andre Agassi  and No. 2 Michael Chang, Gilbert coasted through his first five matches without  dropping a set or facing a seeded player until meeting No. 14 Pugh in the  final.  </P> <P> Pugh, who earned $57,000, started well, breaking Gilbert's serve in the third  and seventh games.  </P> <P> Pugh netted a backhand to go to break point in the next game, and although he  warded that one off, he was broken on another netted backhand.  </P> <P> Gilbert remembered the point.  </P> <P> "I hit a backhand angle that I thought was going a couple feet wide, and then  all of a sudden, he wasn't sure," he said. "He hit it, and hit it into the net.  That really helped. I got a big break."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Gilbert switched to a more aggressive forehand that forced Pugh into  errors.  </P> <P> Said Pugh: "I felt like I got maybe a little physically tired after playing so  many tough matches and the doubles matches."  </P> <P> Losing only one set throughout the $350,000 tournament, Emilio Sanchez of Spain  defeated Martin Jaite of Argentina, 7-6 (7-1), 6-1, 2-6, 6-2, to gain the title  at Kitzbuhel, Austria.  </P> <P> After both players held service throughout the first set, Sanchez won the last  point of the tiebreaker on an ace.  </P> <P> In the opening game of the fourth set, Sanchez had to fend off three break  points. Then he quickly broke Jaite's serve.  </P> <P> Fifth-seeded Paolo Cane of Italy edged Bruno Oresar of Yugoslavia, 7-6 (7-4),  7-6 (7-5), to win the final of a $305,000 tournament at Bastad, Sweden.  </P> <P> Cane, seeded fifth, became the first Italian winner of this clay-court  tournament since Corrado Barazzutti in 1977.  </P></p>

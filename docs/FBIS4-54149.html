			<p>BFN     [Text] Opposition lawmakers on the House committee  monitoring MPs' conduct yesterday accused the United States  Information Service (USIS) of acting in collusion with the Thai  Foreign Ministry to smear the name of Chat Phatthana MP Mongkhon  Chongsutthanamani. According to USIS, the US Embassy in Bangkok  on March 18 rejected Mongkhon's application for a US entry visa  on the grounds that he was suspected of involvement in drug  trafficking by US law enforcement authorities.    "Everybody on the House committee on parliamentary affairs  agreed that USIS was apparently in great haste and gave  confusing statements regarding the rejection of Mongkhon's visa  application," said MP Phairot Suwanchawi (Chat Phatthana-Nakhon  Ratchasima).    Phairot, a member of the House committee, claimed that the  US  Embassy informed Mongkhon that it could not issue an entry visa  to him because he had not submitted all necessary documentation  on February 28.    "The USIS statement said the US Embassy rejected his visa  application on March 18. How can the embassy reject the visa  application on March 18 when Mongkhon did not re-submit his  application at that time?" the Chat Phatthana MP said.    There apparently was a misunderstanding on the part of  opposition lawmakers as a copy of a notification dated Feb 28  issued by the US Embassy informed Mongkhon that he was  ineligible at that time for the entry visa because his  application was still "pending necessary administrative  processing". Therefore, it appears no irregularities were  involved when, after consulting the US law enforcement  authorities, the embassy on March 18 rejected Mongkhon's visa  application on the grounds of suspected drug trafficking  activities. Copies of the US Embassy notification, written in  English, were given to reporters yesterday by some members of  the House committee.    Phairot said the House committee also decided that the  government should devise measures to prevent people from  accusing others of serious crimes without supplying evidence to  back up the charges. He also said Mongkhon, who testified  before the House committee without being summoned, announced  that he was willing to travel to the United States if the US  Embassy here arranged for his journey.    "Khun Mongkhon said he was prepared to go to the United  States even if he would be arrested by US authorities upon  arrival," Phairot said.    MP Witthaya Thianthong (Chat Thai-Sa Kaeo), also a member of  the House committee, said USIS must have colluded with the  Foreign Ministry to damage Mongkhon's reputation.    "USIS must have been given a cue from the Foreign Ministry.  The whole thing is politics between the coalition government  and the opposition," Witthaya said. He acknowledged that some  coalition government MPs on the House committee did not agree  with the opposition lawmakers' theory.    The House committee chairman, Charoen Khanthawong  (Democrat-Bangkok), said the House committee did not make any  decision as to what to do with Mongkhon's case. Charoen said  opposition MPs on the panel claimed there were irregularities in  the way USIS handled Mongkhon's case but several other members  disagreed.    "Some members claimed that USIS was interfering in Thai  politics, while others disagreed," the chairman said.    Charoen said the House committee had sought more information  regarding Mongkhon's case from the US Embassy but was told that  any request must go through the Foreign Ministry.    The House committee has yet to conclude its investigation  into the case of former MP Thanong Siriprichaphong (Chat  Thai-Nakhon Phanom), who resigned from the Chat Thai Party last  Saturday and who subsequently lost his House membership.    Thanong has been charged in the United States with smuggling  into that country more than 45 metric tons of marijuana between  1973- 1987. Thanong's assets in the United States -- a Beverly  Hills house and a Mercedes Benz -- have been seized under a US  court order.</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Spanish directors quit at Cofir THE FUTURE of the Spanish operations of Mr Carlo de Benedetti's Cerus group is in doubt following the resignation of several directors of Cofir, the holding company for the Spanish business. Mr Jose Ramon Alvarez Rendueles, a former governor of the Bank of Spain who was chosen by Mr de Benedetti to be Cofir's founding chairman in 1988, resigned from his post and from the board, as did fellow directors Mr Alberto Cortina, one of Spain's most prominent industrialists, and Mr Javier Gurpide, a deputy chairman of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya. 'We are just very frustrated about our involvement in Cofir. We once had high hopes but there has been an absence of strategy and our expectations have come to nothing,' a former board member said. Mr Alvarez Rendueles, who is chairman of Banco Zaragozano, and Mr Cortina, one of the bank's main shareholders, represented Zaragozano's 12 per cent shareholding in Cofir and Mr Gurpide represented BBV's 10 per cent holding in the company. Both banks named lower-ranking representatives to Cofir's board in what is viewed as a temporary measure before their disinvestment from the company. Mr Pedro Cuatrecasas, a Barcelona-based lawyer, was appointed Cofir's new chairman and Mr Gabriele Burgio, an Italian associate of Mr de Benedetti, was named managing director replacing Mr Juan Llopart, Cofir's chief executive. Cerus, which controls more than 40 per cent of Cofir, hit difficulties following its failed bid for Societe Generale de Belgique, and, with the onset of the 1990s, Cofir began to lose its acquisitive drive. Cofir is understood to have put on the market its 49 per cent stake in Bodegas Berberana, a Rioja wine producer and its Portuguese unit, Cofipsa. Cofir remains highly liquid with funds over Pta20bn (Dollars 173m), mostly routed towards government paper.</p>

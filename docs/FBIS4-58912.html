			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, 8 May (MENA)--Semi-official Lebanese  sources have stated that Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri has  decided to stay home and to refrain from doing his work in what  these sources have described as a political stance and not a  constitutional one. No official statement has yet been issued  by the prime minister on the reasons for his decision to remain  at home. However, informed sources have told the MENA  correspondent that Prime Minister al-Hariri is facing  difficulties in reshuffling his cabinet with a view to improving  the chances of Christian representation in the Lebanese  Government to remedy the frustration felt by the Christians in  Lebanon.    The sources said al-Hariri's decision does not mean he will  resign. The MENA correspondent says several ministers, as well  as political, religious, and military figures, including Army  Commander Gen. Emile Lahhud, have visited al-Hariri at his  mansion in the Quraytim area of Beirut to ask him to change his  mind.    Informed sources in Beirut say al-Hariri's decision to stop  doing his job has moved what could be considered a cabinet  crisis into the Lebanese streets. In the past few days there  has been a lot of speculation in the press and in political  quarters about an imminent cabinet reshuffle to include some  Christian political figures in the government, such as  Phalangist Party leader Dr. George Sa'adah, plus a member from  the National Liberal Party and other Christian figures.    The situation is still vague regarding the fate of the  Lebanese Government. Prime Minister al-Hariri canceled a radio  and television interview that was scheduled to be aired live  tonight, in which he would have addressed questions and  speculations about a possible cabinet reshuffle.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (7): 'Marketing is tough' in Glasgow - Mixed fortunes in the industry IT WAS obvious that something big was happening at the Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre because one encountered the nose-to-tail traffic several miles before reaching the exhibition complex at Bridge of Don. Inside, the hot late August day made the atmosphere almost suffocating. Last year the biennial Offshore Europe exhibition at Aberdeen, devoted to the offshore oil and gas industry, was more popular than ever, with an extra 200 exhibitors bringing the total to 1,500 in the 20,000 sq ft exhibition space. As usual for this exhibition, most of the stands were housed in temporary accommodation rather than in the permanent structure at the Bridge of Don centre. O f f s h o r e Europe is the largest exhibition in Scotland and last year was in the happy position of serving an industry whose fortunes are running in the opposite direction to the rest of the UK economy. At the S c o t t i s h Exhibition and Conference Centre (SECC) in Glasgow, the mood is less ecstatic. 'It's tough for everyone at the moment,' says Mr Victor Brierley, an executive at the SECC. 'A number of exhibitions have withdrawn recently and marketing is tough.' With the recession having begun in Scotland about a year later than in the rest of the UK, the downturn has only recently hit the exhibition business. Mr John Todd, chief executive of Scottish Industrial &amp; Trade Exhibitions (Site), one of the largest exhibition organisers north of the border, says that the picture is mixed. 'I predicted difficulties for our Scottish engineering show in November but we're already halfway to selling it out. On the other hand, our Scottish marketing exhibition has had to be postponed because there wasn't enough support. It's difficult to predict what is going to go well.' Success is especially necessary for the SECC because it has rarely been in the black since it opened in 1985. It cost Pounds 36m, of which Pounds 14m was provided by the Scottish Development Agency, some Pounds 14m by local authorities and Pounds 8m by the private sector. Almost immediately after it opened, it was apparent that financial projections for the SECC had been too optimistic. After an initial financial reconstruction, the original public sector backers agreed in 1989 to inject Pounds 2.75m into the company, while debts were restructured and the councils approved an annual grant to cut one third from the SECC's very high rates bill. In the year to September 30 1990, the SECC cut its loss to Pounds 258,000 from Pounds 2.2m. However last year there was a further setback when a staging of the musical West Side Story flopped; the loss was more than Pounds 500,000 and the chief executive resigned. Mr Brierley says that the rock concerts and other entertainments staged at the SECC are 'on the up and up.' In 1990 both the Bolshoi Opera and Pavarotti performed successfully at the SECC. But when the National Audit Office - the government's watchdog on public spending - looked at the SECC in 1988 it doubted how far 'entertainment and consumer events' made 'a significant contribution to the development of Scottish industry' which was the original justification for public sector investment in it. Yet if the financial performance of the SECC has been disappointing, it has become an established part of the Scottish scene and many organisations have taken advantage of its flexible facilities. The Confederation of British Industry has twice held its annual conference there. Edinburgh has so far failed to create its long-promised conference centre. Its need for a purpose-built centre to seat 1,200 people has b e e n recognised for many years. By early 1990 it finally seemed ready to go ahead, as part of a large development project for the Lothian Road area of the city. But then the developers of the associated project got into difficulties  - because of the property crisis in England - and the project was delayed. Last autumn, however, it appeared to be moving ahead again with Edinburgh district council and Lothian &amp; Edinburgh Enterprise, the local enterprise company, committing themselves to starting advance engineering work on the Pounds 30m project. The Scottish Tourist Board, meanwhile, has in recent years stepped up its marketing of Scotland as a conference destination. It has spawned the Scottish Convention Bureau and produces an elaborate and meticulous 80-page book, Scotland: Everything a Conference ever needed. It contains details not only of purpose-built conference facilities in Scotland but of the many hotels, both in the cities and the rural areas, which are able to lay on conferences. There are also entries from a number of famous privately-owned stately homes which offer conference and corporate entertaining.</p>

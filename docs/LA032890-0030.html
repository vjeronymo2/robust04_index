			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A judge refused Tuesday to lower bail for Ernest Booker Brown, a Knox  Elementary School teacher charged with 30 sex crimes against two female  students.  </P> <P> Brown, 47, remains in County Jail in lieu of $300,000 bail, after Superior  Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez said the bail amount was appropriate.  </P> <P> Brown is to go on trial June 15 on charges of molesting the girls, both 12, who  testified against him in a closed preliminary hearing last month.  </P> <P> His attorney, Alex Landon, cited Brown's ties to the community in arguing for a  bail of $25,000.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Aaron Katz, noting that he had filed two additional child  molestation counts against Brown on Tuesday, unsuccessfully asked that bail be  raised to $400,000.  </P> <P> "The defendant is facing 70 years if convicted," Katz said.  </P> <P> The prosecutor said Brown had a child molestation conviction in Florida in 1977  when he was a teacher there.  </P> <P> Brown was arrested Nov. 30 at the Southeast San Diego school where he was  teaching fourth- and fifth-graders.  </P></p>

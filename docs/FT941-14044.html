			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Fears of violence grow as quake victims wait for aid Fears of violence were rising in Los Angeles yesterday amid desperate efforts to find shelter for the thousands of people who have camped in parks and open spaces since last Monday's earthquake. 'There has been incredible destruction of residential property,' said Senator Diane Feinstein, who as mayor of San Francisco oversaw relief efforts for the 1989 earthquake there. 'The destruction here is far more significant and long-range,' she said. Frustrations were rising as victims complained about the lack of immediate assistance. Thousands queued outside emergency centres that opened on Thursday to distribute financial aid. Most received only an application form and an appointment to return days or even weeks later. To deter unrest, about two dozen riot gear-clad National Guard troops armed with M-16 rifles patrolled the area round the Winnetka Community Centre in Northridge, near the epicentre of the quake. Another problem facing victims is the exorbitant prices that some stores are charging for basic necessities. 'I had to pay Dollars 5 (Pounds 3.30) for a can of soup and Dollars 9 for a bag of charcoal,' complained Mr Larry Chisom, a young man with a wife, baby and mother to support. Still without electricity and gas, he is cooking on a barbecue. Others say that they have had to pay Dollars 10 for a gallon of water. The city has established a telephone hot-line for consumer complaints, but Mr Chisom and his friends think there may be a better solution. 'This is going to bring out criminal instincts. Those store owners will regret it,' he said. Although there has been remarkably little crime or looting in Los Angeles, concerns are mounting about the potential for civil unrest in a city torn by riots two years ago. The death toll yesterday rose to 55. The number of injured rose to 5,700, of whom about 700 sustained serious injuries. At least 36,000 residents are without water and thousands of homes still have no electricity. Picking themselves up, Page 7</p>

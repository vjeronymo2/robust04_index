			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S&amp;L SALES SYSTEM RECORD-KEEPING LACKS SAFEGUARDS;  </P> <P> BAILOUT: THRIFT REGULATORS MAY BE HANDICAPPED IN DETECTING POTENTIAL  FAVORITISM, FRAUD OR IMPROPER PRICING.  </P> <P> The federal agency responsible for selling billions of dollars in real estate  from failed savings and loan associations lacks a central record-keeping system  to keep track of the properties sold, the prices paid or the names of the  buyers.  </P> <P> Without such a system, the Washington headquarters of Resolution Trust Corp.  may be handicapped in detecting potential favoritism, fraud or improper pricing  in the sales of thousands of pieces of property.  </P> <P> The agency's local offices are expected eventually to sell more than $100  billion in real estate from failed thrift institutions, including single-family  homes, condominiums, office buildings, shopping centers and land. The  corporation's four regional offices are independent in deciding the types of  records to keep on purchasers of real estate, The Times has learned.  </P> <P> RTC officials questioned the importance of a central mechanism to identify  buyers but added that such a system eventually will be installed.  </P> <P> The agency is not particularly interested in the identity of buyers, said Kevin  Shields, spokesman for the Denver regional office, which includes California.  "If they have the money and paid in cash, it doesn't matter," he said. "What's  the difference to the taxpayer; who cares who buys it?"  </P> <P> He said that agency procedures will prevent fraud and protect taxpayers. "We  have policies and guidelines that do not allow us to sell below market value."  </P> <P> However, local RTC officials have considerable autonomy, with the authority to  cut the price of a property 20% if it hasn't sold in six months.  </P> <P> The agency has 35,000 properties for sale. Buyers can be identified only if the  specific address of the property is known. Even then, on sales of specific  pieces of property by the 247 thrifts currently operating under Resolution  Trust conservatorship, it is usually necessary to go to the S&amp;L involved to  search for information.  </P> <P> The agency's 14 local offices should have files on the sales of properties held  by S&amp;Ls that have been shut down. However, on a regional level, the  compilation of local figures varies.  </P> <P> The Western region in Denver, for example, has no central listing of buyers of  real estate assets throughout California, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Alaska  and Hawaii.  </P> <P> In the Dallas region, officials began a complete computer record system in  June, insisting that they be notified of the identification of buyers on a  routine basis.  </P> <P> Previously in Dallas, RTC regional reports identified buyers only a third of  the time.  </P> <P> "The system was spotty at best in tracking buyers," said Teresa McUsic, public  affairs officer for the region, which includes Texas and Oklahoma. "The focus  at first was on the number of assets and the dollar amount sold," she added.  "The focus was not on tracking the buyers."  </P> <P> There is an elaborate set of RTC rules, forbidding officials involved in the  cleanup of hundreds of S&amp;Ls to do business with persons who have caused a  loss to a thrift institution. The government does not want people who might  have contributed to the collapse of an S&amp;L to be able to buy foreclosed  properties at bargain prices.  </P> <P> But the lack of a central system makes it difficult for officials in Washington  to know precisely who is buying government-owned real estate.  </P> <P> "Washington has decentralized," said Thomas Hamberger, special assistant to  Lamar Kelly, director of asset and real estate management. "We in Washington do  not keep files on the specific properties."  </P> <P> "The regional directors are in charge of their property, having their people  dealing with the purchasers, doing appraisals and selling property," he said.  He argued that, because sales take place at a local level, it is unnecessary to  have sales records at Washington headquarters.  </P> <P> "It is very difficult for us in Washington to travel to Los Angeles and show a  property," Hamberger noted. "We don't have a specific computer base at this  time to have the capacity, for example, to keep track of single-family home  sales in Los Angeles."  </P> <P> The RTC makes available a list of properties for sale through both printed  volumes and computer discs.  </P> <P> However, there is no accompanying list of the properties that have already sold  by the agency, which has been in existence since last August.  </P> <P> "They know at the local level who they are selling property to," said Stephen  Katsanos, the agency's director of communications. "As far as us in Washington  needing to have a five-foot stack of paper listing everyone who bought  property, I am not sure how useful that would be."  </P> <P> He added: "If I wanted to go to an S&amp;L and find out everything that S&amp;L  has sold, they have the records at the S&amp;L, so I can look at each  transaction." And, he said, at local offices of the agency "I can look at what  has been sold" from defunct S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> Katsanos said that his agency eventually will have a central system for  identifying asset sales and buyers. "I can't tell you (when) at this time," he  said.  </P></p>

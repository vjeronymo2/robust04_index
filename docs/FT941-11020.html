			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Bank backs fixed mortgages The Bank of England has made clear that it would like to see more UK mortgages with fixed interest rates because this would make the operation of monetary policy less costly to homeowners. The Bank notes in an analysis of fixed and floating-rate finance in the UK and abroad that the overwhelming majority of British mortgages are at variable rates, in contrast to the practice in most developed industrialised countries. It also notes that UK household mortgage debt relative to gross domestic product is, at 60 per cent, higher than elsewhere. This means mortgage borrowers in Britain can be subject to 'dramatic and hard-to-predict variability in the proportion of income that needs to be used to meet payment obligations'. Recent buyers, in particular, can suffer 'crippling' increases in outlays when the monetary authorities raise real interest rates to counter inflationary pressures. The Bank's observations, in an article released ahead of publication of its Quarterly Bulletin tomorrow, will be familiar to many families which suffered sharply higher mortgage repayments after base rates were raised from 7.5 per cent in May 1988 to 15 per cent in October 1989. The Bank concludes that the most important effect of more fixed-rate mortgage debt on monetary policy would be a reduction in the sharp impact of short-term interest rate rises on the cashflow of specific households and corporations. 'This would allow interest rates to be increased quickly but at lower cost - in terms of induced liquidity problems - to the private sector.' Half the mortgages granted by banks and building societies in the third quarter of last year were at rates fixed for more than one year compared with 17 per cent in the second quarter of 1992. But the Bank notes that demand for this type of loan 'might evaporate' if money-market rates remain stable for an extended period.</p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEAMS TIPPING OFF THEIR SEASON EARLY;  </P> <P> BASKETBALL: LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL SQUADS ARE LOGGING DOZENS OF GAMES THIS SUMMER IN  PREPARATION FOR THE NOVEMBER CAMPAIGN.  </P> <P> With four starters returning and a 6-foot-11 sophomore joining the team, La  Canada High probably will have its best basketball season during the coming  school year.  </P> <P> "Talent-wise, I think it can be (the best team)," Spartan Coach Tom Hofman  said. "We're way ahead of where I've ever had a team.  </P> <P> "A lot is going to depend on development."  </P> <P> Basketball season, of course, does not begin until the end of November.  </P> <P> But, like most high school coaches, Hofman does not leave much to chance.  </P> <P> Because the Southern and City sections do not regulate the number of games a  team may play during the summer, high school basketball players see voluminous  amounts of supervised court time.  </P> <P> By the end of the first week in August, for example, La Canada will have  completed a summer schedule of almost 50 games.  </P> <P> "We get pretty much the max out of each summer," Hofman said.  </P> <P> So do most other Glendale-area programs.  </P> <P> Crescenta Valley will be in Las Vegas this weekend, putting the finishing  touches on a 26-game summer calendar.  </P> <P> Ribet Academy, the defending Southern Section Small Schools Division champion,  played 25 games and several members of the Fighting Frogs participated in  all-star camps.  </P> <P> "You have to do it because everyone else is doing it," said Hoover Coach Kirt  Kohlmeier, whose team played about 25 games this summer, including two  tournaments. "If you didn't do it, it would be like losing a season."  </P> <P> Hofman, who played at Pasadena High in 1969-70, said summer leagues are all the  rage because gym space no longer is available for pickup games.  </P> <P> "When I played in high school, we had open gyms where you were playing against  good competition five nights a week," said Hofman, who has coached La Canada to  three consecutive Rio Hondo League championships. "But now there aren't open  gyms because of insurance liability.  </P> <P> "Kids just don't have the opportunity to play pickup games like they used to."  </P> <P> However, high school basketball players do pick up and go.  </P> <P> La Canada, for example, played seven games in two days earlier this summer  because of scheduling snafus in two tournaments.  </P> <P> The Spartans recently began a day with a game at Dorsey High in South-Central  Los Angeles. Then they drove to Pomona College in Claremont for a game,  returned to Dorsey for an afternoon contest and headed east again to Claremont  for a nightcap. La Canada finished 2-2 on the day.  </P> <P> "It was our worst day," said Hofman, whose team was 36-9 entering this week.  "But we lost to some good teams."  </P> <P> Crescenta Valley, a perennial playoff participant, doesn't play as many games  as La Canada but the Falcons don't get cheated when it comes to sharpening  their skills.  </P> <P> Crescenta Valley Coach John Goffredo is one of the few coaches who conducts  workouts during the summer.  </P> <P> Crescenta Valley players practice from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., help run a youth camp  from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m., then work as parking attendants at the Hollywood Bowl in  the evenings.  </P> <P> "I know the kids are getting worn out," Goffredo said. "It's definitely more  hectic than the regular year.  </P> <P> "Every one wants to keep up with the Joneses, so no one wants to stop."  </P> <P> Not all coaches, however, are even willing to start.  </P> <P> Subscribing to the theory that it's better to be good in January rather than in  the summer, St. Francis Coach John Jordan scheduled only 12 games for the  Golden Knights this summer.  </P> <P> "We use it (summer league) as a gauge for individuals, not so much the team,"  Jordan said. "We also share a lot of athletes with other sports at the school,  so we don't want to overburden them."  </P> <P> From its summer program, each school will unearth a potential starter or  contributor for next season.  </P> <P> At La Canada, 6-11 sophomore Richard Mandeville will replace departed Louie  Nieto at center and could be the player who helps the Spartans advance past the  Southern Section 3-A quarterfinals, which have been a stumbling block in each  of the past three years.  </P> <P> Senior guard Christian Burgess emerged as Crescenta Valley's leading scorer  this summer and St. Francis benefited from inspired play by sophomore guard  Rudy Martinez and senior guard Tim Mathy.  </P> <P> Junior guard Dave Ulloa led a group of eight solid players at Hoover and junior  forward Ken Vera and junior guard Tim Ramessar established themselves for Ribet  Academy.  </P> <P> "Summer basketball allows players to gain confidence in themselves because  they've played a lot of games against bigger, stronger, and in most cases older  kids," Ribet Academy Coach Mike Miller said. "That pays off when they come back  for the regular season with their confidence at an all-time high."  </P></p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / US balanced budget law back on shelf The proposed constitutional amendment to balance the US federal budget has been put back on the shelf for at least a year following its failure to secure enough votes in the Senate on Tuesday night. The Clinton administration expressed unalloyed pleasure at the outcome. The amendment was carried by 63 votes to 37, four votes short of the required two-thirds majority. Some 22 of the 56 Democrats and 41 of the 44 Republicans voted in favour. The House may well consider the measure later this month, but Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, said afterwards there was 'no way in the world' he would permit a second Senate vote this year, regardless of what the House did. Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader, conceded the issue was dead this session, but vowed to fight on. 'It's going to happen, if not this year, next year or the next year,' he said. Tuesday's vote came as a great relief to the administration, which had lobbied hard against the amendment on both constitutional and practical grounds. Current progress in cutting the deficit would be put at risk, it argued, and important state and federal programmes eviscerated. The more immediate political concern was that failure to stop the amendment could set a nasty precedent for the big upcoming battles in Congress on healthcare reform. As sponsored by Senator Paul Simon, the Illinois Democrat, the amendment, to take effect in 2001, would have prohibited a federal budget deficit unless two-thirds of both houses voted to permit one. To become law, it would also have required approval by three quarters of the 50 state legislatures. Conscious of popular support for the amendment ahead of this year's mid-term elections, the Democratic leadership, under Senator Mitchell and Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, felt obliged to come up with a device to make a vote against easier. This took the form of a weaker amendment, proposed by Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat, calling for a balanced budget but with several exemptions from its strictures, including social security. This went down to a large defeat - 78 votes to 22 - but it provided political cover for six Democratic senators who voted for it on Tuesday afternoon but then opposed the Simon motion later in the night.</p>

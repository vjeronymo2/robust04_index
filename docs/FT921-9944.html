			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Russia unnerved by exchange rate dilemma THE level of foreign investment in Russia will depend on the outcome of a heated debate within the Russian government over whether or not to create a special exchange rate for foreign companies which wish to take part in the privatisation programme being launched, John Lloyd reports from Moscow. Mr Anatoly Chubais, the Russian privatisation minister, said yesterday he was against a special rate - and said that 'unfortunately', it was better to rely on administrative controls on the purchase of Russian stock until the rouble was made at least internally convertible, a process which the government hopes to accomplish this year. That in turn depends, Mr Chubais said, on the provision from abroad of a Dollars 5bn-6bn stabilisation fund to support the rouble, support for which Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, again made an urgent call on Thursday during his visit to France. However, evidence that some authorities plan to use a special rate came yesterday from Mr Vladimir Klimenko, deputy chairman of the Moscow Regional Council. He said that regional authorities intended to set varying exchange rates for foreign investors - varying between Rbs4 to the dollar to Dollars 2 to a rouble. The latter rate is 40 cents higher than the old fixed exchange rate. Under the terms of the Russian privatisation law, foreigners can freely buy enterprises which are abandoned, failing, loss-making or closed - or plants in the food processing and agricultural products sectors. Otherwise, foreigners are only allowed to buy into new enterprises, or to take part in the bidding for a minority of shares at an auction. They may buy into large companies, banking and insurance enterprises and others only by permission of the Russian government. Mr Chubais said the restrictions were necessary because of the low rate of the rouble - officially standing at Rbs110 to the dollar, but selling in interbank auctions for between Rbs160 - 170 to the dollar, and lower in the Baltic exchanges and on the black market. 'If we sold at this rate, it would mean you could buy a shop in Moscow for Dollars 1,000 - students could come and buy one with their holiday earnings.' The minister said that over the past two years, 'wild' privatisation had meant that state assets had fallen into the hands of company managers. He said that any attempt to prosecute those who had taken the assets for themselves would be difficult because there was no framework of law within which to bring prosecutions. The government plans to sell off 25 per cent of state enterprises this year, for a target amount of Rbs92bn - starting with shops and small companies. The amount raised is planned to increase to Rbs350bn in 1995 and to up to Rbs500bn in 1994. Workers will be given 25 per cent of the shares, and can choose to buy another 10 per cent at favourable prices.</p>

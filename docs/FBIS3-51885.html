			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Venezuelan President Ramon J. Velasquez to </F> representatives of the Chambers of Deputies and Senate following  the announcement of the start of a new period of Venezuelan  National Congress regular sessions at the Sol del Peru Room of  the Miraflores Presidential Palace in Caracas -- live]    [Text] Mr. Senate President and President of the National  Congress; Mr. President of the Chamber of Deputies and Vice  President of the National Congress; Dr. Felipe Montilla,  president of the Senate Commission; Messrs. Senators; Dr. Pedro  Tabata Guzman, president of the Chamber of Deputies Commission;  Messrs. Deputies; Messrs. Ministers:    I would be lying if I denied the deep emotion I felt when  listening to this morning's television debate. I saw in the  debate that a new chapter in Venezuelan democracy was opening.  All this time I have focused my efforts on fulfilling my duty  to democracy, Venezuela, and the National Congress, which has  given me enormous responsibility.    With his usual extraordinary voice, Dr. Felipe Montilla  reminded me of the origin of that mandate and described the  historic national climate of those hours. When I was sworn in I  told my fellow members of parliament -- where I have spent most  of my life as a politician during this democratic stage -- that  a political storm had led me here and that at any moment the  crisis could oust me, but my personal and political ethics would  not be discredited. I wanted to fulfill the mandate and I  wanted to avoid an interruption in the country's democracy, a  process to which the country was committed. I was sure that more  important than the painful conflict that brought us together was  the Venezuelan willingness to live in freedom. I was also sure  of the powers of the democratic process of perfection and  correction.    A dictatorship would have been unable to face the crises  that  the Venezuelan democratic system faced throughout 1992-93. It  was a series of political, military, and social factors and it  was within a climate of exacerbation, and for many, a climate of  defeat and disorientation.    However, above that atmosphere stood Venezuelan society's  resolve, which had been tested during that process and is open  to the admission of new political and social forces which are  gradually appearing in an increasingly developing Venezuela.    Contrary to other Latin American countries, where  traditional  parties have attempted to close ranks and exclude the new forces  emerging from development itself from political debate and  democratic and legal participation, Venezuelan democracy has  opened up this participation, allowing new challenges for the  country to be stated from their platforms.    In a process currently criticized by many as frustrating,  this democracy has accomplished that which certain people were  determined to achieve since 1936. From exile, the founding  leaders of the democratic process pointed out the need to have a  school in each village, a high school in each town, and a  university in every state capital, so that through learning we  could change the traditional education system and, therefore,  change the system whereby the country was ruled by a very small  group.    Democracy has allowed this magnificent opening whereby each  region designates its governor and every community its mayor.  Democracy has gradually led to the growing participation of  civilian society. There have been mistakes, failings,  corruption and influence peddling, but complaints, lawsuits and  democratic society's watchfulness have corrected those defects  and created a critical awareness among Venezuelans in response  to those negative attitudes. This had to be protected; the  democratic process could not be interrupted because to do so  would hinder Venezuelan society's end-of-century plans.    If my administration was hesitant and weak, it is because  democracy is hesitant and weak. It is hesitant because to make  a decision it must consult with all of the sectors; it is weak  because it must accept [the will of those sectors], but its  weakness is ironclad; it does not break. Only authoritarian  regimes can boast a strength that translates into arbitrariness  and the will of one person against the community.    When I see the accusations that have been leveled against  Congress and against political activity in Venezuela, perhaps  because I am a researcher of history and have participated in  lengthy episodes, I can only look back at the political activity  of this century to see how the political strength of congress,  the political parties, the news media, and the opposition have  gradually undermined the bad habits, cunning, and hindrances  that blocked the development of Venezuelan society for almost  two centuries.    This is a society on the move because it has the  watchfulness of democracy through the parliament, through the  constant denunciations and complaints by the media. It is  preferable to have exaggerations than silence.    Venezuelan democracy is the fruit of a painful experience  because what was attained in the end was what successive  generations since the 19th century and until the sixties of this  century wanted to have, to live with liberty and dignity.    Messrs. Senators and Deputies, you will start legislative  sessions at a very difficult time in national life, because the  threats facing the country are not traditional conspiracies or  attempts to frustrate the process but problems such as the  country's fiscal situation.    To fulfill the mandate of the Congress of the Special Powers  Law, I, together with the Council of Minister and with the  attendance of the most renown lawyers of the country, assumed  the responsibility of promulgating the laws that the Congress  pointed out to me, including tax laws, because it is necessary  to say that in light of the demands of development, social  demands, the state's commitments, the income from petroleum  today is not capable, as it was in the recent past, of  fulfilling those demands. Those demands are now on the  government's table.    Tax collection is necessary. It will not be done through the  taxes we promulgated with the Special Powers Law but, as one of  the new parliament's immediate tasks, it must undertake a study  of the fiscal paths that would allow the state to immediately  tend to the problems, its own administrative problems as well as  the social problems that have been pointed out; the problems  related to the salaries and the cost of living.    On the other hand, it is indispensable -- I confirmed this  need in its real dimensions -- to deal with the social problem,  the poverty problem, because there can be no perfect political  democracy if the wood worm of social disaster, which is created  by poverty, is at the base of that democracy. As far as I am  concerned, this has been an extraordinary watch tower, an  observatory, as well as an information bureau. This is the case  because just as I was able to establish a dialogue here with the  political parties, I have also been able to meet with the  economic sectors, other sectors of the population and other  social sectors that allowed me to have a good idea of the  Venezuelan social crisis.    The best way to reaffirm democracy, ensure that it can  extend  to the next century and ensure sustained growth is by finding  solutions to the fiscal, social, and poverty problems in  Venezuela. I truthfully say.... [pauses] I am aware that it is  inappropriate to use certain words especially during addresses  such as this one, but I am going to do it anyway because I am  addressing persons who were my parliamentary companions for so  many years. I want to say that I am ending my term quite  content. I am content because I have been able to witness the  arrival here at the Sol del Peru Room, of those legitimate  representatives of the new political and national country that  you represent. This means that Venezuelan democracy has been  able to pass through a dark tunnel which opened the way to all  sorts of sneak attacks, and every dishonest conduct imaginable  aimed at preventing the country from progressing.    Your presence here on this 23 January 1994 is evidence of  democracy's strength. Your presence here and the incorporation  of the new political organizations, the presence of new  parliamentarians and the parliamentary youths, is the best  evidence of a new year. Venezuela's destiny is in your hands  because, as has already been said by the presidents of the great  commissions, we have arrived at a moment of understanding. I  was telling the president-elect that when he is preparing to  announce his programs, he should first ensure a national  agreement. It is indispensable that we reach a national  agreement in Venezuela. Problems are so serious and there is so  little time, that truce and understanding are indispensable.    It is not a matter of distributing public posts, ministries  or embassies. That makes no sense whatsoever. I am referring  to an agreement about the country's fundamental problems, the  solution of which can wait no longer. The voice of every sector  must be heard. As legitimate representatives of the country's  regions and opinions, the national agreement must find in each  of you its champions and guarantors.    In concluding this address, I would like to deeply thank  Senator Montilla for his generous words and offer that I will be  able to return as always, as if it were my home. Thank you.  Good evening.</p>

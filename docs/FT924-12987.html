			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Property: Timeless folly for sale THOSE interested in early Victorian architecture have a rare chance to buy a building that was eccentric even by 19th century standards: the Clock House at St Leonards, East Sussex. Its clock tower dominates the public gardens at St Leonards, looking across them out to sea. The Clock House was built as the focal point of a speculative development by James Burton and his architect son Decimus. But the development cost Burton senior the fortune he had made in building a large area of Bloomsbury, central London. He was more successful developing Royal Tunbridge Wells, and in raising a 1,000-strong regiment of the Loyal British Artificers to fight Napoleon. (Building workers were the soldiers and architects the officers). James died at St Leonards in 1837. Decimus went on to design the great Palm House at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in 1844. Their Clock House is on offer at Pounds 235,000 from Fox &amp; Co (0444-450-105).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Milan Martic, president of the republic of </F> Serbian Krajina, by Ilija Zurobac; place and date not given: "I  Shall Fulfill the Demands of the Nation"]    [Text] The most important thing now is to immediately  kickstart the paralyzed economy, to return some of the armed  people from the front, and to start the professionalization of  the army. Afterward, we will start public works in forestry and  agriculture, and the reconstruction of Krajina. In this way, we  will create the conditions for a normal functioning of the  state, while drawing a sizable number of people into the  reconstruction of the war-torn republic of Serbian Krajina  [RSK]. All this, newly elected RSK President Milan Martic  emphasizes, is contained in his electoral program.    Everything that I have promised, he says, starting with a  stable and efficient economy, the establishment of legal order,  the revitalization of the economy, the social program,  diplomacy, and naturally, the unification of the Serbian lands,  I intend to carry out. However, prior to the unification we  must build a stable country, with a strong defense and economy.  I hope that we will accomplish this within a relatively short  period of time and that we will not longer need to ask for aid  from Serbia, but will help it as much as we can.    Milan Martic does not doubt that he will get the support of  the RSK Assembly for everything that he intends to do,  regardless of the fact that it is the SDS [Serbian Democratic  Party] of Krajina and the SRS [Serbian Radical Serbian] for  Krajina, which support Dr. Milan Babic, that have the majority  in the new parliament.    Nobody has an absolute majority in our parliament, Martic  says. The SDS of Krajina has 31 deputies and can only achieve a  majority through a coalition. I am not worried by this because  I will carry out talks with the chiefs of the parliamentary  groups and the leaders of the parties and demand that they  respect the will of the people. I recommend them to refrain  from working toward the differentiation and obstruction of the  authorities, as the people expect a better life and a stable  country for all of us. I will extend my hand to everyone, and  give them a chance to work in the joint interests. The national  interest of the Serbian people must be above party interests,  Martic says.  <H5>  Adamantly Against Profiteers </H5>   By saying this, President Martic emphasizes that the new  government will carry a great burden and responsibility, as an  extremely capable cadre is needed for the realization of such an  ambitious program. Martic says that the government will be  formed among the most capable people in the RSK, regardless of  their party membership. The Krajina residents who are currently  in Serbia or Montenegro, among whom are numerous acclaimed  businessmen, will definitely be included, too. Martic's  intention is to create capable teams of experts, consisting of  powerful personalities and acclaimed businessmen, who will be  prepared for round-the-clock, self-sacrificing work.    When asked whom he would like to see at the head of such a  government, Martic did not wish to give a precise answer. It is  inevitable, he says, that he holds consultations before he  announces the name of the prime minister designate. However, he  will do this soon.    One of the conditions for the RSK to become a truly stable  country is also the information system, of which a real mess has  been made in the electoral campaign. This is one of the  priority tasks, the president says. In a moment in which  efforts are being undertaken to create a unified information  space of all Serbian lands, it is intolerable that our  information system is being fragmented into some sort of  communal, and other, media systems.    Asked to comment on the divisions between the "north" and  the  "south" of Krajina and the ways in which they reflect other  problems, Milan Martic says that this division does not exist.  There are differences that will definitely be overcome. The  north and the south of the RSK wish to live together and none of  them wish to secede, as has often been overemphasized, Martic  says. We will find a way that nobody will be harmed, he adds,  that all who work will be stimulated.    I have nothing against lavish hosts and rich people if they  have acquired their property honestly. However, I am a fierce  opponent of all who have acquired wealth through profiteering,  theft, and criminal activities. With such we shall deal  mercilessly. They will all be held responsible, that is for  sure, Martic emphasizes.  <H5>  No Bargaining With Krajina </H5>   The economic, political, and other trends in the RSK are in  many ways also influenced by the republic of Srpska. It is  natural, Martic says, that we are also "interwoven" in the  Geneva negotiations. If we do not stick together, there will be  no survival. The main Krajina capacities are linked to  companies in the republic of Srpska, and, with the formation of  a consortium of experts, the economies of the RSK, the republic  of Srpska, and Serbia have been thoroughly linked. This is a  way toward the formation of a unified economic territory of the  Serbian lands. There will soon be unification of the monetary  system and the new Yugoslav "super dinar" is being introduced in  the RSK.    It is realistic to expect that the unification of all  Serbian  lands will materialize this year already, Martic says. Many  Krajina residents have left their homes and have ended up in  Serbia, Montenegro, and all over Europe. Their fate is  uncertain for the time being, however, the RSK president says  that this will be resolved soon. We have already have prepared  a program that will be applicable to all those who have left  Krajina. We will cooperate closely with the High Commissioner  for Refugees and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Serbia and  Montenegro. We will demand that all those who have  unjustifiably gained refugee status be found and immediately  returned to their homes. The majority of them have left their  houses in Krajina. If they do not want to return, we will be  forced to confiscate their property. Naturally, we cannot apply  the same treatment to the Serbian refugees from Croatia, they  are a special category, Martic adds.    Many see the way out of the situation, in neither peace nor  war, in bargaining with the Krajina territories with Croatia.  Significant regions and towns are on auction. Milan Martic  categorically denies all these stories and malicious  disinformation that are, according to him, aimed at disuniting  the RSK.    There is no substance to these stories, Martic says. There  is no bargaining with Krajina, not a single part of Serbian  soil. True enough, we cannot regain Western Slavonija now,  however we have not given up on this region. We cannot resettle  the Serbs from that area there, and we cannot even promise them  this now. However, it is definite that, if they return there,  they will not be doomed to the Croatian checkerboard [reference  to Croatian flag]. For the time being, I believe, they are  safer in Baranja, Eastern Slavonija, and Western Srem, where  they should feel like equal citizens. I expect the old settlers  to accept them as their own.  <H5>  [Box 1, p 2] </H5> <H5>  Only on an Equal Footing </H5>   The statement about the cooperation of the governments of  the  FRY and Croatia is a positive step in the resolution of  Serbian-Croatian relations. It represents the insistence on a  peaceful solution of problems and offers a guarantee of peace.  It is important that the statement does not prejudice a  political solution, which gives hope that, with sufficient  engagement and patience, a final solution will be reached, Milan  Martic says. The fact that Croatia and its leaders use this to  prove that the international community considers Krajina to be  Croatian territory has no realistic grounds. I am not surprised  by Tudjman's statements, because he has not prepared his people  for the truth, and it is thus logical that he always looks for  ways to throw sand in their eyes and placate them with promises.  In the future, Krajina will strive to win an equal status in all  international negotiations, just like the Serbian Republic. Our  fate will not be tailored without us.  <H5>  [Box 2, p 2] </H5> <H5>  Without Vengefulness </H5>   The circumstances made Milan Martic become a politican, too.  As he says he understands his current role as a transitional  phase in the constitution of a unified Serbian state. He  believes that his mandate will last a shorter time than  envisaged. This legendary warrior and chief of the Krajina  police, known as a man of high moral qualities, says the  following about his role as a politician:    I believe that I will justify the trust of the nation and  accomplish the joint goal -- the unification of the Serbian  lands. This means numerous changes in the RSK, primarily cadre  changes. Naturally, cadre changes must take place, but there  will definitely be no revenge again anyone. All changes will be  implemented exclusively for the sake of the faster development  of Krajina's prosperity. Generally speaking, the army will  undergo the biggest changes. If we realize the program  according to the established schedule, I hope that the RSK will  have a professional army and considerably stronger defense in  half a year's time.  <H5>  [Box 3, p 2] </H5> <H5>  Unified State </H5>   There is no alternative to the unification of the Serbian  lands. I believe that a unified Serbian state will be formed  very quickly. This is the only solution by which we will grow  economically stronger and become a stable European country.  Naturally, the capital of this country will be Belgrade and its  president Slobodan Milosevic, Martic says.  <H5>  [Box 4, p 2] </H5> <H5>  Zhirinovskiy </H5>   Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is a friend of the Serbian people and  I  am glad that he has visited the Serbian lands. I am awaiting  meeting him joy. I believe that he can do a lot for the Serbian  nation. We, of course, would not consider comparing him to  anyone in Russia, as the entire Russian nation is our friend and  we expect support from him, the RSK president says.</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / EC to investigate Du Pont purchase of ICI nylon side THE EUROPEAN Commission is to investigate the proposed acquisition by Du Pont, the US chemicals company, of Imperial Chemical Industries' nylon business because the deal may distort competition in the market for nylon carpet fibres. The investigation will take up to four months and follows a four-week preliminary inquiry. Both companies yesterday said they were confident that the commission would eventually allow the transaction to go ahead. ICI said: 'While not unexpected it is unfortunate. It will add to the uncertainty felt by employees and customers.' The sale is part of an agreement made in April under which ICI would receive Pounds 250m in cash and Du Pont's acrylics business in exchange for its nylon operations. The agreement called for the deal to be completed by the end of the year. ICI said yesterday this was still the target. However, if the commission is still not happy about the agreement after its four-month inquiry, it could outlaw the deal or ask the companies to amend it, for example by selling overlapping parts of the business. Since EC merger regulations came into force in September 1990, 93 deals have been notified to the commission's merger task force, of which only six have gone into the second-phase four-month inquiry. Of those six, only one - last year's Franco-Italian bid for De Havilland, the Canadian aircraft-maker - has been blocked outright. US anti-trust regulators open inquiries this month. If the deal does go ahead, Du Pont would become the largest manufacturer of nylon in western Europe, with 30 per cent of capacity. Its main European competitor would be the new 50:50 joint venture between Rhone-Poulenc of France and Snia of Italy, with about 25 per cent of capacity. The industry has been forced to consolidate because nylon sales have been hit by the world slowdown in construction - most is used in carpets. However, its problems go back to the early 1970s, since when it has lost market share especially in clothing to another artificial fibre, polyester. ICI nylon operations have sales of about Pounds 600m annually and 6,100 employees in the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. By swapping nylon for acrylics, ICI distances itself from the textiles industry and concentrates on mainstream chemicals.</p>

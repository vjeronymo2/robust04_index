			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Russian economy worsens as rouble drops by 7.3% The frail Russian economy tottered yesterday as its currency plunged 7.3 per cent, inflation turned upward and a struggle over the membership and the policies of the new government intensified. On Moscow's interbank currency exchange the rouble, which has slid 25 per cent this month, traded at Rbs1,504 to the dollar, down Rbs102 from Monday. On the streets, the US currency was changing hands at up to Rbs1,700 as queues formed at exchange offices. The inflation rate reached 12 per cent for the first two weeks of January alone, it emerged. It is on course for more than 20 per cent for the whole of this month after a much trumpeted fall to a monthly 12 per cent in December. Mr Boris Fyodorov, the most prominent liberal cabinet member whose fate is still unknown, refused the finance minister post after it was offered to him without his present rank of deputy premier. He sent a stinging letter to President Boris Yeltsin accusing prime minister Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin's government of 'sliding into communism' and refusing to 'act as a veil for its policies'. He repeated that he would not serve while Mr Viktor Gerashchenko remained chairman of the central bank or if Mr Alexander Zaveryukha, a deputy premier and member of the pro-communist Agrarian party, was confirmed in his post. He also demanded guarantees that reform would continue. Unconfirmed reports on the radio station Ekho Moskvy said that Mr Yeltsin - who was locked for most of the day in a meeting with Mr Chernomyrdin described by his press secretary as 'not easy' - had proposed replacing Mr Gerashchenko. This would presumably allow Mr Fyodorov to remain in government, possibly as first deputy prime minister - the post vacated by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the leading economic reformer who resigned at the weekend. Mr Alexander Shokhin, an original member of the radical Gaidar team who now takes a moderate stance, told reporters yesterday at the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, that he had been offered the post of economics minister or of minister for the Commonwealth of Independent States. He was considering the offers. Mutual recriminations are now flying among the leading members of the Russia's Choice party, headed by Mr Gaidar, following the defection from it of Mr Fyodorov and Mr Andrei Makarov to the Union of December 12. This was formed after the parliamentary election by liberal independent deputies headed by Mrs Irina Khakamada. Mr Sergei Yushenkov, a senior member of Russia's Choice, said that Mr Fyodorov's move 'raised ethical questions' since he was elected on the Russia's Choice ticket. From the other side of the political spectrum Mr Sergei Baburin, a leading nationalist deputy, said that 'Gaidar's departure will complete the transition of Russia's Choice from government to opposition'.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Despite obstacles, it appears that a dialogue  between Greece and Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM] with Cyrus Vance's mediation will begin and is  expected to continue immediately after the two sides reply to  the proposals presented by the international mediator in Geneva.  Very little is known about the contents of Vance's set of  ideas. However, there are reports that the proposed draft  agreement has basic similarities with the one presented in May  1993 by Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen although it has some basic  differences.    According to information from diplomatic sources, the most  significant difference is the separation of the  confidence-building measures from the issue of the name.  According to the same sources, in order to continue the current  efforts, the international mediator has not made the lifting of  Greek countermeasures a condition, as Skopje insists. Greek  diplomatic moves are distinguished by a first phase that  includes the formation of the preliminary conditions for the  resumption of the dialogue and a second phase that includes  dialogue under the auspices of the United Nations and economic  cooperation measures between the two countries. Parallel  meetings of experts from the two countries with Vance are  expected in the next couple of days to discuss his proposals.  Separate meetings between the UN mediator and the foreign  ministers of the two countries are expected to follow.</p>

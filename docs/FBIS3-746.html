As a 400-odd vehicle convey filled with  armed rightists left the BDF air strip late on Friday afternoon,  troop carriers of the BDF confronted them.    "Every route the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] tried  to  take out of town, the BDF prevented them from doing so," STAR  newspaper photographer Ken Oosterbroek told SAPA. He said shots  were fired, and he also suspected the rightists had suffered  more casualties.    The situation was so bad that the rightists had to ask for  an  SA Defence Force [SADF] escort out of town.    "The SADF said they would help get them out as long as they  promised not to return. An officer told them `if there is  contact we will take care of it. If you people shoot we will  leave you in your own,'" Oosterbroek said.    The rightists left town heading towards the border and were  by shortly after 8pm said to be regrouping for a revenge attack  against the BDF -- but this could not be immediately  independently confirmed.</p>

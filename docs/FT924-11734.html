			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Andreotti under fire over aide's Mafia role THE former Italian prime minister, Mr Giulio Andreotti, came under fire yesterday after a magistrate's report named Salvatore Lima, his right-hand man in Sicily who was killed in March, as the Mafia's link to the political establishment, Reuter reports from Rome. The report also disclosed that Tommaso Buscetta, the Mafia's most famous turncoat, has decided to talk to investigators about relations between gangsters and politicians - a topic he had earlier refused to discuss on the grounds it was too delicate. The report issued on Wednesday said the Mafia murdered Lima, a former mayor of Palermo, because he stopped protecting their interests after years of collusion. Lima, 64, who had been a member of the European Parliament and the uncontested leader of the Sicilian wing of the Christian Democrats loyal to Mr Andreotti, was shot dead in his car less than a month before last April's national elections. Mr Andreotti, who served in all post-war Italian governments until last April, continued to defend Lima in radio and newspaper interviews after the report was issued. 'I never found one element to judge him (as a Mafioso) . . . but I know how much he helped us in the fight against the Mafia in these past years,' Mr Andreotti told Italian radio. But Mr Andreotti came under sharp fire in the media and from some politicians for defending Lima for years when many suspected him of Mafia collusion. The newspaper La Repubblica ran a front-page cartoon showing Mr Andreotti removing his face to reveal an alligator with a head shaped like Sicily. Mr Antonino Caponnetto, the retired magistrate who founded Palermo's anti-Mafia investigation unit in the early 1980s, criticised Mr Andreotti for continuing to defend Lima 'in tones which seemed like a prelude to a beatification'. 'Everybody knew except Giulio,' L'Indipendente said in an editorial which called Lima 'the Mafia's travelling salesman'. Mr Leoluca Orlando, a former mayor of Palermo and head of the maverick anti-Mafia party La Rete (The Network), criticised the Christian Democrats for sending Lima to the European parliament. Palermo magistrates have issued 24 arrest warrants for Mafia members suspected of ordering and carrying out Lima's killing. At least five have been arrested.</p>

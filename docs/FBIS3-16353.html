It was pointed out that after the State Duma's resolution on  political amnesty, the parliamentary commission for  investigations into these events had been dissolved. According  to the Communist activists, this lets those responsible for the  bloodshed avoid punishment.    The Communist Party's plenum also addressed the Russian  government with an open statement expressing concern over  "unprecedented destruction of Russian agriculture."    The statement emphasized that the current government's  policy  was making Russian agriculture insolvent since it was supporting  foreign farmers. Communist Party activists believe that the  issue must be discussed urgently before the situation gets out  of control. This could trigger off unpredictable consequences,  the statement said.    The plenum adopted the party's draft program "From Crisis to  Sustained Development." The program states that Russia must  finally become a state with a socialist economy established  after the nationalization of private property."    The Communists stressed that a regime of personal  presidential power had been set up in Russia after the new  constitution had been adopted by a minority of the population.  The Communist program considers it to be a "juridical and  political confirmation of dictatorship by corrupted capital."    The program of the Communist Party is to be submitted for  consideration at the party's third congress this autumn.</p>

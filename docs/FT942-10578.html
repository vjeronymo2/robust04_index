			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / The right question time Yes, there should be a referendum on Europe. It could be held in 1997, if in the preceding year the European Union acquires central control over its member states. Alternatively, it might come on a hypothetical date in the wild blue yonder - say the day before a British government concludes that sterling should be melted down into a single pan-European currency, if there is one. There is no principled case for a poll now, and even less for a ballot in which the question would be, as Mr William Cash puts it, 'Do you want a federal Europe?' That would be as sensible a barometer of opinion as 'Should we eat the firstborn?' A quickie summer referendum whose purpose was to save the Conservative party would be pointless. No constitutional precept would justify it. Beyond possibly buying a little time, it would not save the Tories. It is true that the then Harold Wilson achieved a (temporary) ceasefire in the Labour party by calling a plebiscite on Britain's membership of the 'common market' in 1975, but four years later a sorely divided Labour government was out of office. It has not been back since. Mr John Major may be tempted to try his luck, but he will be aware that any give on a referendum today might legitimise the already open faction-fighting in his cabinet. Supposedly disciplined ministers thump their own tubs quite enough already. Heaven help the Tories if they are freed to answer questions on the single currency. The riposte canvassers are meeting on the doorsteps - 'which Conservative party are you from?' - would become universal. Yet there is a practical case for promising a plebiscite in certain circumstances. Promising because nothing is about to happen this year or next. Such a long-term undertaking would be of limited value, since no party leader can bind his or her successor. Against that, statements by leaders can act as markers. The Conservatives should say, and mean it, that a commitment to hold a referendum on strengthening the EU will be in the next general election manifesto. They should do this on principle, not expediency. Such a strategy would be forced on them anyhow, if substantive, centralising, constitutional changes were agreed at the intergovernmental conference of 1996 - or, as Mr Norman Lamont intimates, if Britain's monetary policy was about to be controlled by a European central bank. An unconsulted public could not be expected to support the government in either endeavour. There is no getting away from this. Important constitutional proposals should be submitted to the voters for a decision. The establishment of the European Union on the basis of the Maastricht treaty was endorsed by the general election of April 1992. That was then. Next time might be different. Suppose that in 1996 the EU crosses the line laid down by its nation states, and acquires self-sustaining sovereign powers. That would be a huge alteration in the way in which people are governed. As presently set up, even after Maastricht, the EU is a congeries of states, in constant debate about an almost infinite series of treaties and sub-treaties, ever trying to agree on pan-European rules for this and that. After the 1996 conference, it could become an embryonic super-state, the stuff of English nightmares and continental fantasies. As Mr Paddy Ashdown has said, that would be the time to consult the people. In such a circumstance, as Mr Ashdown has not said, a general election would be an insufficient method of gauging the popular verdict, since the character of the EU would be permanently altered. There is no problem about what question should be asked. The leader of the Liberal Democrats has this one right. The entire package agreed by the member states should be put before the public. 'Do you accept it?' they would be asked. 'Yes or no?' When a change is significant enough to warrant mass consultation, the question usually sets itself. Should Scotland have its own parliament? Should the first-past-the-post system of voting be changed? If so, to what? Should Maastricht II be enacted? This last proposition is acknowledged by passionate British advocates of a federal Europe, such as the European Movement. You will appreciate the flavour of the EM if you reflect on the choice of Sir Edward Heath to deliver the keynote address at its weekend 'rally for European democracy'. The meeting was called to debate a text for British Europhiles, published last week under the title 'Reform of the European Union'. We may rest assured that Mr Major will not take up this package. He will be aware that the EM's proposals could only be put forward by a Conservative prime minister on his last day in office. There is no need to go into detail. Just note that the movement would streng-then the European Parliament and place the administration of justice, as well as foreign and security policy, under the central control of an evolving quasi-state. Whoa there. Justice and security are the separate 'pillars' for which Mr Major fought so hard at Maastricht. On one point, however, the EM might find all sides in agreement. It proposes that the new constitution should not come into force until it has been approved . . . 'in referenda to be held simultaneously throughout the Union'. As it says, 'such a constitution requires a large consensus among the citizens, as well as very thorough preparation by its drafters'. The EM does not believe this will be achieved by 1996, so we can assume that its proposed referenda might not take place much before the close of the century. This prolonged timetable has been used as camouflage by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, as it has been by ministers who seek cover while the flak flies all around them. Scarred, perhaps, by his experience of the Scottish referendum of March 1979, Mr Smith has been consistently against a Maastricht ballot. 'Normally decisions are taken by Parliament,' he said yesterday. 'But this is a decision that is so far ahead that we can consider all these matters carefully much nearer the time.' Translated, that means: 'I'm still keeping my mouth shut, and watching the Tories destroy themselves.' Some Conservatives admire this Trappist strategy but the voters may not reward him for it. Mr Smith has proffered a referendum on proportional representation, to keep his party together. He should think about promising one on a centralised Europe, or a single currency. Why? Because it would be right.</p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> AL OWNERS REJECT GAYLORD'S ATTEMPT TO BUY OUT RANGERS  </P> <P> American League owners have rejected Edward Gaylord's attempt to purchase  majority interest in the Texas Rangers.  </P> <P> Gaylord, of Oklahoma City, owns about one-third of the Rangers' stock and wants  to buy an additional 58%. Baseball owners reportedly have opposed Gaylord's bid  because they do not want another team owned by a broadcasting company.  </P> <P> "I have been informed by the major league baseball ownership committee this  afternoon that they have reached a recommendation that the transaction between  myself and Mr. Gaylord not be approved in accordance with the guidelines for  the transfer of controlling interest that were adopted by baseball in 1988,"  Texas owner Eddie Chiles said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Gaylord was out of town today and unavailable for comment, his office said.  Jerry Reinsdorf, chairman of baseball's joint ownership committee, today  confirmed the rejection.  </P> <P> A number of other investors, including former Rangers executive Larry  Schmittou, have expressed interest in buying the franchise. A son of President  Bush also has expressed interest.  </P> <P> The change in ownership needed 11 votes in the American League and seven votes  in the National League.  </P> <P> Gaylord is president of Oklahoma Publishing Co., the parent company for Gaylord  Broadcasting Co., and some owners have been concerned about Gaylord's  broadcasting interests, which includes Ft. Worth's KTVT-TV, the station that  televises Rangers games.  </P></p>

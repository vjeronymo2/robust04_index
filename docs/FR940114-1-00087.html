			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By allowing a filing of a claim on the date ``collection of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the loan is stayed''_the date of the filing of the petition by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the borrower, or, in a Chapter 13 case, by the endorser or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrower_rather than the date a borrower receives a discharge,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statute might be read to permit claims to be submitted if an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endorser files, rather than, as under prior law, only in borrower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bankruptcies. Nothing in the amendments suggested that such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result was intended, and the proposed regulations would permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the submission of a bankruptcy claim only in the case of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrower bankruptcy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations would continue to require lenders  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to file proofs of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding, unless the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guaranty agency directs otherwise or the holder is officially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notified by the court that no assets are available for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution. If the guaranty agency later receives notice that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assets have become available, the guarantor must file a proof of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim at that point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants in the negotiated rulemaking proceedings noted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a growing number of discharges were being received by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrowers who file sequential bankruptcy petitions, particularly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those who first file for relief in Chapter 13. During the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pendency of the prior bankruptcy case, loans in repayment less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than seven years are non-dischargeable without proof of undue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hardship, yet cannot be enforced by the holder according to their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original terms; little or nothing may be paid on those loans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the proceeding. Rather than attempting to show that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repayment would constitute an undue hardship, or negotiating an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income-sensitive repayment arrangement with the holder, borrowers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who complete their Chapter 13 proceeding may then file a second  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bankruptcy petition, making sure that the second is filed more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than seven years after the loan entered repayment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Bankruptcy Code excludes the period of ``any applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspension of the repayment period'' from the seven-year period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during which loans are dischargeable only for undue hardship. 11  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. 523(a)(8)(A). If the term ``suspension of the repayment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period'' is read, as these borrowers contend, to include only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forbearance or deferments granted by the holder of the loan, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reality of the forbearance imposed by virtue of the automatic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stay in the prior bankruptcy_which barred enforcement of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan according to its terms during the pendency of the bankruptcy_would be ignored, and borrowers who have neither made the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required seven-year attempt to repay nor demonstrated undue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hardship would obtain a discharge in the second bankruptcy. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary does not consider this interpretation of the statute to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be consistent with its purpose, and the only court that has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed this precise issue has concluded that the period during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which enforcement of a loan is stayed in a prior bankruptcy is an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``applicable suspension of the repayment period'' for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computing the seven-year period for a subsequent bankruptcy.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> re Saburah, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  136 B.R. 246, 254 (Bankr. C.D. Cal. 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of the above discussion, the Secretary proposes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpret the term ``applicable suspension of the repayment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period'' to include periods during which the automatic stay in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bankruptcy proceeding is in effect. The Secretary further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognizes that a borrower who in fact meets his or her  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligation under the original repayment agreement during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bankruptcy has acted in a manner consistent with the intent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statute, and this proposed interpretation would not regard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the period of the first bankruptcy as a period of suspension of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repayment for the borrower.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The death and bankruptcy requirements in proposed &sect;682.402  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are taken directly from the HEA. There is no change to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current disability cancellation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Closed School Cancellations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The closed school cancellation provision is taken, in large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part, directly from the mandates of the HEA, although the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations reflect some areas of necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpretation. The discussion that follows is grouped into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three major areas where the Secretary and the negotiators had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretion to interpret the statutory closed school cancellation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Student Withdrawal Prior to the Closing of the School <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There was unanimous agreement among the negotiators and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary that it would be inequitable to strictly limit a closed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> school cancellation to only those students who were in attendance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the school on the date that the school officially closed. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed earlier, conditions at the school immediately preceding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its closing may have caused a deterioration in the educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program that would have prompted a student to withdraw. Such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student should not lose entitlement to a loan cancellation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because of his or her prescience or inability to tolerate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> school's deterioration. To balance the interests of students and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the federal taxpayers (who ultimately must pay the cost of each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancelled loan), the Secretary proposes to limit this withdrawal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period to not more than 90 days prior to the date the school  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Student Use of Teach-out or Transfer of Academic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Credits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed earlier, the Secretary does not believe that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student who completed the educational program for which the loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was intended, even though the completion occurred through a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> teach-out at another school or by the student's transfer of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> academic credits earned at the closed school, should be able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> avoid repaying that loan. The student is not required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer those credits or make use of a teach-out opportunity,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but if the student chooses to do so, then the Secretary believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, because the student was able to complete the educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program, it would be unfair to require the Federal taxpayer to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pay the student's loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Student Statement Requirement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary believes that a statement made by the student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under penalty of perjury demonstrating eligibility for a closed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> school discharge should be obtained from the student to assist  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary or the Secretary's designees in pursuing claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against the closed school. Without this statement, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary's ability to protect the interests of the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer would be frustrated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

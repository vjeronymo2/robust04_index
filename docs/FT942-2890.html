			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Minister firm on college contracts Mr Tim Boswell, the further education minister, will today step up the government's intervention in the dispute between college principals and lecturers over new contracts and conditions. He will tell the Colleges' Employers' Forum that any college signing contracts approved by the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education, which include guarantees on teaching hours, would be severely disadvantaged. This could mean forfeiting funds. Under rules announced in the Budget by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, the government can withhold up to 2 per cent of a further education college's budget if it maintains 'restrictive practices' in lecturers' contracts. Education ministers will decide whether contracts are restrictive. Mr Boswell will today list several such practices under the present national contract. These include 14 weeks holiday a year, a limit of 21 hours a week spent in class and a limit of 30 duty hours. The association has urged colleges to match the contract it signed with the Manchester College of Art and Technology. This placed a limit of 756 hours on each lecturer's teaching time a year - even less than the level Mr Boswell considers restrictive - and gave contractual safeguards on the length of the working week. Strikes have been held at more than 70 further education colleges this week in protest at the more flexible contracts. The association yesterday urged the employers' forum to re-open national talks.</p>

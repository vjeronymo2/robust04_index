			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhao Lianqing (6392 6647 1987)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 25 May (XINHUA) -- This reporter has  interviewed Zou Jingmeng, director of the China Meteorological  Administration, on the weather forecast during the flood season  this year. According to weather forecast, the regions on the  upper and middle reaches of the Huang He and the northern part  of North China should particularly pay attention to flood  prevention during the flood season this year. Regions  experiencing droughts at present, while combating drought,  should also watch out for possible floods during the flood  season.    Zou Jingmeng said: During the flood season this year, the  natural disasters caused by droughts and floods could be more  conspicuous than last year, and droughts could be more serious  than floods. As both serious droughts and serious floods are  likely, we must be fully prepared for them and strive to keep  losses at a minimum.    Concerning weather service activities during the flood  season, Zou Jingmeng said: At present, the weather departments  at all levels have been on combat alert. Weathermen will work  around the clock to closely monitor weather changes and strive  to offer a good weather service during the flood season. To  ensure a good weather service during the flood season, the China  Meteorological Administration has already called on the leaders  of the weather departments at various levels to go to work on  the front line, clearly divide work, strictly perform their  duties, implement the system of responsibility at various  levels, and be well prepared in terms of mentality,  organization, technology, equipment, and personnel.    Zou Jingmeng particularly emphasized that the weather  department should provide weather service for the prevention of  floods both in major rivers and reservoirs and in urban areas,  so as to protect the people's lives and property.</p>

The military and technical training of personnel  taken over from the GDR National People's Army is insufficient,  Major General Juergen Hoeche, commander of the Fifth Luftwaffe  Division, said at a security policy conference in Strausberg  near Berlin on Thursday [10 February].    The eastern Luftwaffe is preparing for NATO integration,  which can only take place in 1995 at the earliest, however.  Then the acceding area will lose its special status, which was  laid down in the Two-Plus-Four Treaty in 1990 and provided for a  purely national defense structure. According to Hoeche, the  Luftwaffe will only continue its operations on three of formerly  40 GDR military airfields.    After the final withdrawal of the Russian Air Force, which  the major general expects in July this year, low altitude  flights can be carried out in the whole of eastern Germany.  They still have to be coordinated with the Western Group of the  Russian armed forces. On average, up to 30 low altitude flights  per day will probably be carried out in the new laender, Hoeche  said.</p>

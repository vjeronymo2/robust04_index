			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Willem van Kemenade and Theo Westerhoudt: ``Van </F> Der Stee Starts Action Against Rotterdam Dry Dock Company's  Trade With Taiwan'']    [Text] The Hague, 22 Dec -- Former Minister A. van der Stee  (CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal]) is heading a group of major  Netherlands companies lobbying to halt the possible export of  submarine parts by RDM [Rotterdam Dry Dock Company] to Taiwan.    The group, comprising representatives of Shell, Akzo, DSM  [Dutch State Mines], Philips, Stork, and Fokker, fears that, if  RDM's deliveries to Taiwan are carried out, it will have a  negative impact on their trade relations with the PRC.    RDM has an opportunity to deliver nonstrategic parts for  submarines to Taiwan. Such an order, which is expected to be  worth several hundred million guilders, is very important for  the Rotterdam company's existence.    Van der Stee, who is chairman of the China section of the  Netherlands Center for Trade Promotion (NCH), confirmed this  morning that he had recently talked to Prime Minister Lubbers,  Economic Affairs Minister Andriessen, Finance Minister Kok, and  Foreign Minister Kooijmans in an attempt to protect the  Netherlands companies' interests in the PRC. ``The Chinese  surely will condemn us for our hypocritical policy and this will  have a negative effect on our trade relations,'' Van der Stee  claimed. ``China currently has a 10-13 percent growth rate and  the Netherlands should profit from that. One must avoid  anything that could conflict with this interest.''</p>

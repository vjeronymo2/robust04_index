			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Italian justice caught between two revolutions: How tensions from the old regime are affecting the new one Mr Umberto Bossi, rough-tongued leader of Italy's federalist Northern League, never minces his words. Asked on Tuesday whether crusading magistrates and their 'clean hands' corruption investigations were responsible for changing Italy, he replied: 'Balls.' Mr Bossi had just learned that his was the only well-known name from the new political regime on a list of 32 people who will go on trial on July 5, charged with breaking the law on the financing of political parties. In another era - perhaps as recently as three or four years ago - any ambitious Italian politician might have been pleased to find himself in the company of those now up for trial. They include two former Italian prime ministers (the Socialist Mr Bettino Craxi and Christian Democrat Mr Arnaldo Forlani) three other ex-ministers and several well-known industrialists. Mr Bossi - like his fellow accused - is fighting back. In an interview published yesterday in La Stampa, the Turin daily, he accused the magistrates of trying to hold up the 'revolution' started by his party, now part of the new right-wing government. The magistrates, however, claim that the formal decision on Tuesday to move to a trial is further proof that they are determined to continue a different 'revolution' they began two to three years ago, by uncovering a powerful network of bribery, corruption and organised crime. Last Saturday, for example, Palermo magistrates requested a trial for Mr Giulio Andreotti, the Christian Democrat who has seven times been prime minister of Italy. He is accused of links with the mafia, which he vehemently denies. At least three investigations are also under way into businesses linked to Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister. Meanwhile, Ravenna magistrates are examining documents taken last Friday from the Milan headquarters of Mediobanca, the powerful merchant bank, after allegations that the bank did not reveal all it knew about a 'hole' in the accounts of Ferruzzi-Montedison before the industrial company collapsed last year. However, although the work will continue, the high-profile style of Italy's investigators may now be toned down. Mr Alfredo Biondi, Italy's new justice minister, has already said that magistrates and judges should stick to their job - applying the law - and steer clear of policy pronouncements. Mr Francesco Saverio Borrelli, Milan's chief prosecutor, appears to agree, although he would attack any proposal that smacked of increasing the political control of judges and magistrates. In an interview last week, he said he used to believe that magistrates should always remain anonymous. 'But when this operation began, there were such strong reactions (from the public) I wondered whether perhaps at this point people wanted to know who we were,' he says. 'Were we archangels, demons, or people like anyone else?' Italians certainly know who the magistrates are now, and most of them think they are on the side of the angels. The best-known example and most popular is Mr Antonio Di Pietro, one of Mr Borrelli's elite team of investigators. Currently in Los Angeles to deliver a series of lectures, he has been greeted like a film star by Italian expatriates. Mr Borrelli believes that the decision to open up to the public - partly through carefully timed leaks to journalists about the most important breakthroughs in investigations - built up the momentum of the 'clean hands' investigation. The momentum was maintained over the last few months by revelations during the long-running trial of Mr Sergio Cusani, a financial adviser to Ferruzzi-Montedison. Much of the trial was televised, enhancing the image of Mr Di Pietro, who acted as prosecutor. Mr Cusani was sentenced to eight years in prison at the end of last month for corruption and falsifying accounts in relation to the alleged payment of L150bn of bribes by Ferruzzi-Montedison. Payment to political parties allegedly helped the group extract itself from Enimont, its ill-fated joint venture with Eni, the state energy and chemicals company, in 1990. The trial which will begin on July 5 has sprung from testimony during the Cusani trial. As an event, it is likely to attract even more public attention. 'When great heads start to roll, il popolino (the common people) are always enthusiastic,' Mr Borrelli points out. The danger in such an approach is that it sets up a potential 'short-circuit', as Mr Borrelli puts it, between the piazza and the magistrature, which is both undemocratic and unhealthy. Mr Borelli says such a short-circuit has not yet occurred but he thinks now may be the right time to recast the public image of the magistrates. Partly that may be a tactical decision to avoid political interference. Members of the new government have already launched into polemical debate with the judiciary and magistrates. During the election campaign in March, Mr Berlusconi was critical of the timing of certain investigative 'breakthroughs' by magistrates. Mr Bossi himself rails against persecution of his party by the 'gang of four' Milan prosecutors. Mr Borrelli says the investigators are counting on popular support to maintain the impetus through many years of trials and appeals. The hope is that people will also start to clean up the smallest cases of corruption themselves. 'That process hasn't yet taken off,' says Mr Borrelli.</p>

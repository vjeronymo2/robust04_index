			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / People: Pit closure winner It was Peter Loughead, a high- flying civil servant, the government turned to last year when it realised it had made a mess of plans to close 31 pits. He readily fulfilled his ministers' wishes. The white paper which subsequently emerged from the coal review he headed was widely viewed as a masterpiece of presentation. Without changing significantly the market for coal, it provided a reprieve for 12 pits and was embraced by potentially dissident MPs. The government has now rewarded Loughead by appointing him head of the department of trade and industry's coal privatisation unit. He will lead a team of 15. The job is a civil service grade three post, the level to which Loughead rose when he was hastily recruited from the Treasury in November. Salaries for grade three appointees, formerly called under-secretaries, range from Pounds 51,272 to Pounds 59,280. Loughead, 42, educated at Liverpool Institute High School and Lincoln College, Oxford, started his civil service career 18 years ago in the department of prices and consumer protection as an administrative trainee. He moved to the DTI's European policy division in 1985 as a grade five worker. Five years later he joined the financial services division which transferred to the Treasury in June 1992. Coal privatisation is expected in the next parliamentary session. With coal markets shrinking in the face of increased competition from gas, few people expect the queue of potential buyers to be long. Among the decisions facing Loughead's team will be whether to break British Coal into small units or sell it as one or two large chunks.</p>

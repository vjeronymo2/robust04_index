			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This understanding is based on the above cited EN and relevant HRLs. HRL 953282, dated February 16, 1993, classified a 1 liter glass jar decorated with a blue ribbon and decalmania which created a country motif band in blue, pink, green and yellow around the middle of the jar. Customs held that, while the container did convey goods, its decoration, lid, and environment of sale all indicated that the principal use of the container was for storage, not the conveyance of goods. See also, HRL 087727, dated September 21, 1990, which classified spice jars as household storage jars. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Customs proposes to continue to apply the standards outlined above. We note that due to the USDA report's recommendation that glass articles with wire bale and trigger closures (non ``Mason-type'') not be used for home canning, but rather as storage articles for dry ingredients, all glass articles with wire bale trigger closures and glass caps or lids will be classifiable under subheading 7013.39, HTSUS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, we note that there are glass articles capable of both conveyance or packing of goods and household storage, as demonstrated in the Kraft case. Instances of these types of articles will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, with the above outlined characteristics determining the article's principal use and classification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Authority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice is published in accordance with section 177.10(c), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 177.10(c)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the above discussion, Customs is now seeking comments from the public regarding the proposed change of practice with regards to the tariff provisions for all three of these classes of glass articles. Customs is especially interested in receiving comments regarding the characteristics that are indicative of each class. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before adopting this proposed change in practice, consideration will be given to any written comments timely submitted to Customs.

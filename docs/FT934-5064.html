			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: A sigh of relief that recovery will live on - Tony Jackson gauges the reaction of industry and finds general approval mixed with specific grumbles As one who makes much of his roots in Midlands manufacturing, chancellor Kenneth Clarke might be expected to be nice to British industry. In rhetorical terms, he took every opportunity yesterday to declare how close industry was to his heart. How much this means in practice may be a matter for the small print of the Budget rather than the headlines. In broad terms, industry expressed itself satisfied yesterday. There was grumbling from the engineers and machine tool makers, which had urged the necessity of further tax breaks for investment. But on the big question of whether the recovery would be killed by taxes, there was general relief. A total of Pounds 1.7bn in new taxation next year and Pounds 4.9bn the year after, it was felt, was a burden the consumer could live with. The Confederation of British Industry last night applauded Mr Clarke's 'tough decisions' on public spending, and said the budget 'should provide a sound base for continued non-inflationary recovery'. The traditionally more hawkish Institute of Directors expressed relief at the limited scale of tax increases, while arguing Mr Clarke could have gone even further on public spending cuts. The British Retail Consortium said: 'This is a skilfully balanced Budget, which will help boost the confidence of both retailer and consumer.' One reason for the chancellor's solicitude towards industry could be gleaned from the details accompanying the speech. In spite of last September's devaluation of sterling, the government is plainly still concerned that the balance of payments deficit might inhibit recovery. Mr Clarke went out of his way yesterday to point out that in the past three months, exports had risen 14 per cent: 'a convincing demonstration of the strength of British manufacturing today.' The Treasury evidently expects more of the same. In Mr Norman Lamont's March Budget, the current account deficit for next year was forecast at Pounds 18.5bn. The official forecast has now shrunk to half that - just Pounds 9.5bn. At the same time, profitability of UK companies, says the official Red Book, is expected to be well up in 1993 on its 1992 level. 'In 1994 it is expected to pick up further as recovery strengthens, labour costs remain in check and pressure on margins eases further', the Red Book says. Similarly, business investment is forecast to rise by 3.75 per cent in volume terms next year. This is despite the fact that, as the Red Book concedes, it was actually 1.75 per cent down in the first nine months of this year. Here as elsewhere, there are hints that some of the chancellor's assumptions many be a trifle heroic. This may also apply to the other side of the equation: public spending. Several respected economists were starting to mutter yesterday that the projected cutbacks looked implausible. They are, however, central to the chancellor's message to business. Government spending, he said, constituted a substantial risk for business next year. 'Business can only plan ahead if it knows government borrowing is under control. My task today is to instil that confidence.' In some cases, it sounds as if cuts in spending are to come out of industry's hide. The budgets for roads and housing are to be cut, in hopes of getting the same output. Construction prices next year, Mr Clarke said ominously, would be more than 25 per cent lower than in 1989, so the programmes could be maintained in real terms for much less money. Some other details yesterday might give rise to suspicion. The move to stop reimbursing sick pay - except for the smallest companies - will cost industry Pounds 700m a year for the next three years. Doubtless, this will be partly offset by lower employer national insurance contributions. It remains to be seen, however, how the two changes will interact in individual cases. Similarly, the airlines were distinctly miffed at the decision to tax air passengers a collective Pounds 330m a year on leaving British airports. As one airline chief remarked, it rather looked as if the government was reluctant to impose VAT, since this would logically entail also taxing rail passengers ahead of privatisation. Having instead stumbled upon the neat expedient of stinging businessmen flying at their companies' expense, the Treasury might find it hard to resist coming back for more in future. There was also widespread scepticism in the construction industry over the list of projects to be financed by the private sector. The only new item on the list, it seems, is the new air traffic control centre for Scotland. As for the grandiose scheme for the private management of motorways, the construction companies would prefer to see the Treasury's proposed terms before getting excited. As Mr Clarke himself conceded yesterday, the private finance system requires 'a complete change of culture in government'. When it comes to small businesses, Mr Clarke deserves full marks for trying. Helping small business, he said, was his particular priority this year. Some of the moves on deregulation and the cutting of red tape were familiar, having already been trumpeted by the industry minister Mr Michael Heseltine. But the removal of the requirement for a statutory audit for small companies is a genuine innovation. So, in the separate field of small company cash flow, is the proposal that companies should be legally entitled to charge interest on overdue bills. The proposals for increasing the supply of risk capital for small companies  -the installation of investment trusts for unquoted companies and a replacement for the generally reviled Business Expansion Scheme - probably amount to little. But as employers' organisations acknowledged yesterday, it all adds up to a sustained attempt to help out the small businessmen who form the Tory party's natural constituency. Above all, Mr Clarke has shown adroitness in allowing expectations to build up of VAT and other tax increases, then deflate them. There was an unusual emphasis on keeping the consumer happy. Even the rise in excise on wine, the chancellor said, would not take effect until after Christmas, while there is no extra duty on beer at all. Mr John Clare, managing director of Dixons, the electrical stores group, doubtless spoke for many shopkeepers yesterday. 'It was nowhere near as bad as we expected. The expectations of tax increases in the Budget caused a lot of uncertainty in the retail business - people don't want to spend until they know where they stand. That's gone now. Let's get on with Christmas.'</p>

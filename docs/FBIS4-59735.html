			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 16, IRNA -- President Akbar  Hashemi-Rafsanjani termed as "important" Kazakhstan's links with  Iran's Caspian Sea provinces in further activating the trade  ties between the private sectors of the two countries.    The president made the remark here monday in his meeting  with  visiting Kazakh premier, Sergey Tereshchenko. He described as  positive the political will existing in both the countries for  strengthening of mutual cooperation and called for putting into  practice the agreements reached between Tehran and Almaty.    The president referred to the setting up of a free trade  zone  at the port city of Bandar Anzali, and said this would greatly  strengthen Kazakhstan's links with Iran's Caspian provinces of  Gilan and Mazandaran by facilitating trade exchanges and making  the private sectors of the two countries more involved. The  decision to declare Bandar Anzali as free trade zone was taken  yesterday at the end of the president's inspection tour of Gilan  Province.    The southern shores of the oblong Caspian, the world's  largest inland sea, are hemmed in by Iran, while the northern  and part of the northeastern shores forms the Kazakhstan  coastline.    The other three countries with access to Caspian waters are  the Russian Federation on the northwest, the Azerbaijan Republic  on the southwest and Turkmenistan on the southeast.    Tereshchenko who arrived in Tehran on Saturday, submitted  Rafsanjani a message from Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev  and said Tehran-Almaty ties had further expanded especially  after Nazarbayev's visit to Iran.    He said Iran's valuable experiences in establishing  industries and re-activating factories was very useful for his  country.    Raising the volume of Tehran-Almaty wheat and coal exchanges  in the long-term, Kazakhstan's purchase of copper and  fire-resistant material from Iran, joint production of engine  oil and expanding road, rail, shipping and air transportation  between the two countries were among the topics Tereshchenko  discussed with Iranian officials.</p>

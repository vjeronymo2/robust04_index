He underlined the importance of the Partnership for Peace  plan as an important element for a stable Central and Eastern  Europe. It is necessary for Ukraine and Russia to develop  democratically and to foster good relations both with the United  States and NATO, Goncz stated. Goncz said that the Visegrad  Four countries had expressed the same views on important issues  related to the Partnership for Peace.    Hungarian Premier Peter Boross stressed the economic aspects  of the project and mentioned the planned conference in the  United States which was to enhance Western investment in Central  and Eastern Europe. He emphasized the importance of concrete  steps in military cooperation.    Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky said that the  question of the military exercises in Hungary would be specified  after NATO General Staff sends its experts to the Visegrad Four  countries. He added that joint military maneuvers in Hungary  were first to be approved by parliament.    Jeszenszky said that an agreement with Slovakia was not  possible until the problems of ethnic Hungarians in Slovakia  were resolved. He stressed that a large number of equally  important problems of Slovak-Hungarian relations were still  pending.</p>

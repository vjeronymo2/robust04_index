			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Zurab Zhvania, leader of the "Greens" Party </F> and general secretary of the Union of Georgia's Citizens, by  Nino Khidashvili; place and date not given: "The Union of  Citizens Will Create a New Civic Space"]    [Text] The first congress of the Union of Georgia's  Citizens [UGC] will begin its work today, 18 March. This is a  political movement that unites hundreds of thousands of  citizens. A whole number of political organizations have united  within it. We interviewed UGC General Secretary Zurab Zhvania.    [Khidashvili] The union was already created some time ago.  What report will the UGC general secretary deliver at the  congress?    [Zhvania] It has been three months since the UGC was founded  in the large hall of the Philharmonic building [Tbilisi]. This  initial period witnessed the growth of the organization. Our  union was created on the basis of that charge that existed in  Georgian society, a charge that was set off with the desire to  prevent that catastrophe that was really threatening our state  and society. However, a serious organization would not have been  able to exist on emotions alone. We can say today that we have  managed to create solid structures around these emotions, not  only in Tbilisi but throughout Georgia. I think that  interesting people have joined the union and a single and  coordinated nucleus has emerged. Those persons have also  emerged who will be unable to fit into the mainstream of our  organization. However, at the same time, people with different  political experience have united and they now represent a single  unified organization.    [Khidashvili] The union has an organized structure and all  those qualities or features that are characteristic of a ruling  party. Does the union have its own ideology?    [Zhvania] I would like to emphasize that the UGC is not an  organization based on a single specific ideology. If we use  traditional European terminology, we could be called a political  movement more than a party. This means that our doors are open  to everyone who wants to cooperate with us. At the same time,  we have managed to create a solid political nucleus that will  become even stronger in the future. It is precisely this  nucleus that ensures the strength and stability of the  organization.    If it is possible to define our ideology in one word, it is  statehood. Our ideology -- our main aim -- is to create a  solid, strong state that will ensure the safety and well being  of each citizen and the prospects for his free development. We  base ourselves most closely on traditional liberalism, although  our ideology is broader than this.    [Khidashvili] Your opponents assert that the UGC has assumed  the functions of an executive body. What do you say?    [Zhvania] It would be difficult for me to cite an example of  the UGC fulfilling the functions of an executive body. If our  opponents mean that active members of the union are trying to  contribute toward resolving the bread problem and exposing  sabotage in the power engineering complex, and, in general, are  trying not to view in a passive manner and joke about the  destruction of the country but are personally making their small  contribution to the common cause so that our lives can at least  be a little better, I do not think this constitutes gross  interference in the functions of the executive body. This can  be called more civic responsibility. We are a union of citizens  and the main concern of our members is civic responsibility  before society and the state.    This probably should not be a subject for discussion. There  are people who believe that our existence today is something to  joke about. Others believe it is better today to make one's own  contribution to improving the situation. However, everything  will probably be decided by the people.    [Khidashvili] The politician Zurab Zhvania hails from the  "Greens." What qualitative links are there between the "Greens"  and the UGC?    [Zhvania] I remain a Green. However, I must say frankly  that the situation that has prevailed in Georgia these last two  years has made it practically impossible to resolve the serious  economic problems. It is superfluous to speak about preserving  forests and producing environmentally friendly goods in a  society where complete chaos reigns and where a person's life  means nothing. This is precisely the reason why we have united  with people from other political persuasions: To create a space  where Greens, Christian- Democrats, Conservatives, Liberals, and  so forth can freely exist.    There is today no space in Georgia for civic life. Our union  will create this space.    [Khidashvili] You pointed out at a recent news conference  that there are many issues in the government's policy with which  you disagree. What precisely are these issues?    [Zhvania] These would make a very long list. It is more  difficult to list the issues on which we do agree. I personally  find the existing attitude to economic reform unacceptable.    I can state directly that the governing bodies are  committing  sabotage; they are disregarding every sensible initiative.  Moreover, a real war has been declared against private  structures and private business, which is threatening us with  catastrophe.    I find unacceptable the view that we can do nothing to save  the coupon and, therefore, we have to enter the ruble zone.  Both I and our economic experts can see large resources that  will enable us to strengthen the coupon. It, indeed, cannot  become a hard currency. However, we believe that it can be  stabilized on condition, first and foremost, that the problem of  privatization is resolved and many other issues are quickly  settled.    The main thing that I find unacceptable is the corruption  that characterizes our government. I firmly believe that the  time will soon come when all will be made to answer for  "incorrectly" drawing up contracts for the sale of wheat or  gasoline, for the "incorrect" distribution of humanitarian aid,  and so forth. Let no one think that they will be able to hold  onto the property that they have acquired through [misusing]  their position.    [Khidashvili] Do the UGC and you yourself support the  reformist Cabinet of Ministers and, in general, the so-called  "shock therapy" for the economy?    [Zhvania] They often joke here in Georgia that this period  is a shock, never mind any kind of therapies. It is difficult  not to agree with the public on this score. Our economy really  is in need of therapy and it would be good if it were to become  something necessary and not something akin to surgical  intervention.    The main thing is that a united team should enter the  government, each of whose members will act by proceeding from a  single position and within the framework of a common program.  Such a team will not appear before the elections. Therefore,  our union's position is as follows: The most odious members  should leave the government prior to the elections and the  government should become more respectable, although a  reform-minded team can realistically come to power only after  the elections.    [Khidashvili] Eduard Shevardnadze is the chairman of the  UGC. Does this factor have symbolic importance or does it  signify full support for the head of state's policies?    [Zhvania] This is not a symbolic factor. I want to  emphasize that we do not view Eduard Shevardnadze as the head of  state; he is our political leader, a person who is creating new  political traditions in Georgia and forming the principles of a  new moral pragmatic policy. It is from this angle that the  union's members view Eduard Shevardnadze as a politician. We  are convinced that he will fulfill a unique role in the history  of Georgia.    [Khidashvili] Will the UGC participate in the future  elections and how will its program differ from those of the  other parties?    [Zhvania] Of course, it will take part. As for its program,  it will be formed on the basis of that document that will be  adopted at our congress. There will probably be serious  discussions on individual issues in this program. We will adopt  a basic document on whose basis all other documents will be  formed, including the election program.</p>

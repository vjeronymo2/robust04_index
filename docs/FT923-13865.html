			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Fight for the consumer's ear: The two different formats seeking to replace tape recorders are in fierce competition The world's biggest consumer electronics companies are bracing for battle. The prize is the lucrative market for the next generation of portable music players. For the protagonists, Sony on the one side, Philips and Matsushita on the other, victory could determine whether they consolidate, or slip from, their positions at the top of the industry during the 1990s. The mega-contest centres on mini-products: Sony's MiniDisc, and the Digital Compact Cassette which has been co-developed by Philips and Matsushita. The MiniDisc, a small recordable disc, will be launched by the end of this year. The digital compact cassette will reach the high street sooner - by the end of September - thus gaining an important head start over its rival. In both cases, the new products are aimed at replacing the traditional tape recorder and tape cassettes, for decades the dominant portable music system, but now facing decline. Sales of prerecorded cassette tapes, which peaked in 1989 at about 780m units, last year amounted to just 638m units. Industry analysts expect a further decline this year. Consumer electronics companies believe that the market for portable audio equipment - 'ghetto blaster' tape recorders, Walkmans, car stereos and other portable audio equipment - is also at risk. They fear that the market, which is worth nearly Dollars 10bn in the leading industrialised countries alone, according to BIS Strategic Decisions, the high-technology consultancy group, will follow the downward path of cassette tapes. Industry executives draw a parallel with the LP, which started to decline in sales from about 1978, even before CDs were introduced by Sony and Philips in 1982. 'The LP had become old-fashioned,' says Mr Gerry Wirtz, senior product manager at Philips in charge of DCC. Sony is particularly worried that the declining popularity of cassettes threatens sales of the Walkman, the portable cassette tape recorder which has revolutionised music-listening habits since its introduction in late 1979. 'The Walkman is 12 years old and 100m units have been shipped already,' says Mr Norio Ohga, president of Sony. 'We must think seriously of replacing the Walkman.' While Philips executives agree with Mr Ohga that the days of traditional tapes and tape recorders are numbered, the two companies differ over the reasons for their decline and how they should be replaced. Philips is firmly committed to the tape format for portable audio. It claims its studies show that people who like to carry their music around with them prefer to do so on tapes, rather than discs. CDs are perceived as vulnerable to physical shocks and therefore not an appropriate medium for portable equipment, says Mr Wirtz. The Dutch group believes the main reason consumers have lost interest in cassettes is because they do not provide the crisp, clear sound of digital CDs. It also assumes that, while consumers want something better than cassette tapes, they will not be willing to throw away the tape collections they have accumulated over the years. As a result, DCC players have been designed to play the old analogue cassettes as well as the new digital ones. Sony takes a very different view of the development of the portable audio electronics market. It sees the declining interest in cassette tapes largely as the result of consumers' disenchantment with tapes as a medium. 'Tape is a 30-year-old format,' says Mr Eric Kingdon, technical managing director of Sony UK. 'Putting the word 'digital' in front of tapes is not going to stir a market that is losing momentum.' Consumers, according to Sony, want digital sound, but they also want random access - the ability to find the beginning of a certain track without having to wind a tape forwards or backwards. Discs can provide this feature, cassettes cannot. 'The main reason why cassettes have fallen in sales is because they lack this feature,' says Mr Ohga. 'DCC is not the right medium to address the demands of consumers.' Sony says that it is not particularly concerned by the fact that consumers will have to throw away their old cassettes, or continue to use two formats if they switch to MiniDisc. The company points out that CD players could not play vinyl discs, and that did not prevent them from replacing record players. Similarly, the 8mm video format is not compatible with VCRs but it is still the dominant camcorder system. As with CDs and video cameras, the problem facing Sony and Philips is that there is likely to be only one winner in the battle between the MiniDisc and DCC. Few in the industry believe the market is big enough to sustain two competing formats. 'I don't think co-existence is possible,' Mr Ohga states unequivocally. For both companies, the stakes are raised even higher by the business difficulties they currently face. Philips is in the middle of a group-wide restructuring programme aimed at slimming operations and raising efficiency and profitability. While the Dutch group did return to profit in 1991, it has continued to suffer from weak consumer demand. Last month it warned that a deepening crisis in the consumer electronics market could reduce profits for the full year below last year's figure. Shares fell by almost 20 per cent on the day of the announcement. Sony is also facing problems. Last year, operating profits from its worldwide consumer electronics business fell sharply to Y113bn (Pounds 481m) from Y249bn. The parent company in Japan suffered its first operating loss since 1958, falling Y20.5bn into the red, compared with a profit of Y72.2bn in 1990. It has also suffered the humiliation of seeing Betacam, its VCR format, driven out of the world's main markets by the VHS system developed by JVC, a Japanese manufacturer of audio-visual products. Sony's Digital Audio Tape, a pioneering digital tape format, has also proved a commercial failure. Both companies are therefore in pressing need of a new hit product. The introduction of a successful heir to the cassette tape recorder presents the perfect opportunity to achieve their objectives of boosting income and establishing control in a new product area. In terms of technology the two systems are fairly well matched. Both produce high-quality, digitally recorded sound, and while Philips' DCC will be able to play old analogue cassettes it will not record on them. Nor will the new tapes be playable on conventional tape machines. Similarly, while the MiniDisc player offers random access it will not play any other format and MiniDiscs themselves cannot be played on CD players. The deciding factors in the contest are therefore expected to be the extent to which Philips and Sony succeed in signing up software suppliers - in particular the large record labels - and in licensing their technologies to hardware manufacturers. As demonstrated in the 1980s by the competition between the two rival video systems - VHS and Betamax - the success of a new format depends crucially on how much software is available to be played on it. Licensing technology to a wide range of hardware manufacturers is also vital to ensure that a format becomes the dominant system in a particular market. In both respects, Philips appears to have a slight edge. It has put together an impressive marketing and publicity machine through which it has managed to convince the big hardware manufacturers, many of which are Japanese, to license its technology and bring their own DCC machines to the market. Matsushita, a co-licensor of the DCC technology, has already announced plans to bring out its players by Christmas. Philips has also won agreements from leading record producers, including even Sony Music, to bring out hit songs on DCC. Artists whose music will be available on DCC include Bryan Adams, U2, Elton John and the Fine Young Cannibals. What is keeping many record companies from signing up for MiniDisc is their fear that it is likely to prove more damaging than digital cassettes to sales of CDs. Their argument is that if consumers like MiniDiscs, they may replace their CD collections with the smaller discs. On the other hand, they believe, the DCC tapes are sufficiently different from CDs to form a separate market. Mindful of protecting the CD market, which has seen worldwide sales rise steadily to 900m units last year from about 738m units in 1990, many record companies are therefore leaning towards the Philips format. As a result, Sony is looking somewhat lonely with its list of supporters. The main record companies such as Time Warner and PolyGram, which is 80 per cent owned by Philips, are conspicuously absent. Unless Sony can win over the record companies in time for the launch of MiniDisc, it will be facing a formidable opponent in the marketplace with little more ammunition than a conviction that the consumer will fall for its vision of the portable market. The Japanese company's convictions have often proved right in the past; the Walkman and the Handycam video camera are the most noteable examples. But winning the consumer over in the current fray is likely to be more difficult. One reason, in addition to the strong competition from Philips, is the confusion faced by potential buyers. People who replace their cassette tape players will not know for several years how long their chosen format will survive. Those who choose wrongly may have to invest in another system within a couple of years. Both Philips and Sony claim that they have done their best to achieve a smooth transition to thereplacement for cassette tapes. Each side blames the other for rocking the boat and for failing to collaborate on technologies to replace the tape machine. But neither has been willing to bend its position to avoid burdening consumers with the uncertainty of competing formats. Ironically, the consumer may well think it best to sit tight until a victor emerges from the fray. If that happens, the battle to replace the humble tape recorder may in fact extend its lease of life.  -------------------------------------------------------------------             WORLD SHIPMENTS OF RECORDED MUSIC ALBUMS  ------------------------------------------------------------------- million units          Vinyl          Cassettes       Compact discs  -------------------------------------------------------------------  1983                   536              480               4.9  1986                   390              608               131  1989                   210              780               599 *1991                    86              638               899  ------------------------------------------------------------------- * Estimate                            Source: IFPI/BIS  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

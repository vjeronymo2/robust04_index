			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Forged letters THE bizarre train of events which has engulfed the prosecution of Mr Asir Nadir took another tortuous twist last night with the disclosure of a crudely forged letter attempting to link the fugitive businessman to a former minister, Philip Stephens writes. But the document - offered for sale to at least one national newspaper  - appeared to have no direct link with the separate controversy over the activities of the Serious Fraud Office. The view at Westminster last night was that it was a 'freelance' attempt by someone seeking to defraud the media. Whitehall officials said that Mr David Mellor, the former heritage secretary, had informed Mr John Major's office about the circulation of a forged letter he was said to have written to Mr Nadir, thanking him for the contributions of Pounds 440,000 he had made to the Conservative party. Officials dismissed suggestions that Mr Major had personally authorised a police investigation.</p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Commonwealth team for S Africa The Commonwealth will send a team of about a dozen prominent citizens to help end violence in South Africa and facilitate renewed constitutional negotiations, it was announced yesterday, Michael Holman, Africa Editor, reports. The groundwork for the Commonwealth role was carried out last month when Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the organisation's secretary general, visited South Africa for talks with political leaders. During his visit Chief Anyaoku won government approval for a plan setting out a Commonwealth contribution to the search for a political settlement. Many of the elements, including the suggestion that there should be close liaison with the country's National Peace Secretariat, an independent body formed last year which monitors political violence, were taken up by Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN special envoy to South Africa. In response to his report, the Security Council has authorised stationing UN observers in South Africa, expected to number around 30, to help end township violence. The Organisation of African Unity and the European Community are also expected to send teams. Yesterday the South African government accepted the report, saying it would welcome the stationing of observers in the country.</p>

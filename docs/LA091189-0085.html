			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HONG KONG DRAIN OF PROFESSIONALS IS GAINING SPEED  </P> <P> Hong Kong's brain drain of people seeking the security of foreign passports and  new ways of life abroad, before the colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in  1997, is expected to rise by about 30% from 42,000 this year to 55,000 next  year.  </P> <P> Recent events in China have seriously affected the confidence of Hong Kong  people in the territory's freedom and prosperity after 1997. Thousands who said  they had not previously planned to leave have approached local foreign  consulates about possible emigration.  </P> <P> Pressure has also increased on the United Kingdom to provide more than 3  million people with the security of full British passports, which would boost  confidence and could stem the brain drain. The United Kingdom government is  expected to announce in the next few weeks how many passports it is prepared to  issue, but the number will be far less than 3 million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Was Much Lower  </P> <P> The outflow of people will have a serious impact on Hong Kong's businesses,  which have managed so far to cope with the loss of mostly younger professional  and skilled workers.  </P> <P> New estimates released last week by the Hong Kong government show that last  year's total of 45,800 is expected to drop to a previously forecast level of  42,000 this year because there has not been enough time since the Beijing  crisis for people to organize residence abroad.  </P> <P> The total is then expected to rise to 55,000 in 1990. In the early and  mid-1980s, the annual figure hovered around 20,000. About 90% of the total go  to Canada, Australia and the United States. This proportion is not expected to  change rapidly, despite recruiting efforts made recently by other countries,  notably Singapore.  </P> <P> Michael Rowse, the official in charge of preparing the statistics, said last  week that a new "equilibrium of around 55,000 to 60,000" was likely to be  established.  </P> <P> About 24% of the total emigrants are classified as professional, technical,  administrative and managerial workers, who only make up 5.5% of the total  population.  </P></p>

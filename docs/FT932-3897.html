			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / International Company News: Li Ka-shing and Citic in joint bid MR Li Ka-shing and Citic Pacific, Beijing's listed conglomerate in Hong Kong, have joined forces to make a HKDollars 8.7bn (USDollars 1.1bn) bid for Miramar Hotel and Investment. Mr Li's Cheung Kong and Citic Pacific are offering HKDollars 15.50 a share and HKDollars 8.50 a warrant for Miramar, which owns the Miramar Hotel on Kowloon and office and retail properties on the peninsula. Mr Li has taken small minority positions in other deals involving Citic but this bid for Miramar is the largest transaction in which he has participated with a mainland-backed company. It underlines Mr Li's growing ties with mainland Chinese power brokers and the decision he has made to concentrate on Hong Kong and China ventures. However, the initial reaction of the Hong Kong stock market was that the offer was too low. Miramar's share price yesterday closed at HKDollars 16 and analysts are advising investors to bide their time. They said Miramar represented one of the best opportunities available in Hong Kong's property market. Miramar's assets are in prime Kowloon locations and have good redevelopment potential. Mr Michael Greene, at Warburg Securities, said he expected Mr Li and Citic immediately to sell the commercial properties on strata title, providing joint ownership, probably to mainland Chinese companies seeking a hedge against the devaluation of the yuan. He said they could also take advantage of under-utilised 'plot ratio' in some of Miramar's commercial properties to increase the amount of space available for sale. The Miramar Hotel, on Nathan road in Kowloon, is a sprawling if somewhat dowdy hotel. It could either be refurbished or, razed and replaced with a commercial and retail development. Mr Li and Citic have indicated that they wish to maintain Miramar's listing. The reason is unclear, but there is an active secondary market in Hong Kong listings and analysts expect them to sell it to a mainland Chinese company seeking a Hong Kong listing. Miramar, a Hang Seng constituent, is controlled by the Yeung family, which owns 21 per cent of the company. Its other main shareholder is Goldberg Corporation SA which owns 13 per cent.</p>

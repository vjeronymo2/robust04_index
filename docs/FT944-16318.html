			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Want replaces war as Macedonia's key election issue: As fears recede about the Bosnian conflict, economic problems loom large in the minds of voters The political consensus that helped Macedonia emerge peacefully from the wreckage of the former Yugoslavia shows signs of breaking apart in Sunday's presidential and parliamentary elections. According to opinion polls for the first direct presidential election, the incumbent, Mr Kiro Gligorov - a reformist ex-Yugoslav politician elected by parliament in 1990 who is given most of the credit for Macedonia's success in winning international recognition - will easily defeat his nationalist opponent, Mr Ljubisha Georgievski, a theatre director with little experience of politics. The Alliance for Macedonia, the governing coalition led by the Social Democrats, the re-named communists, and backed by President Gligorov, still holds a lead in the polls for the parliamentary elections. But a strengthening challenge from the free-market nationalist Democratic party of Mr Petar Goshev, founded just over a year ago, makes it unlikely that the coalition can capture a majority in the 120-seat parliament. Sunday's election is not expected to produce a clear result, with candidates in a only a few constituencies expected to win the overall majority required. Most parliamentary seats will be decided in a run-off poll two weeks later. As fears of the war in Bosnia spreading south recede, Macedonia's economic problems start to loom larger in voters' minds. Mr Goshev's election slogan, 'so ciste race' ('with clean hands'), underlines the resentment felt at the way those close to the governing coalition appear to be prospering. Mr Goshev's call for an easing of taxes and faster privatisation through the launch of a voucher system similar to those used elsewhere in eastern Europe, holds a strong appeal for voters. More than 40 per cent of Macedonia's workforce is unemployed or on forced leave from factories that have shut down. Welfare benefits and pensions are paid several months in arrears, and many families survive on remittances from Macedonians working abroad. Mr Alexander Tortevski, a lawyer in his 30s standing for the Democratic party, says: 'We need to move through this transitional period much faster. Other countries that had more tightly controlled economies under communism are far ahead of us now.' Macedonia's economy is squeezed between the UN embargo against Serbia, its main trading partner, and a blockade imposed by Greece, in an effort to make the republic change its name, considered in Athens to imply a claim on the Greek province of Macedonia. The government estimates losses to the economy caused by UN sanctions at about Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn), while the Greek embargo is said to cost another Dollars 60m monthly in lost exports and higher transport costs. Nevertheless, the coalition has pressed on with a stabilisation plan agreed with the International Monetary Fund, although payment of a Dollars 35m stand-by loan has been frozen until Macedonia reaches agreement with the Paris Club on repaying Dollars 100m to creditors abroad. The Democratic party hopes to make considerable gains at the expense of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation (VMRO), the hardline nationalist party. Despite VMRO's efforts to revamp its image ahead of the election, attempting to re-unite its half-dozen factions and present more moderate candidates, voters believe the party is too closely linked with Bulgaria, a traditional enemy of Macedonia. However, the key to forming a new government could again be the ethnic Albanian party, the Party for Democratic Prosperity, which has co-operated with the Alliance for the past two years. Yet the PDP is also likely to lose support on Sunday as members of a radical faction, impatient with the coalition's reluctance to improve conditions for the Albanian minority in Macedonia, have split away to run as independent candidates.</p>

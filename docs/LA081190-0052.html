			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The U.S. Navy closed its investigation into allegations by a petty officer who  said she was raped by a Soviet sailor during the recent visit by Soviet ships,  saying Friday that the evidence was inconclusive.  </P> <P> "The evidence gathered by the Naval Investigative Services did not provide  sufficient facts to allow for a conclusive resolution," said Lt. Cmdr.  </P> <P> Bob Pritchard, a Navy spokesman, in a prepared statement.  </P> <P> The 26-year-old, third-class petty officer told authorities she was raped while  visiting the Soviet destroyer Admiral Vinogradov when it arrived in San Diego  July 31. The woman said the assault had occurred at 6 p.m. on the first day of  the Soviets' unprecedented visit to the West Coast. Earlier accounts that it  reportedly occurred at 8 p.m. were incorrect, sources said.  </P> <P> The woman said she was wearing civilian clothes and had become separated from  her friends while aboard the Soviet vessel. Since she did not report the  incident until two days later, investigators were unable to find substantial  evidence.  </P> <P> "We took the allegation very seriously," Pritchard said. "NIS did as thorough a  job as they could possibly do, given the facts they had to work with."  </P> <P> Though the evidence was inconclusive, officials were quick to point out that  they were not discrediting the woman's account.  </P> <P> NIS officials turned over much of their investigation to Soviet officials the  day the warships departed, Aug. 4. More information was also relayed to them  this week, Pritchard said. Soviet officials have said they will keep their U.S.  counterparts informed of any developments in their investigation of the  incident.  </P> <P> "It's one of those unfortunate incidents that I wish we were able to come to a  conclusion on," Pritchard said, "but we can't."  </P></p>

			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Names to press claim for payments individuals who support the insurance market's capital base - is to press ahead with a call for an extraordinary meeting in a bid to win compensation for losses, Richard Lapper writes. Mr Claud Gurney, the Name who is organising the initiative, said: 'We will not be dumped unceremoniously in the dustbin of Lloyd's history.' Mr Gurney said the Lloyd's business plan, announced last month, was unacceptable since it 'proposes leaving current Names with all the accumulated losses and liabilities of history, and giving away their goodwill and assets to corporations free of charge'.</p>

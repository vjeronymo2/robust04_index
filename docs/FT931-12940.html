			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Siemens keen to acquire GEC's 60% stake in GPT SIEMENS, the German electrical and electronics group, is eager to buy from GEC the 60 per cent stake in GPT it does not already own, but so far the UK company has shown no willingness to sell. Neither Siemens nor GEC would comment yesterday on reports that the German company had offered Lord Weinstock up to Pounds 800m for GEC's share in the telecommunications equipment maker. GPT, which last year made Pounds 127m in pre-tax profits, was formed through the merging of the telecommunications manufacturing interests of GEC and Plessey. It has been jointly owned by GEC and Siemens since 1989 when the two companies successfully made a bid for Plessey. Siemens' UK operations were profitable last year but if the contribution from GPT is excluded, the UK subsidiary was in loss. Mr Jurgen Gehrels, chief executive of Siemens UK, last week said that the price paid for Plessey had been too high because the company had been bought when the market was buoyant.</p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Management: Beat the Budget with solid gold - Tim Dickson on hedging your bets against March 16 Psst] Fancy being paid in gold bars, diamonds or even cocoa beans? Bizarre as it seems a growing number of UK companies have been turning to commodity-based bonus schemes, which tax experts reckon may be costing the government tens of millions of pounds in 'lost' National Insurance revenue. The present popularity of the schemes is attributable to two main factors: a growing fear that the chancellor may raise the level of NI contributions in next month's Budget, and suspicion that he could crack down on apparent loopholes at the same time. National Insurance planning is one of several issues for companies to consider before Lamont gets to his feet on March 16. Corporations do not have the same range of opportunities to beat the Budget as individuals: but a checklist of possible boardroom actions can be compiled. Accountants and lawyers say NI is a big preoccupation for companies - hardly surprising perhaps given that it is already such a nice little earner for the chancellor. Raising more income tax would be widely decried as a political U-turn, which is why Lamont may find it more attractive to raise additional revenue through National Insurance. Controversially, he could take a leaf out of the Labour party's last election manifesto and raise or remove the Pounds 21,060 ceiling above which the employees' National Insurance contribution is not paid. But a more plausible option might be to lift the present 10.4 per cent rate which companies pay on most salaries. Present NI rules exempt staff bonuses paid in the form of marketable commodities rather than money from both employer and employee contributions. MAI, the financial services group, attracted considerable attention before the last election by making payments to some staff in gold bullion. Diamonds can also be used, while factory workers at the Presbar group were recently reported to be receiving part of their remuneration in cocoa beans. A scheme involving bonus payments in unit trusts was ended in 1991. Obviously, employees do not take physical delivery: in a typical scheme the commodities are credited to their name and sold for cash within a couple of days of being bought. Value Added Tax on gold can be avoided provided the purchase is routed through an offshore centre like Switzerland. John Valentine, a tax partner with Grant Thornton, points out that employees also enjoy the benefit of deferring income tax. He nevertheless cautions against setting up a scheme of less than Pounds 100,000. 'The Revenue may choose to challenge individual cases, and unless every single document is word perfect they may fail. It could be a time consuming and expensive process.' Other accountants say some clients are reluctant to enter into arrangements which could upset their relations with the Inland Revenue. Valentine emphasises that the scheme only works for bonuses, not for the employee's basic remuneration (where the company has a contractual obligation to pay). National Insurance is not the sole pre-Budget tax topic for management in-trays. Take Advance Corporation Tax, for instance. An intense lobbying campaign has been directed at the government over rules which disallow ACT from being credited against tax paid on overseas profits. The chances of the chancellor succumbing to the pressure look slim - indeed he may even clamp down on some of the tax avoidance schemes which have been put in place. But as David Reid, tax partner at solicitors Clifford Chance points out: 'If there is to be a change in the ACT rules there could be advantages for multinational companies to delay the receipt of dividend payments into the UK from their overseas subsidiaries until after the Budget.' Companies will also want to keep a close eye on any moves in the Budget to tax company cars on the basis of their market value. In the meantime, executives with their eye on a new model which costs, say, more than Pounds 19,250 - the current definition of an executive car - may want to wait and see how Lamont changes the current banding system. This way they may be able to buy a bigger car without the additional tax cost incurred at the moment. Business proprietors who think personal tax rates are set to rise, meanwhile, may want to take advantage of the opportunity to 'dividend strip' before the end of the tax year. The point here is that dividends, unlike salaries, are free from NI contributions and thanks to the offsetting effect of ACT can be extracted from a company at a tax rate of just 20 per cent. This would increase if the chancellor raised the top rate of personal tax - currently 40 per cent - though there would still be time to take action for this year before April 5. Tony Allen of Coopers and Lybrand warns companies to beware of exchange differences when disposing of overseas assets. There is some expectation that the government may in the forthcoming Budget remove the current anomaly which means businesses incur capital gains tax on a paper profit. But it would be unwise to count on it.</p>

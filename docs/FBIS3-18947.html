The Land Office for the Protection of  the Constitution said that the potential for extreme-right  violence is "alarmingly high" in Saxony-Anhalt. Last year, there  were 328 violent acts with an extreme-right connection, Interior  Minister Walter Remmers (Christian Democratic Union) said when  he presented the 1993 report of the Office for the Protection of  the Constitution in Magdeburg. The centers of extreme-right  activity are above all the big cities of Halle and Magdeburg.    According to the Office for the Protection of the  Constitution, the violent confrontations between right-wing and  left-wing extremists have assumed a new dimension. The  threshold for brutal violence has been lowered on both sides.  With 70 violent acts against leftists motivated by right-wing  extremism in 1993, the number of these offenses has doubled.  [passage omitted]    Right-wing extremism did not come to the old FRG from the  former GDR only after unification. With this opinion, Saxony  Interior Minister Heinz Eggert (CDU) contradicted statements to  this effect made by Federal Prosecutor General Nehm. It is true  that the propensity for violence has increased significantly in  the east, "but this is connected with the police's inability to  act at this stage," Eggert told DIE WELT. Criminal offenses by  the extreme-left (57) in the Free State of Saxony remained  constant compared with 1992.</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: TWO REPORTS SAY USE OF STEROIDS WIDESPREAD IN EAST GERMANY  </P> <P> Two former athletes, one a world champion ski jumper, have charged that East  Germany customarily gives young athletes steroids, two newspapers reported in  Hamburg, West Germany.  </P> <P> The reports said that all top East German sports stars are required to use the  drugs and that such successful athletes as figure skater Katerina Witt,  sprinter Renate Stecher and swimmer Kristin Otto are among those who have  regularly used anabolic steroids.  </P> <P> "Every athlete who competes internationally for East Germany is doped, every  one," said Hans-Juergen Noczenski, former head of the East German Judo Assn.  Noczenski fled East Germany last February and now lives in Austria.  </P> <P> Hans-Georg Aschenbach, the former East German ski jumping star, was quoted as  saying that he was told to take steroids during his athletic career and that it  is required among all top East German athletes.  </P> <P> "I swallowed and injected anabolics for eight years," Aschenbach, 38, was  quoted as saying. "We had to take this medicine. We were required to. Whoever  didn't was forced out of the national squad and faced great difficulties in  private life."  </P> <P> Aschenbach fled East Germany last year and now works as a doctor specializing  in athlete treatment in the West German city of Freiburg.  </P> <P> East German sports officials, Aschenbach said, give steroid pills to promising  athletes as young as 13 without telling them what the pills contain.  </P> <P> "That's one reason I fled," he was quoted as saying.  </P></p>

Rockwell plans to merge Reliance with its Allen-Bradley division, creating a worldwide industrial automation business with sales of about Dollars 3.5bn. Rockwell plans to sell Reliance's telecommunications business, which made up about a third of Reliance group sales last year. Rockwell said yesterday the acquisition would bring its turnover to Dollars 12.6bn, of which over 70 per cent would come in commercial markets.

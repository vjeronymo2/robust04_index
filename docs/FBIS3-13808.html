			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by PLO Ambassador in Sanaa Yahya Rabah] </F>   [Text] The U.S. conduct at the UN Security Council's  debate of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the U.S. position  on the entire peace process have at once dismayed and angered  the Palestinian people and many others around the world. Seen  in the light of the horrific massacre, the U.S. stand raises  many questions about the entire role of the United States. So  much so that [word indistinct] list may be as follows: What  kind of peace does the United States want? Will the United  States be up to the role of a true peace sponsor? Is the United  States willing to explore all the possibilities to make peace?  [passage indistinct]    This is because the long, drawn-out talks convened in  Washington following the Madrid conference, and then the Oslo,  Granada, Paris, Davos, Cairo, and Taba talks, after the signing  of the Declaration of Principles agreement on the White House  lawn, have revealed [word indistinct] and real obstacles placed  in the path of the peace process and the Declaration of  Principles. [passage indistinct]    The U.S. argument has consistently been that the United  States is loath to apply any pressure on any of the  interlocutors. [passage indistinct]    As a result of this Israeli behavior and the (?emotional)  support for this Israeli behavior [words indistinct] the  beginning was set for 13 December, 1993 and the end for 13  April, 1994. Deadlines came and went. [passage indistinct].  The result has been that the peace initiative has lost much of  its luster and the hopes pinned on it have been blighted. Also,  the Declaration of Principles has lost a good deal of popular  support and the hopes based on it have waned. Things now look as  if we are back at square one.    The U.S. Administration has been aware of the true picture.  [passage indistinct] In regards to the Hebron massacre itself  and the developments leading up to and following the slaughter  and the participants in it, Israel's effort at a cover-up has  proved unavailing. The Israeli generals, the state inquiry  commission itself, the Israeli press, and the Israeli human  rights organization, have been uncovering more and more facts  and details that can be proved as follows:    First, a massacre on that scale had been predicted. Israeli  military and political circles had expected similar [word  indistinct].    Second, with so many settlements and settlers [passage  indistinct].    Third, the Israeli measures and pledges that followed the  massacre [passage instinct].    Fourth, [passage indistinct] calling for placing East  Jerusalem under the heading of an Israeli withdrawal from the  occupied Palestinian territories is nothing unusual; it fits in  with the essence of the [word indistinct] and with the letter  and spirit of the declaration of principles agreement. More  importantly, it fits in with the [word indistinct] as revealed  by the appalling carnage at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque.    Why then is this U.S. position, and why is this U.S. threat  to use the veto prerogative?    We agree with all the parties, including the U.S.  Administration, that the al-Ibrahimi Mosque bloodbath has  highlighted the pressing need to pursue the peace process and  the negotiations, and to secure all the elements required for  bringing the peace process and negotiations to a successful  conclusion. [passage indistinct].    The last interesting question is this: The United States,  which has consistently argued that it does not want to pressure  any of the interlocutors, is now applying maximum pressure,  including a direct threat to veto a draft resolution proposed by  the PLO and the Arab and Muslim groups, as well as European  nations led by Russia, the cosponsor of the peace process with  the United States.    We have not the least doubt that the United States is the  most powerful nation on earth and that its ability to apply  pressure and issue threats is limitless. However, we think the  world has a need for a framework of legitimacy and neutrality  and, at least, a modicum of balanced logic. But the U.S.  rationale that the United States will support Israel even when  it is at fault and, in the meantime, others can bang their heads  against the wall [words indistinct] can implement on account of  its limitless power. But it will serve no purpose.    [Words indistinct] if peace will bring dividends to all the  parties, irrespective of the prevailing circumstances, all these  parties must shoulder the responsibilities this sought-after  peace carries.</p>

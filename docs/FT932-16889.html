			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Drug doubts hit Wellcome share price REPORTS that AZT, the world's principal Aids drug, is ineffective for carriers of the disease, wrongfooted London and New York broking houses yesterday and sent shares in Wellcome, the drug's manufacturer, plummeting. The reports relate to the biggest trial carried out so far on the drug, an Anglo-French study involving more than 1,700 people and lasting for three years. Analysts yesterday were still digesting the possible impact of a study which suggests that for 10m HIV-positive people worldwide AZT will fail to delay the onslaught of Aids. Wellcome's share price fell by 10 per cent when trading began in London and ended the day 51p lower at 692p. Turnover of 15m shares in London was one of the heaviest daily totals ever recorded. In New York, the US equivalent of the shares opened Dollars 1 lower at Dollars 10 1/4 but then recovered a little. Pharmaceuticals analyst Mr Peter Laing at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull cut his forecast for Retrovir's earnings for the year to August 1995 by Pounds 150m to Pounds 400m and for the following year by Pounds 210m to Pounds 460m. Mr Nigel Barnes at Hoare Govett said of the news: 'It undermines the Wellcome marketing message for earlier use of the drug. It is the asymptomatic population that Wellcome is targeting as offering the greatest sales potential.' The day before the news broke that 1.5m Aids carriers in the developed world were unlikely to benefit from the treatment, many financial analysts had been sceptical of its import. They said that the 'hope factor' included in forecasts had largely been removed as asymptomatic people, those who are HIV-positive but show no signs of Aids, had tended to shun AZT because of side effects. They added that Wellcome's share price had already fallen so far that it discounted bad news and was now implying a price-earning ratio below that of the FT-SE 100 Index. However, the background to yesterday's selling lay in the issue last July by Wellcome Trust of 270m shares. The Trust raised Pounds 2.1bn in what was one of the biggest ever share offerings and at that time optimism over the drug, also known as Retrovir, was one plank in confidence in the company's future performance. The global co-ordination, handled by merchant bank Robert Fleming, involved most of the world's principal securities firms. Such houses as S G Warburg and Cazenove in the UK, Nikko Securities of Japan and Morgan Stanley of the US all produced hefty research extolling the strengths of the company. After an extensive book-building exercise, the shares were finally bought by investors at Pounds 8 each, having fallen from around Pounds 10 two months earlier. With no fundamental shift in the company's performance since the issue - in fact Wellcome last week recorded better than expected pre-tax profits of Pounds 324.6m - it has been difficult for financial analysts to justify a shift of attitude. However, one leading UK broker said 'people involved in the share issue may have been slightly bullish at the time'. Since the issue, enthusiasm for pharmaceuticals companies in general has been hit by concern that drug prices in the US will be cut following reforms proposed by the Clinton administration.</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STRIKE'S CONFLICTS LEAVE STUDENT LEADER UPSET, CONFUSED, DISCOURAGED  </P> <P> As 14-year-old Renee Barrow left Le Conte Junior High School one afternoon this  week, she was angered when she saw picket-carrying teachers heckling another  instructor who had spent the day in class.  </P> <P> "Why don't you grow up?" Renee yelled over her shoulder at the strikers.  </P> <P> The incident underscores how Le Conte's student body president has changed over  the last few days. Before the strike, "I always looked up to my teachers,"  Renee recalled.  </P> <P> Renee said Friday that she is angry, depressed and "all confused" by the  5-day-old teachers' strike. And, she said there is a sense on the Hollywood  campus -- among both supporters and opponents of the striking teachers -- that  things at Le Conte may never be the same.  </P> <P> The usually bubbly ninth-grader has been unable to reconcile conflicting  statements from teachers, parents, friends and television news reports. "I  don't understand," she said, her ponytail whipping back and forth as she shook  her head.  </P> <P> One moment, Renee chastised her teachers as uncaring and accused them of using  students as pawns in their battle; the next she said she sympathizes with their  cause, but wishes "they would fight this out on their own time."  </P> <P> Renee's greatest concern is that the strike will ruin her graduation -- a  significant rite of passage. She and several of her friends have already bought  their dresses and Renee has rented a limousine for the occasion.  </P> <P> Graduation is important, she said, because "it means we're growing up" --  something she anxiously awaits.  </P> <P> Renee, a B-plus student who wears a touch of lipstick and keeps her nails a  well-manicured pink, is maturing quickly into a responsible and astute young  woman, according to her teachers. She was the first candidate for student body  president who bothered to return to the year-round school to campaign during  her vacation period. Just last week, the teen-ager -- who said she plans to go  to college and become a lawyer -- served as chairwoman of the school's advisory  council and conducted a meeting that included teachers, parents and  administrators. She got high marks from participating adults.  </P> <P> She also boasts friends from around the world. The tendency among students at  the ethnically diverse school is to mix primarily with youngsters of their own  group. But Renee can usually be seen on campus surrounded by an eclectic group  of Armenian, Latino and Asian students.  </P> <P> Despite her apparent maturity, however, Renee still gets bruises and minor  scrapes from roughhousing with friends on the gym floor, and she's not above  speaking pig Latin with girlfriends.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Offended by Treatment  </P> <P> Last Monday, when she arrived at the school on the first day of the strike,  Renee said she felt overwhelmed by the disorder. She also was offended by the  curt, heavy-handed treatment she said she received from the relatively few  adults -- some of whom she had never seen before -- struggling to maintain  control.  </P> <P> When she wasn't allowed to call home to ask her mother to pick her up, "I said,  that's it," she recalled. She and a handful of friends jumped a chain-link  fence behind the school. Her mother, however, persuaded her to return to school  and the girls ended up jumping back over the fence later in the afternoon.  </P> <P> "We've always thought that teachers were the good guys and parents the bad  guys. But now it's switched around," Renee said. "It's our parents who are  helping us through this."  </P> <P> She has continued going to school, she said, because ninth-graders have been  warned by school administrators that attendance during the strike may be used  to determine who may attend graduation ceremonies. By Friday, less than half of  the school's 1,500 students were still showing up for school.  </P> <P> After one week, the school's response to the crisis has established its own  routine. Renee and her classmates have a regular class schedule, though they  still complain that class content ranges from "basic to nothing."  </P> <P> While Renee is anxious for the strike to end, she isn't looking forward to the  aftermath -- "a lot of hard feelings" between teachers and students.  </P> <P> "I don't think that it will ever be the same," she said.  </P></p>

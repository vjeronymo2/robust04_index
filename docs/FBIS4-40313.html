			<p>BFN     [Text] Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev said there was no  political opposition in the republic. "There is no opposition,  just ordinary criminals protected by Russia which seeks to get  its way in the Chechen Republic," he said in an interview with  Interfax.    Asked by an Interfax correspondent about the possible aims  of  the Russian leadership in Chechnya, Dudayev said it was trying  to discredit the Chechen leadership, to deteriorate the  situation. He said Russia was also involved in terrorism,  sabotage and provocations which Dudayev believed, according to  plans of Russian politicians, might lead to chaos and collapse  in Chechnya.    Dudayev said Russia was carrying out a policy of aggression  against Chechnya.    "When did Russia put an end to the Russian-Caucasian war? I  think, it never stopped. The present situation is just a  continuation of it but in a more sophisticated manner," Dudayev  said. In Chechnya, aggression, occupation, genocide and  violence have been going on for 300 years already, he concluded.</p>

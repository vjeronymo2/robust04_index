			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Arts: Three Choirs' still packs the naves - Roderic Dunnett feels Elgar would have approved of this year's Festival at Worcester CLOSE BY Elgar's statue opposite the north side of Worcester Cathedral is a shop named 'Bygones'. You could be forgiven for thinking the Three Choirs Festival, which has been running all this week, fitted the name. Surely it perished years ago, with the rest of those dinosaurian choral traditions - Huddersfield, Birmingham and the Leeds Triennial? Well, the answer is 'no'. Three Choirs claims to be Europe's oldest festival. This year's is the 266th in a series tracing back to at least the 1720s. The 280-strong three choirs - made up by choral societies from the three cathedral cities of Hereford, Worcester and Gloucester (the venue alternates annually) - continue to pack the naves and aisles. The festival has survived all vicissitudes: the collapse of Hereford's west tower in 1786; the provisioning of George III's entire retinue two years later; and dire cash shortages in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars. The venues make idyllic settings. Worcester, clasped between the Malverns and the Vale of Evesham, is an agreeable place to spend a few days. The omens seemed good this year. Both a four-day cricket match on the county ground abutting the River Severn and a race meeting dovetailed nicely with the middle of the festival: Elgar would have approved. But who goes to the Three Choirs now? Critics traditionally lambast the festival as one of the nation's arch-parochial events (where else would you find an informal forum on church music packed to the doors?) William Mann used to speak of its 'senile decay'. But it is a large parish. An audience survey last year showed that some 70 per cent of visitors to the festival are drawn from outside the locality. Many come from London and the Home Counties. Punters, prepared to pay up to Pounds 25 for a seat, arrive from as far afield as Scotland and Cornwall. Some 50 visitors from the US were here; my immediate neighbours proved to be enthusiasts from Durham, North Carolina, Washington DC and Boston, Mass. A few rows down was an attentive Japanese contingent. Programming to maintain diversity, ensure profitable sales and keep the Arts Council happy is a fine balance. The administration - much of it amateur and laid back, old-style but efficient - annually falls to a local committee, led by the Festival Director, who is also the host cathedral organist. The conducting is shared with visiting professionals: this year the BBC Philharmonic brought with it the Bolshoi's Yuri Simonov, replacing the indisposed Sir Edward Downes, and BBC Scotland's Jerzy Maksymiuka. Some think there should be more guest conductors, but budget plays a role here. Full accounts date back to early performances of Handel's Messiah. One problem is that County Council and Arts Council support has fallen woefully behind in the last few years, while the costs of orchestras, staging and closed-circuit TV have risen. Fire and safety checks have meant the loss of several hundred mainly cheaper seats, reducing Worcester's capacity to around 2,000. But the festival has its own resilience, as the Worcester treasurer, Peter Seward, explains. A tradition of stewardships guarantees the bulk of the central nave; sales are completed in March, providing a tidy sum for advance investment. Sponsorship from commerce and industry was initiated in 1976, at the same time as an organised 'Fringe' added diversity. A Royal Worcester donation of Pounds 4,000 towards a performance of Britten's War Requiem, linked to Wilfred Owen's centenary and the 75th anniversary of the armistice, was matched under the Business Sponsorship for the Arts scheme administered by ABSA. The Great War has an added meaning for Worcester: Geoffrey Studdart Kennedy, the pioneering forces' chaplain known as 'Woodbine Willie', was vicar of St Paul's Church. Ticket sales account for well over half the Pounds 370,000 budgeted expenditure, the bulk of which goes on orchestras and soloists. Sponsorship adds some Pounds 28,000, of which Pounds 10,000 is from county council sources. The dense programme book still makes a healthy profit. Most important, the administration takes up only 14 per cent of the whole. There are advantages in this quiet, in-house efficiency. administrator would meaningfully increase either the income or the professionalism of the set-up. In the meantime the parent body, the Three Choirs Association, is in the process of drawing up a three-year business plan. Friends of the festival make donations, the odd legacy still makes its way in, and there is an active organising ladies' committee. Slightly less promisingly, an Endowment Scheme recently set up has only produced Pounds 26,000 to date, part of which has been taken up with a new orchestral revolving platform and improved staging. The festival still seeks to innovate, if modestly. This year's programme includes the European premiere of the American composer Dominick Argento's large-scale Te Deum, plus a string orchestra commission from Robin Holloway. The event would benefit, perhaps, from a closer study of its visiting orchestras' repertoire, or linking in with the wide-ranging contemporary groups and series such as the London Sinfonietta or Contemporary Music Network. Each has been featured before. This week, amid jazz and Ivor Novello favourites, the Composers' Ensemble brought songs from the wholly contemporary Mary Wiegold Song Book. Above all, the festival needs to win over and educate its audience, Rattle-style, to offer a ready ear to the more innovative side of its repertoire. Without that there would have been little Parry and still less Elgar. Where the Three Choirs does score is in its commitment to second performances - forgotten works like A Spring Canticle by the suffragette Dame Ethel Smyth, not heard since its premiere here in 1926. Her memoirs, 'Impressions that Remained' were displayed in that same 'Bygones' shop window. Impressions that remained of Worcester this week were of a friendly series of events, often into the small hours, and very much alive.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar supported by GDP data THE DOLLAR was well supported against both the D-Mark and the yen in yesterday's European trading after the second-quarter GDP figures were revised upwards by more than the market had expected, writes James Blitz. Second-quarter GDP was revised to 1.8 per cent from a previous 1.6 per cent, but the impact of the figure was all the greater because market expectations had been for a rise of only 1.1 per cent. The strong data were backed up by reasonable consumer confidence figures. The conference board said its index had fallen to 59.0 in August from 59.2 in July. But July's figure was an upward revision from 57.7 and the expectations for the August number had only been for 57.2. Altogether, these figures helped to push the dollar to a high of DM1.6820 from a low of DM1.6675 in Europe. It closed at DM1.6780, up nearly a pfennig. Against the yen, the dollar finished at Y104.70 from a previous Y103.95. In New York the US currency ended at DM1.6765 and Y104.77. Mr Ian Gunner, an economist at Chase Manhattan Bank in London, said GDP data may give the dollar longer term support because of upward revisions for growth figures in previous years. 'In recent years, the Federal Reserve has been lowering interest rates in the belief that the economy needed a strong stimulus, but it might start to question that policy,' he said. However, Mr Gunner added that the immediate outlook for the dollar still depended on the non-farm payroll report for August, expected on Friday. In the case of the dollar/yen rate, much will depend on the Japanese government's new fiscal stimulus package due to be delivered around September 20. There are signs that the authorities in Tokyo are seeking to water down the contents of this package. But the dollar may have received some encouragement from comments by the Japanese trade minister, who said he wanted both a discount rate cut and a supplementary budget. European trading was very thin, even though many dealers were back in London from the summer vacation. The D-Mark gained some strength from unusually tight conditions in the German money market, with call money seen at the 7.5 per cent level. But the French franc still managed to make headway against the German currency, closing at FFr3.495 from a previous FFr3.499. The Danish krone also firmed against the D-Mark: it eased to DKr4.115 in mid-morning, but later rose to close around DKr4.0950. The pound ended  1/2 pfennig down on the day at DM2.4950. Sterling money markets continue to take a dim view of the prospects for a reduction in UK interest rates. But the British political party conferences are only a few weeks away, and some dealers believe that the prospect of another season of speculation on UK monetary policy is upon us.</p>

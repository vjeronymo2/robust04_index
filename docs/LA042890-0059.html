			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND AT AFI FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> SATURDAY  </P> <P> Following are The Times' recommendations for today's and Sunday's schedule of  the American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival, with  commentary by the film reviewing staff.  </P> <P> Information: (213) 480-3232 or (213) 520-2000.  </P> <P> Recommended:  </P> <P> "LADDER OF SWORDS"(Great Britain, 1989; Director: Norman Hull; Century Plaza,  6:45 p.m.). A husband-wife circus act on the skids in the British moors may not  sound like a promising premise for a movie, but this debut feature is  engagingly scruffy. The wayward lives it depicts are viewed without  condescension. (Peter Rainer)  </P></p>

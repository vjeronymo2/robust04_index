			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Standard bearer for Mitterrand's Yes campaign - William Dawkins profiles the French European affairs minister THE earnest, neatly tailored Mrs Elisabeth Guigou, French European affairs minister, has over the past few weeks become both the workhorse and standard bearer of her government's pro-Maastricht campaign. The 46-year-old European affairs minister has been on the stump somewhere in the French provinces almost every day since mid August and will have visited more than 40 cities before the campaign is out. She has lobbied in the provinces far more than any other government minister. Yet for all her admirable qualities, Mrs Guigou's campaign must be a factor in the surprise emergence of a majority against European union in some opinion polls. One found her less convincing than Philippe Seguin, the Gaullist MP who has taken the highest profile in the no campaign, and less convincing than the rabidly anti-Maastricht head of the Front National, Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen. The indefatigable Mrs Guigou bought her campaign to the Euro-faithful earlier this week, at a European Movement youth conference in a seaside holiday village near Biarritz. 'Success or failure hinges not so much on turning back the no vote as on those who have not yet made up their minds,' she told her audience of student campaigners. They should concentrate on the details of the treaty because much of the no vote was based on ignorance and misunderstanding. Campaigners should remind local townsfolk that hardly a French commune lacked afacility, built with the help of EC cash. She omitted, however, to mention that France was a net contributor to EC funds and that its contributions were likely to rise as a result of the treaty. Even so, it was clear, competent stuff. Mrs Guigou knows the treaty backwards and she talked to her young audience without a trace of condescension. She bore heckling with calm good humour and hit back trick questions with skill. So why has Mrs Guigou's approach not won more votes? It could be that her style is so clearly Parisian, a disadvantage when so much of the no vote appears to be a protest against the political establishment. To some, she appears reserved, though this is said to be symptom of underlying shyness. Oddly, Mrs Guigou's background is quite like that of her arch-opponent Mr Seguin. They were both born in colonial north Africa and went to the elite civil service college, the Ecole Nationale d'Administration following high flying careers in the public administration. Yet Mrs Guigou has come out of this quite a different person - a cool technocrat, as against the more populist Mr Seguin. Despite both sides' entreaties to the French populace to vote purely on the issues style counts for something in this - as in any other - political campaign.</p>

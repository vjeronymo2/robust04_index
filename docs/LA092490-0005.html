			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNING  </P> <P> I can see no compelling reason why taxpayers should be expected to foot the  bill to deploy Air Force One, Secret Service personnel and all the other costs  associated with a presidential trip so that George Bush can raise campaign  funds for Sen. Pete Wilson ("Wilson Fund-Raiser Headlined by Bush," Part B,  Sept. 19).  </P> <P> Dragging the President around, at taxpayers expense no less, to shill for the  Republican Party is particularly odious considering the various crisis the U.S.  is now facing, not the least of which is an economic one.  </P> <P> DENISE ARANT  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

The third convention of the MPD, which has been in power  since January 1991 following the first free legislative  elections in Cape Verde, took place 19-20 February in the Cape  Verdian capital and solidified the divisions within the party,  resulting in the departure of the former labor and justice  minister, Eurico Monteiro, and several other leaders.    Monteiro had contested the way the chairman of the MPD was  designated and announced that he would create a new party.  Among the new leaders of the MPD are Communication Minister  Ondina Ferreira, Territorial Administration Minister Mario  Silva, Fisheries and Agriculture Minister Helena Semedo, and  National Assembly Speaker Amilcar Spencer Lopes.    The divisions within the MPD began several months ago with  the resignation of the ministers of foreign affairs, justice and  labor, and health. The first two blamed the prime minister for  having kept in place the Cape Verdian ambassador to Portugal,  who was accused of using government funds for personal use.    The former single party, the African Party for the  Independence of Cape Verde [PAICV], in power for 17 years,  demanded the holding of early elections due to the crisis within  the MPD.    The PAICV has 22 deputies at the National Assembly compared  with 56 for the MPD.</p>

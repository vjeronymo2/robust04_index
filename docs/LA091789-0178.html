			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CYCLING;  </P> <P> WORDIN MAKES A CAREER MOVE -- STRAIGHT DOWNHILL  </P> <P> The thought of hurling himself and his bike off a cliff had never really  appealed to John Wordin. Sane people can be like that.  </P> <P> But, as the National Off-Road Bicycle Assn. Points Series Finals and World  Mountain Bike Championships approached on consecutive weekends in September,  the more intrigued he became. Road racing did not prepare him for this  experience. Neither did several years of football at Cal State Northridge.  </P> <P> "It's the gnarliest thing you'll ever do on a bike," the West Hills resident  said. "They carry people off on stretchers. There were a lot of guys coming  down with mangled bikes."  </P> <P> Wordin, a road racer by trade, was speaking of last weekend's kamikaze downhill  at the World Mountain Bike Championships at Mammoth Lakes, where it is  advisable to wear hockey goalie gear and check your trepidations at the door.  Competitors push huge gears and reach speeds approaching 45 m. p. h. -- all  while negotiating hairpin turns and hair-raising obstacles.  </P> <P> "It's so different," Wordin said. "You get out of control a lot easier. It's  not harder or easier, really, just different. Kind of like going from  racquetball to tennis."  </P> <P> Wordin dropped out of the race -- although he was 49th in the hill climb --  when he experienced mechanical difficulties, but he was 25th overall at the  NORBA event in Big Bear.  </P> <P> He said it was his first mountain bike race.  </P> <P> "Most of the guys dropped out," Wordin said. "I think that's why I did so  well."  </P> <P> Add NORBA Championships: Chatsworth's John Tomac was ninth in the NORBA Points  Series Finals Sept. 3 in Big Bear. Tomac, the defending champion, finished the  30-mile cross-country race at Snow Summit Resort in 2 hours, 29 minutes, 41  seconds, nearly seven minutes off the pace of winner Tim Gould of Great  Britain.  </P> <P> In the final points standings Tomac, who spent much of the season concentrating  on road races, was ninth with 65 points. Ned Overend had 119 points to win the  title.  </P> <P> The women's race champion was Sara Ballantyne, who also finished first in the  overall points standings.  </P> <P> Add Tomac: Considered the finest off-road cyclist in the world despite recent  efforts to steer his career toward road races, Tomac won the kamikaze downhill  en route to the overall title in the Mountain Bike World Championships last  weekend in Mammoth Lakes.  </P> <P> Tomac, the defending champion, finished six seconds ahead of the pack, covering  the approximate four-mile descent in 5:30.  </P> <P> Tomac was sixth in the cross-country event and fourth in the hill climb to hold  off Sunnyvale's Don Myrah, who finished with 59 points -- four behind Tomac.  </P> <P> Other area finishers included Canyon Country's Tom Rogers, who was third in the  hill climb, 17th in the cross-country race, 21st in the downhill and ninth  overall; and Palmdale's Wayne Crosdale, fifth in the downhill and 21st overall.  Burbank's Bret Hill was 43rd in the hill climb and 50th in the cross-country  race.  </P> <P> Rogers, incidentally, is an original member of Team Ape, a Simi Valley team  that, among other requirements, demands its members be at least 6-feet tall.  </P> <P> In the women's standings, Simi Valley's Katie Beck was 19th overall in the  expert class.  </P> <P> Wild thing: The Wilderness Institute, a nonprofit organization based in  Woodland Hills, is offering several classes for beginning cyclists over the  next two months.  </P> <P> The courses include bicycle maintenance, introduction to touring in Santa  Barbara, mountain-bike maintenance and introduction to mountain biking in  addition to tours of the Santa Ynez Valley and Ojai.  </P> <P> Information: 818-887-7831.  </P> <P> Subaru series: David Brinton of North Hollywood and Team Crest was 13th in the  most recent stop of the Subaru Cycling Series, held Sept. 10 in Salt Lake City.  </P> <P> Steve Hegg of Montgomery/Avenir won the criterium. Hegg, a teammate of Van Nuys  resident Thurlow Rogers, earned 35 points and moved to within 33 points of  overall leader Tom Schuler.  </P> <P> The eight-event series concludes Sunday with its championship races in  Philadelphia.  </P></p>

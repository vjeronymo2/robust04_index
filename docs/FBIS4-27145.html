			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Nam Son-hyon from the UN Headquarters] </F>   [Text] UN sources have said that the UN Security Council  [UNSC] is preparing to adopt a resolution or a statement urging  North Korea to immediately stop the extraction of fuel rods.    In a behind-closed-doors plenary session held last night,  the  UNSC held an emergency discussion on North Korea's nuclear  issue. It was reported that the UNSC reached an agreement to  actively cope with North Korea's nuclear issue.    The permanent members of the UNSC are actively engaged in  fine- tuning their opinions over how to take measures on North  Korea at the moment, but that China is maintaining a prudent  stance.</p>

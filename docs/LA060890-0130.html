			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: A&amp;E NARROWS THE CULTURE GAP, CNN TURNS A HEAVYWEIGHT 10  </P> <P> Cable's Arts &amp; Entertainment network, in little more than six years of  operation, has managed to become a sort of junior public TV -- with  commercials.  </P> <P> To say that A&amp;E is presently a bona-fide alternative to PBS -- even taking  the public-TV system's flaws into account -- would be going too far. For one  thing, the frequency and seemingly arbitrary insertion of A&amp;E commercials  is just exasperating. A recent showing of that fine John Sayles film "Matewan,"  for example, found A&amp;E bringing down a commercial break on a climactic  final sequence like a guillotine. A network that purports to exalt art should  respect its integrity.  </P> <P> In other ways, however, the gap separating PBS and A&amp;E may be narrowing.  </P> <P> Although still short on first-run fare, A&amp;E offers many of the same types  of programs -- let's stop mincing words and call them "highbrow" -- available  on PBS.  </P> <P> And some that are not found on PBS.  </P> <P> Most dramatically, that includes the cable network's own month-old "Arts &amp;  Entertainment Revue," a weekly hour (airing at 5 and 9 p.m. Fridays, 3 p.m.  Saturdays and 8 a.m. Sundays) that nourishes your mind with a cultural menu not  unlike the old "Omnibus" series that ran on CBS and ABC in the mid-1950s.  </P> <P> "Arts &amp; Entertainment Revue" is a show that PBS should have done.  </P> <P> Produced by Susan Lester and Av Westin and hosted by the gifted Eric Burns (who  previously co-hosted "By the Year 2000" on KCET), this is a very  good-getting-to-be-grand program that has no twin or even a close cousin  elsewhere on TV. To call it "Entertainment Tonight" with a brain is either to  overvalue the syndicated "Entertainment Tonight" or to undervalue "Arts &amp;  Entertainment Revue."  </P> <P> Actually, there is no similarity beyond the title. Here is a show that  leisurely explores and celebrates creativity, in part by turning creators  themselves into informal correspondents, as in last week's rich profile of  Mandy Patinkin. The reporter was author/singer/deejay Jonathan Schwartz.  </P> <P> "Arts &amp; Entertainment Revue" has been a Rolodex of delights, whether a bit  of a play or Morley Safer reading portions of his book, "Flashbacks: On  Returning to Vietnam," or comments by Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca juxtaposed  with their brilliant sketches from "Your Show of Shows." There's genius here,  and wit and vibrancy.  </P> <P> Just as "Nightline" and Ted Koppel were made for each other, so, in a  lower-case way, are "Arts &amp; Entertainment Revue" and Burns, whose ability  to make unforced, intelligent conversation with guests sets the tone for this  show. More than anything, however, it's the performance aspect that defines  "Arts &amp; Entertainment Revue."  </P> <P> Not everything works. If some authors wrote as poorly as they read their own  writing on this program, for example, they wouldn't even be published.  </P> <P> Yet this is a very special hour and a sweet way to cap a week. A quote from  that singing, dancing little person on ABC's "Twin Peaks" applies here:  "There's music in the air."  </P> <P> CNN has just celebrated its 10th birthday, noting one of the most incredible  success stories in the history of television. The visionary Ted Turner's  almost-all-news cable network is TV's Rocky, an underdog, 90-pound weakling  grown into a brawny, thick-necked heavyweight with 16-inch biceps.  </P> <P> Measuring today's CNN against the infant CNN -- the one that ABC, CBS and NBC  regularly ridiculed before later growing to respect and fear it -- is just,  well, boggling. It's something to keep in mind before making snap negative  judgments about weird-looking toddlers like the three-hour news block that KCAL  Channel 9 initiated three months ago.  </P> <P> CNN has become not only one of this nation's institutions but also one of the  world's. The one thing that you can count on while traveling abroad is CNN,  whose straight news programs are beamed to 90 nations.  </P> <P> No wonder that Bobbie Battista may have closed in on the globally syndicated  Lucille Ball as the world's most recognizable face during her recently ended  seven-year stint as "Headline News" anchor. Although relatively unknown in the  United States, Battista -- who now co-anchors CNN's "World Day" and "Newshour"  programs -- got famous internationally by being on the air at peak viewing  times in other nations where TV diets are sparse.  </P> <P> According to CNN executive vice president Ed Turner, a CNN executive was in a  cab in Berlin recently when the driver noticed the network logo on his tote  bag. "Oh, CNN," the cabbie said. "I learned to speak English listening to  Bobbie Battista."  </P> <P> In the United States, CNN has become indispensable both as a network of record  for such epic events as the Bush-Gorbachev summit and as the network that  reacts speediest to breaking news. What's more, CNN sometimes covers things  that may not rank high on a news scale but are interesting slices of life that  make up the American pie.  </P> <P> As an industry, cable has a spotty record in providing diversity. Without a  doubt, however, CNN has become the 911 number for finding out what's happening  in the world.  </P> <P> It's also a network that can make you mad, having been known to overcover  events merely because it is a news network. And raw, unedited footage still  finds its way onto CNN during some breaking stories for no other apparent  reason than it's available -- a dangerous practice. Moreover, not all CNN stars  are on camera because of their news pedigrees: Witness the controversial hiring  of Texas judge Catherine Crier -- a news neophyte -- as "The World Today"  co-anchor with veteran Bernard Shaw.  </P> <P> TV being TV, it was inevitable that CNN would nurture its own news celebrities.  Unlike its older counterparts, however, this is not a network where news  anchors and reporters are the stars. As Hank Whittemore, author of a  just-published biography on CNN, notes, on this network "the news is the star."  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dr. Chon Hyon-chun, lecturer at Sukmyong Women's </F> University]    [Excerpts] There are two extremes of opinion regarding Kim  Chong-il. At the one extreme critics say that he is quite  capable of making reasonable choices thanks to his more than 20  years of experience in public life whereas the opposite  opinion says that he is emotionally unstable and haphazard,  acts on the spur of the moment, and is unreasonable in  character. In reality, it is difficult to say which of these is  accurate because of the paucity of information, a common  difficulty encountered in research on North Korea. Therefore,  any attempt to evaluate Kim Chong-il is full of pitfalls.  Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that Kim Chong-il is quite  capable of making choices in the "North Korean style" on the  strength of his long practical experience and with the  assistance of his staff, limited as it is. Of course, this is  not to say that I take at face value the overestimation of the  existing arrangement for the succession on the one hand and  his ability on the other.   <H5>    1. Overly Packaged Kim Chong-il's Birth </H5>   In the past North Korea overly embellished Kim Chong-il's  image and publicized his blown up image instead of letting  people know about him as he is. The key point in the succession  in North Korea is whether the successor will secure his  authority as the leader. For this reason, North Korea has been  doing everything possible to groom Kim Chong-il. In this effort  North Korea used books and NODONG SINMUN and other news media  as major tools. As mentioned earlier, in my opinion Kim Chong-il  will be able to rule North Korea for a certain period on the  strength of his experience and ability alone. Yet North Korea  continues to overexaggerate his image, and this might rather  cause his early fall.    That is why we need to analyze and evaluate North Korea's  appraisal of Kim Chong-il accurately and objectively. If we  were to accept the North Korean appraisal without ascertaining  facts, we would be faced with difficulties in dealing with the  future Kim Chong-il regime. For this reason, I will analyze the  substance of "Kim Chong- il, the Leader," Vol. I and Vol. II,  (hereunder referred to as "Leader- 1" and "Leader-2,"  respectively), Tongbangsa, 1984, co-authored by Tak Chin, Kim  Kang-il, and Pak Hong-che, by way of critiquing the process of  blowing up Kim Chong-il's image.    The most distorted part of Kim Chong-il's biography concerns  his birthplace. According to "Leader-1," "Dear Comrade Kim  Chong-il was born ... at a secret camp in Mt. Paektu on 16  February 1942." In fact, Mt. Paektu, known as a sacred mountain  of our nation, has been the spiritual prop of the Korean race.  For this reason Kim Il-song has exaggerated the anti-Japanese  armed struggle in the area around Mt. Paektu (the Changbaek  Mountains), using it as the basis of his legitimacy.  Accordingly, North Korea might have had no other choice but to  fabricate the story of Kim Chong-il's birth in a secret camp in  that mountain while Kim Il-song was waging the anti-Japanese  struggle in 1942 (some say 1941). Otherwise the myth about the  Kim Il- song-led anti-Japanese armed struggle in and around Mt.  Paektu would crumble, weakening the logical basis of the  succession doctrine as well.    The general view on Kim Chong-il's birthplace is that he was  born in the South Camp in a village near Vladivostok, Russia.   <H5>    2. Unstable Character </H5>   Among Kim Chong-il watchers, there is a controversy over the  question of his personality. On the whole Kim Chong-il's  character is far from a composed and stable type. "Leader-2" on  page 167, says: "He is always pondering some problem. Even when  he sits, he constantly moves; and when he crosses the room he  does not walk slowly, but moves with agility." But when we  interpret this remark--originally intended as a compliment--in a  critical light, we would say Kim Chong-il is unstable.    Kim Chong-il could be a militant. "Leader-2" on page 123  says: "The piebald horse he wanted was still an untamed  ferocious wild horse unfit for riding. The workers were  reluctant, but he insisted on bringing the horse to him." The  book continues: "Aggressiveness, speed, and incisiveness--this  temperament clearly manifested itself in accomplishing  everything at a stroke. Thrust forward quickly, break through  barriers and dash forth ceaselessly by leaps--this is his  unique work ethos. This passionate temperament found its  expression in the Speed Battle." In this way the book pays  tribute to Kim Chong-il's intrepidity. But conversely, this is  indicative of being foolhardy and adventurous.    The question of modesty arises in discussing Kim Chong-il's  personality. Says "Leader-1" on page 92: "He is erudite, free  and easy in disposition, and does not get bogged down in  anything. Naturally, in response to unanimous requests by  classmates, he got himself involved in many activities on the  university campus and stood at the center of the youth  movement." "Leader-1" on pages 255-256 says: "His fine virtue  of dealing with others with modesty and frankness always warmed  people's hearts, inspiring a boundless sense of intimacy, and  wrapped people around him wrapped in a family atmosphere...  Wherever he went, he soon mingled with people." "Leader-2" on  page 378 says: "When he mounts the platform, or leaves the hall  after a meeting, he always tries to let former anti-Japanese  fighters precede him. This sometimes causes a temporary halt in  the flow of dignitaries mounting or leaving the platform." In  this way the books try to publicize his image as a humble man.    Kim Chong-il is even said to be arrogant to people of his  father's generation because he grew up as the oldest son of Kim  Il-song, and identifies himself with his father's status.  Reportedly, he holds his hands behind his back even in front of  Kim Il-song; and that is why the "followers of Kim Il-song"  complain about this attitude. Accordingly, the claim that he is  humble could be fiction.   <H5>    3. `Daring,' Wide-Angle Politician </H5>   There are also arguments about Kim Chong-il's ruling style.  North Korean propaganda claims that Kim Chong-il engaged in  politics early on as a university student. Says "Leader-1" on  page 122: "Early on in his university days, Dear Comrade Kim  Chong-il emerged as a politician who contributed directly to  the formulation and implementation of party policies, not as a  politician who merely took part in politics to simply help  implement party policies... Dear Comrade Kim Chong-il was a  university student and a politician at the same time." The book  claims that he was a student politician who personally  contributed to the formulation and implementation of party  policies during his university days, going beyond simply  assisting in the implementation of party policies. From all  this, it may be surmised that he was interested in politics  already in his youth.    Regarding his work style, North Korea is publicizing that he  is a "daring" wide-angle politician. Says "Leader-1" on page  277: "It is customary for him to tackle any task daringly and  boldly. But the latest large, long-distance belt-conveyer  transport project was a particularly fantastic and grandiose  transformation plan... In fact, after this project, numerous  structures were built under a long-range plan under his  guidance. The large long-distance belt-conveyor transport  construction project at Unyul Mine marked the beginning of the  series of impressive monumental structures erected under plans  for the ages." Of course, that was true because the succeeding  years saw the erection of numerous gigantic strictures, such as  Changgwang Street (in 1980), the Great Study Hall of the People  (in 1981), the Arch of Triumph and the Chuche Tower (in 1982)  in North Korea. The problem, however, is that Kim Chong-il, who  entered politics with no political philosophy, thinks anything  huge is valuable without regard to efficiency and economic  benefits. This is to say that contrary to North Korea' boast,  what they call wide-angle politics is a reflection of the  haphazard, extemporaneous, and uneconomical aspects of his  personality, and it could cause him difficulties in securing his  authority as the successor.   <H5>    4. Kim Chong-il's Ruling Style </H5>   In addition to all those problems, the side effects of  personalty cult- centered mode of rule are very serious as  apparent from this passage on page 136 of "Leader-2": "He  immediately sent a high-performance pump by helicopter. No  sooner had he received a report that a certain mine had no  means to haul dirt than he dispatched large trucks. They were  able to instantly overcome whatever obstacles and temporary  slack times by following his bold and resourceful  countermeasures." In the last analysis, this mode of personal  rule has become one of the fundamental causes leading to the  derangement of North Korea's economic structure, a planned  economy. This is to say that his mode of operation is a factor  causing the incapacitation of the planned economy. A more  serious problem is that Kim, failing to realize the  seriousness of this, is absorbed in "gift-oiled politics" and  "invitation-driven politics," the acme of personal rule.    Another problem involving his ruling style concerns his  working hours. "Leader-2" on page 166 says: "Dear Comrade Kim  Chong- il's daily schedule begins at 0000 hours and ends at 0000  hours on the following day... Some of his aides say his  schedule flows like a duet or a trio, and others say his  schedule runs on a two-dimensional or three-dimensional scale."  This kind of operating style has led to grumbling by  functionaries. Those concerned have to stand by just in case he  summons them, and this reduces efficiency due to the difficulty  in adapting oneself to the different working hours. Therefore,  this operating style should be viewed as a factor undermining  his authority rather than an asset.   <H5>    5. Kim Chong-il's Complex </H5>   Another question raised by Kim watchers is, why does he  seldom appear in public? There may be roughly two reasons.  First, it may be because of his scheming temperament. In this  connection, "Leader-1" on page 364 explains: "While moved as  they were by the marvelous changes, the general public in many  cases knew very little about his hard work hidden in those  marvels because he worked silently by mixing with the masses.  Moreover, he tried hard to shun publicity on his achievements.  That is why in most cases his heroic efforts in certain tasks  came to light belatedly. This to say that what he accomplished  was in the limelight, but he hid himself behind his  accomplishments." Nevertheless, it may not be out of modesty  but because of his scheming personality and his tendency to  shun the masses that Kim Chong-il avoids public appearances as  much as possible. Some critics attribute it to his "inferiority  complex about being short."    Secondly, his poor conversational skills may be another  reason. Of course, "Leader-2" on page 12 praises his speaking  capability in these words: "He delivers powerful speeches in  plain words, but he leads the audience to the high ground of  his unique thought through his well-organized logic." However,  none of his speeches has ever been broadcast in his own voice.  This sheds light on the question of his public speaking  capability. That he is an illogical and unsystematic orator was  proven by the testimonies of Choe Un-hui and Sin Sang-ok. In  this connection, it may be said that Kim Chong-il has a  "stutterer complex."   <H5>    6. Childhood Glorified </H5>   Another problem is that "Leader-1" and "Leader-2" exaggerate  Kim Chong-il's wizardry. North Korea traces back Kim's  childhood to age three in order to highlight his love of the  country. "Leader-1" on page 8 describes his return to Korea as  follows: "One day shortly after liberation Dear Comrade Kim  Chong-il was en route to Pyongyang on board a boxcar with his  mother, Mme Kim Chong-suk, and other female anti-Japanese  fighters. The train traveled along the scenic east coast in the  liberated homeland before heading west. As he watched a hamlet  of thatched houses at the foot of the mountain from the  whistling train, his face beamed with joy. Everything seemed to  welcome him and his party with an extended hand. Young as he  was, he felt deep in his heart the preciousness of the  fatherland."    According to this book, he must have been 3 years old when  he returned to Korea, for he was born in 1942. A 3-year-old  prodigy could have an exceptional ability to speak and  comprehend, as well as exceptional mathematical reasoning power.  But according to experts, even such a whiz kid is not  emotionally mature enough to express his inner feelings about  his country. Therefore, the claim that he felt deep in his heart  the preciousness of the fatherland at that young age is an  exaggeration of his personality. This is to say that North  Korea is exaggerating Kim's childhood in an attempt to deify  him and elevate him to the level of Jesus Christ.    "Leader-1" on pages 14-15 tells anecdotes about him as a  preschooler. An old man was telling the story of a woman named  Kye Wol-hyang, who during Hideyoshi's invasion of Korea in  1592, spied on the enemy and passed the secrets to our forces,  resulting in the death of an enemy general and the recapture of  Pyongyang. The old man was embarrassed because he could not  recall the name of the Japanese general. At that moment Kim  Chong-il, who sat near the old man, gave him the name and left  quietly. The audience called the young child a whiz kid. That  is the gist of the story. The book also carries the following  anecdote about Kim's exceptional wisdom: "From childhood Dear  Comrade Kim Chong-il surprised those around him by his  wide-ranging knowledge and high level of intelligence that were  beyond imagination for his age. First of all, his knowledge and  intelligence are gifts of nature." "Leader-1" on page 25 says:  "The intensity of the fire of his effort and enthusiasm can be  surmised by the single fact that the books he read from  childhood through secondary school numbered in the thousands."    Regarding Kim's academic ability, "Leader-1" on page 91  says: "Dear Comrade Kim Chong-il's writings are really many-  sided. The forms and methods he uses in writing scientific  theses are very diverse and the scale of his works is huge  indeed. The substance covers a wide range of politics,  economics, education, science, literature, and art." Even if  these anecdotes are true, they are not particularly unusual.  Kim Chong-il might have had an extra lesson in Hideyoshi's  invasion of Korea from his tutor, and thus the young Kim,  dubiously known as a prodigy, might have been able to recall  the name of the Japanese general. But no doubt they went too  far when they turned him into a prodigy. The claim that he is a  bookworm may be accepted at face value to some extent, but the  claim that he is an expert in all fields, not just one  particular field, is hardly acceptable.   <H5>    7. Kim Chong-il's Doubtful Record </H5>   Whether Kim Chong-il studied abroad or not is also an open  question. "Leader-1" on page 57 says: "Quite a few people  predicted that Dear Comrade Kim Chong-il would study abroad  when he graduated from a higher middle school. People thought  so partly because it was a popular notion in those days that  anyone desiring to be successful in life should go abroad to  study, and partly because he traveled abroad in his higher  middle school days before going on to university. His decision  to study at Kim Il-song University, however, was a  demonstration of his thoroughgoing chuche awareness to pursue  studies based on reality in his own country where the great  chuche ideology and party policy, its embodiment, are in bloom."    Generally speaking, quite a few youths belonging to the  generation that experienced colonial rule in the early 1900's  went abroad to study, and North Koreans were no exception. As  the author of "Leader" admits, the general atmosphere in those  days was such that study abroad was essential for the ruling  elite. However, suppose that Kim Il-song, who adopted  self-reliance and chuche as the dominant ideology, had sent Kim  Chong-il abroad to study for whatever reasons, it might have  raised a serious question about the "holiness" and "the chuche  stand and attitude" of the Kim Il-song regime. That is why  North Korea is stressing that Kim Chong-il did not go abroad to  study.    However, the problem is that there is a 2-year blank in Kim  Chong-il's schooling. He entered Namsan Higher Middle School in  Pyongyang in September 1957. But it is not clear where he was  in from August 1958 when he was enrolled at his higher middle  school, to September 1960 when he entered Kim Il-song  University. Some critics say he was studying at the East German  Air Force Academy. They try to substantiate this speculation by  the fact that when he writes the Arabic numeral 7, he crosses  it with a bar, just as Europeans do--a practice not found among  Orientals. One may refute this by saying that he might have  taken on that habit while he was playing with the children of  Russian advisers.    On the other hand, there is another somewhat different  question concerning the North Korean claim that Kim Chong-il  uncovered the thesis "On Combating Dogmatism and Formalism in  Ideological Work and Establishing Chuche," known as the  theoretical foundation of the chuche ideology in North Korea.  Says "Leader-1" on page 167: "In March 1968 Kim Chong-il  "spotted the leader's following handwritten manuscripts among  his notes: `On Combating Dogmatism and Formalism in Ideological  Work and Establishing Chuche,' a masterpiece dated 28 December  1955; and `On Communist Indoctrination,' a speech delivered in  November 1958; in addition to the April 1965 Theses."    The claim that he uncovered the manuscript of "On Combating  Dogmatism..." in 1968 is of very great significance. As is  widely known, this document, supposedly published by Kim  Il-song in 1955, is a very important document in the study of  North Korea's chuche ideology. But the problem is that none of  the official papers, including NODONG SINMUN, ever published it  that year. Accordingly, most probably this document was  fabricated by necessity in 1968. 1968 was when the campaign to  idolize Kim Il-song reached its peak, and they might have found  it necessary to fabricate Kim Il-song's image as a "great  chuche ideologist." To this end, North Korea published numerous  educational books, including "A Sketch of Comrade Kim Il- song's  Revolutionary Activity" and "Picture Book on the History of the  Leader's Revolutionary Activity," in order to publicize Kim  Il-song's revolutionary thought and the sagacity of his  leadership. Quite possibly, it may be said that North Korea  fabricated the document, "On Combating Dogmatism..." as part of  this propaganda campaign.    In conclusion, the overblown image of Kim Chong-il in  "Leader-1" and "Leader-2" is a natural outcome of the  personality cult that has become a religion in North Korea. To  define a proper relationship between Kim Il-song "the God" and  Kim Chong-il the son of "the God," they have no choice but to  deify Kim Chong-il. Accordingly, in an attempt to exaggerate Kim  Chong-il's legitimacy and infallibility, they fabricated the  myth that he was born on Mt. Paektu, and made false claims  about his wizardry, benevolence, prowess, and ideological  quality, etc. It is a fact that this kind of hoodwinking works  on the North Korean people, who remain in social- political  infancy. But sooner or later the lies will come to light; and  when the "icon in the cave" breaks, North Korea will be thrown  into terrible turmoil.</p>

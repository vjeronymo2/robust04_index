			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Stephen Smith: "Angola Demands Arms in Return </F> for Its Oil"]    [Text] Is France prepared to lift its embargo against  exports of military equipment to Angola, that country racked by  the bloodiest war? Finding that out was the main reason for the  official visit carried out yesterday by Angolan President  Eduardo dos Santos, who had left the borders of Angola for the  first time since the contested elections held in September 1992,  which resulted in the resumption of the armed conflict.  According to UN statistics, which cannot be checked but do  indicate its order of magnitude, the civil war in Angola "is  responsible for more than 1,000 deaths per day" and has uprooted  approximately 3 million people, nearly one-third of the  population. Under these circumstances, and although laborious  peace talks have been under way since last November, could the  French Government be planning to lift the military embargo? "A  priori, no," replied an official French source yesterday, while  adding: "Unless a political decision is made at the highest  level..."    The Angolan request is dividing the government according to  a  variable political geometry: The president is against "anything  that might risk appearing to send a bad signal while a peaceful  solution is being sought." The prime minister's office is also  "somewhat embarrassed by the bad timing," whereas the Ministry  of Defense is "totally against" the idea, which is causing  Francois Leotard's entourage of being suspected, in the words of  one Angolan diplomat, of "supplying arms to the UNITA [National  Union for Angolan Independence]," the rebel movement led by  Jonas Savimbi. On the other hand, the Ministry of Cooperation  stated that it was "in favor, with no qualms," while the  Interior Ministry is so enthusiastic that the UNITA, in turn,  suspects Charles Pasqua of having "profited from several  unlisted cargoes of oil." There too, it is an accusation based  on strictly no evidence, but which puts its finger on the raw  spot of the war: Angolan oil, extracted by foreign companies  and "pawned" -- up to the year 2000 -- by the government so that  it could finance the purchase of arms.    Tomorrow afternoon, with a half-hour gap between them,  Eduardo dos Santos will receive the new managing director of Elf  Aquitaine, Philippe Jaffre, and the CEO of Aerospatiale, Louis  Gallois. In simplified terms the situation can be summed up as  follows: The oil will have to finance the weapons... However,  Elf complains that it "is not earning any money in Angola," due  to a "punishing and intolerable tax system." Hence the idea of  making a deal that would benefit everyone, with the notable  exception of the Angolan population. In exchange for  renegotiating its contracts, the French company would prove  "understanding" in the context of requests made by the  government in Luanda, all this with the blessing of the French  authorities, which not only want to sell arms and oil  installations, but also offer some opposition to the major U.S.  companies which have firmly established themselves on the  Angolan platforms.    Will Edouard Balladur opt in favor of this "strategic view"  while at the same time assuring himself of the tacit support of  Francois Mitterrand? It is not clear. For France would then be  accused of an ill-founded approach in the context of UN efforts  at pacification, and would expose itself to reproaches of  cynically putting its financial interests first. All the more  so since the Luandan regime, despite emerging victorious in the  election, is not distinguishing itself by an administration of  exemplary integrity. In the diplomatic dispatches from the  French Embassy, too, it is effectively made clear how those  close to -- sometimes even related to -- President dos Santos  are profiting from a war economy, especially by importing arms,  setting up so-called intermediate companies to which the state  addresses its orders and which, in the course of transactions,  take juicy commissions. "To spell it out clearly," sums up one  French source, "the war is yielding fat profits, whereas peace  would be dangerous."    Today, more than 80 percent of the income of the Angolan  state -- mainly its revenue through oil -- is spent on the war  effort. Admittedly, this war was "imposed" on the government by  the UNITA when, the day after its election defeat, the rebels  took up their arms again. However, since then, the warmongering  by the men in power has gained momentum, progressing from the  "massacre of la Toussaint" in 1992, when the supporters of Jonas  Savimbi were beaten to death in cold blood in Luanda, via the  terrible pogroms in January 1993 against the Bakongo, people  originating from around the border shared with Zaire, to the  acts of violence orchestrated last December against Lebanese,  Senegalese, and Mauritanian traders. The Angolan authorities  have taken every opportunity to unload their responsibility onto  scapegoats, at the cost of thousands of deaths. However, the  misery is caused not only by the war, but -- as one official  from the World Bank put it -- also by the government's  incompetence, which "is aggravating the difficulties facing the  Angolan people."    Today, these "difficulties" are such that in some areas of  Luanda, into which 3 million inhabitants are now crammed, people  are dying of hunger in the streets. According to the price  index drawn up by the highly official National Institute of  Statistics, inflation in the capital reached a level of nearly  700 percent in 1993. Meanwhile, the state, remaining impervious  to the suffering of the poorest citizens and open to all forms  of trade, is self-sufficient. For instance, the government  presented a new Audi car as a "gift" to each deputy of the  National Assembly, now dubbed the "auditorium." Moreover, the  "national" character of the Parliament is becoming the subject  of increasing caution, for UNITA controls -- or rather, is  rendering unsafe -- 70 percent of Angolan territory, ranging  from the south east to the north, via the central plateau.    Like the government with its oil wealth, largely invested  offshore, the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi are financing the  pursuit of the war thanks to diamonds excavated by Zaire, where  they have their home base. However, there too, what suffices  for the purchase of arms is in no way enough to enable them to  administer the "liberated areas." In Huambo, which has been the  site of UNITA headquarters since last March, the number of  children afflicted by vitamin deficiency is legion. In several  provinces, according to humanitarian sources, the level of acute  malnutrition is higher than 20 percent. And yet today, like  never before, the civil population is being held hostage and  humanitarian aid is being hijacked and used for blackmailing  purposes. In Luanda, in preparation for the visit to France by  the Angolan president, Michel Roussin, the minister of  development cooperation had stated that this aid had become "an  instrument of pressure." Like the call for arms?</p>

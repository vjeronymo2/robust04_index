			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Securiguard input aids Rentokil - Environmental group's organic growth of 14% disappoints analysts Rentokil more than doubled the profits of recently-acquired subsidiary Securiguard in the first half of 1994, but it disappointed the City with only 14 per cent growth in organic profits. The environmental and property services group's shares fell 11 1/2 p to 222p as it announced pre-tax profits for the period up 20 per cent to Pounds 80.6m (Pounds 67.1m). Securiguard contributed Pounds 4.4m, after subtracting Pounds 2m of interest costs for the Pounds 70.9m acquisition. However, Mr Clive Thompson, chief executive, was confident that Rentokil could continue to achieve its stated aim of 20 per cent higher profits a year without further acquisitions. Mr Thompson said Securiguard, the security and cleaning company, almost doubled operating profit margins from 3.7 per cent to 7 per cent. Rentokil has focused Securiguard on the higher value-added elements of its business, and cut back on head office costs, and some of the less profitable businesses. Restructuring of the security subsidiary cost Rentokil about Pounds 500,000 in the first half, but this was covered by the previous year's provisions. Turnover increased from Pounds 252.4m to Pounds 357m, but stripping out Pounds 92.9m from Securiguard, growth was subdued. The downturn in profits was exaggerated by a Pounds 900,000 loss on foreign exchange translation. In addition, turnover from the European division grew by only 2.9 per cent, as sales were hit by the continuing recession. European profits expanded from Pounds 18.8m to Pounds 20.4m. The Asia Pacific and African operations raised profits by Pounds 3m to Pounds 17.2m, but this progress was held back by a disappointing performance in Australia. Calmic's Australian business was hit when senior staff left to set up in competition. In North America, turnover doubled to Pounds 61m and profits increased to Pounds 7.5m (Pounds 5.2m). This figure included a first-time contribution from Securiguard. In the UK, profits grew by Pounds 8.1m to Pounds 34.7m, but about half of this increase was attributable to Securiguard. Rentokil increased its net cash reserves to Pounds 36.5m (Pounds 15.6m) and Mr Thompson said the group was aiming to add further acquisitions to its core businesses. Analysts expect Rentokil to beef up its newly-acquired security operations, which at present offer only limited geographical spread. Mr Thompson said the company would also consider acquisitions in its other businesses of pest control, healthcare and tropical plants. The dividend is increased by 20 per cent from 0.84p to 1.01p, tracking a similar advance in earnings per share from 4.39p to 5.3p. See Lex</p>

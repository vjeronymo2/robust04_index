			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Observer: A man of the people Popular he may be. But Brian Lara - the West Indies' record-breaking cricketer - might not be the favourite pin-up of trade unions in his home land. The reason is simple. Lara returns to Trinidad and Tobago today, a moment in the calendar which the country's perennially truculent trade unions had designated - along with three successive days - as 'days of resistance'. They called a general strike in protest at government plans to sack hundreds of workers from state-owned enterprises. But in a stroke of Machiavellian brilliance, the government has now determined that today shall be nationally recognised as a 'day of achievement'. Cresting the Lara-mania tidal wave now engulfing the country's 1.2m people, the government has clean-bowled the unions; schools are closed for half-day holidays and various civic jamborees are planned. How can you stage a strike when no one would have been working anyway?</p>

			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEW JET CURB SOUGHT AT VAN NUYS AIRPORT  </P> <P> The Van Nuys Airport Advisory Council voted Tuesday to urge Los Angeles city  officials to bar any new jets from being based at the airport. .  </P> <P> Members of the advisory group said they want the Board of Airport Commissioners  to enact the recommended moratorium to halt a decade-long trend at the airfield  of corporate jets displacing piston-engine craft favored by recreational  fliers.  </P> <P> The council members blamed jets for increasing airport noise and for squeezing  out many of the weekend fliers who formerly used the airport.  </P> <P> Airport officials say that since 1979, the number of jets based at the airport  rose from 18 to 93 and the number of piston-engine planes dropped from 1,333 to  771.  </P> <P> Business operators at the airport say they expect the proportion of jets to  continue to grow because renting and servicing jets is more profitable than  catering to owners of piston-engine craft.  </P></p>

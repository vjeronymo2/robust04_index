			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xu Jinzhang (5171 6855 4545)] </F>   [Text] Urumqi, 19 Jan (XINHUA) -- In a recent interview  with this reporter, Abulaidi Amudurexiti, acting chairman of the  Xinjiang regional government, and Pan Zhaomin, Xinjiang Military  District political commissar, said cheerfully that a new  situation in army-government unity, army-people unity, and unity  among the different nationalities has emerged in Xinjiang  because the soldiers and people in the region have respected one  another, supported one another, and worked side by side, with  the building of a stable and prosperous Xinjiang as their common  mission.    After recounting Xinjiang's achievements in economic  construction in other fields of work, Abulaidi Amudurexiti said:  The development and prosperity of Xinjiang is the product of  unity between soldiers and civilians, and unity among various  nationalities. The military units stationed in Xinjiang have  regarded assisting localities in invigorating their economy as  an important task in guaranteeing social stability and promoting  unity among nationalities. In recent years, officers and men of  the military units in Xinjiang have taken part in more than 210  key construction projects in various localities, assisted  localities in building more than 310 public facilities, taken  part in over 1,200 disaster rescue operations, planted more than  1 million trees on a voluntary basis, built more than 150 school  structures, and assisted more than 80,000 poor households in  areas where they are stationed in freeing themselves from  poverty. The officers and men have helped people of various  nationalities to dig more than 1,400 km of irrigation ditches,  thus expanding the irrigated areas by 1.4 million mu. Water  diversion canals, such as the "Canal of Army-People Unity" and  the "Canal of Love for the People," have been built in many  areas north and south of the Tianshan. The military units have  also voluntarily helped the masses sink more than 110 wells and  install over 40,000 meters of water pipes, thus solving the  problem of water supply for more than 120,000 herdsmen's  households and ending their long history of drinking unclean  water obtained from snow. The people of all nationalities in  Xinjiang will never forget the contributions of the soldiers,  who are their sons and brothers, in developing Xinjiang.    Pan Zhaomin said: The people of all nationalities in  Xinjiang regard the "Army as a great wall, and soldiers as their  relatives." Whenever a military unit has some important arduous  task to perform, the masses in the surrounding areas dispatch  young and able-bodied men to assist in transporting goods and  provisions. Despite a shortage of capital, the governments at  various levels have done their best to raise funds to help  military units solve problems of drinking water and electric  power, and other problems involving employment for the  dependents of officers and schooling for their children.  Commercial enterprises, supply and marketing departments, and  bookstores have frequently organized mobile service vehicles to  deliver goods to the military barracks. Counties, cities, and  agriculture-animal husbandry farms run by regiments have  established a system of army-people joint defense to help  military units conduct patrols and maintain stability along the  border areas. Throughout the autonomous region more than 3,100  household service centers have been set up to warmly help the  officers and men guarding the frontier, and to solve the  problems of dependents of servicemen and revolutionary martyrs.  Every road, every military barrack, every electric power  station, and every water diversion project along the border  defense area is imbued with the painstaking labor of the people  of all nationalities.</p>

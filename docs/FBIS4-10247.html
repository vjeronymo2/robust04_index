			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alejandro Varela] </F>   [Text] La Paz, 10 Apr (EFE) -- Fifteen days after  acknowledging his wrongdoings, announcing his retirement from  public life, and being politically "crucified" as a result of  alleged links to drug trafficking, former Bolivian President  Jaime Paz Zamora decided in the last few hours to break his  silence and to defend himself.    On 26 March, in a televised address to the nation and  flanked  by a crucifix, former theology student Paz Zamora acknowledged  "his mistakes, made in good faith" during his presidential  administration (1989-1993). In addition, he announced his  retirement from public life, and therefore, his decision to  withdraw from running for president in the 1997 elections.    However, yesterday Paz Zamora formally requested to make a  statement "as another citizen, without seeking protection in any  privileges whatsoever," to the parliamentary commission that has  proceeded to unmercifully question several fellow party members  who occupied high-ranking positions during his administration.    According to Paz Zamora, his only "sin" that has been proven  up to now is having cultivated a close and "naive" friendship  with an alleged drug trafficker who goes by the name of Isac,  surnamed Chavarria, and alias "Oso," whose habit is to  constantly bite and gently suck a rosary in public.    As result of that friendship, Paz Zamora's main apostles and  several leading members of the Movement of the Revolutionary  Left (MIR) were investigated and accused by the police of links  with drug trafficking and cross-examined by a parliamentary  commission.    All of the former public officials proceeded to defend  themselves firmly and some of them, such as Susana Seleme, Paz  Zamora's private secretary during his presidential term, even  denied on more than three occasions being involved in anything.  She even described herself as "the biggest victim of good faith  mistakes" committed by the former president.    On the other hand, this past Friday the Bolivian Interior  Ministry, apparently always well-advised by the U.S. Drug  Enforcement Administration (DEA), indicated its lack of solid  evidence in its accusations against the MIR during an appearance  before the parliamentary investigation commission this past  Friday.    During cross-examination by the parliamentary commission,  General Renato Lopez, head of the Special Front in the Struggle  Against Drug Trafficking (FELCN), and Prosecutor Leopoldo Ramos,  reluctantly admitted that their only evidence was based on  unsubstantiated accusations made by confessed drug trafficker  Carmelo "Meco" Dominguez, a former MIR activist arrested during  Paz Zamora's administration and sentenced to 12 years in prison.    Lopez and Ramos even accepted the possibility that they may  have to publicly apologize to some MIR members because some of  the accusations that were mysteriously leaked to the media now  seem not to have any support whatsoever.    Nevertheless, up until today, most commentators and  politicians in Bolivia agree in predicting the inevitable  political demise of the MIR and its leader, Paz Zamora.    Parliamentary Investigation Commission President Edil  Sandoval, has acknowledged Paz Zamora's request to be  cross-examined and has announced that the former president could  present his testimony this coming Tuesday. Based on the content  of the letter sent to Sandoval, Paz Zamora insinuates that he  would like to be cross- examined publicly in presence of the  media, as his fellow party members have been. Their respective  testimonies were broadcast daily and live by La Paz Radio  Panamericana.    However, the members of the parliamentary commission  summoned  a meeting for this Monday to decide if the cross-examination  will take place publicly or privately in honor of the former  president's investiture, which would be contrary to Paz Zamora's  request.</p>

			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AUTHORS' HEIRS THREATEN PULLOUT  </P> <P> The heirs of three of France's best-known 20th-Century authors and 55 other  writers threatened today to switch publishers if a corporate raider succeeded  in gaining control of the Gallimard publishing house.  </P> <P> The heirs and copyright holders of Nobel laureates Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert  Camus and Andre Gide made the threat in a statement also signed by Paris-based  Czechoslovak author Milan Kundera and best-selling novelist Marguerite Duras.  </P> <P> "If a financial or industrial group succeeds in gaining control of Gallimard,  thus jeopardizing its independence, we would immediately withdraw" from  Gallimard's list, they said.  </P> <P> Publishing sources said the authors were likely to find it extremely difficult  to pull out if Gallimard changed hands.  </P> <P> French media said construction group Bouygues had expressed interest in buying  shares in France's largest independent publisher since a bitter ownership feud  among four Gallimard children broke out in January.  </P> <P> Gallimard's highbrow list makes it the most sought-after jewel in French  publishing.  </P> <P> On Monday, a French court effectively blocked attempts by the publishing  house's chief executive, Antoine Gallimard, to create a new holding company to  protect the group against any outside raiders.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Muhammad al-Amin Khalifah, the speaker of the  Transitional National Assembly, has told our radio correspondent  that the Sudanese Government will not withdraw from the decision  it has issued about the British ambassador's departure from the  country within a period not exceeding two weeks. He added: We  have asked for the British ambassador's departure in an attempt  to improve relations between the two countries. It is for  Britain to nominate another person from its embassy to be acting  ambassador. He stressed that the matter was legitimate and does  occur in diplomatic relations. He pointed out that the British  Government's demand that the Sudanese Government should  reconsider its decision is a matter which is not legitimate in  these relations.    He also made reference to the visit of the Archbishop of  Canterbury to Sudan. He said that he considered the archbishop  as a VIP and he ought to have entered Sudan through the capital,  Khartoum, but regrettably he went to see the rebels and visited  the citizens who were under the control of the rebels.</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Management: And my spouse came along too - International companies increasingly find that employees are married to people who have their own job, career, and income which they don't want to leave behind. Bobby Meyer considers the implications It may not be the biggest constraint on their global expansion, yet a growing challenge for the personnel departments of international companies is how to accommodate the so-called 'trailing spouse'. One of the most common reasons for an employee's refusal of an overseas posting is the disruption caused to his or her partner. Not only is the spouse's career jeopardised, the dual income disappears, too. Failure to tackle these issues has significant implications for companies. There is the obvious headache of finding someone else to go in their place when executives turn down an international assignment - as one in three in Britain does, according to the consultancy Organisation Resources Counsellors. But there is also a financial impact. The Confederation of British Industry estimates that restricted mobility is costing UK companies as much as Pounds 500m in lost business opportunities a year. By 2000 an estimated 75 per cent of relocating executives will be involved in dual-career partnerships, and yet few companies give the issue the attention it deserves. ORC found that while almost three-quarters of a sample of American and European companies admitted to a dual-career relocation problem, few had plans to tackle it. Many companies still use policies developed in the 1970s and 1980s, with the result that little or no account is taken of the spouse's career. The spouse is seen as the back-up, expected to organise the move, entertain and be prepared to uproot the family again, often at short notice. Companies too often assume that the only remedy is to compensate for lost income, but there are other ways of dealing with the issue. Employers, for example, have easy access to training expertise and recruitment information, as well as their overseas networks. They can help spouses obtain work permits; ORC found that 42 per cent of European companies are already doing this, compared with 15 per cent of US companies. The companies can provide career counselling, which can be valuable preparation for a new life abroad. Too often the spouse is left to fight for help; that takes a strong personality, particularly when speaking out may jeopardise the partner's prospects. The more enlightened companies advise against a blanket approach. Realising that each case must be assessed on a highly individual basis, and that the conditions in the host country also need specific consideration, the international chemical company Monsanto in Brussels has developed what it calls a 'cafeteria approach'. Kristien Debougnoux, responsible for Expat Policies, explains: 'The intention is to eliminate as many barriers as possible to an international assignment for dual-career families.' Monsanto offers some compensation for loss of income to the trailing spouse (linked to the employee's salary level). It also tries to help spouses develop skills in their own field or a new endeavour. Perhaps most important of all, the spouse gets help re-entering the home job market when the assignment is over. Monsanto also helps indirectly as one of the corporate sponsors of Focus in Brussels, a networking and career resource centre operated by volunteer expatriate spouses. The oil company Shell, with 5,600 expatriate staff in 100 different countries - is currently analysing the outcome of a large survey commissioned from the independent organisation International Survey Research. A long, detailed questionnaire was sent to expatriates and their spouses in 35 countries, as well as to couples who had been or might be expatriates. The 70 per cent return rate was 'exceptional', says Mike Cloughley, special projects manager for human resources at Shell. Overall, Shell expatriates seem to be a happy bunch, with 88 per cent expressing satisfaction. The company's handling of expatriation, however, drew some criticism, with only 60 per cent saying they were satisfied. At this point there were some revealing comments from spouses. The dual-career problem and separation from school-age children were two of six main issues highlighted. For Cloughley, a big worry is that these two factors have emerged as the main reasons for restricted mobility among staff aged under 30 - the ones specifically recruited for their willingness to 'go anywhere, anytime'. Not everyone, though, thinks that the answer is to bow to UK expatriate needs. On future mobility trends, Alan Chester, operations director of Employment Conditions Abroad, suggests that 'mobility may have to come from parts of the world where people are still prepared to be mobile'. Meanwhile, the spouses themselves have not been idle. In cities such as Brussels, The Hague, Geneva and Paris, women have set up counselling and advisory services of their own. London, too, has a non-profit resource centre for international residents, Focus Information Services, run by a voluntary staff of expatriate wives. Focus runs a monthly job group and a series of seminars on interviewing techniques, CVs, cultural adjustment and other issues. Multinationals such as AT&amp;T and General Electric of the US provide sponsorship. Working Partners, co-ordinated from Belize by Gill Mackilligin, uses the United Nations network as a worldwide link for expatriate spouses. 'The talents and efforts of thousands of trained professional people are going to waste, often in countries where the very skills they possess are in desperately short supply,' she says. There is a strong emphasis on project and job creation and the training of local people, rather than taking jobs away from them. Working Partners began in 1990 as Spouses for Development and was adopted as a programme of the World Federation of United Nations Associations in November 1992. Pilot Working Partners programmes are already in operation in the UK, Switzerland, US and Belize and by 1995 it is hoped that expansion will cover a further 23 locations.

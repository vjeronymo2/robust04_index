			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Part one of an "exclusive" two-part interview with Shaykh </F> Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din, Chairman of the Higher Islamic  Shiite Council, in Lebanon by unidentified ETTELA'AT  correspondent; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [ETTELA'AT] Can you clarify  the effects of the imposed peace in the Middle East and the  negligent attitude of some governments toward confronting the  effects of this imposed war in the Middle East?    [Shams al-Din] [passage omitted] We have witnessed with  great  regret that the Zionist movement has been successful over the  Arabs and Muslims, though not in an actual war. This is also  the case regarding our society and ummah. I do not wish to use  unrealistic or anachronistic terms. In view of the fact that  the designs of the Zionist movement have been implemented in  Palestine, we can say that from this angle we have sustained  defeat. They have completely driven us out of Palestine.  Similarly, they have pushed us back in all areas, in our  position in the world; so at present the issue is not just  Palestine. Therefore, we are not pitted against a victorious  enemy but we are an ummah who have been beaten back.    However, defeat does not mean that we have lost all our  means  of defense. I stress that the ummah has not used all its  offensive resources but has merely suspended the use of its  means for defense. [passage omitted]    Our condition at present is such that the Arab plan has  failed and the Islamic plan has failed. The only place where  the Islamic program continues is the Islamic Republic of Iran,  which is also under an embargo that is being tightened in the  political, economic, and security fields. I fear that the  Zionists will drive a wedge thus paving the way for the  infiltration of the enemy's designs of our ranks.    After the Arabs went to Madrid, I studied the pre-Madrid  period in the light of the Fiqh and the shari'ah and I perceived  many secondary elements, which cannot be considered primary ones  in any way. First of all, I noticed that there were many  unfortunate divisions prevalent in many areas. One was a  division within the ummah at the political level with regard to  political beliefs. The other was a dichotomy of interests  between these forces and the ruling system. On this basis, we  observe that some systems were facing a split in their ranks.  [passage omitted]    In my opinion, we should study issues that are important and  of primary interest. We are facing problems ourselves, such as  the issue of the return of the government of Islam, victory of  Islam, the application of the Islamic shari'ah and so on. We  have the problem of Arab unity, of Pan-Arab nationalism, which  is pressing. There are certain issues which would make the  present systems appear illegal.    We have problems such as democracy and public freedoms;  these  are very widespread. From the late 1940's to the 1970's we  experienced policies of coups d'etat in Arab countries. Saudi  Arabia was the only exception in this regard. [passage omitted]    In principle, whatever is going on at present cannot be  considered a peace. This is also not a compromise, because we  define a compromise as when a person has a right to one of two  disputed things. In such a case, the one who has the most  relinquishes some of his rights for the sake of peace. What is  going on now is actually between the rightful owner and a thief.  This is not compromise, it is theft.    Thus, it is incorrect to term this a peace process when it  is  based on the retreat of one side. This is a retreat only on the  part of one side and that is the one which is the rightful  owner. What is going on now is for the purpose of legislating  future interests; since it has resulted from domination, this  form of legislation has no legal basis.    Western politicians say that this situation is a reality and  has evolved this way. We tell them that evil is also a reality  in this world, but should we bow down to it? We should resist  it instead. [passage omitted]    The fact is that the ummah's struggle against Zionism is not  a struggle of one generation at one particular time. The  Zionist plot belongs to a nation which has placed itself in the  thick of international interests; right from the outset, the  ummah should fight against it, and it should be considered a  struggle spanning many generations.    A long-term strategy should be formulated; part of this  strategy is to ignore governments, because this struggle does  not end with the death of a king or a president. It the battle  of all the ummah, whether it spans one generation or three  generations. We should also accept the fact that we will have  many losses on this path. This is because the plot that we have  to fight against is not confined to Palestine, but is a  worldwide plot.    This is one of the strategic errors--that is, the Arabs  thought they could combat Zionist plots in the short term. It  is for this reason that we state that the ummah should reassert  itself to combat the Zionist plot, as the ummah is not limited  to a single generation.</p>

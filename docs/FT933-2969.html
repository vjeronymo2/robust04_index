			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / People: Tunnelling out Jack Lemley, chief executive of Transmanche Link, the Anglo-French contractors building the Channel tunnel, will step down at the end of the year after the Pounds 8.4bn project is handed over to Eurotunnel, the publicly quoted tunnel operator. The post will be filled by Haro Bedelian from Balfour Beatty who became chief executive designate yesterday. Balfour Beatty is the construction arm of BICC and one of 10 British and French companies making up TML. Lemley, a US engineer, was appointed chief executive of Transmanche in 1989 as part of a series of management changes after relationships between Eurotunnel and its contractors first became strained. Over the following four years, Lemley was at the centre of negotiations between Eurotunnel and Transmanche over the contractors' claims for extra payments. In the process Lemley's relationship with Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's chief executive, is understood to have become increasingly difficult. In May, Joe Dwyer, Wimpey's chief executive, who had worked closely with Lemley, stood down as the British co-chairman of Transmanche and was succeeded by Neville Simms, Tarmac's chief executive. Finally, in July this year, Eurotunnel and the contractors announced an agreement to end their long conflict, setting a target date of December 10 for TML's handover of the project to Eurotunnel and paving the way for a phased opening of the tunnel next year.</p>

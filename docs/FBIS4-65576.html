			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial by Bo Stenstrom: "Austerity Even Under Lipponen </F> Government"]    [Text] Social Democratic Party [SDP] leader Lipponen spoke  sensibly about economic policy. Generally speaking, the next  government will have to pursue the same policy as the current  one, but that is scarcely what Lipponen's and Ehrnrooth's  listeners had been expecting, writes Bo Stenstrom.    Things went as many people had suspected they would -- on  the  same day that Social Democratic Party leader Paavo Lipponen and  mining consultant Casimir Ehrnrooth were speaking at the  People's Palace, the number of unemployed dropped by 30,000, and  had it not been for the farmers' and forest owners' MTK  [Agricultural Producers Association], there would have been no  devil to attack.    Excluding the attack on the MTK, the message by both  Lipponen  and Ehrnrooth seemed objective and responsible. But that was  scarcely what their listeners had been expecting.    It is true that Lipponen talked about speedy and selective  economic stimulation and rapid tax relief as a way of increasing  consumption. But he did not say what should be stimulated or by  how much.    It should be noted that the SDP leader favored an austere  finance policy during the next election period in order to get  the deficit in the national economy under control. And he said  that the public economy's share of the gross national product  was extremely high.    There will not be enough room for investments in such an  environment, Lipponen said. That is what Aho, Viinanen, Korkman,  Koroma, and others are in the habit of saying.    Is tax relief the answer?    Lipponen said quite rightly that it is not sensible to  postpone all tax relief until the economy improves -- an upswing  that, incidentally, will probably occur sooner than the current  indicators show. He also pointed out that there is no  possibility of major tax changes, but at the same time, he said  that we must look for opportunities to widen the tax base.    That sounds hopeful -- but wait until Lipponen, who may end  up as prime minister after the election, states specifically  what is going to be taxed or what is going to be subjected to  higher taxes and how much higher those taxes will be. That is  something he ought to be talking about in plenty of time before  the election.    When Ehrnrooth talks about the MTK and timber prices, he is  in the highest degree a party to the proceeding. It is not an  easy matter to raise timber prices, but it should also be  remembered that timber prices fell 40 percent before being  increased by 15 percent.    It is estimated that the export industry will earn about 2.5  billion markkas more thanks to the VAT [valued-added tax] reform  this summer, and in connection with both the decision on nuclear  power and that on the EU [European Union], the lumber industry  has clearly stated that if the right decisions are not made, it  will move abroad. And no one can guarantee the opposite no  matter what happens.    So there may be the sound of clinking glass in the house if  it accuses others of "blackmail."    Regardless of the MTK, more and more forest land is coming  to  be owned by someone other than farmers and MTK members. Many of  those owners are average supporters of the SDP and Lipponen.  Unlike the farmers, they cannot cut timber themselves and can  scarcely afford to sell their forest property at a loss.    Ehrnrooth was right about a lot of other things. The more  pressure and even the more unforeseeable international effects  we are exposed to (exchange rates and interest rates, for  example), the more important it is that there be continuity and  predictability in the economic policy over the long term.    It would be ridiculous to claim that the current government  ought to have continued the Blue-Red government's policy just  for the sake of continuity -- even beyond the first budget,  which it inherited -- after the bottom fell out completely.    On the other hand, there is much in Lipponen's and  Ehrnrooth's message to indicate that it should be possible to  form a government across the center line after the election. The  government should commit itself to a program extending into the  following election period and based on the labor market, so that  we do not squander the economic upswing through devastating  inflation.    If membership in the EU becomes a reality on the first of  next year, Lipponen knows as well as Aho or Salolainen that that  will put further pressure on the national economy.    If someone is likely to become prime minister next spring,  he  does not need to learn from Siberia as long as there are public  opinion polls. It remains to be seen whether the presidential  election tactics will be repeated in such a way that Lipponen  represents the indispensable prime minister approach while  others take care of painting the current government in dark  colors and building castles in the air for the future.</p>

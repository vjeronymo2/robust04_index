			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: Pinault considering stake in Fnac MR FRANCOIS Pinault, who heads Pinault-Printemps, the French retailing group, is considering taking a stake in Fnac, the books and music retail chain which is the target of a takeover bid. GMF, the mutual insurance group that controls Fnac, last week announced that it had given an option to acquire a majority stake to Altus Finance, part of the Credit Lyonnais banking group, and Compagnie Generale des Eaux (CGE), the utility company. Under the terms of the deal, Altus and CGE have an option (lasting until October 11) to buy 54.78 per cent of Fnac for FFr2,928 a share, or FFr1.3bn (Dollars 220.7m). However, the deal is still under scrutiny by the French stock market authorities. The COB, the stock market watchdog, said yesterday that it had not completed its assessment. Meanwhile, La Tribune Desfosses, the French financial daily, yesterday reported that Mr Pinault had met with representatives of Altus and CGE to discuss the Fnac situation. Mr Pierre Blayau, who recently took over from Mr Pinault as executive chairman of Pinault-Printemps, confirmed that Mr Pinault was interested in Fnac during an interview with yesterday's edition of Les Echos, another financial paper.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norwegian production forecast to grow more slowly NORWAY WILL set another record for crude oil and natural gas liquids production this year but growth will be much slower than that achieved in 1992, according to a report by Edinburgh-based analyst Wood Mackenzie. WoodMac forecasts that oil/ngl production will increase by about 3 per cent to a daily average of 2.28m barrels, following a 14 per cent surge in 1992 to a daily average of 2.22m barrels. The analyst predicts that production in the fourth quarter of this year will soar to about 2.5m barrels a day as five new fields are brought on stream. Last year the Norwegian share of total North Sea crude oil production reached 53 per cent, making it western Europe's biggest oil producer for the second year in a row, following 11 consecutive years of growth. Total North Sea output will rise to an all-time high of 4.38m b/d this year, the analyst forecasts, from 4.22m b/d in 1992. WoodMac says the net effect of bad weather in January and February, which hindered oil tanker loading operations, deferred production of about 7m barrels of oil from Norway's Statfjord, Gullfaks and Snorre fields. It forecasts that Norwegian production will advance to 2.39m b/d in April and retreat to an expected low of 2.06 b/d in June when scheduled maintenance work is under way. Maintenance shutdowns are likely to defer production of about 19m barrels of oil/ngl, compared with 26m barrels in 1992. WoodMac says a notable feature of 1993 will be a 50 per cent increase by the end of the year in Norway's ngl/condensate production, which will hit a record 150,000 b/d, when the Sleipner East, Loeke and Lille Frigg fields come on stream.</p>

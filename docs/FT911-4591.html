			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / PowerGen wins Pounds 200m of new business POWERGEN, the recently privatised generator, has increased its electricity sales turnover by 60 per cent after winning new business worth Pounds 200m from industrial and commercial customers. They include British Rail, Tesco, Kellogg, Cadbury Schweppes and British Gas. The generator's sales rose from Pounds 300m last July to Pounds 500m this month as the second round of annual negotiations between electricity suppliers and their large customers drew to a close. The company for some time has been actively courting customers taking more than 1MW of electricity, as they are free to choose their electricity supplier. It kept 90 per cent of its existing customers and now supplies 149 companies compared with 100 this time last year. Regional electricity companies said PowerGen's bargaining approach towards customers and suppliers had been aggressive. In most regions of England and Wales it is close to the maximum allowed market share, which ranges from 7.5 per cent to 12.5 per cent. PowerGen said it had not succeeded in increasing its market share in certain regions, notably those of Southern Electric and Eastern Electricity. The company plans to reduce its dependence on British Coal and to import about 10m tonnes of low-sulphur coal by 1994 to comply with new European Community law on sulphur dioxide emissions. Gladstone Dock at Liverpool, about 15 miles from the company's Fiddler's Ferry power station, is being upgraded to take 5m tonnes of coal, and some Pounds 14m has been spent upgrading the company's Kingsnorth terminal on the River Medway in Kent, where PowerGen has a power station. The terminal can handle 5m tonnes. The company is pursuing plans with National Power and Associated British Ports which will lead eventually to the expansion of the Humberside Immingham terminal.</p>

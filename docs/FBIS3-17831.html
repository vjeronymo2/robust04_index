			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs </F> by correspondent Zaiga Grinberga in Riga; for the "Pusdiena"  program--live]    [Excerpts] [Grinberga] [passage omitted] I think that,  nevertheless, today the agreements initialled between Latvia and  Russia on the withdrawal of the Russian Army must also be  touched upon because you will examine these agreements at  today's Cabinet of Ministers meeting. The Cabinet of Ministers  must then confirm them.    I think there still are, however, some ambiguities. Other  countries--some of them that have even congratulated Latvia on  such an outcome to the talks and are satisfied--at the same  time, are they satisfied? [passage omitted]    Mr. Birkavs, are these other countries, after all, aware of  how many troops will remain here and of what this process will  be like?    [Birkavs] Mrs. Grinberga, you immediately grab the bull by  the horns very strongly. [passage omitted] I would very much  like everyone to feel secure and stable about the future during  this heated time. Precisely during the present day, however,  our state's boat or our state's ship is being rocked quite  heavily in connection with the agreement between Russia and  Latvia. Moreover, it is being rocked in such a way that all the  values that we possess and that we have achieved and for which  we are striving may collapse.    We, of course, are very thoroughly evaluating each sentence  in the agreement. The agreement is the result of two years of  difficult talks, in which a compromise in one place gave an  opportunity to move forward at another place. The heart was  heavy before signing this agreement, but the agreement is a  guarantee. It is a guarantee for our future: that the troops  will definitely leave, that Skrunda will definitely be  eliminated, and that military pensioners will definitely be  controlled in our state. This is because one of the component  parts of the agreement are the lists of pensioners, of the  militarists; 22,000--that is a big number--but we will know them  all. At the present moment, we do not even know them all.    We will know exactly who those 599 military persons will be  who are to be located at the Skrunda facility. When we know all  those persons--in the near future we are forming an immigration  policy--then we will find much more easily the superfluous ones.  We will much more easily isolate them and much more easily  extradite them from the state. Therefore, we must very  thoroughly weigh in, but the movement toward signing the  agreement is absolutely necessary. I think that the attitude of  the world toward signing of the agreement is comparatively  unequivocal in principle; it is positive, because the world sees  that we are using a civilized method. [passage omitted]    [Grinberga] Is it, after all, really ethical to lay down in  such detail those social guarantees for the military people who  will be considered pensioners and will be considered retired.  These minute concerns that have been laid down in one of the  agreements, why is it necessary to do so in that much detail, to  do so very thoroughly?    [Birkavs] You see, in one of the agreements all the minute  concerns have been laid down that are being implemented until 31  August. After 31 August, both these minute and major concerns  will end for us because the troops, and their family members,  and the military persons who retired after this agreement was  concluded are being guaranteed definite rights until they leave.  That is those who retired after 28 January 1992; in fact, it is  from the moment when Yeltsin recognized the former USSR troops  as their troops. Until that moment that all the complex of  military persons leaves, they are being guaranteed definite  rights--comparatively minute, yes, but so it is. This is until  the agreement's ... [pauses] until the troops leave.    Another agreement relates to the stay in Latvia of military  persons, of retired military persons. Of course, if we would be  able to get rid of these retired military persons easily without  an agreement--and they would leave with the troops--this would  be an ideal version. I would be the most glad of all. This is  not possible, however; therefore, it is laid down in the  agreement that they cannot and never will obtain Latvian  citizenship under any conditions and that they must subjugate  themselves to the laws of Latvia.    They have those minute concerns for themselves, as you said,  to be allowed medical services, to visit the dentist, on general  grounds. So that their apartments will be warm--although the  apartments of Latvians, as they usually are, are cold--this has  been laid down in the agreement. So, neither more nor less is  given to them than to others, but these were the demands by the  Russian side. This is what they insisted on, as a result of  which we have arrived at the agreement that will rid us of them  after all.    [Grinberga] So, would you also please tell us with what  means  will the Skrunda radar station be dismantled--those  buildings--with what money?    [Birkavs] I think that--although hatred and anger against  Skrunda is so great that the radar station might collapse by  that alone--nevertheless, the U.S. Senate will decide on 15  April on allocating 10 million dollars in order to make use of  technical means for dismantling the Skrunda radar station.  Dismantling can begin, dismantling of the new radar station can  begin at the moment the agreement is signed. I have already  spoken with people about whether they would be ready to drive  there with tractors, although a tractor will not suffice.  Actually, the Skrunda radar station, the new one, must be  levelled to the ground. Also, the foundations must be blown up.  No kind of a temptation must remain there for Russia. If  foundations were to remain, then building the top--that big  one--could be done very quickly. Therefore, at that moment  when there will be nothing--neither the foundations nor the  top--we will be fully convinced that Russia will not make any  kind of investments for building a new radar station. They  will, evidently, invest that in Belarus, at Baranovichi.  [passage omitted]</p>

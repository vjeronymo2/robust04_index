			<p>BFN     [Text] NEW DELHI, 1 April -- India is far ahead of China  and Pakistan in making use of nuclear energy for peaceful  purposes and emerging as an advanced country in this field, Dr.  R. Chidambaram, Chairman, Department of Atomic Energy said here  today.    While China has (?two) operational nuclear power plants and  Pakistan only one, India has nine operational nuclear power  plants and generates about 1720 MW of power which is  approximately three per cent of the total power generation of  the country, Dr. Chidambaram said in an exclusive interview.    He said that the country had developed expertise in all  stages of the nuclear fuel cycle and had created indigenous  capabilities in designing construction and operation of nuclear  power plants, reprocessing of spent fuel, and manufacture of the  necessary sophisticated equipment.    Capabilities had been created right from exploration and  mining atomic minerals; preparation of high purity nuclear  materials, such as uranium, thorium, zirconium etc.; production  of fuel elements for reactors; production of heavy water and  health and safety instrumentation of nuclear waste management,  he said.    Dr. Chidambaram said that the prime objective of the atomic  energy programme was development, control and use of atomic  energy solely for peaceful purposes. These included generation  of electricity and development of nuclear applications in  research, agriculture, industry, medicine, and other areas.    To achieve this objective, efforts were initiated to build a  versatile infrastructure for research facilities, trained  scientific and technical manpower, raw material processing  centres and the know-how and capability to manufacture nuclear  components and electronic equipment to support the atomic energy  programme with a view to making India truly self-reliant, he  said.    As a result of these efforts, Dr. Chidambaram observed that  India had broken the super power monopoly in this field and the  country was today in a position to export research reactors and  heavy water, subject to international safeguards.    "Today, nine units of nuclear power plants are in operation  in the country with a total capacity of 1720 MW. The work in  respect of Rajasthan Atomic Power Projects Ill and IV, and a  unit of Kaiga Atomic Power Project in Karnataka, each unit of  220 MW, would be commissioned soon", Dr. Chidambaram informed.    He said that the Tarapur Atomic Power Station, Rajasthan  Atomic Power Station, Madras Atomic Power Station, Narora Atomic  Power Station and Unit I of Kakrapar Atomic Power Project were  presently operational. The second 220 MW unit of Kakrapar  Atomic Power Project is expected to achieve criticality shortly,  he added.    Dr. Chidambaram admitted that India's nuclear programme  target of generating 10,000 MW of power by the end of this  century had been slowed down due to a financial crunch.  However, he said that such a crisis was being faced by all  public sector units and the country's nuclear programme was no  exception.    The Nuclear Power Corporation was striving to increase its  internal resource generation. Today our nuclear power stations  could generate an internal surplus of about Rs. [rupees] 100  crore, but with the addition of Rajasthan and Karnataka units  our internal resource generation would touch almost Rs. 400  crore by 1997-98, he said.    Dr. Chidamabaram was of the view that at some stage going  public would be necessary, and that there was tremendous scope  for joint ventures in this field. Referring to low operating  performance of nuclear power plants, which is lower than  international standards, Dr. Chidambaram said that difficulties  were being faced in integrating the nuclear power stations with  the grid resulting in low operating performance. These problems  were, however, being sorted out.    Referring to the safety aspect of nuclear power plants, Dr.  Chidambaram said that the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, an  independent body, oversaw and regulated all activities to  enforce safety-related aspects of atomic power plants. "The  guidelines followed are in conformity with international  standards, such as those prescribed by the International  Commission on Radiological Protection," he asserted.    Dr. Chidambaram said that safety was incorporated in all  phases of a nuclear power project or activities starting right  from the selection of site. Safety, well engineered into the  system as per current international standards, was pursued in  fabrication of equipment, construction phases and maintained  during operation phase, with review by multi-tier committees at  different levels. Plans for emergency preparedness had also been  implemented, he said.    Recently, the standing committee on energy of the Lok Sabha  in its fourth report on "Nuclear Plan Safety and Spent Fuel  Management" which was placed in Parliament last month, has held  that the commitment of the Department of Atomic Energy to safety  was total. The committee found that care for protection of  environment was imbibed in the form of regular procedures for  site design and operations of all plants. It observed that the  Department of Atomic Energy adhered to site safety features,  including protection against earth quakes and associated  phenomena, extreme meteorological phenomena such as cyclones,  floods etc. and man-induced events such as aircraft crash, fire,  explosions, and toxic chemical handling.    The committee findings revealed that nuclear industry in the  country had established a satisfactory safety record. There  have been no fatalities caused by radiation, nor any sigificant  occupational radiation injuries of any kind detrimental to the  public or the environment, at any of the Indian nuclear  facilities.    The committee noted that India accorded top priority to  management of radioactive wastes right from the beginning of the  Indian nuclear programme.</p>

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Ultra-nationalists win seats in Romanian government Romania's left-wing minority government has given cabinet posts to two members of the country's leading ultra-nationalist party, in an attempt to boost its position in the country's hung parliament. It has appointed Mr Valeriu Tabara to the Agriculture Ministry and Mr Adrian Turicu to Communications. Both men are members of the Romanian National Unity Party, an anti-Hungarian and nationalist organisation based in Transylvania, Romania's ethnically mixed western province. The formal inclusion of the RNUP in the cabinet had long been expected. The party holds a pivotal 10 per cent of seats in the parliament. The ruling Party of Social Democracy, which includes many senior former Communists, has relied on the RNUP's support in parliament to stay in power since narrowly winning general elections in September 1992. Until now, the PSD had offered the RNUP junior ministerial and local government posts in return for its support. The latest move comes as the government is completing plans for a controversial mass privatisation programme which it hopes to present to parliament as soon as it reconvenes after the summer recess in two weeks. The RNUP had indicated it would oppose the programme and withdraw its support for the government unless given ministerial posts, diplomatic sources said. Pro-reform opposition parties said yesterday the move was a setback for democracy and risked increased inter-ethnic tension in the country, which has large ethnic Hungarian and gypsy minorities. Western diplomats and businessmen in Bucharest said the appointments were likely to damage further Romania's already poor image in the west. 'They have brought members of a neo-Nazi party into the government. This is terrible for us - it will only deter foreign investors and lenders even more,' one local businessman said. The two new ministers come from the RNUP's more technocratic wing. Mr Turicu comes from the state telecommunications company, while Mr Tabara is an MP and a university lecturer in agriculture. He replaces Mr Ioan Oancea, who has been attacked in the local press for alleged inefficiency and corruption.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDICINES AND SURGERY CAN AFFECT CHOLESTEROL TEST RESULTS  </P> <P> Question: My doctor told me my cholesterol was high, so he made me come back a  second time after putting me on a diet. The cholesterol count had dropped.  Could the diet have made such a change in my cholesterol after only a short  time?  </P> <P> Answer: There are a number of possible answers to the question you raise. The  change in diet may have been responsible for your lower cholesterol level, or  the laboratory may have provided inaccurate results on one or both occasions.  The chance of this happening would be greater if the two tests had been done by  different laboratories.  </P> <P> It is also possible that the the circumstances under which the blood sample was  drawn may have influenced the results. Certain medications or recent surgery,  for example, may affect cholesterol readings. Even the fact that a patient is  standing when a sample is drawn can affect the results.  </P> <P> Q: I have heard women who used an IUD say it is the best thing ever, and I've  heard other women say they tried them and they were horrible. Would you  recommend use of an IUD?  </P> <P> A: You really answer your own question. An intrauterine device (IUD) may be  good for some women and not good for others. It is not possible to make a  general recommendation for or against their use.  </P> <P> The fact is that about 6% of women in the United States -- or 2.7 million women  -- use IUD's, so they and their physicians must find them to be a satisfactory  means of birth control. However, there are also contraindications to their use,  including a history of pelvic inflammatory disease and severely painful  menstruation, among others.  </P> <P> Your question about recommending an IUD for a woman must be answered with  another question: Which woman? Your own physician will have to answer that in  your case.  </P></p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Electronic links across the Pacific: The prospects for co-operation in developing consumer products Amid the bright lights and the bustle of the Ginza in central Tokyo, there is a small gallery of Sony consumer products of the past intended to inspire confidence that Sony will be a company of the future. There is a quaint 1955 transistor radio and a sleek short-wave set from the 1970s; and an early if ungainly example of multi-media, a 1960 pocket radio with an old-style Seiko watch wedged in at the top. In spite of the mixed success on display at Sony, the spectacular growth of Japanese electronics companies over the past decade has given them a sense of certainty that the 2004 US presidential election campaign will be followed by a Chinese farmer using Japanese television technology, and that the world will listen to the next wave of popular music on portable, compatible, indefatigable Japanese equipment. It is this sense of certainty, and the profits from having mastered mass manufacturing techniques, that has fuelled the product development departments of Japan's large consumer electronics groups and spurred their drive into next-generation television technology a decade before their competitors had committed themselves to high definition television (HDTV). But now this sense of confidence is under assault. For the past few years, the consumer electronics industry as a whole has suffered from a dearth of new product ideas, and the Japanese companies have in general simply been adding knobs and apertures to existing equipment. Sales of televisions and video-cassette recorders in Japan have been falling since the final quarter of 1988, well before the economy began slowing. Financially, the companies are facing higher capital costs at home, and the two market leaders, Sony and Matsushita Electric Industrial, reported steep falls in profit this week. Sony reported a 44 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Y166bn; Matsushita, its main rival, saw profits fall 39 per cent to Y363bn. More important than the financial difficulties, the companies' confidence in their ability to judge consumer trends has also been seriously shaken. The future of HDTV remains unclear. Japanese television makers had started to market the machines even though programmes could only be received for a few hours a day. They have also been adversely affected by the decision of the European and US electronics industries to adopt different standards. For Sony, this has not been the only recent setback. The company, renowned for its nifty product ideas and marketing skills, has suffered the defeat of Betamax, its VCR format, in the face of a competing format, the VHS system, and more recently its Digital Audio Tape flopped for lack of music business support throughout the world. Such experiences have tarnished Sony's previously high reputation for predicting and even for creating new consumer demands. The company is looking dangerously vulnerable to a further marketing reversal. The group has promised to deliver its next international 'hit' later this year - a small, portable mini CD player which it hopes will be to the CD player what the Walkman was to the cassette tape recorder. But the Mini Disc has so far failed to capture the imagination of consumers, partly because it has been preceded by Philips's competing system of digital cassette tape recorders and partly because listeners who tossed out their old tapes for CDs are unwilling to change again. Like much of the Japanese industry, Sony is pinning its hopes on the embryonic multi-media technology, which combines video, photography, data, animation and sound. But, to the disappointment of Japanese executives, it is in the US, specifically in the computer industry, that the most attractive multi-media ideas are surfacing. Multi-media offers the prospect of bringing the vast information-storing and processing capabilities of computers to consumer entertainment products. The computer's intelligence that drives that capability - the software - is increasingly seen as the crucial spark that can rekindle consumer demand. Films on video can be made more exciting by providing people with a vast library to choose from, not at the video shop, but on screen. Or how about interactive films that can be edited and rearranged to satisfy the viewer's creative instinct? With technological developments and the right software the television can become as intelligent as the computer. And the electronic personal organisers now on the market may tempt otherwise reluctant consumers to buy, if they could call up video snippets of the latest Madonna concert or pictures of the family, or provide a fax and mobile phone system that could link them to a data bank providing details of just how many times Arsenal has beaten Liverpool at home. A CD player doesn't have to be just for music. A CD itself can store vast amounts of information - the last 10 issues of GQ, together with Moby Dick and other novels in their entirety, films and video games. A multi-media book could play all these different discs with all the information accessible at the touch of a key. Experimenting with multi-media has kept a growing number of American computer manufacturers busy, while Japanese companies have poured money into ultimately futile attempts to convince consumers that they want extra knobs on their VCRs. Apple, the computer group, has been working on what it calls a personal digital assistant that will act like a personal computer, mobile phone and fax combined. Microsoft, the computer software group headed by Bill Gates, has sponsored several multi-media conferences over the years and is trying to establish itself as the software supplier for multi-media products. Many small West Coast companies are experimenting with multi-media technology and churning out software that will drive the technology. The realisation that software will be the driving force behind the next generation of consumer products has led to moves by consumer electronics manufacturers into the world of American entertainment. Matsushita has bought MCA, the entertainment group, while Sony has bought Columbia Pictures. Philips, the Dutch group, has set up a multi-media software company in the US and has bought Whittle, a producer of educational programmes. These movie studio and recording label purchases have created extra uncertainty for the two main Japanese electronics companies, which are beginning to realise just how unpredictable the entertainment industry can be. The end-year results this week released by Sony, a company accustomed to steady if rapid growth, showed a 65.2 per cent fourth-quarter increase in revenue from films and a 15.8 per cent fall in music sales. But while Japanese manufacturers may not be able to define the immediate benefits of their entertainment purchases, they are increasingly confident that the software that runs computers offers just the extra bit of added value to consumer products needed to stimulate a sluggish market. And for that software as well, they need to go to the US. The trend is evident in the tie-up of Sony, Apple Computer and Motorola to develop multi-media products expected to find their way into the living-room later this decade. In part, these partnerships are about matching different technological skills, for example, Sony's expertise in audio visual products, Apple's software and computing skills, and Motorola's communications expertise, but they are also an attempt to pool resources in the search for a space in people's lifestyles that can be filled with electronic goods. The belief that every pocket should have a personal digital assistant has prompted alliances between AT&amp;T and Matsushita, NCR and Poqet, a subsidiary of Fujitsu, and Apple Computer and Sharp, which is now the leading producer of electronic personal organisers that can store and retrieve information. There are useful business applications for these products - for example, for pizza delivery companies and salesmen - but the manufacturers are particularly keen to succeed in the consumer market. They have yet to convince the average family that it really needs the present generation of pocket organisers. Sales of some products have, however, been somewhat disappointing in Japan, where Sony was confident that its pen-based palmtop system would be a hit after its release in 1990. The market is still flat even though the pen better suits the Japanese language, for which a keyboard is awkward. The partnerships also raise the possibility that makers in different countries will be able to agree on common specifications for their systems. It would be frustrating if you were able to use a personal organiser to call up the UK soccer results or the latest movements in the Nikkei stock market index while on a business trip to Bahrain, but you found that the local retrieval network was incompatible with your equipment. It is still too early to predict whether the US or Japan will take the lead in the partnerships, and in which areas the industry will develop. The tie-ups may herald a comeback for the US in the world of consumer electronics as Japanese groups becoming increasingly aware that they need to co-operate with international rivals especially in the software arena. Making the leap from the world of computers to the world of consumer entertainment will not be an easy one for American electronics groups either. They recognise the value of the manufacturing and mass-marketing skills of the Japanese consumer product manufacturers and the difficulty of entering a market in which they have little experience. Apple probably needs Sony just as much as Sony needs Apple. The real question for the international electronics industry may be not whether the Americans or Japanese or Europeans dominate the next-generation markets, but whether consumers want the electronics-based lifestyle that the industry would like them to have. One reason that urban Japanese tend not to carry electronic gadgets around with them is that there is a strong sense that life is high-tech enough at the moment. And it is not only Japanese consumers who decided that they preferred a watch on their wrist and not in their radio.</p>

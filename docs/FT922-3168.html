			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / House rejects US balanced budget move THE US House of Represen- tatives last night rejected the proposed constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget by the 1998 fiscal year. After two days of political debate, drama and intrigue, including another last-minute pitch for the amendment by President George Bush, the House voted by 280 votes to 153 in favour of the motion, ten votes short of the required two-thirds majority of the 435-member chamber. Under US procedures, a constitutional amendment may become law if passed by two-thirds majorities of both House and Senate and ratified by three-quarters of the legislatures of the 50 states. If it falls at the first hurdle, in this case the House, the Senate deliberation, which was to have been next week, becomes moot. Mr Bush had delayed his departure for the Earth Summit in Rio yesterday morning for last-minute lobbying for the amendment. He has never submitted a balanced budget as president and his conversion to the cause in recent weeks has generally been considered electorally motivated. His two rivals for the presidency, Governor Bill Clinton and Mr Ross Perot, both oppose the balanced budget amendment. Mr Perot called it yesterday 'an excuse not to do anything'. Its rejection will not help the president's faltering political standing. Nevertheless, it was the feeling of many in a beleaguered Congress that public disaffection would only be addressed by extreme measures designed to attack the Dollars 400bn budget deficit and the approximately Dollars 4 trillion (million million) national debt. The key motion was sponsored by Congressman Charles Stenholm, a conservative Democratic from Texas and the parallel motion in the Senate by Mr Paul Simon, the Illinois liberal Democrat. In the event, in the final vote last night the Democratic congressmen split 115-150 against the amendment, while all but two of the 166 Republicans voting supported it. Mr Stenholm's proposal would have required a balanced budget by fiscal 1998, and thereafter, unless three-fifths of both houses of congress voted in favour of a deficit. The amendment could be waived if the US was at war. The case for the amendment was that the country was squandering the future of its children. Much was made of the fact that Thomas Jefferson had first advocated a balanced budget amendment two centuries ago. Congressman Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana Democrat, calculated that each child born today inherited a Dollars 16,000 mortgage as his or her share of the national debt. Congressman Joseph Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat, proclaimed that 'if our generation cannot get it together, let's have an amendment that does'. While Mr Kennedy and Congressman Jim Moody, a Democrat from Wisconsin, warned that national indebtedness was 'mortgaging America to foreigners'. The mostly Democratic opposition was marshalled by Mr Leon Panetta, the Californian chairman of the budget committee. Mr Charles Schumer from New York said that if it was 'absurd' to have amendments abolishing crime and Aids, which it was, then the 'new panacea' to balance the budget was equally absurd. Congressman Mike Synar, Democrat from Oklahoma, likened it 'to putting garlic in the window to ward off vampires'.</p>

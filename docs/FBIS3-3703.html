This information was released at a symposium jointly  sponsored by China's State Administration of Industry and  Commerce and the United Nations Conference on Trade and  Development (UNCTD) in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, today.    The three-day international symposium is aimed at exchanging  views on the roles of competition policy and competition laws,  how to prevent monopolies which result from over-concentration  of economic sectors on the market and how to prevent abusing  favorable conditions on the market.    According to the symposium, since China enforced its  Anti-Unfair Competition Law at the end of last year, China has  scored progress in the development of a unified national market.    Various levels of the department of industry and commerce  are  taking measures to protect the legal rights and interests of  producers and consumers.    A high-ranking official of the State Administration of  Industry and Commerce said that his administration is willing to  cooperate with UNCTD and its counterparts in international  communities and jointly fulfill the international obligation  stipulated by "fair principle and regulations".    Officials of the Administration of Industry and Commerce  from  all over the country and experts from Britain and Germany  attended the symposium.</p>

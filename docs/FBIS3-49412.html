			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Bratislava City Council today discussed the  appeal issued by the Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny  Ostrov, as well as the question of to what extent it concerns  self-administration of the capital city of the Slovak Republic.  In the statement given today to the Press Agency of the Slovak  Republic, Bratislava Mayor Peter Kresanek believes, along with  members of the City Council, that sound reason, responsibility,  and the interests of all citizens of the Slovak Republic will  prevail.    The City Council appeals to mayors of the Association of  Towns and Villages of Zitny ostrov with a feeling of regret and  misgiving that, instead of taking a common approach in pushing  through self-administrative structures and interests of the  citizens-voters, they have chosen a path of unrealistic demands  that do not represent a real interest of the inhabitants of the  towns and villages of that region.    In the statement, Mayor Kresanek and members of the  Bratislava City Council, addressing their colleagues from the  Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny ostrov, call for  well-considered conduct and a fundamental reassessment of the  course they have taken up to now, which otherwise might lead to  raising nationalistic passions.</p>

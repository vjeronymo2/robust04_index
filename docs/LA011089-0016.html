			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DOCTOR GETS PROBATION IN POSING FOR EXPLICIT PHOTOS WITH GIRL, 6  </P> <P> An Oregon vascular surgeon was placed on three years probation, ordered to  perform 500 hours of community service and fined $5,000 Monday for taking  sexually explicit photographs of himself with the sleeping 6-year-old daughter  of friends he was visiting in Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Alan B. Haber also ordered Daniel J. Lindner, 33,  not to treat patients under the age of 16 and not to be alone with anyone under  18 without a responsible adult present during the probation period.  </P> <P> Lindner, of Portland, Ore., pleaded guilty last November to committing lewd and  lascivious acts with a child under the age of 14, a felony, during the October,  1986, visit. He entered the plea under an agreement with prosecutors that he  would receive no more than a year in jail.  </P> <P> The child's mother told Haber on Monday that she did not want Lindner to be  incarcerated. She said she thought that Lindner had suffered enough from  humiliation and from the suspension of his medical license by Oregon  authorities.  </P> <P> In sentencing Lindner, Haber said he considered the mother's wishes and took  into account the fact that there was no evidence that Lindner had touched the  child or harmed her. The judge also imposed a suspended 30-day jail sentence,  which Lindner can be ordered to serve if he does not prepare a plan for doing  the community service by a Feb. 24 deadline.  </P> <P> According to a probation officer's report, Lindner was visiting the family  while attending a medical conference in the Los Angeles area. Lindner told the  probation officer he drank one and a half bottles of wine on the night of the  incident, in which authorities said he photographed himself in sexually  explicit poses with the sleeping child.  </P> <P> Lindner was prosecuted after he took the film to a photo development service  that notified Portland police, authorities said. Lindner surrendered to Los  Angeles police in January, 1987, according to court records.  </P></p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Troubles mount for Tory council THE RESIGNATION of Mr David Weeks as leader of Westminster City Council comes as the council prepares for what is expected to be a highly critical report by the district auditor into the housing policies of the council's previous leader, Dame Shirley Porter. Mr Weeks's resignation was forced by fellow Conservative councillors following an accusation by Mr Mervin Montacute, the council's managing director, that he was using council facilities 'for party political purposes'. The district auditor's investigation followed allegations by Labour that the council had given homeless families temporary accommodation while council property in marginal wards was left vacant, in an attempt to manipulate the 1990 local election. The Audit Commission said the investigation, which started in November 1991, had taken longer than expected because other matters had come to light. Publication is not expected until October. The council believes that the resignation of Mr Weeks, who was deputy leader and chairman of the planning committee under Dame Shirley, marks the end of the last link with the era of the controversial housing policy. Dame Shirley resigned her seat on the council earlier this year. The dispute between Mr Weeks and Mr Montacute culminated in a raid by Mr Montacute on the offices of Mr Weeks and Mr Andrew Dismore, the leader of the opposition. In a letter to Mr Peter Bradley, Labour's deputy leader, Mr Montacute said: 'I had reasonable cause to suspect that council facilities in the leader's office were being used for party political purposes. Party political material was found there. The actual use of council facilities was not great, but the political documents were of significance.' In a subsequent letter to Mr Dismore, Mr Montacute confirmed that 'some of the documents were copies of fundraising letters. Only a small number of inappropriate documents were found. There is no evidence, for example, of a mass mailing for fundraising purposes.' Mr Montacute refuses to publish the letters, citing advice from the council solicitor. He also refuses to answer Labour questions on whether any of the letters were addressed to the council's own contractors.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Romel Manigat, senator elected during the contested  18 January 1993 elections and vice president of Bernard  Sansaricq's unofficial Senate office, said U.S. President Bill  Clinton is a sick person. This statement was made following the  Clinton administration's recent decision to suspend the visas of  all 18 January senators except Serge Gilles, general coordinator  of the Nationalistic Progressive Revolutionary Party of Haiti,  who has never participated in the meetings of his colleagues.    The U.S. authorities' decision was adopted in an attempt to  return those parliamentarians who support the military coupists  and who contributed to the installation of the de facto  government of Emile Jonassaint to their senses. Senators Bernard  Sansaricq, Eddy Dupiton, and Dejean Belizaire, who are well  known for their ultranationalism, reacted on 23 June to the U.S.  administration's decision to cancel their United States visas.</p>

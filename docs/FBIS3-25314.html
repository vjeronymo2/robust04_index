			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Words indistinct] because UN Special Representative  Alioune Blondin Beye has again moved for an information  blackout. This morning everyone was ready for the resumption of  the peace talks, which should now discuss the role of the UN  Angola Verification Mission-3, including a UN contingent of blue  beret forces.    The UN special representative's team was the last to arrive,  but it is already in Lusaka, and yesterday it met the leaders of  the government and National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] teams.    All this happens at a time when UNITA President Dr. Jonas  Malheiro Savimbi, who is also Armed Forces for the Liberation of  Angola [FALA] supreme commander, has expressed optimism and said  he is ready for a political solution to the Angolan conflict.  He expressed those views in interviews he granted to a  Portuguese television station and to Portugal's O PUBLICO  newspaper. UNITA said it favors a general cease-fire and asked  Luanda to also make political concessions.    In those interviews Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi rejected any  possibility that there could be a military resolution to the  Angolan conflict.</p>

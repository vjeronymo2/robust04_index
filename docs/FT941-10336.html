			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Rich given a heavier tax burden: Reaganomics' winners are paying for a more egalitarian system President Bill Clinton has wiped away Reaganomics. Estimates in this week's budget confirm that fiscal changes enacted last year will more than offset the impact of tax cuts for the wealthy during the 1980s. The federal tax system is now more egalitarian than in the late 1970s when Jimmy Carter occupied the White House. The two most important changes were the sharp increase in the marginal tax rate on high earners - to nearly 43 per cent against 28 per cent as recently as 1990 - and the big expansion of the earned-income tax credit (EITC), a kind of negative income tax that provides cash rebates for about 15m low-income working families. In a foreword to this year's budget, Mr Clinton drew attention to 'dramatic changes that had restored fairness to the tax code'. He emphasised once again that 80 per cent of the burden of last year's tax increases would be borne by the richest 1.2 per cent of families - those with annual incomes of Dollars 200,000 (Pounds 134,000) or more. Starting this April such families will be liable for tax increases averaging Dollars 23,500 a year, generating, it is hoped, an extra Dollars 33bn in federal revenue. Middle income families will face tax increases averaging a few hundred dollars a year. Families earning Dollars 30,000 or less will enjoy tax cuts. The independent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates federal taxes (income, payroll and excise) this year will absorb 27.7 per cent of the incomes of the richest 20 per cent of families, compared with 27.3 per cent in 1977 and less than 25 per cent at the height of Reaganomics in 1985. The bottom 20 per cent will pay 5.1 per cent of their incomes in tax compared with nearly 10 per cent in 1977. Thanks to the expansion of the EITC, the effective subsidy received by such families will be 10 times as large as in 1977, according to the CBO. The tax gyrations of the past 16 years have had relatively little impact on the bulk of middle income households. Such families did not benefit significantly from the Reagan tax cuts, nor have they suffered much from the Clinton tax increases. The new top tax rate of nearly 43 per cent on high earners reflects the combined impact of a new top income tax rate of 39.6 per cent, the phasing out of itemised deductions and the lifting of the previous ceiling on Medicare payroll taxes. (High earners also face state income taxes which in some cases will push the overall marginal tax rate above 50 per cent.) As the spike in the chart illustrates, the phasing out of the EITC subsidies as incomes rise will impose high effective marginal rates on many low-income families, creating potentially serious work disincentives. CBO calculations suggest a couple with two children earning Dollars 20,000-Dollars 25,000 a year could face a marginal tax rate of more than 49 per cent. This reflects the combined impact of income tax, payroll taxes and the loss of 21 cents of EITC payments for every dollar of additional earnings. Mr Clinton accelerated, but did not initiate, the shift toward a more progressive tax system - one that places a proportionately larger burden on the wealthy. In the 1990 budget accord President George Bush took an important step in raising the top tax rate from 28 per cent to 31 per cent and placing tougher curbs on itemised deductions and personal exemptions for wealthy families. The shift in the tax burden from poor to rich would have been even more pronounced but for the steadily increased reliance placed on social insurance taxes, which are less progressive than income taxes. They will account for about 37 per cent of federal revenue this year against 30 per cent in 1977. Senior officials are confident they can extract substantially more tax from America's wealthy families. However, some independent experts, such as Professor Martin Feldstein of Harvard University, argue the rich - who can afford the best tax lawyers - will report less taxable income, take more leisure and find other legal ways of avoiding the higher taxes. If this happens, the progressivity of the tax system could fall short of the theoretical calculations - and the federal deficit will not fall as rapidly as expected.</p>

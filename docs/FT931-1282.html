			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Cashing in at Reuters Reuters' ruminations about whether to distribute some of its Pounds 710m cash mountain to shareholders again arouses the suspicion that it may be running out of growth. If Reuters concludes its shareholders can use the cash more advantageously than it can, it would be tacitly admitting that future expansion was at least limited. This, though, would be a rather unkind interpretation of a commendable instinct. The temptation for companies with strong cash flows is to make acquisitions. The result has often been foolhardy diversification which has diluted returns. So far, Reuters has shown restraint. The company certainly plans modest purchases in related areas. It also lifted its capital expenditure last year by a quarter to almost Pounds 200m. Even so, Reuters is likely to continue throwing off surplus cash. As interest rates fall, it becomes more pressing to consider how to use it. The theory of distribution is fine. But the practicalities are fraught with complexity. A special dividend would be one option. The drawback is that shareholders would benefit to varying degrees depending on their tax position. Moreover, Reuters' shareholders have traditionally looked for capital appreciation, not yield. A share repurchase scheme may be preferable, despite the difficulty of coping with different regulatory and tax regimes in the UK and US. Several other companies, ranging from GEC to BT, face actual or incipient problems of surplus cash. It would be nice if Reuters could publish a solution on its wires.</p>

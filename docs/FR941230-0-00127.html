In addition, it will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Public Law No. 96&hyph;534 (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order No. 12778, Civil Justice Reform, and the required certification has been made to OMB.

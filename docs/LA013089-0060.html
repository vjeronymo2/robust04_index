			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PARENTS JOIN IN PROPOSAL;  </P> <P> ROLE SOUGHT FOR STUDENTS IN TEACHER CONTRACT TALKS  </P> <P> Students and parents from nine San Fernando Valley schools proposed Sunday that  high school student leaders sit in on contract negotiations between the Los  Angeles Unified School District and its teachers. The student-parent group,  frustrated at the drawn-out negotiations, also suggested that board members  bargain face to face with the teachers union.  </P> <P> "Having senior students sitting in will be a calming influence on the thousands  of kids" who have picketed and stayed out of classes, said parent Barry  Pollack. He referred to protests last week at a dozen high schools and three  junior high schools in the city.  </P> <P> In addition, the students' "mere presence will temper heated rhetoric and  encourage honesty and compromise" between the two sides, he said.  </P> <P> Pollack said that a letter with the recommendations, signed by himself and Todd  Cobin, the board's student representative, will be delivered today to Supt.  Leonard Britton, to Wayne Johnson, president of the United Teachers-Los  Angeles, and to board members. Pollack is running against school board  President Roberta Weintraub.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Student Opinions  </P> <P> Students should not only attend the negotiations but should also give their  opinions, said Cobin, who is student body president of Birmingham High School.  The students are not outsiders but rather "the keynote, the backbone of the  whole thing," he said. "The board and the teachers are supposed to be working  for the students."  </P> <P> Sunday's meeting in Sherman Oaks drew about 35 parents and students, many of  whom said the students were being used as pawns in the labor dispute.  </P> <P> The district and teachers union have negotiated for nearly a year. Teachers  have threated to withhold grades from the district, but they said that they  would give the fall term grades, due Friday, to students on unofficial report  cards.  </P> <P> Many students said they support teachers' demands for higher pay. And seniors,  in particular, said that they want their official grades filed with the  district because they need them for college admissions. Cobin called the  situation "academic child abuse."  </P> <P> To pressure the district, several students last week skipped homeroom, where  attendance is taken, because the district loses $15 a day in state aid for each  student absent.  </P> <P> Pollack, who has three children in public schools, said he drafted the letter  because "something's the matter when it takes 1,000 students walking out" to  call attention to a dispute. He said he had not been able to go to an open  house in more than a year because of the teachers' boycott of parent  conferences.  </P> <P> Amanda Walzer, a junior at Grant High School, said a student presence would  help ensure that the negotiating "is operating and reaching a quick  compromise." She said she boycotted homeroom last week because "our teachers  are worth more than they're getting."  </P> <P> Parents agreed that teachers are underpaid. "We've got to pay them like the  professionals they are," said Philip Reeder, who has two children at Sherman  Oaks Elementary School.  </P> <P> The letter, he said, might "shake the board up a little bit." He said that he  supported the students' protest because "I come from the '60s" and because the  protest was "really thought out, peaceful, controlled and the issue is of vital  importance."  </P></p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Concerto attacks share structure at Liberty CONCERTO Capital, the vehicle for South Africa's Myerson family, yesterday maintained the assault on Liberty when it used its 15 per cent stake in the fashion retailer to demand an extraordinary general meeting to vote on changes to the company's share structure. Liberty complied with the request, and a meeting will be held in the next four weeks. Concerto complained that Liberty's share structure, which involves ordinary and non-voting shares, is out of date. It wants each non-voting share to be split in half, and one half given voting rights. Ordinary shareholders would be compensated by a 1-for-2 bonus issue. Mr Brian Myerson said enfranchising non-voting shareholders would improve the shares' marketability and allow Liberty easier access to capital. 'The issue is that every shareholder should have a vote,' he said. But Mr John Pugh, Liberty's finance director, was initially dismissive of Mr Myerson's move. 'His whole thinking is dreadfully muddled. His proposals would introduce another level of shares and complicate our relatively simple structure,' he said. Both sides claim support from institutions, which hold 74 per cent of the non-voting shares. Mr Myerson refused to comment on whether Concerto would finally bid for Liberty, where the Stewart-Liberty family owns 35 per cent of the ordinary shares, and claims support from other family members with a further 15 per cent. 'Our ultimate objective is to increase value for all shareholders,' Mr Myerson said. If Concerto's proposals were accepted, its stake would be diluted to 13.4 per cent while the Stewart-Liberty holding would fall to 27 per cent. Concerto's holding is less affected by dilution because it owns 7.6 per cent of the non-voting shares.</p>

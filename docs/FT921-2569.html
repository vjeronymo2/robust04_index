			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Electronics giant may be stillborn: French plans for a 'competitive' conglomerate are faltering FRANCE'S controversial plans to create a giant electronics and nuclear energy conglomerate are running aground. The Socialist government unveiled the project in a blaze of optimism last December, when it described the plan as a way of giving French electronics the muscle to compete with such as Toshiba of Japan and Germany's Siemens. The idea was to merge the loss-making civil electronics businesses of state-owned Thomson, the defence and consumer electronics group, with the profitable CEA-Industrie, the public-sector nuclear fuel and plant producer. Today, the gloss is being rubbed off the project by scepticism from the opposition and complaints from the nuclear industry that it was never consulted over the plan. The senate, the conservative-dominated upper house of parliament, warned in a report last month that the plan was poorly prepared, the result of ideological dogma, and 'unlikely to see the light of day'. Officials close to the scheme warn that the merger may not be ready by the government's June deadline. Its main supporters are Mrs Edith Cresson, the prime minister, and her special adviser, Mr Abel Farnoux, who has brought an interventionist tone to her industrial policy. Mr Alain Gomez, chairman of Thomson, is right behind them - if only because he wants to separate Thomson's loss-making consumer electronics businesses from its profitable defence arm. The Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique (CEA), the holding group for the nuclear energy businesses concerned, has refrained from passing judgement in public. Mr Philippe Rouvillois, its chairman, has simply warned that the CEA expects to be reimbursed for the loss of the FFr400m (Pounds 40.85m) in dividends that it draws from its industrial subsidiaries - due to be hived off to the new company. Mr Jean-Claude Leny, chairman of Framatome, the CEA-controlled nuclear plant builder, is said to be deeply against the plan, because he does not want his cash reserves to be used to run down the FFr10bn of Thomson Consumer Electronics' debt. Others feel that their general strategies are in question. 'Our development projects are frozen, awaiting the public authorities' decision on the new group,' said Mr Alain Vidart, chairman of Cisi, a CEA computer services unit. In charge of co-ordinating the project is Mr Jean Syrota, chairman of Cogema, the CEA-owned nuclear fuel business. Mr Syrota has already shown, in his quiet way, that he is going to be no push-over for Mrs Cresson's planners. He has done nothing to separate the chairmanships of CEA and CEA-Industrie - the holding company for the commission's industrial activities - despite the fact that the government has issued a decree allowing him to take this first step to putting the project in place. He has also dragged his feet over producing a detailed study of the feasibility of the new structure by mid-February - as requested by Mrs Cresson. Instead, his report is understood to have been an extremely brief account of progress so far, emphasising that feasibility could not begin to be assessed until the businesses involved had been fully evaluated. This is now being done by banks called in by the government to arbitrate. Not surprisingly, Thomson appears to value itself more highly than the banks do. The final figures cannot be decided until Thomson's 1991 results - believed by analysts to show another heavy loss - are published, in several weeks time. By then, the results of next Sunday's regional elections will be out. These are likely to be another big blow to the government's confidence and could hasten a general election. Clearly, a change of government would throw doubt over the whole project.</p>

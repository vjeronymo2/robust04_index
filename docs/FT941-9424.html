			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Arts: The Royal Academy plans a feast of Old Masters The Royal Academy is getting back to basics with a vengeance; its 1994-95 programme, announced yesterday, is a feast of Old Master art. It starts in March with Goya, concentrating on his small paintings; picks up steam in September with a major exhibition of 18th century Venetian art, packed with Tiepolos, Canalettos, Guardis and Canovas, and continues a month later with The Painted Page, illustrations from Italian Renaissance books and manuscripts; and reaches its apogee next January with the first major Poussin show for decades, with over 90 paintings by the 17th century French artist. Tucked in between are displays of art from late 19th century Belgium; the Summer Show; and in February 1995 an architectural exhibition devoted to Lord Burlington and the Palladian style. It is chance rather than design which has eliminated the modern from the programme. The RA is on something of a high at the moment, with a small, but unexpected, Pounds 150,000 surplus on its 1993-94 operations. But it is finding it harder to get sponsors, and even the Goya show lacks a backer. Its corporate membership has fallen from 161 to 141 but this shortfall has been made good by signing up 5,000 more Friends. With 68,000 in the club the RA is third in the world, (behind the Los Angeles County Museum and the Metropolitan Museum, New York), in the size of its Friends organisation. The recession also hit the Summer Show, with visitors down 10 per cent at 135,501, and the value of art sold, at Pounds 1m, is nearly 50 per cent lower than the 1990 peak.</p>

The meeting's main objectives are to  convey the guidelines set by the national meeting on economic  work and the ninth plenary session of the ninth provincial party  committee and to assign economic tasks for this year. Present  at this morning's session were: Provincial Governor Wu  Guanzheng; Vice Governors Shu Shengyou, Zhou Zheping, Zheng  Liangyu, and Zhang Yunchuan; assistants to the governor Jiang  Zhongping and Sun Yonghe; and Secretary General Zhu Yingpei.  The morning session was presided over by Huang Zhiquan. Shu  Shengyou briefed the participants on the guidelines laid by the  national meeting on economic work and delivered a speech.    In his speech, Shu Shengyou first briefed the participants  on  the current economic situation and the main economic tasks to be  carried out this year. He said: 1993 is a year in which the  people of this province carried out in depth the guidelines of  the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee, deepened the ongoing reform,  sped up development, and achieved great success in economic and  other social undertakings.    Last year saw the widest margin of increase in major  economic  indexes ever achieved by the province since the beginning of  reform and opening up. What is more, such growth was achieved  on the basis of the high growth registered over the past  consecutive years. The year 1994 will be an important year in  which this province is to maintain the momentum of sustained,  rapid, and healthy development as well as a crucial year in  which we are to expedite reform aimed at establishing a  socialist market economy.    This year, the guiding philosophy of economic work in the  province is to uphold Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic  line as the guide; to conscientiously implement the guidelines  laid by the 14th CPC National Congress, the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and the ninth plenary  session of the ninth provincial party committee; to  comprehensively expedite all the major reforms finalized by the  central authorities; to appropriately handle the relationship  between reform, development, and social stability; and to thus  ensure a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the  province's economy while vigorously improving economic returns  and optimizing the production structure and strive for general  progress in all social undertakings.    Shu Shengyou pointed out: We must strive for progress on all  fronts while seeking breakthroughs in certain key aspects, and  we must make up our minds to achieve victory in the most  difficult aspects of reform. He said: This year, our main  tasks in reform are to speed up the establishment of a modern  enterprise system, with a focus on the program to start pilot  projects in one aspect and to strive for development in two  others. With the reform of the national financial and taxation,  banking, planning, and investment systems as a starting point,  we are to push forward the reform of the macroeconomic  regulation and control system and to expedite the transformation  of government functions.    We are to vigorously develop a market of production  elements,  further nurture the market network, appropriately introduce all  the supporting reforms -- in particular step up the reform of  the social security system -- actively develop the individual  and private economic sector, modify the ownership structure, do  a good job in the reform of foreign exchange and foreign trade  systems according to the state's centralized plan, further  expand the process of opening up to the outside world, carry out  in depth the reform of the rural economic structure, and  establish a rural market economic operational mechanism full of  vigor and vitality, among others. [passage omitted]    Shu Shengyou said: It is necessary to vigorously explore the  urban and rural markets and make special efforts to develop and  perfect the market system. It is necessary to speed up reform  of circulation structure, invigorate the state-owned commodity  circulation sector, give rein to the individual and private  economic sector in the area of commodity circulation, and, in  particular, encourage peasants to play a part in commodity  circulation.    Shu Shengyou noted that it is necessary to do a really good  job in finance and taxation, make every effort to increase  financial revenue, pay attention to exploring new sources of  taxes, further intensify control over tax collection, keep  financial expenditures under strict control, improve budgetary  management, and intensify the regulatory function of budgets.    Shu Shengyou demanded that the relations between reform,  development, and stability be properly handled and that  appropriate arrangements be made to keep up the people's  standard of living. It is necessary to carefully and  meticulously map out a plan before introducing measures  regarding price reform and to make every effort to keep the  margin of price increases below the level as set in the plan.  Governments at all levels and departments concerned must  properly keep the prices of rice, foodstuffs, and fuel under  control, with a view to pacifying the public and maintaining  social stability.

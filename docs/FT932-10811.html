			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / French interest rates cut again THE Bank of France yesterday reduced its key interest rates for the fifth time since the centre-right government took power in the March parliamentary elections, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. The cuts, which brought the intervention rate down from 8.25 per cent to 8 per cent and the 5-to-10 day short-term lending facility from 9.25 per cent to 9 per cent, had been widely anticipated by the markets because of the franc's recent resilience against the German D-mark. Yesterday's cuts also illustrate the growing confidence of the French authorities, which have previously tended to wait for the Bundesbank to announce cuts in German rates before trimming French rates for fear of renewing pressure on the franc in foreign exchange markets. However, the Bank of France made its announcement early yesterday without waiting for the outcome of the Bundesbank's fortnightly meeting. The German authorities eventually decided not to cut interest rates. Both Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, and Mr Edmond Alphandery, finance minister, have made it clear that French rates should fall further to alleviate the pressure on the economy. Yesterday's cuts came at the end of a week of gloomy economic news, including an official business survey reporting a deterioration in confidence since the start of the year.</p>

Vitruk told the president that at the Council of Europe's  request prompted by Russia's intention to apply for a full  membership in this organization, he was going to deliver on  February 25 a report on the new Russian Constitution to experts  of the European Commission. This commission, to which Vitruk is  Russia's permanent representative, had carried out an  examination of the draft Russian basic law. When speaking to  the president, Vitruk commented, specifically, on the proposed  report's provisions illustrating the role played by the  Constitutional Court in implementing the principles of  constitutionalism, separation of powers, federalism, protection  of human rights and liberties.    The president and the Constitutional Court acting chief also  dwelt upon a draft law "On the Constitutional Court of the  Russian Federation" worked out by constitutional judges and  submitted to the State Duma as a legislative initiative. Vitruk  informed Yeltsin about preliminary consultations on the draft  law with Russia's Supreme Court, the Supreme Arbitration Court,  the prosecutor general, judges of various constitutional courts,  Russian and foreign scholars and lawyers. He stressed that at  the moment, the Constitutional Court was thoroughly examining  responses to the bill provided by the presidential staff's state  and legal directorate and by the Duma committee for legislation  and court reform. The scientific and consultative council under  the Constitutional Court is to gather in an enlarged meeting to  discuss the draft law "On the Constitutional Court of the  Russian Federation".    In his turn, Yeltsin assured Vitruk that the Russian  Constitutional Court and other federal courts would be guarded  properly. He pledged the presidential decree of October 7,  1993, on the Constitutional Court in the part of setting up a  department for security of supreme judicial bodies would be  fulfilled in full. The security service will be supervised by  the federal counterintelligence service, a Constitutional Court  spokesman told TASS.</p>

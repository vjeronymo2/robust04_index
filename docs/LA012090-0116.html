			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SIMMONS CLOSES IN ON 3,000 POINTS  </P> <P> Everyone likes Lionel.  </P> <P> Lionel Simmons, who started the college basketball season as a probable lottery  pick in the next NBA draft and has done nothing since to lower his stock, has  admirers everywhere.  </P> <P> The people at La Salle know they would never have gotten out of the local  shadow of Villanova and Temple, on to network television, and into the homes of  other blue-chip recruits without the four-year heroics of Simmons, a 6-foot-7  senior forward who is on pace to become only the fifth player in NCAA history  to score 3,000 career points.  </P> <P> The people in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, a lesser-known league on  the East Coast, are ecstatic with the attention Simmons and La Salle are  getting. Baltimore's Loyola might not have joined the MAAC last year were it  not for the residual benefits of Simmons' high profile, but the Greyhounds  could have second thoughts after playing the No. 17-ranked Explorers next  Monday at the Philadelphia Civic Center.  </P> <P> The people of Southwark Plaza, a mean streets housing project in south  Philadelphia, revere Simmons as a folk hero. Employees of the Philadelphia  Housing Authority honored him before last month's win over Villanova, just for  getting up and out of the neighborhood.  </P> <P> "Not too many people go down there," teammate Doug Overton said. "We play all  over the city in the summer, but that's one place I've never played."  </P> <P> The people on opposing teams respect Simmons. Sure, Digger Phelps is a public  relations genius, but the Notre Dame coach didn't have to do what he did last  week, when Simmons became La Salle's all-time leading scorer in an 86-78 win  over the Irish. When the announcement was made and no one from La Salle went to  Simmons, Phelps grabbed the game ball, handed it to him and shook his hand.  </P> <P> The people in the media like him, too. Last Wednesday, Simmons could read about  himself in USA Today and Sports Illustrated. Simmons is a 21-year-old criminal  justice major who's 12 credits away from a college degree, and he enjoys  recounting his Horatio Alger story to anyone with a notepad or mini-cam.  </P> <P> "I've worked hard to get the attention," Simmons said without a hint of  braggadocio. "This is fun, and I'm enjoying it."  </P> <P> The circumstances surrounding Simmons' rise out of the ghetto and into the  spotlight obviously endear him to people. He overcame an environment that put  two brothers in prison, and plenty of doubters, despite being one of the  premier players in one of the nation's great basketball cities.  </P> <P> "I thought I was ready for a Top 20-type team coming out of high school, but  those coaches didn't think I was ready," Simmons said. "I was considering  Temple, but they weren't sure I could play inside for them."  </P> <P> Simmons can play for anyone in the country, but even La Salle Coach Tom  "Speedy" Morris sounds as amazed as everyone else when it comes to discussing  his impact.  </P> <P> "No one thought Lionel would end up being this big," Morris said. "I coached  against him when he was a sophomore in high school and you could see then the  kid had talent and worked hard, but no one could envision what he's  accomplished in four years here."  </P> <P> The stars of Morris and Simmons were aligned in the spring of 1986, when  Morris, who had powerhouses at Roman Catholic High in the 1970s, jumped from  the La Salle women's program to the men's.  </P> <P> Simmons watched the Big Five rivalries among La Salle, Penn, St. Joseph's,  Temple and Villanova in the Palestra, and let it be known he was going to stay  home to play his college basketball. A few weeks after Morris became the La  Salle coach, Simmons signed with the Explorers.  </P> <P> As a senior at South Philadelphia High, Simmons and current teammate Bobby  Johnson won a city public schools championship. The year before, they were  beaten out for the title by Murrell Dobbins Tech, which had the Loyola  Marymount combination of Bo Kimble and Hank Gathers and a sophomore point  guard, Overton, who is now La Salle's second-best player.  </P> <P> A Dobbins classmate of Overton's, Larry Stewart, is now Coppin State's best  inside player.  </P> <P> Simmons was proficient at all phases of the game but spectacular at none, and  his main asset has always been a serious work ethic. If Simmons had a weakness  when he came to La Salle, it was a lack of polish away from the basket. In his  first two seasons, he was 4-for-14 from three-point range. This season, he's  14-for-23, 60.9 percent.  </P> <P> "Very talented people tend to let their athletic ability take them as far as it  will," Simmons said. "I don't think that's ever been the case with me. I've  never been the type to just show up and think that everything is going to go  well on its own."  </P> <P> Simmons was the MAAC Rookie of the Year in 1986-87, when the Explorers lost in  the first round of the conference tournament but went on to the final of the  National Invitation Tournament.  </P> <P> La Salle since has lost one MAAC game and earned two NCAA tournament berths,  and Simmons has improved to the level where last season he averaged 28.4 points  and 11.4 rebounds, third and fifth in the nation, respectively. He's shooting  over 49 percent for his career, and Morris said Simmons could easily average 40  points if they weren't interested in the team.  </P> <P> Simmons has scored in double figures in 94 straight games, and Morris stressed  that he will play just as hard against Loyola Monday as he did in a Dec. 2 date  at DePaul. That was La Salle's first game ever on network television, and  Simmons delivered 26 points and 14 rebounds in an 83-62 rout.  </P> <P> "The remarkable thing about Lionel is that he does it against all opposition,"  Morris said. "He's the most consistent player I know. People have tried  everything to stop him, and I haven't seen much work."  </P> <P> Two years ago, when he was in the third of his four seasons at Penn, Loyola  Coach Tom Schneider worked a five-point victory over the Explorers.  </P> <P> "We did a great job of holding him to 27 points," Schneider said. "We didn't do  anything special on Lionel, we were just fortunate that we played well and they  shot poorly. He gets the quietest points I've ever seen from anyone. Lionel  doesn't excite the crowd or do anything fancy, but from a coach's standpoint,  he's beautiful to watch."  </P></p>

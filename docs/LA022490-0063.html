			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRIVER WHO KILLED 27 GETS 16-YEAR TERM;  </P> <P> DRUNKENNESS: DEFENSE ATTORNEYS' PLAN FOR PROBATION IS REJECTED BY KENTUCKY  JUDGE.  </P> <P> A man convicted of killing 27 people in the nation's worst drunk-driving  accident was sentenced Friday to 16 years in prison.  </P> <P> Carroll County Circuit Judge Charles Satterwhite denied a defense motion to  place Larry Mahoney on probation, and instead imposed the sentence recommended  by the jury that convicted the 36-year-old chemical-plant worker Dec. 21.  </P> <P> Satterwhite said the community would not stand for probation and that  punishment must be strong for such a serious crime.  </P> <P> One survivor of the crash, 18-year-old Tammy Darnell, said Mahoney should have  been sent to prison for life.  </P> <P> "Sixteen years does not take the place of the friends I lost," she said.  </P> <P> Mahoney was driving the wrong direction on Interstate 71 on May 14, 1988, when  he crashed into the front of a school bus packed with teen-agers on a church  outing. Twenty-four teen-agers and three adults died in the fiery crash.  </P> <P> Mahoney was convicted of 27 counts each of second-degree manslaughter and  first-degree wanton endangerment, 12 counts of first-degree assault, 14 of  second-degree wanton endangerment and one of drunk driving.  </P> <P> The recommended sentence totaled 611 years, but the jury said the terms should  run concurrently. That effectively gave Mahoney 16 years. He is classified as a  violent offender under Kentucky law and must serve at least half of his  sentence before being considered for parole.  </P> <P> Defense attorney William Summers, one of Mahoney's three attorneys, urged  Satterwhite to make something positive out of the tragedy. The defense  recommended a probation plan under which Mahoney would have lectured to  schoolchildren about the dangers of drunk driving, served volunteer time in  hospital emergency wards, and spent one year in a work-release program.  </P> <P> "Judge, we must do as much good with this as we possibly can. His punishment  has already been death. He already has been given a life sentence," Summers  said, referring to Mahoney's suffering since the crash.  </P> <P> Prosecutor Paul Richwalsky Jr. of the state attorney general's office opposed  probation.  </P> <P> "He alone is responsible. He alone brought us to this place today," Richwalsky  said. "Regardless of statements the defense would make, it's time for  punishment."  </P> <P> Russell Baldani, another of Mahoney's attorneys, had said earlier that  Satterwhite's decision would be appealed.  </P> <P> During testimony, jurors learned that Mahoney was upset over financial problems  brought on by expensive medical bills for his daughter, who suffers from a  spinal birth defect. He spent most of the day of the crash visiting friends and  drinking beer at several taverns, according to testimony.  </P> <P> He testified that he only occasionally drank beer and abhorred hard liquor. He  said he did not remember drinking hard liquor at a party later that evening.  </P> <P> He said he had no recollection of getting into his pickup and driving the wrong  way on the interstate.  </P> <P> The collision punctured the gas tank of the bus, sending a stream of flaming  gasoline into the passenger compartment.  </P> <P> The 27 deaths were attributed to smoke inhalation, but Mahoney's attorneys  contended that toxic smoke emitted from the plastic seats poisoned the  passengers.  </P> <P> When Mahoney took the stand, he apologized for the tragedy.  </P> <P> Richwalsky said earlier in the week that he did not expect Friday's hearing to  be the last of the Mahoney case.  </P> <P> "It's not over and done with," he said. "I'm sure there will be an appeal and  so we change gears and go into another arena."  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD CUP SOCCER;  </P> <P> U.S. FALLS TO COSTA RICA, 1-0, IN QUALIFYING OPENER  </P> <P> The United States, considered a favorite to qualify for its first World Cup in  39 years, lost to Costa Rica, 1-0, Sunday in its opening match of final-round  qualifying.  </P> <P> Forward Gilberto Rhoden scored the game's only goal at 15 minutes of the first  half. Rhoden deflected a wide shot by teammate Evaristo Coronado into the net.  </P> <P> The United States, eliminated by Costa Rica in 1986 World Cup qualifying, plays  host to the Costa Ricans April 30 at Fenton, Mo.  </P> <P> The United States' best chance to tie came with nine minutes remaining in the  first half, but Costa Rican goalkeeper Luis Gabelo Conejo lunged high to his  right to make the save.  </P> <P> Coronado, who drew a yellow card for rough play, now has two yellow cards in  World Cup qualifying. He received an automatic suspension from the April 30  game.  </P> <P> "It was a very tough game," Rhoden said. "But we prepared ourselves mentally  and things came out really well."  </P> <P> Costa Rica leads the group with a 2-1 record and four points. Guatemala is 1-1  with two points. El Salvador and Trinidad-Tobago have not played yet in the  five country round-robin qualifying. The top two teams make the 24-nation  finals in Italy in 1990.  </P> <P> The United States was rated the favorite after Mexico and Canada were  eliminated. Guatemala beat Canada last fall and Mexico was expelled after using  over-age players in qualifying for the world under-20 championship.  </P></p>

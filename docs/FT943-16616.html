			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / OECD set to slam Pergau arms link The British government's use of an offer of Pounds 234m worth of aid to Malaysia to help build the Pergau dam is expected to be criticised by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development when it publishes a long-delayed report tomorrow. The report is expected to be broadly complimentary about the general conduct of British aid policy. But it is thought to be critical about the way that aid was linked to a defence deal in the case of the Pergau dam project. The OECD's criticisms will come when the political controversy over Britain's aid programme for the dam is set to re-open. The Commons foreign affairs committee is due to publish a report into the Pergau project in a few weeks. It is expected to be critical of decisions taken by Baroness Thatcher's government in the late 1980s. Later in the year the High Court will decide whether to issue a judicial review of the decision by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, to proceed with the aid deal in 1991. If the High Court issued a review it could order a halt to the bulk of the Pounds 234m of payments to the Malaysian government. The OECD's report is being published by the organisation's development assistance committee following an annual review of Britain's aid programme by a team of Finnish and Belgian examiners. The OECD has been criticised for delaying the report, which was completed in draft form in March. OECD officials have blamed the delay on production difficulties. In discussing Britain's involvement in Malaysia the committee is thought to have expressed unanimous support for the principle that all aid be subjected to the full standards of normal assessment and that 'aid quality should predominate' in decisions by individual member states. OECD examiners have taken evidence from British officials at the Overseas Development Administration, which manages Britain's aid programme. Civil servants objected to the Pergau project on economic grounds but were overruled by ministers. The government changed its aid and trade rules last year. The aid grant offer to Malaysia was the largest ever provided for a single scheme under the government's aid and trade provision.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Observer: Unavoidable One obvious reason why John Major should call the general election on April 9 is that Margaret Thatcher will be abroad for the last week of the campaign. Conservative Central Office and Major have spent many hours agonising over what role she should play, aware of the explosive potential of any disloyalty, intentional or otherwise, from the former prime minister. The role she has now agreed, after several meetings with John Major, is limited, given her usual appetite for punishing itineraries. Aides say she will be campaigning for friends in marginal constituencies - helping Michael Forsyth, the deeply Thatcherite Scottish Office minister, retain his precariously unsafe Stirling seat, is probably high on her list. An appearance at a Tory rally with the prime minister is also promised.

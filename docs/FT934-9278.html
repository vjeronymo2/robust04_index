			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: BSI sought 'new breed' of executive Sir, Mr Macdonald's letter (November 4) referring to my comments on the proposed changes to the British Standards Institution Royal Charter and their relevance to the recommendations of the Cadbury committee misses the point. The Cadbury committee took special care to define clearly the respective responsibilities of executive and non-executive directors. The proposed BSI Royal Charter changes sought to create a new species of corporate animal, the 'executive non-executive'. Apparently, members of this new species would have the power under the proposed changes to reward themselves financially for services rendered without the normal checks and balances. These changes were outstandingly rejected by the subscribing membership of the BSI, representing a cross-section of British industry, at the BSI annual general meeting. Mr Macdonald may have been a member of the Cadbury committee, but perhaps he should have listened and understood more carefully. M D Sanderson, chief executive to June 1993, BSI, 31 Murray Mews, London NW1 9RH</p>

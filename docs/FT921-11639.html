			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Leading Article: The president sits it out THE MARKET verdict on US President George Bush's State of the Union message and budget proposals was eloquent: equities and the dollar weakened, while government bonds rose - until their advance was upset by comments of Mr Alan Greenspan on the constraints on interest rate movements. This implies that in the absence of any other than shop-soiled proposals to revive the US economy, the Federal Reserve will, over time, have to do what it can by cutting rates; but no quick results are expected. US economic policy remains paralysed by the burden of federal debt, while the private sector is equally crippled by debts of its own. It is little wonder that Mr Bush's popular standing continues to slide. In a poll taken on the eve of his budget, no less than 73 per cent of the voters said that they thought the country worse off than five years ago - a substantially worse reading than that which drove President Carter to complain of a national malaise. Only 9 per cent saw any hope of short-term improvement. Meanwhile the current president is seen passively waiting for a deus ex machina, in the form of a cyclical consumer-led recovery, to rescue both the economy and his own hopes of re-election. The latest economic readings are not encouraging. Real domestic final demand fell at an annual rate of nearly 2 per cent in the last quarter of 1991, so the real growth rate of 0.3 per cent was sustained only by the improving trade balance. The administration expects this improvement to taper off as growth among US trade partners slows, so its forecast of 1.6 per cent real growth this year rests on a domestic turnround. The source of this is not the proposed budget, which is claimed to add only 0.6 per cent to demand, but monetary policy: 'The moderation of inflation provides the Federal Reserve ample room to ease interest rates further if this appears warranted.' Old favourite The Fed might in fact have to offset the effects of the Bush proposals, in the unlikely event that Congress passed them. Both parties favour higher tax breaks and social spending, financed by defence cuts - Dollars 50bn over five years under the Bush plan, but much more if the Democrats get their way. This approach is obviously a more sensible use of resources than building unwanted weapons, but its economic effects would be slow, and initially might well be deflationary. Jobs and incomes will be lost in the defence sector, but tax cuts - and especially the president's unpopular old favourite, a large cut in capital gains tax - would go partly to restore personal savings. Very necessary, again; but no short-term stimulus. Growing danger However, policies in an election year are framed in the short term, and in this time frame America's trade partners can only pray that the administration's forecasts prove more impressive than its budget proposals. If the economy remains depressed, there is a growing danger the next election will see a rebirth of the sort of populism which gave us the Smoot-Hawley tariffs in the 1930s. The poll showing such poor support for Mr Bush also showed hunger for more public spending - with a fiscal deficit projected at Dollars 399bn - and a forbidding 56 per cent in favour of a protectionist approach to saving US jobs. Protectionism has been publicly favoured only by a part of the Democratic leadership until now; but the president has shown in the past that when the shot is flying he, like the Duke of Plaza-Toro, is happy to lead from behind. The short-sighted EC stance on farm issues at the Gatt, bitterly offending the traditionally free-trade US farm lobby, can only encourage chauvinist voices in both parties. Partners who find the idea of an isolationist US forbidding should reflect that their macroeconomic policies may encourage the result they fear. Mr Bush's dilemma confirms what has been clear since his election - that the US, the traditional locomotive of world economic growth, is out of steam and in sad need of an overhaul. If we are to rely on more than crossed fingers to lead a US revival, the motive power may have to come from outside.</p>

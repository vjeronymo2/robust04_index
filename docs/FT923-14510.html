			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Observer: Job swaps Francis Maude, the second youngest of the bunch of Tory ministers to lose their parliamentary seats, seems to be winning the race to get rich quick in the private sector while he plots his political comeback. Having advised the Hongkong Bank in its successful bid for Midland, Maude has picked up a lucrative job as head of privatisation at Salomon Brothers and now he has been given a seat on the Asda board. Not bad going for a 39-year-old who stands as good a chance as anyone of getting the next safe Parliamentary seat, especially now that Chris Patten has emigrated to Hong Kong. John Maples who, like Maude, would almost certainly have also been picked for the Cabinet if he had held onto his seat, has also found a nice little earner as chairman of a government lobbying arm of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. But he is ten years older than Maude and his political future is less certain. Sir David Trippier's name is beginning to appear as a non-executive director but the likes of Michael Fallon, Colin Moynihan and Christopher Chope have yet to resurface in the appointments columns.</p>

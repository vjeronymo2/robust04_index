			<p>Africa   <F P=102>   944Q0330A Moscow MEZHDUNARODNAYA ZHIZN in Russian No 2, Feb  94 [Signed to press 18 Mar 94] pp 120-128 </F>  <F P=103> 944Q0330A </F> <F P=104>  Moscow MEZHDUNARODNAYA ZHIZN </F> <F P=105>  Russian </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Leonid Alekseevich Safonov, director of Russian </F> MFA Africa Department: "Russian Priorities in Africa"]    [Excerpts] Africa today, like the "Third World" as a whole,  with its profound socio-economic, national-ethnic and military  problems, is becoming one of the prime sources of global and  regional threats for decades to come. Armed conflicts, which  have a destructive effect on international stability, social and  ethnic upheavals, massive famine and pandemic diseases,  terrorism and the narcotics business, are threats on a global  scale and objectively cannot but affect the interests and  security of other regions and states, Russia included.    The contemporary world, and above all the  industrially-developed countries, are faced with the growing  realization that one can hardly isolate oneself from the  problems of the African continent, which are already leading to  an increase in the influx of emigrants from Africa to Europe and  other regions: such as, the growth of Islamic extremism; and the  spread of diseases, including AIDS. It is no coincidence that in  this connection Prime Minister of France Balladour stated, that  the interests of his country "are suffering greatly from African  crises, whether it is a question of development of trade,  reliable supply of raw materials, the dangers of uncontrolled  emigration, or conflicts which threaten to upset the balance of  power on the entire continent."[.sup]1[/]    Obviously, for these same reasons, Russia too cannot wall  herself off from Africa behind the palisades of her own  difficulties. The moreso since, while acting judiciously and  with knowledge of affairs; and while structuring relationships  with the African states on a genuine, mutually advantageous  basis, with equal rights, without the previous distortions in  the ideological and military sphere--it is possible that  cooperation with Africa, which is still a rich and independent  region despite its severe crisis, can be put to use in  overcoming our own specific problems.    At the very same time, if we withdraw from Africa, we are  then in essence acknowledging our inability to engage in  positive, constructive cooperation, and we are confirming the  opinion which is still heard from time to time, that our policy  in Africa was founded merely on the negative values of the "cold  war."    The warm breeze of change, which is breaking up the ice of  many years of confrontation in the world, is blowing over Africa  as well. Many countries on this continent have set about making  democratic transformations: elections have been held on a  multi-party basis, fundamental rights of citizens have been  proclaimed, and more attention is being devoted to human rights.  The changes taking place in the world, and in African states as  well, along with those transformations which are being carried  out in Russia, force us to look anew at the development of  Russo-African relations as well. A thorough "inventory" must be  made of the experience of our over 30 years of ties, singling  out all that is of value and useful, and decisively rejecting  the approaches which were dictated by the market conditions and  ideological considerations of the past.    At the same time one can properly set the priorities in our  relations with Africa, discover the most promising areas for  cooperation, and determine the circle of reliable partners, only  on the basis of precise analysis and forecasting of the economic  and political development of African countries, taking into  consideration those factors which have decisive influence on the  formation of a political and economic climate both for the  African continent as a whole, and for the individual  countries.[passage omitted]    I believe that it is also in the Russian interest,  especially  in the economic plane, not to lose sight of the potential of  Africa as our partner, the more so since we have already  established a firm foundation for cooperation in our relations  with many African countries.    For the most part, future Russo-African relations are seen  precisely in all-round development of mutually-advantageous  economic ties; however, it will hardly be possible to achieve  this until military-political stability is assured on the  African continent, and until the prerequisites are established  for stable socio-economic development. Orienting herself on the  prospects which lie in the plane of economic and trade  relations, Russia, employing political means, will strive to  support the processes of democratization in Africa, and will  take part in settling existing conflicts and forestalling  potential conflict.    Within the framework of the given approach, we should  obviously focus special attention on activating political ties  with this continent. At the same time, it is necessary to pay  attention to its specific nature, when quite often cooperation  in all other sectors depend upon the level of political  relations and with establishing contacts with the leadership of  a country. We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the ruling  circles of many African states still take a cautious attitude  toward the political processes and reforms in Russia, lack  confidence in their successful outcome, and doubt that our  country, at the present stage, is capable of playing a  definitive role in the international arena.    African leaders, as practical experience shows, apart from  discussing questions of bilateral relations, are prepared for  dialogue with us on a broad range of problems associated with  strengthening international peace and security, and primarily  among those who are either directly influencing the situation on  their continent, or who are promoting the acceleration of  positive global transformations. From this point of view certain  directions in Russo-African interaction are seen to be  promising, such as certain aspects of disarmament, creation of  nuclear-free zones, formation of regional security systems,  strengthening international mechanisms for forestalling and  settling conflicts, and formation of an international economic  climate that is beneficial for Russia and Africa as well.    The political assistance of Russia to settlement of the  basic  "hot spots" of Africa, to include support in the UN Security  Council, is directed toward fulfilling the global mission of  assuring a more secure world. We also consider this assistance  an important part of our political partnership with the African  countries, which strengthens the basis for mutually-advantageous  cooperation with them.    Russia is taking a most active part in the Angolan  settlement, and together with the United States and Portugal is  joining a "troika" of observers over the process of carrying out  the Bisesskiy (Lisbon) Agreements (May, 1991). Russian military  and civilian observers have been sent under UN auspices to a  number of other conflict zones in Africa (Mozambique, Liberia,  Somalia and Rwanda).    On the whole it is obvious that in analyses of the prospects  for stabilization of the situation in the "hot spots" of Africa  and around them, one should avoid excess optimism. In this  connection, Russian proposals made at the 48th Session of the UN  General Assembly are considered timely ones. The essence of  these proposals is--to establish within a United Nations  framework additional mechanisms which will permit significantly  increasing the success rate for peacemaking operations, to  include the African continent as well.    Experience in operations in support of peace implemented by  the international community on the African continent is  important for us, for application to Russia's own efforts on the  territory of the former USSR.    At the same time, while cooperating with the West on the  African continent, one should proceed from the fact that the  commonality of approaches noted for a number of problems does  not at all signify that they are completely identical. Russia  must operate above all in consideration of her own national  interests, as well as the reality of the multipolar world that  is taking shape.    In spite of a certain slump in the sphere of trade and  economic relations, prospects for developing cooperation with  Africa exist, and above all in the extraction of minerals; in  geology; and in construction, fisheries, woodworking and  agriculture. Constructing and utilizing major new  facilities--such as the bauxite extraction complex in Dian-Dian  (Guinea); expanding the scale of independent activities of state  and commercial structures; setting up joint enterprises;  establishing new zones for trade and economic activities, for  example, in Namibia and the South African Republic--can  genuinely raise the overall qualitative level and scale of  Russia's economic ties with Africa.    The interests of Russia are served not only by maintaining,  but also by expanding existing ties. It is at the same time  necessary to purposefully and consistently place them on a new  basis: to establish multi-level forms of cooperation with the  countries which remain, chiefly for ideological motives, beyond  the sphere of our attention. At the same time we should above  all examine the possibilities for developing relations with  those states which represent a promising market for acquiring  Russian products, or suppliers of the goods and raw materials  which we need.    Intensification of Russo-African interaction will to a large  extent also depend upon transition to new forms and methods of  cooperation--granting of licenses and know-how, rental of  machinery and equipment, collaboration between industrial  sectors, and scientific-production cooperation.    In recent years, while overcoming significant difficulties,  the processes of integration have intensified in Africa. One may  quite confidently assume that in the future, inter-African  economic cooperation, aimed at the creation of an African  economic community and regional economic structures, will become  more significant. Such intentions have already appeared very  vividly in a number of regions on the continent.    Russian foreign economic structures could also take  advantage  of trends for integration in Africa for increasing her own  exports to the corresponding markets, which will apparently be  expanding as a result of the aforementioned trends. Our  participation is possible at the level of enterprises,  investment banks, and in the form of joint ventures.    In resolving African problems of development, for the  continent as a whole, for subregions and countries, Russia is  devoting significant attention to the role of the UN Economic  Commission for Africa [ECA] and, in particular, to the fact that  ECA could stimulate and attribute a truly international  character to its programs in such areas as transportation, power  engineering, development of natural resources, and environmental  protection, as well as support of small and mid-level  entrepreneurship.    Russian organizations are completely capable of  participation  in implementing projects within the framework of the second  decade of industrial development in Africa and the second decade  of transport and communication of the UN's ECA. It would appear  that Russo-African cooperation, taking into consideration the  peculiarities of the continent, could promote the solution of  problems of employment and the development of facilities in the  infrastructure; and could have as its ultimate goal the  involvement to the fullest of African countries in the system of  international division of labor on a fair basis.    An important element of bilateral relations between Russia  and countries of Africa, which requires a weighty and  well-thought-out approach, is the problem of their obligations  for credits issued by the former USSR. In terms of state credits  alone, the volume of indebtedness of sub-Saharan African  countries amounts to nearly $14 billion. The situation is  aggravated by the fact that the domestic political situation in  many of the countries which are the principal debtors is  unstable, and the economy is in a state of crisis. Therefore,  the task consists of finding ways and means of restoring the  debts, without straining political relations, and without  breaking existing mutually-advantageous ties.    It is most important to proceed from the fact that the  search  for solution of this problem must not rest on narrow  departmental considerations. It is necessary to take into  account all aspects of political and commercial-economic  relations with each country, individually. The question of  indebtedness should be examined comprehensively, employing  various strategies: partial payment in freely-convertible  currency and local currency, compensation for debt by deliveries  of goods, or reinvestment; taking things one step at a time,  using part of the debt for covering the expenses of Russian  missions, and so on.    The sphere of military-technical cooperation remains an  important link in Russia's foreign policy and economic ties with  Africa. This form of interaction appears to be quite promising  in the context of increasing its profitability and placing it on  an exclusively commercial basis. A number of African states have  an appropriate degree of interest in this.    One must not fail to consider that a prolonged pause in the  given sphere of relations with Africa can have a negative effect  on Russian interests; since the vacuum formed as a result of  breaking military-technical ties with the Soviet Union, and then  with Russia as well, is being energetically filled by other  countries--including those which produce weapons under Russian  licenses, of greatly inferior quality than that which Russia  herself could offer. It is evident, incidentally, that Russian  arms deliveries should not appear in regions of existing and  potential armed conflicts, nor in countries with openly  dictatorial regimes.    Apart from solving the urgent problems cited above,  developing stable relations with African countries demands  long-term humanitarian and political investment in the future of  our ties. In this context one should, obviously, be thinking  about the possibility of continuing, in modern conditions, the  training of African national cadres in the VUZ's of our country.  Such a practice provides its own positive results. It is another  matter, that this cooperation should be for the most part placed  on a compensatory basis. At the same time it should remain  advantageous and attractive for our African partners as well.    The question of future Russo-African relations continues to  attract the attention of the Russian and world community. Today,  it is true, few people doubt whether or not we need Africa in  general. On this account, it would appear that at last a  more-or-less unified point of view is taking shape--Yes, it is  necessary, since Russia, even with her present difficulties,  cannot allow herself the luxury of turning her back on Africa,  nor to all the other regions of our planet. Russia must assure  herself a fitting role in the world balance of influence, and in  the multilateral processes for regulating the world economy and  international relations.    By preserving all that is rational in bilateral political,  economic and cultural ties with Africa; applying to them content  appropriate to the realities of today; and by developing  cooperation in new directions, to include those countries which  previously lay beyond the bounds of our active policy, Russia  will support her own state interests, and will obtain greater  freedom in the choice of foreign policy alternatives. In this  manner the prerequisites will be laid down for more solid  positions for our country, not only on the African continent,  but in the world arena as a whole.  Footnotes    1.

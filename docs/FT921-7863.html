			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (7): New look to the car park - Profile of National &amp; Provincial THE 'busy bee' building society, National &amp; Provincial, has scrapped its conventional company car system, under which it owned 400 cars. Instead, it has introduced a radical programme of cash allowances, and loans to every 'company car' driver to buy whatever he or she wishes. The new scheme was launched last October and already the car park at the headquarters in Bradford looks radically different. Gone is the concentration of recently-registered stalwarts from the fleet market, in N&amp;P's case Jaguar for senior executives, then Rover 800, Vauxhall, and, at the bottom end, Ford. There is now a liberal mix of vehicles: more drivers, free from punitive tax bands, have gone for cars with engines of more than 2 litres; there is an unusually high proportion of estates, for the family; and you can see a few Land Rover Discoverys, a popular all-rounder in rural Yorkshire. 'Cars have become a matter for individual choice - as they should be,' Paul Chapman, director of business and organisation development, explains. The switch to the new system has several main objectives, but cost reduction is not one, Mr Chapman says. Most importantly, the company wanted 'to get rid of the status thing which surrounds company cars'. They have long been an unnecessary source of conflict between 'haves' and 'have-nots'. Also, even among those who have company cars, the perceived benefit varies from one employee to another, especially as the workforce becomes more mixed, and is no longer dominated by prototype male breadwinners. Basic administration was a burden on the company - not a great one, but the buying, selling, insurance, processing of claims and so on distracts from the main business. The new system of cash allowances will allow N&amp;P to respond more effectively to further changes in the tax structure of company cars. N&amp;P's 400-strong fleet was split evenly between those which were primarily perks, or 'benefit cars', and 'need' cars, supplied to staff such as salesmen and valuers for whom a car is essential. The benefit cars were on a three-year, 60,000 miles replacement cycle, while the need cars were renewed after two years or 40,000 miles. These are now the starting points for working out individual cash allowances. They are calculated by taking the retail price of the car allocated to the employee's grade within the company, the 'benchmark value', adding the estimated straight line depreciation, maintenance and other costs, then deducting the net tax saving for the individual. The allowance is paid monthly, grossed up for tax. It is shown as a separate item, although it could, logically, be consolidated with the salary. That might be moving too far ahead of the market, however. 'We would want to see what our competitors are offering, before we made that decision,' says Mr Chapman. The company offers employees four-year loans towards the cost of the car, again related to the benchmark value, and tax-free up to the first Pounds 10,000 - the limit for tax-free loans under the society's rules. Employees can benefit by buying second-hand and saving on depreciation, something which would be much less acceptable as a company fleet policy. Chapman's own car is a good example. Under the old scheme, he would have been due a new Jaguar, reflecting his senior status in the company. In fact, he has bought a sporty two-year-old Toyota Supra. List price, new, is Pounds 26,000 but he bought his from a local dealer for Pounds 13,000, with the warranty extended for a further four years. Not only does he have a car he prefers, he will gain financially. The car had already suffered its heavy depreciation when he bought it, and by the end of the third year, say, the car will be worth substantially more than the value of the outstanding loan. The cash allowance scheme is being closely monitored, Mr Chapman says, and each driver's circumstances are reviewed every six months. Adjustments may be made to the scheme, for example, to give employees a degree of protection against the sharp depreciation in the first two years of a new car. Any direct financial benefit to the society is marginal, and cost savings were not the object of the change, Mr Chapman said. There should be cost savings to the 'company car' economy as a whole, as employees are likely to look after their vehicles more carefully. Many are expected to be passed on to spouses, or other relatives. Surprisingly, perhaps, employees are paying little more, in the present economic climate, than N&amp;P was, either for new cars or for servicing. N&amp;P has left its fuel payment system unchanged, to avoid making an already complicated change more difficult. Those with cars on a 'need' basis claim back fuel expenses, while those using cars as benefits use Dial fuel cards. The principles behind the cash allowances scheme can be applied for a wider range of company perks - car parking, low-cost mortgages and pension fund contributions could eventually come up for review, for much the same reasons as the car fleet system has been overhauled. Mr Chapman believes the new scheme gives N&amp;P a slight edge in recruiting good new staff. In spite of some initial misgivings, 'it has gone down quite well, especially as people have come to recognise the individual responsibility and choice involved', he says.</p>

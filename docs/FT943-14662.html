			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: Japan's banks 'will remain burdened' Japanese banks will remain burdened for many years by their high proportion of bad loans, a US credit rating agency said yesterday. The report, by Moody's Japan, said poor asset quality was compounded by the fact that the banks' underlying profitability was among the weakest in the world. Problem asset levels were very high in relation to core earnings. 'Since there is little prospect for a massive (government) bail-out, or for significant profit improvement, we see a prolonged period of uncertainty,' the report said. Margins were expected to remain under pressure because of the heavy cost of carrying non-performing loans, and the limited lending opportunities. In the last three years, Moody's has cut its ratings of large Japanese banks from an average of Aa2 to A2. Only four leading banks - Bank of Tokyo, Industrial Bank of Japan, Mitsubishi Bank and Sanwa Bank - received long-term ratings of Aa3. Moody's said that while it was confident the risk of default by any big bank remained remote, 'the unwillingness of the authorities to move decisively in resolving the banks' asset quality problems has created an atmosphere of risk and uncertainty on the part of market participants at home and abroad.'

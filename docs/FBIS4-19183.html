			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Fighting continues in the Rwandan capital,  Kigali. [passage omitted] The last French soldier has now left  the country. Their mission was to protect and to evacuate the  expatriate community. That mission has now been accomplished.  As to the ongoing situation, Cooperation Minister Michel  Roussin this afternoon told parliament that France has no  intention of acting as the policeman of Africa:    [Begin Roussin recording] France has not ceased to try to  mobilize public opinion in Africa and across the world. We did  not sit back with our arms folded. Though we realize that the  2,500 blue berets urgently needed the reinforcement of the 500  paratroopers to ensure the evacuation of more than 1,500 people,  let me tell you that the prime minister today asked the foreign  minister to remind the United Nations of its role. We cannot be  the policeman of Africa. The international community has a duty  to take over from us, and the United Nations must now bring the  different parties together, and bring the protagonists to a  cease-fire. If France is again called upon, France will answer  yes. [end recording]</p>

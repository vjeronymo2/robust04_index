			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 9 Jun -- The rules of using Russia's air  space have been violated 109 times in the past year. This was  done 22 times by aircraft of the former USSR states, and 27  times by planes belonging to other foreign states. The air  defense troops have been forced to take decisive measures with  regard to transgressors. Forty five aircraft were forced to land  en route or to return to their place of departure.    These figures were cited in an appeal by the command of the  air defense troops to all ministries and departments, as well as  to the management of Russian commercial and foreign airlines.  The document, which ITAR-TASS received today from the press  service of the air defense forces main command, requests that  the rules for the use of Russian Federation air space be  strictly observed, and stresses that only concerted action can  prevent emergency situations, including those involving human  losses.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Duanmu Laidi (4551 2606 0171 1229) and Gao </F> Jianxin (7559 1696 2450)]    [Text] Beijing, 25 Feb (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng and his  wife Zhu Lin, Vice Premiers Zou Jiahua and Li Lanqing, and other  leading comrades joined members of the Preliminary Working  Committee [PWC] of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region  Preparatory Committee this evening to mark the Lantern Festival  held at the Hong Kong and Macao Center.    The center, which is located on the second floor of a  building on the East 40th Street, was decorated with lanterns  and colorful streamers and was permeated with laughter this  evening. The get-together sponsored by PWC members from Hong  Kong opened at 1830 [1030 GMT] under the chairmanship of Zhu  Youlin, a PWC member from Hong Kong, and Ni Ping, a celebrated  presenter from China Central Television. After PWC Vice  Chairman An Zijie gave a welcoming speech, Premier Li Peng gave  an extemporaneous speech. He said he was very glad to be able  to join PWC members from Hong Kong in marking the Lantern  Festival, and he wished all PWC members good health, successful  careers, and happiness for their families.    Speaking on the current situation in Hong Kong, Li Peng  said:  The China today is not the China of more than 150 years ago.  Today, China's political situation is stable, its economy is  developing, and we are full of confidence in the future of our  motherland. He said: No matter what may happen, the Chinese  Government's determination to reinstate its sovereignty over  Hong Kong will not change, and Hong Kong certainly will witness  a stable transition of political power and long-term prosperity  and stability.    Under the current circumstances, Li Peng said, the PWC's  burdens and responsibilities have become even heavier and  greater. He urged all PWC members to work harder and make even  greater contributions to Hong Kong's long-standing stability and  prosperity and the motherland's prosperity.    The 50 or so PWC members from Hong Kong and China, members  of  its secretariat, and friends from the press watched a brilliant  performance given by literary and art workers in the capital.  The pleasure-filled get-together, which lasted more than two  hours, reached a climax when Lu Ping, director of the State  Council's Hong Kong and Macao Office, and Fang-huang Jiwen, a  PWC member from Hong Kong, sang the songs "I Am A Chinese" and  "Tomorrow Will Be Even Better."</p>

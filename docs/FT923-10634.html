			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: All clear for beer Yesterday's ruling on the Allied-Lyons/Carlsberg deal plainly suggests a truce is breaking out between the competition authorities and the brewing industry. Of the conditions imposed, the only one with any bite is that which requires Allied to allow its pub tenants to buy half their lager from the competition within two years. The condition has its paradoxical aspects; the authorities give credit to the merger for providing stiffer competition for Bass and Courage, while at the same time proposing to give Bass and Courage access to Allied's pubs. But the amount of beer at risk is at most 150,000 barrels a year, or perhaps Pounds 5m in profit. In the context of a deal which puts Pounds 135m cash into Allied's pocket, that scarcely seems worth quarrelling over. In any case, the pace of change in the industry seems to be slowing. The only big deal pending is that between Allied and Brent Walker, which now looks like going through with only minor modifications. There remains vague speculation about a brewing link between Whitbread and Scottish &amp; Newcastle. If that ever came to anything, yesterday's ruling might suggest that the authorities would take an indulgent view. As the dust settles, it becomes clear that quite a number of things are going Allied's way these days, including the removal this week of the threat of higher EC duty on gin and whisky. The shares have outperformed the market fairly consistently over the past couple of years. There might be life in them yet.</p>

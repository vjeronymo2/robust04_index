			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Mozer to plead guilty MR PAUL MOZER, former head of government bond trading at Wall Street securities house Salomon Brothers, is to plead guilty to criminal charges that he lied to Treasury officials about customer bids he submitted at a 1991 Treasury securities auction. After concluding a plea agreement with federal prosecutors, Mr Mozer will appear before a Manhattan court this morning to plead guilty to two felony counts that he falsified bids, in the names of Salomon customers Warburg Asset Management and the Quantum Fund, at a February 1991 auction of five-year treasury notes. The bids were submitted without the knowledge of either customer, and enabled Mr Mozer to obtain a greater share of the newly-issued securities for Salomon than government rules allowed. Mr Mozer has paid Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 322,000) into a government escrow account to meet any judgments against him by the Securities and Exchange Commission or by private civil claims that relate to his bidding activities. Although the two felony charges carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a Dollars 500,000 fine, a special hearing will be held to determine how much money, if any, investors and other trading companies lost as a result of Mr Mozer's actions. The severity of the sentence will be determined by the hearing's findings. Mr Mozer's lawyer, Mr Stanley Arkin, maintains that no money was lost because of his actions, and that neither Mr Mozer nor Salomon profited from the false bids. Mr Arkin also points out that Mr Mozer has pleaded guilty to 'administrative violations' that he has long conceded were wrong, and argues that the violations were not severe enough to warrant criminal proceedings.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Emman Omari] </F>   [Excerpts] Eighteen Catholic bishops called for a revision  of the Constitution yesterday, saying the political situation in  Kenya had not changed since single-party rule. They urged the  president to lead the country to democracy and said they would  be willing to meet with him.    "The main responsibility is, in a particular way, on the  president of the Republic who is also the commander in chief of  the Armed Forces and therefore, can change the situation," they  said.    Quoting a previous statement, they declared: "As president,  he cannot escape his responsibility. He cannot escape the  judgement of history."    The bishops made their remarks in a pastoral letter, "On the  Road to Democracy," which will be read in all churches serving  the seven million strong Catholic population on Sunday [20  March]. Seven prelates, including Cardinal Maurice Otunga,  presented the letter at the Catholic Secretariat's headquarters  in Nairobi. Parts of the document quoted or repeated previous  statements by the bishops or Pope John Paul II or bodies such as  the Justice and Peace Commission.    Taking turns to read the letter, the bishops also criticised  opposition parties for internal divisions, struggles for  personal power and visible orientation towards tribal  membership. All this, they said, was "a source of confusion and  disappointment" to the people.    The bishops called for the rewriting of the Constitution "to  fit our political circumstances." This should be done not by a  group of politicians but by an enlarged independent constituent  body. "Our constitution was composed when there was a de facto  one-party system and was suitable to the situation of that time.  "A complete revision has to be entrusted to a large constituent  body of experienced competent citizens representing all trends  of society and not just to a reduced group of politicians," the  bishops said. The Constitution should be endorsed by popular  consent.    The bishops complained that KANU [Kenya African National  Union] ignored other political parties and interpreted not being  a member of KANU as being against the government. This could be  seen from utterances of senior ministers that only KANU zones  would benefit from government development programmes. National  resources, they said, were a right and not a gift from KANU.  They said that if KANU could not serve all Kenyans equally then  it was breaking the contract of service and had no business  being in power "because ipso facto it loses the moral right to  govern."    The bishops reiterated that multipartyism was not synonymous  with discord but it did not mean democracy had arrived in Kenya.    The letter said the situation in the public universities was  chaotic. "No matter how the government would wish the public to  forget the university problem, that is just not going to happen.  A problem which is postponed is not solved," they said.  [passage omitted]    Referring to government efforts to convince people that  tribal violence was started by the opposition, the letter said  Kenyans had come to believe that the authorities passively  watched or collaborated in the clashes. They said it was well  known who ordered the demolition of Maela camp and Nakuru kiosks  and who sent bulldozers to Buru Thessalia holding ground to  evict people who had lived there for more than 50 years.    "Should we believe the words about national unity pronounced  by our president during the celebration of Kenyatta Day or the  words inciting to tribal revenge pronounced in Parliament by one  of his ministers with total impunity and even support of many  KANU members of parliament?" the bishops asked.

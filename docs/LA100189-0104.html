			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BOSTON U WILL OPERATE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM IN 10-YEAR EXPERIMENT  </P> <P> When public school students returned to class there was something else beyond  the usual change of new classes, new teachers and new books. There also was a  new administration, run by Boston University.  </P> <P> After months of sometimes bitter controversy, the private university was at the  helm of the Chelsea public school system. It is the beginning of a 10-year  experiment to see if academia's resources can make a difference.  </P> <P> "It's like Christmas morning and we're ready to go," said Ted Sharp, an  assistant dean at BU's School of Education, on the first day of classes earlier  this month.  </P> <P> Despite the fanfare, there was little evidence of the university's new role.  Signs welcomed students and university officials in Vietnamese, Cambodian and  Spanish, reflecting the native tongues of a third of the student body.  </P> <P> There also was talk of a new computer system and a special program for truants.  But the university has longer-term goals than improving attendance or school  equipment.  </P> <P> University officials talk of creating a new climate in this working-class  community of 26,000. There are plans to teach parents about nutrition, child  care, even neonatal care, with the idea of preparing children for school long  before they can read or write.  </P> <P> "We're talking about a philosophy that education can emancipate the underclass  in the United States," said Peter Greer, dean of education who oversees the  management team.  </P> <P> But there are many who still have doubts about the university's involvement in  the local schools. The teachers' union and Latino parents have filed separate  suits challenging the agreement. Others are worried the city may be left in  deeper debt if the university doesn't raise the $2 million to $3 million it  promised for special programs this year.  </P> <P> "I'm concerned we may get stuck if the money doesn't come in," said Elizabeth  McBride, chairwoman of the Chelsea School Committee.  </P> <P> The unique agreement between the university and Chelsea follows years of hard  times for the 3,500-student system. An influx of immigrants from Latin America  and Southeast Asia swelled the school population; declining tax revenues cut  school budgets.  </P> <P> Chelsea spends $1,600 less per student annually than the national average. Test  scores, graduation rates and teacher salaries are among the state's lowest.  </P> <P> School committee members sought help by approaching John Silber, president of  Boston University, who has long sought to use his school's resources in public  education. After months of negotiations among the school committee, aldermen  and the Legislature, an agreement was reached in June giving the university  control.  </P> <P> Althoug planners have talked about new courses and individualized teaching  plans, an emphasis has been placed on preparing children and their parents for  school. Last spring, the university experimented with a literacy program for  mothers and their young children.  </P> <P> There are other plans for parental courses in nutrition, and classes for  expectant mothers, all aimed at improving the health of future students.  </P> <P> But the ambitious plans require money. University officials talked of raising  $50 million through the life of its contract with Chelsea. More money is  expected, but only $726,000 in pledges are in hand.  </P> <P> And there are other concerns. Chelsea's teachers are mindful of Silber's stormy  relations with his university's unions; Latinos, fearful that the new  management might end bilingual education, went to court to try to stop the  takeover.  </P> <P> The university has tried to soothe those fears, appointing a management team  with several bilingual experts, including Diana Lam, a Peruvian-born Boston  school administrator, picked to be Chelsea's new school superintendent.  </P> <P> The union has signed an interim contract with BU that gives teachers an average  bonus of $1,300.  </P> <P> "There was some apprehension on the part of the teachers," said Edwin  Weinstein, head of the Chelsea Teachers Union. "Now they've adopted a  wait-and-see attitude."  </P></p>

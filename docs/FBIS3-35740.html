			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>   [Text] Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev believes that his  country can truly become economically independent only with  assistance from Russia. Speaking at a press conference in  Bishkek on Thursday [27 January], the president emphasized that  the arrival of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and the  visit of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin planned for  February "would assist with settlement of the issues concerning  support of Kyrgyz industrial enterprises which directly depend  on economic relations with Russia." "If we break these  relations, there is a risk for the Kyrgyz to go back to their  traditional nomadic life of cattle breeders," the president  pointed out.    For the time being, it is impossible to resolve the current  economic issues, like supplies of equipment and fuel material  and lubricants, without the assistance provided by Russia. This  also threatens the future of agriculture.    In connection with this, the president emphasized that dual  citizenship would conform with the interests in preserving the  economic potential of Kyrgyzstan, since this would help to  maintain the working potential of plants where most workers were  Russians. He refuted the assertion that this might lead to  destabilization of inter-ethnic relations.    Commenting on the changes in the Russian government, the  Kyrgyz president said that the situation should not be  exaggerated. "The reforms in Russia will continue since now they  are irreversible," Akayev pointed out. In his opinion,  Chernomyrdin was the man who could carry out the policy of  economic reforms in Russia.    Akayev said that if he won the January 30 referendum on  confidence in him he would take resolute steps to make the  reforms more rapid. "Kyrgyzstan can't afford to waste any time,  because it has huge debts which could go on snowballing," he  said.    He said the referendum, called on his own initiative, had  three goals to pursue: first, to confirm the authority of the  head of state, who, under the new constitution, must be  guarantee of stability and of a balance between the three  branches of government; second, to confirm the policy of reform;  and, third, to stabilize the political situation in the republic.    The president said he would never dissolve parliament, for  it  had been elected by the people, although under the former  regime. "Only the people themselves can determine the future of  parliament," he said.    Akayev said that, during his trips within Kyrgyzstan, he had  come to the conclusion that the population supported the reform  policy but was dissatisfied with the form privatization was  taking. For this reason, he was going to take measures to set  up bodies for combatting corruption and strengthening the  republic's economic security, he said.    The same day, Akayev addressed the nation on television and  radio. He said the main objective of his policy was to reach  ethnic conciliation in the republic and that he would "step up  his efforts to establish civil peace in Kyrgyzstan."    He said that, as head of state, he had been doing his best  to  mitigate the effects of the economic crisis and the social and  political shocks experienced by the republic. "My conscience is  clear," he said.    He said economic problems that had been taking shape for  decades could not be solved within a few months. Today "all  citizens of the country, all political parties and movements,  both left-wing and right-wing ones, both communists and  centrists, stand for market economics, for freedom for the  powerful and support for the weak," Akayev said. He said the  disagreements were over how rapid the reforms should be and over  their social aspect. There was a need for compromise, he said.    Akayev said the mechanism to control the economic situation  was being put into operation "slowly but surely." He said that,  by introducing its own currency, Kyrgyzstan had evaded many  economic upheavals. The country had also managed to restore its  economic ties with other former Soviet republics, in particular  Russia, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, the first step towards which  was the lifting of customs barriers, the president said.    "We are in the process of forming a single economic area  with  Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan," he said.    Akayev said that, if he won the referendum, he would take  immediate measures to strengthen discipline, give an impulse to  the agrarian reform, solve energy and transport problems,  support medium-sized and small businesses, create an atmosphere  of social partnership between the government, business and trade  unions, and improve the position of the pensioners.</p>

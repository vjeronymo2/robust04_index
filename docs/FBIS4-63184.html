Electricity was up most -- by 14.4 percent --  while prices for raw-material energy resources increased by 9.2  percent, and oil refining industry output was up by 4.6 percent.  As a whole, the main types of energy resources have increased  by 90 percent since the start of the year, including increases  of 120 percent for raw materials, 90 percent for electricity,  and 60 percent for petroleum products.    Among the types of raw-material energy resources surveyed  (oil, coal, and gas) the biggest price rise this April was for  coal -- 17.4 percent (6.5 percent in March, an increase of 80  percent since the start of the year). The variation in the  average price of coal in different economic regions was 2.2.  times.    Among raw-material energy resources the smallest rise over  the month was recorded for oil -- up 6.5 percent (19 percent in  March, an increase of 110 percent since the start of the year).

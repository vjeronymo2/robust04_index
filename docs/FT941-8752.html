			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Consumer surveys at odds over recovery More conflicting signals about the state of economic recovery emerged this week with two surveys of consumer confidence, Graham Bowley writes. A Barclaycard/Gallup survey published yesterday showed that two-thirds of consumers remained unconvinced that Britain was coming out of the recession. In contrast the Birmingham Midshires Building Society, in a survey conducted by ICM Research, reported that consumer confidence was at its highest level for four months. Mr Mike McManus, Barclaycard commercial director, said: 'A large number of consumers are still saying they are unconvinced that recovery is on the way.' But Mr Mike Jackson, Birmingham Midshires chief executive, said: 'Everything is now right for sustained recovery across industry, manufacturing and in the high street.' Barclaycard found some reasons for optimism. The survey showed that pressure on household budgets may be easing and consumers could return to certain forms of credit.</p>

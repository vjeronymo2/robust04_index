During a meeting with the U.S. President, political  leaders have given support for the lifting of the embargo.    Meanwhile in Hanoi, American businessmen are hoping the  embargo will lift soon. Thirty American companies have set up  representative offices in Hanoi and waiting for permission to  operate.    The spokeswoman of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Ms. Ho  The  Lan said she welcomed the lifting of the embargo against Vietnam  by U.S. President Clinton on Friday 4th February as rumors said.  Answering questions by correspondents of Reuter, KYODO, and of  Australia at the regular press conference in Hanoi on Thursday,  Ms. Ho The Lan said: The abovesaid event is suitable with the  reality, aspirations of peoples of the two countries, and the  world community, and is awaited by public opinions in recent  days.    Ms. Ho The Lan said Vietnam always welcomes all companies  from the United States as well as from other countries to invest  in Vietnam on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. She  said at present, both American and Vietnamese experts were now  reviewing the results of the 27th joint search of the American  servicemen missing in action. They are now preparing to return  the remains to the U.S. side on 7 February. The 28th search  will be carried out next week in the North, Central, and South  Vietnam. Vietnam and the U.S. are now arranging for the coming  meeting between the two countries to settle the property of both  sides. The meeting will be held in Hanoi on 15-16 February.  Ms. Ho The Lan pointed out that this would be a necessary step  on the road to broaden contact towards the normalization of  relations between the two countries.    [Hong Kong AFP in English at 0934 GMT on 3 Feb in a similar  Hanoi-datelined report adds: "But Vietnamese Foreign Ministry  spokeswoman Ho The Lan did not welcome a State Department report  criticizing Vietnam's human rights record, telling a regular  press briefing that the report was `not objective.'    "`I will applaud if President (Bill) Clinton decides to lift  the embargo,' Lan said. `It will be good not only for Vietnam  and the United States, but for the whole international  community.'    "`We always welcome companies of the US and other countries  to invest and do business in Vietnam on the basis of equality  and mutual benefit,' Lan said.    "In another sign of progress toward normal relations, Lan  said a US-Vietnamese meeting to discuss the restitution of  assets seized by the two sides at the end of the war had been  tentatively scheduled for February 15-16 in Hanoi.    "`Washington and Hanoi still appear to remain far apart on  human rights, however, with Lan making clear that Vietnam  considered the issue its own business. Despite untold  difficulties, the Vietnamese government has made great efforts  in better facilitating citizens to better exercise their  economic, social and cultural rights as well as civil and  political rights,' she said.    "`Against the background of such efforts, the annual report  by the State Department issued February 1 is not objective.'"]</p>

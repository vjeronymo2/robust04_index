			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Technology: Going for gold In the 19th century gold rushes, prospectors sought the seductive metal by trudging across rough terrain and studying streams and rocks for signs of hidden wealth. Today, mining companies have a much more sophisticated array of data to guide them to gold-bearing deposits. They can assemble a mass of information, by land or air, on a region's magnetic, gravitational, geological and chemical peculiarities and then work out where to start drilling. But this is where the difficulties come in. Drilling holes is expensive  - about Dollars 50,000 (Pounds 33,000) a time, including laboratory analysis - and there are no rules on how to use all the data to pinpoint potential mines. However, if a computer program devised by a Sussex University scientist is taken up widely, much of the uncertainty and cost could be reduced. Lecturer Peter Williams' computer neural network program - such programs recognise patterns and trends among a dense mass of data rather than make complex calculations - has been tried successfully by a big US mining company. Using magnetic data from 171 drillings, it was tested on two sites. It predicted accurately that one would yield gold and the other (thought to have potential after 36 test drillings) would not. It has also been used in south-east Asia and attracted interest from an Australian mining group. Williams says his program can be used for small or large areas and even whole countries where the magnetic and gravitational data is available. He has developed his program over three years, but he does not claim it will replace present methods of looking for gold. 'It is another tool in the toolbox,' he says modestly. 'It tilts the odds in favour of the prospector.'</p>

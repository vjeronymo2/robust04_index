This law, of a constitutional nature, extends the mandate  and  power of the Disciplinary Board for Magistrates [JHM] beyond the  implementation of the new Constitution approved by referendum.    The law, which also represents a vote of confidence in the  five JHM members for the outstanding job they have done so far  despite a series of limitations, modifies the previous  legislation in this respect; that is, in referring to the  creation of this body as well as that vetoed by the President of  the Republic which, although it had the same purpose, did not  have constitutional validity.    The scope of the new law will from now on, therefore, allow  the JHM to definitely appoint the 18 Supreme Court justices, the  250 Appellate Court justices, and the 750 magistrates, including  lower court and provincial judges.    The new law also establishes that the JHM will terminate its  functions once the National Council of Magistrates is  established. This will entail a lengthy process, at least 18  months, until its seven members are elected.    Obviously this is too much time to wait to begin the process  of normalizing a state branch in which more than two-thirds of  its officials are in their posts only provisionally, since the  democratic institutions were dismantled on 5 April 1992.    In practice, this means complete functional and individual  instability without any support or guarantees regarding the  government.    This reveals an urgent need for the normalization of the  Judicial Branch, whose utmost expression should not only be one  of full independence, but also of absolute equality in relation  to the other state branches.    For this and other reasons, we pointed out a few days ago in  this same column the need for a transitory solution, such as the  one just approved: "...the appropriate path that should be  taken is to grant the JHM a law, approved by Congress, which is  broad and explicit enough to allow this body -- composed of  exemplary lawyers -- to on this single occasion handle the  problem that has surfaced by officially appointing the great  majority of the judges currently on duty."    Moreover, our judicial branch's many vices and defects --  which, it should be pointed out, have not been corrected, and  have probably been made even worse by the circumstances -- have  perhaps their worst expression in its absolute submission to the  other branches, especially the Executive Branch, which under  circumstances such as the current ones is implacable with  magistrates who are not subservient.    The problem is particularly serious as in the coming months  the country is expecting a series of important cases to be heard  by the Judicial Branch. Its reform, therefore, as well as the  reform of the Attorney General's Office, must not only be  complete and definitive, but also carried out as soon as  possible.    Aside from the basic aspects of the restoration of national  institutionality, there are also some details of a practical  nature. As we had noted previously, neither Peruvian citizens  nor foreign investors have guarantees for their transactions in  a juridically unstable country, "where the full autonomy and  separation of the public branches is not freely exercised."</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Geevor announcement delayed A 'TECHNICAL hitch' delayed yesterday's planned announcement of a rescue for Geevor, Britain's oldest mining company - a move which could provide employment for hundreds of miners made redundant by the government's pit closures programme. The official announcement, now expected on Monday, is expected to spell out the structure of the deal under which Mr Malcolm Edwards, former commercial director of British Coal, will become chairman of Geevor. Mr Edwards said: 'It's just the sheer weight of work of putting together a whole series of different bits and pieces. The problem is that you suddenly find one contract in certain respects cancels out other obligations and the whole thing doesn't fit together. It's been sorted.' The deal involves a rights issue, the acquisition of a Welsh pit formerly mined by British Coal and the conversion of Geevor's debt into equity. Geevor will acquire one of Mr Edward's private businesses, Coal Investments, which has made bids to take over five pits closed by British Coal - Betws in Wales, Trentham in Staffordshire, Markham Main and Rossingham in Yorkshire and Coventry. The new business may be able to provide work for several hundred miners.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We have just received the following statement from  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs:    The charge d'affairs of the German Embassy in Belgrade was  summoned to the Federal Ministry today. He was asked to explain  the German Government's decision on the mass deportation of  Yugoslav citizens from Germany.    The German charge d'affairs stressed that the media reports  on the expulsion of a large number of people were unfounded,  that the number of the so-called asylum-seekers was not so  large, and that deportation measures would be applied only  against those who are in Germany illegally.    The German charge d'affairs was told that the method  announced to deport the Yugoslavs is not acceptable, that it  would represent the violation of human rights and international  conventions, and that the deportation measures have been adopted  in a discriminatory fashion without prior consultations with the  Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on solving  complex humanitarian problems. The Federal Government has taken  certain steps with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees with  regard to this issue.</p>

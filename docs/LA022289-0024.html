			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Deere &amp; Co.'s first-quarter earnings fell 28% from last year to $48  million. Sales totaled $1.14 billion, up 9%. The Moline, Ill.-based  agricultural and lawn equipment maker attributed the results primarily to  extraordinary gains a year ago as well as the start-up of a new line of  combines, large tractors and other equipment, which resulted in some production  and shipping delays and added costs.  </P></p>

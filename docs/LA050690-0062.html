			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALBUM REVIEWS  </P> <P> **** 1/2  </P> <P> SONNY ROLLINS  </P> <P> "Falling In Love With Jazz", Milestone  </P> <P> Rollins' first album of the '90s is highlighted by two superb musical  encounters -- on "For All We Know" and "I Should Care" -- with Branford  Marsalis.  </P> <P> But the most unusual track in the ballad-heavy collection is Rollins'  transformation of the "Tennessee Waltz" into a soaring, passionately eloquent  jazz sermon. Pianist Tommy Flanagan, a standout in a select group of backup  players, plays with exquisite taste and precision on a album that both confirms  and defines Rollins' preeminence among jazz tenor saxophonists.  </P> <P> Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to five stars (a classic).  </P> <P> DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

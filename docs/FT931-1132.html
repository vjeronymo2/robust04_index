			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Dalepak shares fall 24% on profits warning Dalepak Foods, the frozen foods and ready meals group, yesterday warned that trading conditions had worsened since its interim results in January. The shares fell from 264p to 201p. Even in January the company was expecting full-year profits to be down. Interim pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 1.6m. Yesterday it said profits would be 'significantly below market expectations' and analysts are now looking for profits of about Pounds 2.2m compared with Pounds 3.9m in the year to end-April 1992. Mr Chris Ivory, chief executive, said there had been 'further substantial increases in the cost of raw materials, especially beef.' Beef prices were up by 25 per cent on a year ago and by 15 per cent since January. He said price increases were not being fully passed on to supermarkets. Margins were squeezed as trading volumes were low and supermarkets concentrated on price promotions and lower priced foods. However, Mr Ivory said the balance sheet was strong and Dalepak expected to maintain its total dividend at 6p for the year to April. The group said it remained confident about long-term prospects.</p>

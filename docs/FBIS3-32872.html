			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "JB Report" by Teodomiro Braga] </F>   [Text] The Cuban Government has lied: former Brazilian  President Fernando Collor, wife Rosane and their friends Luis  Carlos Chaves and Eunicia Guimaraes stayed at Fidel Castro's  guest house in Varadero, a sea resort.    For three days Cuban officials extended VIP treatment to  Collor and his entourage despite the vehement denials of the  Cuban Government.    Collor tried to see Fidel Castro but failed. The Cuban  president chose to avoid him after receiving a number of  telegrams of protest from the Workers Party and other Brazilian  leftwing parties.    The former president stayed at a modest guest house located  a  few meters from the posh mansion which Al Capone, the gangster,  used in the thirties.    Francisco Marchante, a bodyguard whom the Cuban Government  had reportedly assigned to the former Brazilian president,  accompanied Collor wherever he went in Cuba.    This episode undermined Fidel's credibility; the nickname  Red  Pinocchio suits him just fine.</p>

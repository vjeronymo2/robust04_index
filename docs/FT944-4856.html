			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Vietnam to control air traffic Vietnam will assume air traffic control over all civil flights in the Ho Chi Minh City area on Thursday for the first time since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, government officials said yesterday. After the fall of the Saigon government in 1975, Hong Kong, Singapore and Bangkok took control of flights over former South Vietnam. Singapore transferred its area to Thailand in 1988, giving Bangkok full control of the southern part of the region. The International Civil Aviation Organisation decided last December to transfer the responsibility to Ho Chi Minh City after investment in communications equipment.</p>

			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CBS REPORTS 4TH-QUARTER LOSS, BAD FORECAST FOR '91  </P> <P> CBS Inc., once called the "Tiffany network," painted a grim profit picture  today, saying it will report a loss in the fourth quarter and lower earnings  next year.  </P> <P> The New York-based company said surprisingly steep losses arising from the  short baseball playoffs and World Series games hurt results, while a tough  advertising climate pressured the bottom line.  </P> <P> CBS agreed to pay $1.1 billion in 1988 to televise four years of Major League  baseball, resulting in $275 million in costs for the right to air the games  this season alone.  </P> <P> When the Cincinnati Reds swept the Oakland Athletics in four straight games to  win the World Series, the network could not recoup its licensing expenses.  </P> <P> The network also said it expects earnings to decline next year because it will  not be covering two premier sporting events that it broadcast this past year:  the NFL Super Bowl and NBA playoffs and championships.  </P> <P> "As a result the CBS Television Network is currently expected to show an  operating loss in 1991," the company said in a statement.  </P> <P> The CBS network is the hub of the company's vast broadcast operations, which  include local television and radio stations and the radio network.  </P> <P> The losses come at a particularly hard time for CBS, for its standing in the  television ratings has inched up in the past few weeks from its third-ranked  spot.  </P> <P> Costs for entertainment programming and sporting events have also risen as the  economy has slowed, sapping advertising revenues during its prime-time programs  and sports events.  </P> <P> "These are not just short-term problems," CBS chief executive Laurence Tisch  said in a statement.  </P> <P> "It is now apparent that increased competition for both viewers and advertising  dollars, combined with rapidly escalating programming costs, is changing the  fundamental economics of network television."  </P> <P> The quarterly loss will be its first since the fourth quarter of 1986, when the  company recorded a $20-million operating earnings shortfall.  </P> <P> The company's shares lost $2 to $161.75 in midday trading on the New York Stock  Exchange.  </P></p>

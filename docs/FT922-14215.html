			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / World Trade News: Politics of cost bedevil Hong Kong's new airport - Why estimates have jumped 14% - and where the HKDollars 114bn will come from THE HONG Kong government published updated cost estimates last week for its plan to bequeath a modern airport to the colony before British rule ends in 1997. In the space of a year the real cost rose 13.8 per cent, taking the project, in March 1991 prices, to Dollars HK114bn (Pounds 8.5bn). However, given the politics of the airport's conception and the scale of the project, cost over-runs were inevitable. Beijing was dubious from the start but it traded its consent for a larger say in Hong Kong's affairs before the formal handover on July 1 1997. That said, Beijing was - and is still  - concerned about the airport's cost. The Hong Kong government knew the airport would cost more, but judged it politic to say so after the UK and China agreed to proceed with the project rather than as negotiations were going on or in their immediate aftermath. The over-run has much to do with the optimistic assumptions of the Hong Kong government about some of the 'core' projects which make up Asia's single most ambitious urban infrastructure development plan. The key problem is the plan to build a railway from the airport to the central district of Victoria Island. This was estimated at first to cost HKDollars 12bn; the new estimate is HKDollars 22bn. To make the railway project financially viable, the government has ceded to the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) - the company which will build and own the railway - an unprecedented 60 hectares of land adjacent to and over the proposed underground line for profitable redevelopment. The government has further had to undertake to invest, in March 1991 prices, HKDollars 3bn in the MTRC and agree to stump up HKDollars 7bn of 'callable equity' in the event of future difficulties. These are deals the MTRC can rightly be proud of and they certainly safeguard its financial security. Late last year the MTRC presented this proposal to international bankers and the US credit rating agencies and won plaudits. Standard and Poors, in confirming the MTRC's single-A long-term rating and its A-1 short-term rating in late February, said the rating affirmation encompassed a review of the railway project. However, Beijing has expressed concern at the post-1997 blank check it thinks the British administrators of Hong Kong want it to endorse. China's approval is needed for the railway (and the airport) to proceed because of the implicit government financial guarantees which extend beyond 1997. The Hong Kong government's line is that Beijing needs educating in the realities of international construction and finance: 'This is not a World Bank-funded project of the sort they are used to,' said one official. Officials believe the government will receive at least a qualified yes from the Chinese to proceed with the railway. They say the railway can open up to 18 months after the airport before congestion becomes serious. No such problems with Beijing are expected over the airport itself (because they regard it as financially sound), the 330 hectares west Kowloon reclamation and the cross-harbour tunnel planned to connect west Kowloon with the central district of Hong Kong. Meanwhile, work is proceeding apace to level Chek Lap Kok, the small island to the north of Lantau Island, which will form the platform for the runways, terminal and associated services. What Hong Kong officials can be less certain of is successfully negotiating the rocky waters of contract conferral. Deep in the conspiratorial Chinese mind there has always lurked the thought that the airport and its related projects is Britain's way of repatriating Hong Kong's riches to the metropol by way of large construction contracts. When the Provisional Airport Authority announced that Sir Norman Foster and others had won the HKDollars 536m for the design of the airport terminal a howl of protest went up when it was discovered that Sir Norman's bid was the highest of the three short-listed candidates. Of the 38 contracts so far let, UK companies have figured in 80 per cent. Most have been small, but the crunch will come when the contracts are awarded for the Tsing Ma bridge, which will connect Lantau with Kowloon, the Western Harbour crossing, and the site preparation contract for Chek Lap Kok itself, due to be awarded in May. Most bidders have been careful to include among their consortia at least one mainland Chinese company - a modern east-Asian equivalent of buying Papal indulgences. The Hong Kong government has decided to finance the construction of the Lantau fixed crossing internally and will select the consortium to construct the Tsing Ma Bridge on its technical capabilities. Government officials said yesterday external finance had never been a pre-requisite for the Lantau crossing. Bidders for the contract had been asked to quote on financial packages but none was as competitive as the government's own source of finance. Officials said the government would look to offer a long-term franchise to operate the bridge, possibly in three to four years. By then contracts for future ports development - including the terminal 10 container port - may have been awarded, thereby securing the level of traffic needed to make the bridge a commercial venture.</p>

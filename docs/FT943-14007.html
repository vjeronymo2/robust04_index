			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Coffee trade stays on frost alert London coffee traders proved reluctant yesterday to leave themselves exposed to the possibility, however remote, of a third damaging frost hitting Brazilian growing areas this weekend. Having followed New York lower in early trading, the market gradually clawed back losses and by the close at the London Commodity Exchange September delivery robusta futures were quoted at Dollars 3,830 a tonne, up Dollars 24 on the day. That was Dollars 255 below Wednesday's 8 1/2 -year peak but still Dollars 760 up on the week. Weather forecasters saw little prospect of a repeat of last weekend's Brazilian frost, which, together with the one that hit two weeks early, is expected by some analysts to cut the country's 1995-96 coffee crop to below 15m bags (60kg each) from the 25m forecast previously. But traders were taking no chances, especially as next week will bring a new moon, which is often associated with frosty weather. The retreat from the highs had been heavily influenced by technical considerations - Monday's opening leap left a huge 'gap' in the charts  - but it was also encouraged by expectations, later confirmed, that the Brazilian government was about to reopen export registrations, which had been closed while it assessed the extent of the frost damage. The cocoa market has been very much in coffee's shadow of late, but the Pounds 1,073 a tonne reached by the second futures position yesterday was the highest since it hit a 6 1/4 -year peak of Pounds 1,085 in May. And it would certainly have exceeded that level had in not been for the slide in the value of the dollar since then, which has held back London's sterling-denominated cocoa prices. The price finished at Pounds 1,066 a tonne, up Pounds 50 on the week. At the London Metal Exchange prices were generally modestly higher on the week, with overhead resistance frustrating attempts by the copper and aluminium markets to move into higher ranges. Copper's three months delivery price was forced to retreat once again from the Dollars 2,500-a-tonne barrier yesterday after meeting profit-taking and liquidation selling. It closed at Dollars 2,483.75 a tonne, up Dollars 16.25 on the week. Meanwhile the three months aluminium price, having flirted with its near-term target of Dollars 1,550 a tonne, a 39-month high, settled back to Dollars 1,544.50, up Dollars 5 overall. The earlier rises in these metals had been encouraged by news of further drawdowns from their LME warehouse stocks. Aluminium's 11,625-tonne fall was the ninth in succession and took the total to 86,550 below its record level of June 10. Zinc's stocks continued to rise, but that did not prevent it participating in the market's overall firmness. The three months price was yesterday able to consolidate its break above Dollars 1,000 a tonne, closing at Dollars 1,008.50, Dollars 6.50 off the day's peak but Dollars 26 up on the week. The gold price rallied yesterday in defiance, dealers told the Reuters news agency, of technical and fundamental factors. 'After support held on Thursday I think a few people who were short and lacking the courage of their convictions started buying back,' one explained as the price firmed to Dollars 385.20 a troy ounce, up Dollars 1.80 on the week. That performance helped silver to erase earlier losses and platinum to extend its rise. But all were outshone by palladium, which reached a five-year high as increased Japanese physical demand coincided with a perceived tightening of Russian supply.  ----------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------- Aluminium       -11,625 to 2,571,125 Aluminium alloy    -420 to    28,180 Copper           -3,425 to   342,125 Lead               -175 to   355,200 Nickel              -54 to   132,948 Zinc             +3,425 to 1,201,050 Tin                +235 to    30,905  -----------------------------------</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Bulmer sells pectin business for Pounds 8.5m HP BULMER, the Hereford-based cider group, has sold its pectin business to Citrus Colloids, a management-led consortium, for Pounds 8.5m. Pectin, a natural product extracted from citrus fruit peel and apples, is used as a gelling agent and stabiliser in a variety of foods and pharmaceuticals. Bulmer, though one of the world's largest pectin producers, has decided to dispose of the business to concentrate resources on its core drinks operations. The sale includes its UK manufacturing plant and its 50 per cent stake in Braspectina, a Brazilian pectin producer. The business, which employs 270 people, made a profit before interest of Pounds 1m on turnover of Pounds 12.5m in the year to end-April. After a long period of steady volume growth, the pectin market has been hit by worldwide recession, decreased demand from the former Soviet Union, and growing competition in the past 18 months. However, Mr Brian Carver, managing director of the Bulmer business since 1983 and leader of the buy-out, said yesterday: 'Bulmer's decision has presented us with a tremendous opportunity. We have, over several years, built up a balanced worldwide market and this, together with the cost advantages of Braspectina, will give us a strong competitive advantage.' Citrus Colloids has been backed by 3i, the investment capital group, and Lenice, Bulmer's Brazilian partner, from which the management consortium is also acquiring the balance of Braspectina. Bulmer will receive Pounds 8.5m cash on completion, subject to an adjustment based on the value of the net assets of the UK pectin operation. A deferred consideration, equal to the fair value of 7.5 per cent of the ordinary shares in the pectin business, will become payable in cash on the sale of shares in Citrus Colloids.</p>

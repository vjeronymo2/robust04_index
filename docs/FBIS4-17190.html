			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Sevastopol 21 April TASS -- The Russian-Ukrainian  talks on the Black Sea Fleet ended in disarray in Sevastopol on  Thursday [21 April] after the sides failed to iron out their  disagreements.    The Russian delegation insists that the Russian Black Sea  Fleet and the Ukrainian Navy should be located in different  places. The Ukrainian side, however, believes that both can  stay in Sevastopol, but in different harbours.    Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev who headed the  Russian  delegation to the talks told journalists that at the first  plenary meeting the sides outlined their positions on the  matter. Experts were due to resume discussions later in the  day. The talks will continue on Friday on an enlarged basis.    Black Sea Fleet spokesman Andrey Grachev said the Ukrainian  side is playing a "Massandra scenario" at the talks. Under the  agreement signed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk in Massandra, the Crimea, in  1993, Ukraine pledged to sell its part of the fleet to Russia in  exchange for writing off its debt for Russian energy supplies.  However, the deal was strongly opposed by the Ukrainian  military.    Ukrainian Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy's refusal to  allow Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov and Sevastopol city  council chairman Viktor Semenyov to join in the talks added to  the tension.    Articles five and six of the law on the delineation of  powers  between Ukraine and the Crimea allow Crimean leaders to have  their say in issues connected with the location of troops and  establishment of new military units in the republic, the  spokesman said.</p>

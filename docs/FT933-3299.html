			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Unitas turnround cuts losses to FM1.01bn UNITAS, Finland's second-largest banking group, yesterday announced reduced losses for the first eight months in what it describes as a 'decisive turnround' in its performance. The group's pre-tax loss amounted to FM1.01bn (Dollars 179m), compared with a FM1.31bn deficit in the same period in 1992. Its consolidated income climbed 45 per cent to FM2.68bn and operating profit before credit losses rose fivefold to FM881m. Unitas, which is the holding company for the Union Bank of Finland, attributed the upturn to lower interest rates, a rising stockmarket and greater efficiency. It noted that its loss in the second four months was FM498m, FM552m less than in the same 1992 period. However, the improvement was marred by evidence that the rising trend in credit losses and non-performing loans remains unbroken. Credit losses rose to FM1.68bn from FM1.29bn. Non-performing loans at the end of August totalled FM8.62bn, against FM8.57bn at the end of April. The bank's capital adequacy ratio stood at 11.1 per cent, unchanged from the year end. It is now more confident that it can survive Finland's banking crisis without further state help. It received a FM1.7bn preference capital injection from the government and is likely to use a government guarantee for an issue in the international capital market.</p>

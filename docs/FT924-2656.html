			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / The fairytale crisis Every so often Britain reveals itself as the land of no logic, nil reason and nonsense. It is in a flap this week about the constitutional implications of the decision by the Prince and Princess of Wales to lead separate lives. Even by English standards this is woolly. While there is a monarchy there are no constitutional implications arising from the matrimonial difficulties of the royal family. Someone will succeed Queen Elizabeth. If it is not Prince Charles, it will be Prince William; if not the latter, then the next in line. Whoever it is will presumably have been trained to fulfil the contemporary functions of the office, which are fourfold. The monarch must support good causes. She or he must create an atmosphere in which courtiers and the recipients or purchasers of honours may flatter themselves. The institution must at best enchant and at worst entertain the populace. Finally, politicians delude themselves that, under the Crown, they are working within a rational framework. In theory there should be no questioning of who is to occupy such a hereditary post. In practice the abdication of 1937 diluted the hereditary principle. The government sat as a secret court of morals over the monarch and cast him out. We therefore endure an English muddle. Lineal descent determines the heir, but his or her personal behaviour must be vetted. The test changes with time; if, as is to be hoped, the Queen continues in good health for another decade or more, the fitness of her eldest son to replace her will be determined by whatever is the prevailing popular opinion in the early decades of the next century. Constitutional lore will be altered to suit the moment. That's it. Once through the hoop, the occupant of the throne serves as a symbol of continuity and unity, a genuinely useful purpose. In short, the debate about whether the Princess can be Queen if she is leading a life separate from her husband is actually about private matters and individual careers. There are plenty of real constitutional issues to be discussed, but it is not the English way to take notice of these. Just two weeks ago Lord Chief Justice Taylor called for the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into British law. 'Our ratification of the convention obliges us in the end to accept it,' said Lord Taylor, 'but our refusal to incorporate means acceptance occurs only after a decision in Strasbourg, much delay and humiliation.' Lord Justice Bingham, Master of the Rolls, is of the same mind. You could hardly imagine two more distinguished advocates of what most proponents of constitutional reform have long supported. Yet the response of Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, was a politicians' brush-off. The rest is silence. This echoes the uncanny stillness that has descended on all genuine constitutional debate since April 9. On that day the Conservatives were returned to office for the fourth time in a row. Not surprisingly, they are great admirers of our constitution. Under it, the Tory party always wins. For the time being their organised complacency has vanquished even Scottish nationalism. The party of that name is quiescent. Labour's shadow Scottish secretary, Mr Tom Clarke, is on sick leave. The Liberal Democrats are focusing on Bosnia. The stage is thus set for the highly centralised British government to trumpet its allegiance to subsidiarity in Edinburgh today without a blush. If anyone was so rude as to ask why the Celts should not have self-government, the Scottish secretary, Mr Ian Lang, would be ready to reply. Mr Lang, whose sometimes downbeat public image belies his innate political verve, would doubtless respond that the Conservatives are devolving power directly to the people, through opted-out schools, hospitals and the like. Yes, but the stuffing is being knocked out of that one by the Treasury's already evident determination to take back the initial bribe money given to hospital trusts, GP fundholders and grant maintained schools. That leaves Mr Lang with two further arguments against Scottish devolution. The first is that it should not come about in order to satisfy European Community needs; the second that strengthening regions weakens nation-states which in turn strengthens Brussels. Thinking of this kind sets the seal on the 'stock-taking' about Scotland promised by John Major before the election. It is a useful little phrase: 'stock-taking' helps Mr Lang win arguments, fiscal or otherwise, on his fiefdom's behalf. It won the summit conference for Edinburgh, on the ground that the Scots must be made to feel that notice is being taken of them. It may achieve modifications of local government and parliamentary committee structures. What it will not change is the constitution. Only a proper crisis would do that. Nothing that has happened since April 9, including this week's dramatic end to a fairytale, constitutes such a cataclysm.</p>

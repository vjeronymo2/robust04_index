			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Sharp deterioration at BAe THE DETERIORATION in British Aerospace's operating performance caught the City by surprise. An interim loss of Pounds 129m, against a pre-tax profit of Pounds 86m a year earlier, indicated conditions had deteriorated sharply for the group. The problem lay in commercial aircraft production with a loss of Pounds 286m (loss of Pounds 32m a year earlier). Defence raised profits to Pounds 296m (Pounds 281m), Rover trimmed its loss to Pounds 31m from Pounds 43m, the Arlington property division had a loss of Pounds 6m (loss of Pounds 5m) and construction turned in profit of Pounds 12m (Pounds 20m). The Pounds 750m charge for reorganisation costs - or Pounds 1bn before before a tax credit - was the maximum analysts had forecast. As provisions go, it will be one of the largest taken by a UK company. By comparison, British Petroleum, took this summer an exceptional charge of just over Pounds 1bn for redundancy costs - covering 11,500 job losses - and asset write-downs. Barclays Bank wrote-off bad debts of Pounds 1.07bn. In the case of BAe, however, the Pounds 750m exceptional cost to be taken in the second half will create a deficit of Pounds 746m on the company's (as opposed to the group's) profit and loss account. This hole in the distributable reserves prevents a dividend being paid. To restore the reserves and enable a delayed payment of the interim dividend, the group is proposing a reduction of capital. This will involve the following cuts in surpluses in other areas of the capital and reserves that make up shareholders' funds: reducing the share premium account, which stood at Pounds 616m in the last set of accounts, by Pounds 599m; reducing the nominal amount of each ordinary share from 50p to 10p to release Pounds 151m. The changes must be approved both by the shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting, to be held on October 19, and by the High Court. If these approvals are obtained, BAe plans to pay a late interim dividend of 3p, cut from 8.9p. The payment would be made next February, on the day after the announcement of the 1992 results. The preference share dividend due on January 1 would also be delayed until then. The board's decision on the final dividend will be a separate matter. Other parts of shareholders' funds will not be affected, namely the statutory, revaluation and capital reserves. With preference share capital staying intact, the issued share capital of the group will come down from Pounds 256m to Pounds 105m. About Pounds 17m will be left in the share premium reserve. The amount in the group's accumulated profit and loss account after the interim losses comes down to Pounds 424m. This will leave pro forma shareholders' funds at about Pounds 1.8bn, compared with the Pounds 2.54bn quoted in yesterday's accounts, before the reorganisation provision. Net debt on June 30 stood at Pounds 987m, made up of Pounds 1.22bn of advance payments, mainly from defence customers, and Pounds 230m of cash balances. The pro forma debt-equity ratio would be about 55 per cent. BAe said that this level of borrowings was acceptable since working capital requirements reached a peak in the summer and the reorganisation would reduce the cash drain in the regional aircraft operation.</p>

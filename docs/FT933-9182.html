			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Contest for EC funds considered THE GOVERNMENT may force local authorities and local economic development agencies to enter formal competitions for European Community regional funds. The Department of Trade Industry said yesterday it was considering such a scheme for the funds, which are to help areas of industrial decline and urban deprivation, but added: 'It is just an idea that's being looked at, at the moment.' The idea, however, has been discussed for several months and owes its origins to City Challenge, a competition devised in 1991 by Mr Michael Heseltine, when he was environment secretary. Local private- and public-sector partnerships were invited to bid for the funding of regeneration programmes concentrated on a specific urban area. Any new competition would be for what the EC calls Objective Two funds, flowing from Brussels between 1994 and 1996. Although local authorities have already started lobbying Whitehall in the hope of obtaining support for inclusion on the map of eligible areas, the European Commission will not finalise the map until the autumn. Between 1989 and 1993 the EC provided Pounds 229m of Objective Two funding for the UK. Local authorities made bids for use of the money through the UK government but bids did not always reach the total sum available from Brussels. This was because the government, to the anger of the Commission, would simply deduct a sum equivalent to the EC funding from its planned grants to a local authority. The government now has greater scope to stage a competition because it has agreed to abide by the EC rules of providing funding to match any EC grant. This makes the funding more attractive to local authorities. Past practice suggests that government rules for any competition are likely to lay emphasis on, and give funding preference to, partnerships between the private and the public sector. But the rules will have to be approved by the Commission. The DTI will handle the negotiations with the Commission but the Department of Environment will administer any competition and disburse the funds for the EC.</p>

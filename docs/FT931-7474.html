			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Philips strengthens Grundig ties PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics company, plans to boost co-operation with Grundig, its 31.6 per cent-owned German affiliate, in a renewed effort to revive both companies' consumer electronics operations. The Dutch company also said it would consolidate Grundig in its own accounts starting with the 1992 financial year. The move is seen as a signal of Philips' determination to integrate and rationalise loss-making Grundig. The Dutch company - whose 1992 results on March 4 are expected to show the extent of the difficulties it faces in consumer electronics - said 'drastic cost reductions can only be achieved if both companies avoid duplication of efforts, especially in the areas of development and manufacturing'. Philips declined to say what kind of rationalisation it had in mind, although it noted that the two companies had already agreed to combine efforts in production of video cassette recorders and cordless telephones. Mr Joost van Beek, an analyst at Pierson, Heldring &amp; Pierson in Amsterdam, said a similar arrangement in television set production could be next. Philips said it had no plans for boosting its stake in Grundig and emphasised that Grundig would retain its own corporate identity. Philips said the consolidation would have no effect on Philips' bottom line when the company publishes 1992 results next week, as Grundig's figures would have been included anyway under 'net income from non-consolidated companies'. However, Philips' shares fell by 3.8 per cent to Fl 22.60 as the Amsterdam stock market focused on the company's statement that it had a long-standing agreement to finance Grundig's losses. Grundig, which posted a loss of DM19m in 1991/92, is expected to lose more than DM200m (Pounds 84.7m) in 1992/93. Philips promised to give details of its funding commitment to Grundig when it releases its results. Philips, which appoints Grundig's management, acquired a 24.5 per cent stake in the company in 1979 and raised this to 31.6 per cent in 1984, the year in which it undertook to guarantee funding for any losses.</p>

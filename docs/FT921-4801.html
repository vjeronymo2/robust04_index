			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Letter: Action groups at Lloyd's set out to assist, not to destroy Sir, I read Tom Benyon's letter ( 'Lloyd's must be resolved without bitterness, abuse and rancour', February 25) with interest. It conveyed the welcome message of a desire to control forces which have been let loose and, fanned by some sections of the press and an alliance of cross-party politicians, threaten to get out of control. The Association of Lloyd's Members helped to create action groups to assist the loss-review inquiries in the discovery of the facts behind stricken syndicates' losses and then possibly to pursue their rightful recovery through the courts. The apparent Outhwaite settlement confirms this course of action to be a valid procedure, and the action groups cannot be blamed for using tactics which they consider to be appropriate. However, a word of caution: action group members presumably have no wish in so doing to destabilise the Lloyd's institution and, in particular, to destroy its customers' confidence. To do that would surely raise the stakes to an unacceptably high level. Action group members who feel that there is a risk of this should register their views with their groups' committees. Mutualisation is suggested as an alternative. The Lloyd's Council cannot impose this retrospectively on the majority of Names; nor does the E &amp; 0 underwriters' agreement to an out-of-court settlement mean mutualisation by the back door. That is the response of a relevant policy to a claim disputed and subsequently settled. If a substantial majority of Names feel that a solution to the current crisis is through mutualisation, they must make their views known. The sums are likely to be substantial, however, as I suspect the Task Force has already discovered.

The Science Council  (chairman, Ken'ichi Fukui), an MOE advisory organ, compiled a  report on university research reactors confirming that such  reactors would continue to be used. The debate about keeping the  reactors going, which included the issues of whether  universities should have their own reactors for research or  whether they should use JAERI's reactors, and what sort of  atomic energy research universities should do, concluded in the  decision to continue along the same route as in the past.    The Science Council's report is entitled "About How Nuclear  Reactors for University Research Should Be." In that report the  Science Council notes the importance of the KUR "as a reactor  with which significant scientific research may be carried out in  the future," and positively assesses the KUR's role from the  viewpoint of scientific research and the cultivation of talented  researchers. The report approves the continued use of the KUR  with certain conditions attached, one of which is that the  research to be carried out with the reactor matches the  characteristics of the facility.    However, in regard to how the KUR will be handled from now  on, the report emphasizes that maintenance, such as  "preventative maintenance of auxiliary facilities that is  important for safety ensurance," is needed to guarantee the  safety and reliability of the reactor. In addition, there are  conditions attached to organizational management methods, e.g.,  every few years the reactor would be evaluated on its joint use  and the state of research implementation.    With that, Kyoto University will begin to formulate a new  research plan based on the contents of the report. After the new  plan is explained to groups such as the Osaka-fu Nuclear Reactor  Problems Council and the Kumatori-machi Nuclear Power Problems  and Countermeasures Conference, the organizational changes based  on the new plan will be incorporated into the FY95 rough  [budget] requests.    The KUR is the only university-instituted megawatt-class  reactor, and, as a joint-use research institute for all of  Japan's universities since first criticality in 1964, over 8,000  researchers have been using the reactor in areas such as  radiation medicine and materials experiments that utilize the  neutrons produced by nuclear fission. In 1976 a plan to  construct a second reactor surfaced because of the KUR's  deterioration. Due to the local residents' opposition, however,  the plan was withdrawn in 1990, and the problem of whether or  not to shut the KUR down has been pending.    On the other hand, because of the refurbishing of JAERI's  JRR-3 research reactor (thermal output, 20,000 kW; in  Tokai-mura, Ibaraki Prefecture), the JRR-3 can now be used for  advanced research, and the necessity of "a university-owned  nuclear reactor" is being questioned. Given such a situation,  since 1990 the Science Council has been debating about whether  to maintain the KUR or to shut it down.</p>

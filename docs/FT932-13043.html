			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Europeans look for US lead on Bosnia EC FOREIGN ministers left open the possibility of using military force against the Bosnian Serbs at the end of their two-day meeting at Hindsgavl Castle in Denmark, but made it clear they will exert that option with profound reluctance and only under pressure from the US. Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, the Danish foreign minister who chaired the talks, echoed majority sentiment when he told a news conference yesterday that he remained unconvinced about the value of military intervention. 'I have great difficulty in seeing the really positive aspect and why it would go a long way to solve the problem (in Yugoslavia).' But Mr Petersen, a member of Denmark's Radical Liberal party, which has a strong pacifist streak, seemed unclear whether the tighter UN sanctions due to go into effect today would persuade the Bosnian Serbs to sign the Vance-Owen plan sponsored by the EC and UN. After being reminded that Serbia-Montenegro - the rump republics of former Yugoslavia - had already been threatened with expulsion from all international organisations without obvious effect, Mr Petersen issued a correction. On April 30, a meeting of the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation was due to take place; and he for one was adamant that Serbia should not be allowed to attend. Ministers insisted, but without great conviction, that the tighter sanctions approved by the UN a week ago would start to bite. They noted the raging inflation in Serbia, and the sharp fall in imports; and they pledged to enforce the sanctions more effectively - possibly through a 'Super Co-ordinator' who could make the many international organisations such as the CSCE, West European Union, EC, and the United Nations work more efficiently. The most telling point, however, was that the EC/UN team had not had enough people to operate around the clock to block traffic on the Danube. Tougher noises emanated from the French and British, who supply the bulk of the UN force in Bosnia. Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, said lifting the arms embargo against the Bosnian Moslems or supplying large numbers of ground forces were not acceptable; but France was ready to discuss tighter sanctions and possible selective air strikes. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said air strikes needed to be consistent with international law, with due regard to UK troops and the overall UN humanitarian effort to supply besieged towns. Despite their common reservations about military intervention, the French and British positions are blurred because London does not share Paris's desire for a new UN resolution. Partly, this reflects France's desire not to be marching to US orders; but it also suggests France believes there are political benefits in Russian support. This week, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, or possibly Mr Reginald Bartholomew, the US special envoy, is expected in Europe for further consultations with the UK and France. He will discover an EC hesitant, divided and frustrated - and once again looking to the US for a lead.</p>

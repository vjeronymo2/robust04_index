			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Ford plans luxury car for world market FORD, the US carmaker, is considering the development of a new medium-sized luxury car as its next world car programme in North America and Europe. The programme would include a version for Jaguar, its UK luxury car subsidiary. The programme opens the possibility of building a car under the Jaguar name for the first time outside the UK, although Jaguar's preferred option would still be to assemble the vehicle at its main Coventry plant. The scope of the project underlines Ford's determination to integrate Jaguar closely into the group, and follows its decision last year to build a new Jaguar engine range at Ford's engine plant at Bridgend, south Wales. Last week, the company unveiled the Ford Mondeo in Europe as part of its first world car project to replace the Ford Sierra in Europe and the Ford Tempo/Mercury Topaz in the US. Since its takeover by Ford three years ago, Jaguar has planned to develop a smaller luxury sports saloon for introduction in the late 1990s to rival products such as the BMW 5 Series and aimed at more than tripling its production by the end of the decade. Mr Louis Ross, Ford vice-chairman and chief technical officer, said this car and a replacement for Ford of Europe's Ford Granada/Scorpio executive car were under consideration as derivatives of a possible new Ford world car project, code-named DEW98. A version for North America would be a so-called 'near luxury car' that would extend Ford's traditional Lincoln luxury car range and give the US carmaker a product with which to compete in North America against Japanese and European luxury car imports such as the recently unveiled Lexus GS 300, the Infiniti J30, and the BMW 5 Series. The DEW98 project is not a confirmed programme, and the company has not decided where the European derivative versions would be built. Mr Ross said an important aim of the project was to integrate Jaguar more closely so that its new smaller car would have a common chassis platform with Ford. 'Jaguar must get interchangeability of platform.' BMW, the German executive and luxury car maker, announced plans last year to build its first car plant in the US, and Mr Ross said the new Jaguar range could also be built in North America. 'It is possible to build it in the US. It would not take anything away from Browns Lane (Jaguar's Coventry assembly plant)', as this would be additional volume, he said. Jaguar's preferred option was to build the car in Coventry, said Mr Ross, but it was still 'an open issue . . . they are not adamant, they are willing to consider'. The marketing impact on the Jaguar brand image of not building the car in the UK would 'depend on how good the vehicle is', said Mr Ross. 'The ideal would be to build it in the UK . . . but you must get the same cost structure and quality in Europe and in the UK.' He said that it should be possible in the DEW98 programme to maintain '50-60 per cent commonality' of components among different model derivatives while ensuring unique styling, appearance and suspension.</p>

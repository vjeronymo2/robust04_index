			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vadim Nesvizhskiy under the "Boundaries" rubric: </F> "Can an `Alien' Become a Cossack?: Russia Creating Military-Type  Settlements on Land Bordering Finland and Estonia"]    [Text] "The call-up for the Cossack troops which we have  been awaiting for some time has begun." These were the words  spoken by Ataman Boris Almazov of the Northwestern Cossack  District as he commented on the decision made by the leadership  of Russia's Border Troops relative to granting Cossacks three  border control points on land bordering Finland and Estonia, for  which they must recruit the manpower. Under quotas set by the  Northwestern Border District, the Cossack association Nevskaya  Stanitsa and the Northwestern Cossack District are to supply 30  conscripts to each of three border control points, with one each  near Vyborg, in Karelia, and in Pskov Oblast. The general idea  is that Cossacks are to be recruited in three call-ups to render  the three control points all-Cossack in nature.    Mr. Almazov also said that it is assumed that, after  completing their term as conscripts, most of the Cossacks will  stay on at the control points by taking up contract service. "A  criterion we applied in selecting the control points was  availability of land which can in the future be transferred to  the Cossacks so they can conduct their own economy. In the case  of the Pskov Oblast border control point, for example, land is  available, and everything is ready for Cossacks to settle at the  new border," said Boris Almazov to SEGODNYA's correspondent. It  is thought that, starting with the next call-up, Cossacks  assigned to serve at the border will undergo--in addition to  basic training-- special training to be administered in Cossack  associations located in Saint Petersburg.    The Nevskaya Stanitsa and Cossack circle are already  preparing for a ceremonial send-off to the border, with this to  include a mandatory prayer service and parting speeches by  atamans. However, with the problem of the border troop  leadership resolved, the atamans ran into an unexpected  obstacle: It came to light that there were only 80 men  requesting assignment to Mr. Almazov's 90 billets, with 30 of  them conscripts and 50 contract servicemen. The Cossack ataman  remarked that although the present call-up is being carried out  in haste, it would otherwise still be difficult to recruit even  this small number of men wishing to serve at the border.    In addition, representative of the RF Northwestern Border  Troop District commander Sergey Dugalev, who has doubts about  the possibility of realizing the idea of purely Cossack border  control points, said that the military commissariat has so far  received only 13 requests for the Cossack billets. On top of  that, Mr. Dugalev is not sure that young Cossacks will wish to  settle in a new area and remain on duty on a contract basis even  after they complete 18 months of service: "There is always the  possibility that the Cossacks will not remain in border duty  service after being granted land."    Nonetheless, Cossack atamans are full of optimism, stating  that they are in favor of assigning to the new generation an  elderly man who would live in the same barracks as the inductees  and pass on to the young men "the Cossack traditions and  spiritual values." The Cossacks, attempting to resolve the  manpower shortage problem, decided to "expand the ranks."  Nevskaya Stanitsa Campaign Ataman and Russian Army Lieutenant  Colonel Dmitriy Simyakin explained: "We decided to make an  exception, starting this year, by enlisting for Cossack service  youths of non-Cossack origin instead of Cossacks by blood."    Northwestern Cossack District Ataman Boris Almazov,  commenting on the above decision, remarked that "Cossacks at the  present time constitute the sole Russian national movement that  has a national, non-extremist orientation," and that not all  ethic origins may have representatives as new members of the  Cossack society. "We will not accept ancient enemies of  Orthodoxy," stated the Cossack leader of the Russian Northwest,  who is forming detachments for duty at the border control points.    Boris Almazov, characterizing the recent incident occurring  on the Russian-Estonian border in which violators killed one man  and wounded two others as a "real border conflict," stated that  the border should be closed, and the ones best able to handle  that are the Cossacks. This, especially considering the fact  that there are cadres who have completed their "trial period,"  in that in the Fedorovka Stanitsa, which is included in the  Nevskaya Stanitsa, most members have done some fighting on the  side of the Bosnian Serbs.    Incidentally, the above holds true only in case the "best  cadres" are not employed elsewhere: According to the statement  made by Nevskaya Stanitsa Campaign Ataman Mr. Simyakin, if NATO  does not discontinue bombing Serbian positions, and if Russia,  "does not as in 1914 set out to help her brotherly Serbs,"  Russia's Northwestern Cossacks will once again undertake sending  volunteers to the Bosnian fronts. Then our border apparently  will have to wait.</p>

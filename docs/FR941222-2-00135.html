			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Combination Care and Prevention Services Programs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants proposing to provide both care and prevention services must meet the requirements for both categories as described above. They must also propose to make a substantial effort in each of the two areas and indicate clearly in the application and budget the proportion of effort to be expanded in each component. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 2006(b)(1) of Title XX requires each grantee to expend at least one percent but not more than five percent of the Federal funds received under Title XX on evaluation of the project. As this is a demonstration program, all applications are required to have an evaluation component of high quality consistent with the scope of the proposed project and the funding level. All project evaluations should monitor program processes to determine whether the program has been carried out as planned and measure the program's outcomes. Waivers of the five percent limit on evaluation (see sec. 2006(b)(1)) may be granted in cases where a more rigorous or comprehensive evaluation effort is proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 2006(b)(2) requires that an organization or an entity independent of the grantee providing services assist the grantee in evaluating the project. The OAPP strongly recommends extensive collaboration between the applicant organization and the proposed evaluator in the development of the intervention, development of the evaluation hypothesis(es), identification of the variables to be measured and a timetable for initiation of the intervention, baseline measurement, and ongoing evaluation data collection and analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Application Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications must be submitted on the forms supplied (PHS 5161&hyph;1, Revised 7/92) and in the manner prescribed in the application kits provided by the OAPP. Applicants are required to submit an application signed by an individual authorized to act for the applicant agency or organization and to assume for the organization the obligations imposed by the terms and conditions of the grant award.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Applications sent by FAX will not be accepted. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants must be familiar with the entire statute, which is included in the application kit, to ensure that they have complied with all applicable requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be noted that grantees may not teach or promote religion in their AFL project. Each grant project must be accessible to the public generally, not just to those of a particular religious affiliation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 2011(a) of the Act, AFL projects may not provide abortions or abortion counseling or referral either directly or through subcontract and may not advocate, promote or encourage abortion. However, if both the adolescent and her parents request abortion counseling, a project may provide referral for such counseling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Additional Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants for grants must also meet the following requirements: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Requirements for Review of an Application by the Governor.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 2006(e) of Title XX requires that each applicant shall provide the Governor of the State in which the applicant is located a copy of each application submitted to OAPP for a grant for a demonstration project for services under this Title. The Governor has 60 days from the receipt date in which to provide comments to the applicant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An applicant may comply with this requirement by submitting a copy of the application to the Governor of the State in which the applicant is located at the same time the application is submitted to OAPP. To inform the Governor's office of the reason for the submission, a copy of this notice should be attached to the application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Review Under Executive Order 12372.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications under this announcement are subject to the review requirements of E.O. 12372 State Review of Applications for Federal Financial Assistance, as implemented by 45 CFR part 100 (Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs).

Applicants will be so notified, and the applications will be returned. All other applications will be reviewed by a multidisciplinary panel of independent reviewers and assessed according to the following criteria: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The capacity of the proposed applicant organization to provide rapid and effective use of resources needed to conduct the project, collect data and evaluate it.

(20 points) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Final grant award decisions will be made by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Populations Affairs. In making these decisions, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs will take into account the extent to which grants approved for funding will provide an appropriate geographic distribution of resources, the priorities in sec. 2005(a), and the other factors in sec. 2005, including consideration of:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The applicant's capacity to administer funds responsibly; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The incidence of adolescent pregnancy and the availability of services in the geographic area to be served; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The population to be served; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The community commitment to and involvement in planning and implementation of the demonstration project; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The organizational model(s) for delivery of service; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The usefulness for policymakers and service providers of the proposed project and its potential for complementing existing adolescent health models; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) The reasonableness of the estimated cost to the government considering the anticipated results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OAPP does not release information about individual applications during the review process until final funding decisions have been made. When these decisions have been made, applicants will be notified by letter of the outcome of their applications. The official document notifying an applicant that an application has been approved for funding is the Notice of Grant Award, which specifies to the grantees the amount of money awarded, the purpose of the grant, the terms and conditions of the grant award, and the amount of funding to be contributed by the grantee to project costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: November 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Felicia H.

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Money Markets: Large repo rate cut THERE WAS a strong rise in D-Mark and French franc futures yesterday after the Bundesbank reduced its repo rate by more than the market had expected, writes James Blitz. The Bundesbank cut the repo rate - which sets the cost of lending short-dated funds to commercial banks - from 8.09 per cent to 7.75 per cent. Some dealers were impressed that the repo rate cut was greater than last week's 25 basis points lowering of the discount rate to 7.25 per cent. The repo reduction forced the June contract up to a high of 92.80 from a previous 92.70. The September contract was up on even heavier volume, from a previous close of 93.55 to a high of 93.65. However, the contracts later fell back as the German bund market declined on fears that easier monetary policy would lead to higher inflation. A dealer recalled that Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, had said that the central bank would look at the long end of the market when planning its rate-cutting strategy. The June contract receded to finish at 92.74 and the September contract at 93.60. German call money closed rather firmer, at around 7.72 per cent, following a net drain of funds in the Bundesbank's weekly operation. The repo cut had a more lasting impact on the French franc market, raising speculation of another easing in France's officially posted interest rates today. One-month French francs dropped from about 9.25 per cent to below 8.00 per cent. Three-month French francs were about 100 basis points lower at one stage, falling to about 7.80 per cent. The June French franc contract surged to a close of 92.23 from a previous 91.98. Sterling futures rose in tandem with Euromarks, with the June contract peaking 7 basis points higher at 93.97. However, it slipped back to end more or less unchanged on the day as sterling lost ground against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges. Three-month money closed little changed at 6 1/16 per cent, having been as low as 6 per cent at one stage. The one-year rate finished slightly higher at 6 1/4 per cent. The small shortage of Pounds 600m was partly the cause of the easier cash situation, pushing the overnight lending rate down to 2 per cent at around lunchtime.</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Tories and Labour still neck and neck THE FIERCEST period of pre-election campaigning in recent memory has still failed to give either of the two main political parties their much-sought breakthrough, according to a batch of opinion polls released last night. As the conviction grows at Westminster that Mr John Major will not duck an April 9 election, there was nothing in the findings to convince either party that they can be confident of an overall majority. The first soundings on voters' reaction to Mr Paddy Ashdown's revelation of an affair with his former secretary five years ago also suggested that the scandal may have little effect in the polling booths. While the Tories are taking comfort in figures showing them ahead, Labour will argue that the government's month-long assault on its tax and spending plans have used up its best shots without winning a decisive advantage. Today, the focus switches to local government with Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, attacking the records of Labour councils and Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, highlighting the poll tax as the key 'symbol' of Tory waste in a keynote speech to a Labour's conference in Blackpool. On Saturday, the prime minister will deliver his riposte at the annual Young Conservatives' rally in Eastbourne. But in spite of the frenzied atmosphere in Westminster, public opinion remains equivocal. A Gallup 'snapshot' poll for The Daily Telegraph, conducted between January 29 and February 3, gives the Tories 42.5 per cent or five points ahead of Labour - a sharp turnabout on last week's 1.5 point Labour lead but a close reflection of the same poll's findings in mid-January. However, in the much larger Gallup 9000 poll, carried out throughout January from a sample of nearly 11,000, Labour has pulled ahead by a statistically insignificant 0.2 points to 39.2 points - its first lead in this survey for four months. That second verdict appeared to be reflected in the findings of a Harris poll of 1,097 voters for The Daily Express. Conducted over the past two days, it has Labour in a one-point lead on 40 per cent (unchanged on last month) with the Tories dropping back to 39 (41). The three polls put Liberal Democrat support varying from 14 (Gallup snapshot) to 17 (Harris). In a separate telephone poll on voters' reaction to Mr Ashdown's revelation, Gallup found that 82.6 per cent supported his continuing as Liberal Democrat leader, with only 4.6 per cent arguing that he should resign. The polls came as Labour launched a series of onslaughts on the government's economic record. At question time, Mr Kinnock attacked Mr Major's claims this week that the Japanese economy faced recession, saying that a slowdown was not the same as the state of the UK's economy, now 'in reverse'. He added: 'The prime minister, because of his policies, is reduced to imagining recovery at home, while inventing recession abroad.' Mr Major replied that Labour's policies would replace low taxation and low inflation with high tax rates and high inflation and would reverse the best industrial relations record Britain had enjoyed for half a century.

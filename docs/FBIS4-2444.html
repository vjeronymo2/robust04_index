			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Zheng Degang (6774 1795 0474) and </F> XINHUA reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511)]    [Text] Guangzhou, 10 Apr (XINHUA) -- Following a series of  measures taken by Chinese Government departments to curb and  crack down on the illegal export of textiles through the transit  trade, such activities have been brought under control.    Shi Guangsheng, vice minister of foreign trade and economic  cooperation, made the above announcement at the fourth national  work conference on cracking down on the illegal export of  textiles through the transit trade, which opened today. The  conference, which is cosponsored by the Ministry of Foreign  Trade and Economic Cooperation, the General Administration of  Customs, and the State Bureau of Commodity Inspection, will  formulate a set of specific procedures for cracking down on  illegal transit activities and will name a number of enterprises  involved in the illegal export of textiles through the transit  trade.    Illegal transit textiles are textile products which were  originally made in China but which were exported through  fraudulent means to avoid the controls of textile quotas and  through the transit trade via third countries or regions to  countries having a quota limit on imports of Chinese textiles.  The vice minister said: Such activities violate not only  Chinese laws and regulations but also international agreements  and relevant bilateral accords, thus seriously jeopardizing  China's foreign trade export conditions and environment.  Recently, China has strengthened efforts to crack down on the  illegal export of textiles through the transit trade. Principal  leaders of local economic and trade commissions, customs  offices, and commodity inspection departments, as well as  textile companies, have strengthened their leadership over this  work, while many localities have set up joint task forces, have  formulated a series of rules and regulations, and have  publicized them through various documents and the media, thereby  enabling more enterprises to realize the serious harm caused by  such illegal transit textiles and thereby bringing such  activities under control.    He pointed out, however: The problem of illegal transit  exports has not been totally solved. Although the Ministry of  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the General  Administration of Customs, and the State Bureau of Commodity  Inspection have stepped up the efforts to curb and crack down on  such illegal activities, and although the amount of illegal  transit textiles exported after clearing customs is really  insignificant, there still exist in Chinese territory a number  of productive and operational undertakings aimed at illegally  exporting textiles through the transit trade. Although the  majority of foreign trade companies are aware of the need to  crack down on the illegal export of textiles through the transit  trade, and although they understand the relevant regulations  against such illegal activities, some enterprises, especially  foreign-funded enterprises and village and township enterprises,  know little about the situation. For this reason, most of the  problems result from them. Judging from the small number of  cases uncovered occasionally, they resorted to more deceitful  means.    Shi Guangsheng said: In cracking down in the future on the  illegal export of textile products through the transit trade, we  will -- in accordance with the laws and statutes of the Ministry  of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, of customs, and of  the goods inspection administration, and proceeding from the  characteristics of their professional work -- concentrate on  quickly formulating a crackdown measure which stresses the  division of work to check illegal activities and which also  stresses coordination, and we will put this into effect as soon  as possible. This year we will concentrate on the following  tasks: While integrating prevention with control and cracking  down, we will mainly rely on prevention; we will continue to  carry out random checks of key areas and enterprises, strengthen  the training of personnel assigned to crack down on the illegal  transit trade in textile products, and coordinate closely with  the governments of the relevant countries or the authorities of  the relevant regions in the joint effort to crack down on the  illegal transit trade.</p>

			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Paying the price of traffic jams: A city's proposal to fit meters to all vehicles THE journey from Cambridge railway station to Cambridgeshire County Council's headquarters was short: but not so short as to prevent the taxi driver making his point. 'It's a complete load of old cobblers,' he explained. 'It's bad enough that you should have to sit in a traffic jam at all, without having to pay for the privilege.' Yet pay he might, along with every other driver in Cambridge: for the city is planning to be the first in Europe to charge people on a pay-as-you-go basis for the use of its roads. The idea of rationing road space by charging for it - known as road pricing  -is gaining ground as offering the most realistic solution to traffic congestion, particularly in urban areas. Until now, European governments have preferred to live with worsening traffic jams rather than risk the political repercussions of introducing such a scheme. But in Cambridge the county council has been thrust into the vanguard of transport planning by a mounting traffic crisis. The city's rapid economic growth has caused traffic on the main radial roads to increase by 47 per cent over the past 10 years, and it is forecast to rise by another 40 per cent by the end of the decade. The existing roads simply cannot cope, and increasing road capacity would mean demolishing swathes of the city centre. The Conservative-controlled county council has decided that the only alternative is to manage demand. The method it has chosen is to discourage people from using scarce road space at the busiest times by charging drivers who add to congestion. Vehicles would be fitted with meters which monitored their progress through the traffic. Any vehicle stopping four times or more within any  1/2 -km stretch, or taking more than three minutes to cover the same distance, would start clocking up units which would be charged to the driver. For example, the traffic planners estimate that a typical 5km journey would clock up between four and eight units. If the units were priced at 20p, the journey would cost between 80p and Pounds 1.60. Drivers would pay their charges with pre-paid smart cards, rather like phonecards, which would be inserted into the meter and debited as the journey progressed. A visual display would tell drivers how many debits remained. The meter would be linked to the fuel system and would theoretically cut off the fuel supply when credits ran out. In practice, an 'overdraft' would be allowed up to, say, 50 units to give people time to obtain a fresh supply of cards. Normally dormant, the meters would come into operation when activated by micro-wave signals emitted from roadside beacons at all 17 entry points to the city. Similar signals would switch the meters off as vehicles left. Meters would be fitted compulsorily, but free of charge, to all vehicles normally kept within 12 miles of the city centre. Some 92 per cent of all journeys into the centre originate within a 12-mile radius. Visitors from further afield would buy day passes from machines at city entry points. These would be priced at slightly above the average cost of a metered city centre journey. Day passes would be placed in windscreens and, as with the meters, would respond to the micro-wave signals from the roadside beacons. Vehicles failing to respond as they passed an entry point would be automatically photographed so that the drivers could be traced through their registration numbers and penalised. Ultimately, the aim would be to use the proceeds from the system to construct a light rapid-transit railway which would provide car drivers with an alternative means of entry to the city. The system is the brainchild of Mr Brian Oldridge, transport director at Cambridgeshire County Council. It is being developed by Newcastle University with a grant from the Science and Engineering Research Council. At present, the only other road pricing system is in Singapore, where motorists have to buy a daily or weekly permit if they want to drive into the city centre during the morning peak. Permits are checked by police at the city's 29 entry points. Mr Oldridge says the fault with the Singapore system is that it represents a tax on entry to the city which does not relate directly to the use of the road space. Under the Cambridge system, people will pay only when they add directly to congestion. The cost, too, will depend on the motorists themselves. If large numbers of them insist on using busy roads at busy times, their journey costs will rise as delays worsen. If, conversely, they try to avoid adding to congestion, the traffic jams will ease and journey costs will come down. 'Our plan follows simple free-market principles,' he says. 'Motorists themselves will define the tolerance level. If the congestion price is too high, it will meet resistance from the market and the price will come down.' Mr Oldridge is hoping to get a trial of the system in operation by 1994 with a view to introducing a full-scale system in 1996. Before then, the county council will have to seek appropriate powers through a private bill. Inevitably, this will cause controversy. Surprisingly there seems remarkably little opposition locally. Mr Oldridge says a city-centre pedestrianisation scheme has brought more objections. He has received only eight letters on the subject of road pricing, with more of them in favour than against. If the taxi driver represents the majority, it appears to be a silent one. Editorial comment, Page 22</p>

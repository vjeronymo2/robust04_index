			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: US activities put United Uniform Pounds 2.66m in black REBIRTH in the US enabled United Uniform Services to report taxable profits of Pounds 2.66m for the 12 months to December 31. Sales amounted to Pounds 29.85m. In its former existence the company was Amercoeur, whose activities mining anthracite in Wales produced losses of Pounds 269,000 in 1989 on sales of Pounds 182,000. It evolved into its new form via the acquisition of Horace Small, one of the largest suppliers of non-military uniforms in the US. A seven-month contribution from this subsidiary took profits on from the Pounds 421,000 achieved at the interim stage. In October, United consolidated its new direction with the Dollars 9.7m purchase of Hub-Stinette, a privately-owned distributor of uniforms and career wear. Mr Mark Vaughan-Lee, chairman, said United was confident of substantial rises in sales and profits this year. A final dividend of 1.5p is recommended on earnings of 12.9p (37.1p deficit). The shares yesterday added 17p to 105p.</p>

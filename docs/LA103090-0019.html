			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: EX-GOLFER NOT PUT OUT TO PASTURE -- HE'S LAWN BOWLING  </P> <P> The way Claude (Tag) Taggert figures it, lawn bowling has been sort of a  lifesaver for him.  </P> <P> He's a longtime physical-fitness buff whose pastimes such as golf and tennis  were curtailed by asthma.  </P> <P> Ten years ago when a doctor suggested that Taggert join him in lawn bowling, "I  told him I was too young for it."  </P> <P> But two years ago Taggert decided it was a game for him, and the 78-year-old  Costa Mesa man, who once set a world record in the high jump, now admits, "I  wish I had started it then."  </P> <P> The onetime Indiana farm boy set the world's record in the Senior Olympics in  the 70 to 75 age group. "I had just turned 70, so I had a lot more youth going  for me than the rest of the competitors," he quipped.  </P> <P> His jump of 4 feet, 8 inches, eclipsing the old mark by half an inch, has since  been broken.  </P> <P> Taggert admits he was not a star athlete or close to it during his college days  at Ball State University, where he played basketball and competed in track and  field events, including the high jump.  </P> <P> "But I was always involved in sports," said the physical education major, who  placed a high priority on his spiritual beliefs after getting asthma.  </P> <P> In those early days, "I learned that keeping fit and eating the right kind of  food helped keep a person healthy," he said.  </P> <P> So during his years as a high school coach, a Navy officer in World War II and  a salesman after that, Taggert kept himself fit with rigorous sports until a  few years back when asthma got a grip on him.  </P> <P> Now Taggert is trying to lure others into lawn bowling, especially younger men.  "You know, guys in their 50s and 60s," teased the Newport Harbor Lawn Bowling  Club member.  </P> <P> He points out that the United States is far behind other countries in promoting  lawn bowling as a sport. "In new Zealand, they have a lot of young players," he  said.  </P> <P> To do his part in developing players, Taggert has been teaching lawn bowling at  the Newport Harbor Lawn Bowling Club in Corona del Mar under the sponsorship of  Coastline Community College.  </P> <P> "Lawn bowling is a game that's very popular in the rest of the world,  especially in the British Commonwealth, but relatively unknown in the United  States," he said. "College students only know it as a game played by seniors.  That image would change if they would just try the sport."  </P> <P> It appears that message is coming across, since 31 bowlers of various ages were  attracted to a nine-week course that started in September.  </P> <P> Besides playing, the students learn the history of the game, rules, etiquette,  scoring method, team play and strategy.  </P> <P> Taggert admits that while he was a "pretty good golfer" with an eight handicap,  he's just a fairly good bowler.  </P> <P> "A lot of bowlers are better than me," he said.  </P> <P> Bowling is more than competition, he said. "It's the greatest therapy for  someone getting older because it keeps their joints and muscles flexible."  </P> <P> But he adds that the game is also "challenging, interesting and more exciting  than it looks."  </P> <P> Don Boisseranc is in the custom house business, but for dogs.  </P> <P> "A lot of people want me to make the doghouse match their own house with  windows and tile roofs," said the Newport Beach man who calls his fledgling  business Pedigree Estates.  </P> <P> When he isn't contracting for dog houses he works in his cleverly named Corona  BeFORE AND AFTer Marine Service.  </P> <P> Like custom luxury homes, custom dog houses bear hefty price tags.  </P> <P> They usually range from $350 to $750, although he once duplicated a client's  house for the owner's dog at a cost of $1,500.  </P></p>

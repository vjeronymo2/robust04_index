			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Baby, You're a Rich Man: A 26-year-old college student shelled out $18,000 for  Paul McCartney's birth certificate at an auction in Houston Sunday.  </P> <P> Brian Taylor, a self-described "Beatles freak," said that he didn't necessarily  buy the document as an investment but would sell it if the price is right. Bids  came from as far away as Australia and Japan, and started at $10,000. "It's  ridiculous," Taylor said. "People are just ridiculous. I'm ridiculous for  buying it. . . ." CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

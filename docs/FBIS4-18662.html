			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Florian Gerster: "Personnel Is No Disposable </F> Item That Can Be Changed at Will"]    [Text] It is difficult for the Bundeswehr to keep up with  current developments. In the summer of 1990, a peacetime  strength of 370,000 soldiers was stipulated. This figure, which  was bindingly agreed upon during the Two Plus Four Talks with  the former Soviet Union in 1990, seem to be the only basis for  all considerations concerning the structure of the Armed Forces.  However, it is based on structural considerations concerning the  military services that were made at a time when the collapse of  the East Bloc and Germany's reunification were just becoming  apparent.    Thus, the goals of Army Structure 5, which was initiated in  the middle of the 1980's and which has not yet been implemented  completely, are still valid today. Moreover, the equipment of  the Air Force and the Navy is still based on targets that did  not yet take into consideration the fundamental  security-political changes in Europe. The Federal Government,  Mr. Ruehe in particular, has not made any useful proposals for  the adaptation of the structures of the Armed Forces to the new  situation that would help the Bundeswehr overcome the lack of  orientation that was bound to develop.    As recently as during the 1993 budget debate, Chancellor  Kohl  and Defense Minister Ruehe still insisted vigorously on the  planned strength of 370,000 soldiers and 155,000 civilian  employees for the Armed Forces and the Bundeswehr  administration. Even at the security conference in Munich on 5  February, the chancellor confirmed these figures, despite the  finance minister's announcement that 1.25 billion German marks  [DM] have to be saved. He cited the tense situation in the  former Yugoslavia and the uncertainitees of the Russian reform  process as the reasons.    The fact that the Bundeswehr has already been reduced to a  strength of 350,000 because of an acute shortage of funds is  being described evasively as "structure-neutral variation."  This term is nothing but the admission that the lack of 20,000  soldiers is the utmost limit of what the Bundeswehr can handle  without immediate changes concerning the structural objectives.  A comparable gap only existed in the 1950's when the Bundeswehr  was newly established.    The situation shows that the personnel structure of the  Armed  Forces is no longer determined by the goals of the defense  policy but exclusively by the government's budget problems. The  Bundeswehr Association has rightly commented on the government's  most recent decision to reduce the defense budget, stressing  that it deprives the Bundeswehr planning "of the financial  basis, makes the government's often repeated intention to adhere  to a strength of 370,000 men finally incredible, and that it  will largely paralyze the system of training and exercises."    Nothing is to be added to the conclusion of the Bundeswehr  Association that the austerity course will make maintenance and  repair and urgently required structural improvements impossible  in the next few years, which will lead to the closure of even  more barracks and new burdens for the soldiers and their  families. It is common knowledge among experts that the defense  budget is no longer determined by the tasks of the Bundeswehr  but is being used to fill gaps in other spheres.    The government's course not only reveals its inefficiency in  the area of defense but also leads to an increasing lack of  orientation among the troops and administration. This happens  particularly at a time when the Army is exhausted because of the  implementation of German unity.    Since the completion of German unity, the soldiers of the  Bundeswehr and the civilian employees of the Bundeswehr  administration have carried out Herculean labor in restructuring  the Bundeswehr and in adapting to the new tasks. They succeeded  in establishing Bundeswehr barracks in the new laender and in  creating new administrative structures within a very short  period. In addition, they had to handle difficult  reorganization measures and the closure of barracks in the old  laender. These far-reaching changes not only affected the  soldiers involved but, above all, their families.    Some of the decisions on the deployment initiated earlier  still have to be implemented or are in the process of being  realized. Nothing is more important and urgent for the members  of the Bundeswehr than planning continuity and security.  Instead, however, they are confronted with the fact that the  tight budget situation leads to unsystematic cutbacks and  austerity measures in areas where a solid planning concept and  an honest financial framework would have been necessary. None  of the soldiers or civilian employees who were still involved in  the restructuring process in a dedicated manner one year ago  would have thought that the "peace dividend" would be  distributed in such a haphazard manner with disastrous  consequences for the barracks, units, and troops and for  decisions on investments.    A Federal Government that has to fulfill a constitutional  task vis-a-vis our Armed Forces must ensure security in spite of  a decreased military threat and scarce funds. The main task of  the Federal Government continues to be national defense. It  must be in a position, together with the alliance partners, to  deter or ward off external enemies who threaten Germany.  Ensuring security also means equipping the Bundeswehr with  sufficient personnel and material to meet its obligations within  the alliance.    In spite of the disappearance of the East-West conflict and  the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, Germany's territorial  sovereignty can only be guaranteed in the future if the North  Atlantic Alliance can guarantee the territorial sovereignty of  its member states.    I am not surprised that, after the end of the East-West  confrontation, the NATO members who carried the main burden  within the alliance in the past are now calling for a  redistribution of the roles and of the spheres of  responsibility. They increasingly point out the Atlantic or  European responsibility of the alliance partners. At the same  time, organizational structures like the Eurocorps which were  viewed suspiciously in the past are being welcomed. Germany  must be prepared that the range of tasks resulting from NATO  obligations will make the preservation of Germany's defense  capability more expensive.    As compared with the defense assignment, all other tasks of  the Bundeswehr are secondary. This applies to the cases  explicitly stipulated in the Basic Law and to an even greater  extent to missions that may take place at the initiative of the  Federal Government with the approval of the Bundestag. Until a  decision is made by the Constitutional Court, they include all  contributions by the Bundeswehr to the collective safeguarding  of peace. Crisis management and the settlement of conflicts are  the basis of the new planning. The Bundeswehr needs new  structures.    However, these structures must not solely be determined by  the financial situation of the state whose defense the  Bundeswehr is to ensure, as is currently the case. Rather, the  structures must be task-oriented. Every political decision on  the structures of the Armed Forces must be based on  comprehensive considerations. All these considerations are  linked with each other and depend on each other. The isolated  examination of individual components as a basis for decisions is  useless.    When planning for the Armed Forces, one must begin with the  task. It reflects the threat analysis and the risk assessment,  as well as the leeway for action and willingness to act. The  Federal Government defined the task of the Bundeswehr in the  Guidelines on Defense Policy by the federal defense minister,  dated 26 November 1992. What is remarkable about this basic  document designed to outline the principles of security policy,  the task of the Bundeswehr and the major tasks of the Armed  Forces, are the references to threat and the avoidance of risks.    The core of the threat analysis is the statement that  Germany  is no longer within the immediate range of a state capable of a  strategic offensive or of capturing territory. "Germany is no  longer a front-line state." Another passage reads: "The most  dangerous case of a large-scale aggression has become highly  unlikely." Assessing the risks posed by the successor states of  the Soviet Union, the document reads: "A threat for Germany or  its allies can be ruled out in the foreseeable future if the  (NATO) Alliance preserves its ability for flexible deployment  and strategic balance."    As compared with an early warning time of a maximum of 14  days during the Cold War, plans are now based on a militarily  usable warning time of at least one year. The document draws  the following final conclusion: "Military conflicts that might  endanger Germany's existence have become unlikely." The  Guidelines on Defense Policy have the character of a decree in  the defense ministry and are the "binding basis for the work in  the organizational spheres.... and for the safeguarding of  German military interests toward the outside."    The threat analysis of the Social Democratic Party of  Germany  [SPD] is exactly the same. The resolutions on foreign and  security policy adopted by the party conference, which took  place in Wiesbaden on 16-19 November 1993, point out that the  collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the East-West  conflict have fundamentally changed international relations,  particularly on our continent. This opens up big opportunities  but also involves dangers. On the one hand, the dramatic  changes have made it possible to extend peace, freedom, and  prosperity to the whole of Europe. On the other hand, the  negative phenomena accompanying the far-reaching changes that  may entail poverty, disorientation, and bloodshed hold the  danger of a relapse into authoritarian regimes as a result of  ethnic-national conflicts, and of an exacerbating tendency  toward settling conflicts with the use of force.    For this reason, the Bundeswehr, together with its partners,  must provide military protection while at the same time actively  participating in disarmament and confidence-building measures  throughout Europe. The Bundeswehr must continue its efforts to  prevent war and remain capable of effective defense within NATO.    However, the government coalition arrives at a different  conclusion from the Social Democratic opposition concerning the  structures of the Bundeswehr. One of the major reasons is that  the government parties advocate a more comprehensive leeway for  military action for the united Germany, and that they orient  themselves to a greater extent toward a role in foreign and  military policy which they themselves are depriving of the  financial means. This applies particularly to Bundeswehr  missions outside the NATO area and military UN operations that  go beyond blue beret missions. Presently, the dilemma of the  Bundeswehr is that the task of the political leadership goes far  beyond what the financial resources permit.    It is useless in this respect to continue the quarrel  between  the government and the opposition concerning the possibilities  and limits of Bundeswehr missions outside the borders defined by  Article 87a of the Basic Law. The Constitutional Court will  make a binding decision this summer. Before the SPD brought the  matter before the court in Karlsruhe, it launched initiatives  for a clarifying completion of Articles 24 and 87a of the Basic  Law, aimed at limiting the participation of the Bundeswehr in UN  missions to peacekeeping missions (including military emergency  measures) and at rejecting military operations on the part of  the parties to ae conflict.    The Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union  [CDU/CSU] objected to these restrictions. With the  participation in the Somalia mission, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and  Defense Minister Ruehe even forced the smaller coalition partner  Free Democratic Party of Germany to appeal to the Constitutional  Court. If the CDU/CSU continues to point out the vast  difference between the SPD's position and the defense policy of  the federal government and of the parties that support it, this  applies exclusively to the military leeway demanded by the  CDU/CSU.    It is wrong from a security-political viewpoint and harmful  for the future of the Bundeswehr to base all future structural  considerations beyond 1995 on an army strength of 370,000  soldiers. After the disappearance of the East-West threat, the  larger Germany does not need an army of the same actual strength  as during the Cold War.    Germany today is surrounded by friends on all sides. The  states to the south, west, and north even want to shape a common  foreign and security policy, as in the European Union. Our  Eastern neighbors want to establish closer economic and military  ties with us. Because of this strategic center position, we are  basically protected against direct aggression.    Moreover, our allies on our eastern border can also expect  a solidarity security contribution that is in our very own  interest. After all, security precaution within the European  Union means that every member state can rely on joint solidary  action to ensure the security of all in the future.    A beginning was made in a treaty on European Union. The  common military framework will be the Western European Union.  This results in a multinational operation profile of our Armed  Forces that is oriented toward Europe. Flexibility and  professionalism are needed. The changed strategic and  operational framework conditions require a Bundeswehr concept  that is based on flexibility and a high degree of  professionalism. The concept must also provide for an increase  in the number of soldiers after a longer warning period, made  possible by compulsory military service. In addition, there  must be a militia element.    The range of tasks of these Armed Forces includes the direct  defense of the country and the defense of the boundaries of the  NATO alliance. Smaller local conflicts are the more likely  scenario in the foreseeable future. Large-scale military  operations with a Europe-wide conduct of operations or  interventions on the model of the Gulf war are of less  significance.    The current framework conditions allow a drastic reduction  in  the mechanized major formations of the Bundeswehr but no  renunciation of the reinforcement component for the allies or  our own forces outside our territory. This applies mainly to  the Army. The conditions in the Air Force and the Navy are  different. They depend to a large extent on the integration in  a European security architecture.    How long do the European states want to afford the luxury of  national massed concentration? Is a European labor division not  necessary for cost reasons? This makes it clear what structural  changes the Bundeswehr will be facing in the middle of the  1990's. An operational profile that includes both the classical  national defense and international police operations requires  military units with a broad range of possible operations and a  high level of professionalism. They must be in a position to  carry out operations even in the event of an escalation at high  survivability, and they must be able to end conflicts quickly.  At the same time, they must not lose the ability to form the  spine of the Armed Forces as the core units. On the basis of  the current warning periods, the Armed Forces are capable of  carrying out large-scale operations within the framework of a  common European defense system.    The crisis reaction forces in all three military services  will have to assume different tasks from the units whose main  job is to defend the country. A dual system with professional  units consisting of soldiers who sign up for longer periods and  with national defense units on a militia basis requires a  careful examination as to the distribution of resources, fitness  for operations, and the social acceptability within the  Bundeswehr and its impact outside the Bundeswehr.    The shaping of the future structures of the Armed Forces  will  depend on the way and the probability of the requirements within  the national and international framework. Forms of operation  have to be developed in which units can be combined in  accordance with the tasks. To achieve this, combinations from  all organizational spheres and of the military services must be  permissible. However, it must be prevented that, like on the  occasion of the Somalia mission, specialists are gathered like  heroes and that special operational units are formed on this  basis.    As a result, the troop loses its operability, and the  operational unit must first develop its own identity.  Structural changes and reductions of the strength will affect  the Army most. The goal is the formation of elements for units  on the basis of the brigade as the smallest possible operational  unit capable of conducting operations. It should be possible to  combine these units in the above described sense for every  individual task.    For these kinds of organization, one can also use something  that has proven its worth, such as the command and support  organization of the Army, which is planned for 1995.  Alternatively, it must be examined whether the hierarchical  command structure of the Army can be tightened. Thus, following  the French model, one could perhaps even do without the level of  brigades and enable the level of battalions to engage in  operational command in a regimental structure. For the Air  Force and the Navy, there are less serious structural changes in  the offing. However, for these partial forces, too, a command  and communication ability that crosses partial forces and can be  used multinationally becomes necessary.    In the resolutions of the party congress in Wiesbaden on  foreign and security policy, the SPD demanded that the  Bundeswehr must exclusively and visibly correspond to its  defensive assignment in terms of size, structure, armament,  training, and operational concept. In case of scarce budgetary  means, as now exist, savings can be achieved almost exclusively  by reducing the personnel of the Armed Forces, if the  functioning of the Armed Forces will not suffer. However,  personnel is not something that can be changed arbitrarily at  any time.    Therefore, the SPD gives priority to the social  compatibility  of personnel reduction. If, in this connection, the target of  300,000 soldiers is mentioned for the time after 1995, it must  be taken into consideration that such a reduction of personnel  by 70,000 soldiers is linked with the closing down of a  considerable number of barracks. As a figure for orientation,  one can say that if there are about 1,000 soldiers less, one of  the barracks must be closed. Any communally or locally oriented  politician is aware of the social dynamite that is hidden behind  such figures for the affected community or region. After all,  an entire armored infantry battalion with its soldiers  constitutes purchasing power of about 30 million marks per year.    The structural changes for the Armed Forces, which the  Federal Government has to carry out in line with its drastic  thrift decisions in the individual budget number 14 in order to  keep the Bundeswehr functioning, need time for planning and  implementation. It is possible to reduce the Armed Forces  relatively quickly. We have been shown this by the U.S. Forces,  which have reduced their strength from 1.8 to 1.4 million  soldiers, the number of Army divisions from 14 to 12, and the  number of combat ships from 434 to 413.    The German Armed Forces have already been reduced  drastically, if one adds the Bundeswehr and National People's  Army in the reunitied Germany. In this process, however, the  Bundeswehr had the advantage that it suffered less closings and  layoffs than the other German army. In any future reduction,  however, it must be taken into account that the potential  ability to increase the national defense forces must be  preserved.    It will not always be possible to implement a new profound  structural change in the Army immediately after the  implementation of the Army Structure Number 5 as of 1995.  However, already in 1992 and 1993, it was possible and urgently  necessary in the Defense Ministry to undertake a self-critical  inventory. It would have been necessary to convene a defense  structure committee, as this was done in 1970-72 by Defense  Minister Helmut Schmidt with excellent results for the Armed  Forces.    The new Defense Structure Committee could have even relied  on  the preparatory work done by the past committee. Thus, planning  time could have been saved, which is valuable time for thorough  basic work. There is the specific danger today that structural  planning will be started only after the Bundestag elections and  thus too late. The Bundeswehr's current structure does not  correspond to the situation.    The Federal Government is stubbornly sticking to this  structure, but it is not providing the money necessary to keep  it functioning. There are only two alternatives: more money or  another structure that is smaller. For the Armed Forces'  assignment, there applies the following: clear orientation  toward the assignment given by the Basic Law and priority for  alliance defense.</p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Inveresk shares rise 15% in first day's trading INVERESK, the Scottish paper maker, closed at a near 15 per cent premium in its first day's trading on the Stock Exchange yesterday, writes James Buxton. The shares, priced at 150p, closed at 172p, having touched 177p. Some 5.5m shares were traded, out of the 22.6m issued in the placing and intermediaries offer, which was 6.6 times subscribed. Selling was mostly on behalf of private investors unwinding holdings after being disappointed by the size of their allocations, which were severely scaled down. James Capel, broker to the offer, said that the premium was fair and the company was happy with it. Though not as high as some recent first day premiums, it was at a level needed to build a good shareholder base, James Capel added.</p>

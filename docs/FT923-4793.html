			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Kevin Maxwell bankrupt with debts over Pounds 400m MR Kevin Maxwell, whose father, Robert Maxwell, was one of Britain's richest men, yesterday became Britain's biggest ever bankrupt, with debts of over Pounds 400m. At the end of a 95-minute private hearing in the High Court, a bankruptcy court registrar declared Mr Maxwell bankrupt on a petition presented by the liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, a company from which millions of pounds of Maxwell empire pension funds were removed. Mr Maxwell also faces criminal charges of theft and conspiracy to defraud involving Pounds 135m following the collapse of his father's empire. Outside the High Court a grave Mr Maxwell said: 'I stand here today a bankrupt with a deal of humility. Bankruptcy is a very public humbling.' 'If there is a redeeming feature of the bankruptcy order, it is perhaps that the thousands of people who have suffered loss can take real satisfaction from seeing a former director - and I suppose, above all, a Maxwell - suffer the consequences of their loss personally and in public. Perhaps those concerned believe this alone justifies the cost to creditors of these proceedings given the very small extent of my estate and my assets.' He said the bankruptcy order had been inevitable after the Pounds 406.8m order the liquidators obtained against him on July 20. 'As I said at the time, I did not have the resources to continue to defend their claims against me as I would have wished. Had I had the resources, I would have strenuously denied all the allegations of breach of duty.' 'I believe Bishopsgate's pursuit of my bankruptcy has been misconceived. The voluntary arrangement which I proposed for my creditors, which they dismissed, would have been in the best interests of my creditors.' Miss Margaret Cole, of Stephenson Harwood, solicitor to Robson Rhodes, the liquidator, said the court had appointed the Official Receiver to take over Mr Maxwell's affairs. She said an application under the Insolvency Act would be made to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, for the immediate appointment of trustees in bankruptcy, who would be the legal owners of Mr Maxwell's assets. The trustees would be Mr Peter Dubuisson and Mr Philip Sykes, partners in accountants Binder Hamlyn. Miss Cole said that the trustees, who would collect and distribute to creditors Mr Maxwell's assets, would have the power to set aside transactions by him in the last two or five years. If Mr Maxwell co-operates with his trustees he can expect his bankruptcy to be discharged in three years. Until then he cannot be involved in any way in company management.</p>

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (12): How the West slew the Asian dragon THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF MERCHANT EMPIRES, 1350-1750 edited by James Tracy Cambridge Pounds 35, 504 pages TRADE disputes between the Western economies and Japan are a feature of modern life, so it is useful to remember that anything resembling free trade between these states is a relatively recent development. Go a little way back in history and there was almost no trade at all. The central question this volume of stimulating essays sets out to explore is why, in the space of a few centuries, the European states were able to achieve a dominant position in global trade at the expense of often well-organised and financed rivals, mainly in Asia. The book examines several possible explanations. It might be argued, for example, that the Europeans simply had better means of transport, or better business methods including more sophisticated forms of credit. Even if Asian business methods were in no way inferior, the Europeans were able to overwhelm them by making devastating use of their superior armaments to further their commercial aims. Alternatively, the Europeans succeeded because in the likes of the East India Companies and Portugal's Estado da India, they created forms of organisation in which the use of violence was subordinated to the rational pursuit of profit. As James Tracy points out in his introduction: 'The principal feature that differentiates European enterprises from indigenous trade networks in various part of the globe . . . was that they organised their major commercial ventures either as an extension of the state or as autonomous trading companies with many of the characteristics of the state.' That included the capacity to wage war. Given that European traders saw themselves as beset by enemies wherever they looked, perhaps that was just as well. The fears of Europeans stationed in Asia were informed partly by national rivalries, but mainly by the fact that they were all interlopers. Most historians agree that before the Europeans arrived, Asian trade had been relatively peaceful. Geoffrey Parker shows in a perceptive essay how Asians were appalled at the Europeans' destructive style of warfare. He nevertheless shows that the notion of Western powers bent on world domination is anachronistic. Most traders, the Dutch being the notable exception, undertook military action only either to coerce reluctant buyers or in order to safeguard themselves against attack from their European rivals. The book is a companion to The Rise of Merchant Empires, which dealt with the changes in the growth and composition of long-distance trade over the same period. The two volumes emerged from a conference in 1987. Between them they take the debate over the origins of modern trade to new heights.</p>

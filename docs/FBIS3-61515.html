N. Severtsov, RAN, Moscow, under  the rubric ``Investigation of the Sequelae of the Chernobyl  Disaster''; UDC [577.2+576]:539.1.04]    [Abstract]Studies were carried out in order to demonstrate  a set of disturbances on the cellular, molecular, biochemical  and whole organism levels after exposure to the disaster zone,  as well as enhanced sensitivity to subsequent acute irradiation.  Experiments were carried out on (CBAxC57Bl)F[.sub]1[/] mice  in cages with wire mesh on all four sides and HeLa cell  (carcinoma of the human cervix) cultures in plastic vials placed  (in a roofed area) directly on contaminated soil for 1-12 days,  as well as control animals and cultures kept in a clean area,  with the same climate, beyond the 30-km zone of the disaster  area. Cytogenetic studies were carried out to determine HeLa  survival rate, number of micronuclear and giant HeLa cells,  which revealed that there was enhanced sensitivity of the cells  to subsequent acute irradiation, demonstrable for 12-15  generations or more after exposure in the disaster zone, and it  is a function of doses of chronic and acute radiation. Genetic  studies were made of bone marrow somatic cells of experimental  animals and revealed the most appreciable changes in number of  aberrations per cell, and in chromosome type of aberrations, as  well as lesions to bone marrow stem cells, disintegration of  thymus chromatin indicative of interphase death, and decrease in  peripheral blood leukocytes.

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Teacher training scheme launched A FURTHER boost to school-based teacher training was launched yesterday with a Pounds 1m project to train up to 250 graduates for primary and secondary teaching entirely in schools. The funds will be offered to schools which have already shown an interest in training teachers, and to City Technology Colleges. Funding for the project, which will start training this September or in January next year, will cover the cost of setting up and running courses.</p>

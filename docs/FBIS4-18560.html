			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Charles Lambroschini: "The Necessary </F> Compromise"]    [Text] Edouard Balladur's visit to China promises to be  difficult. On the eve of the prime minister's arrival, the  arrest in Beijing yesterday of Wei Jingsheng, the most  well-known dissident, takes on the value of a message. The  Chinese Government does not intend to allow the Western concept  of human rights to be imposed on it. But it is equally obvious  that France cannot remain silent in face of violations of  freedom. In the dialectic between national interest and respect  for major principles, compromise is therefore necessary.    Edouard Balladur has chosen realism. By negotiating to end  the dispute over arms sales to Taiwan, he has enabled French  businesses to reenter the most promising market of the next  century. The cooling in relations between Paris and Beijing  made our market share drop to 1.6 percent, whereas Italy climbed  to 2.6 percent and Germany to 5.8 percent. By departing from  the line followed by Francois Mitterrand since the bloody  repression of Tienanmen Square in 1989, the prime minister ran  the risk of breaking with the rules of cohabitation. But the  stake was worth it. To cite Alain Juppe, "employment in France  also depends on Asia."    At the same time, the limits which cannot be crossed are  clear. The French Government would bring dishonor on itself if  it betrayed the ideal of democracitic countries to pocket a few  more contracts. When dealing with China, the aim is to change  not the essence, but the form. Today, the Beijing leaders seem  ready to make some gestures on human rights, provided they can  save face. They do not want to be taught any public lessons.  Edouard Balladur therefore thinks, on this subject, that it  will be more effective if he negotiates instead of preaching.    The United States, despites its privileged position as a  superpower, is now reaching a similar conclusion. Following the  disastrous visit to Beijing by his secretary of state last  month, Bill Clinton is trying to loosen the link between trade  and human rights. The yearly threat not to renew China's status  of most favored nation has ceased to be credible.    American businesses need outlets badly, too. The White  House, too, badly needs a partner to help it make North Korea,  tempted by the bomb, see reason, or to persuade Japan to lower  its trade barriers. Finally, it is clear that excessively  vehement protests are likely to have the opposite effect. In  the struggle for Deng Xiaoping's legacy, the hardliners could  well take this "interference" as a pretext to take an ever  tougher line.    Thirty years have passed since de Gaulle dared to break the  anticommunist solidarity to restore diplomatic relations with  Beijing. However, the motive which justified the general's  iconoclastic gesture remains the same. In his soldier's  language, de Gaulle said at the time: "China should not be left  to stew in its own juice."</p>

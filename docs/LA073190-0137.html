			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> NEW ADVISORY PANEL WILL BE DISCUSSED  </P> <P> A recommendation to replace the former North Tustin Municipal Advisory Council  with a new five-member advisory board is scheduled for consideration by the  county Board of Supervisors on Aug. 15.  </P> <P> Supervisors dissolved the council in June to save money.  </P> <P> The new body, like the old, would make recommendations on North Tustin issues,  but would save the costs of elections because members would be appointed.  </P> <P> Under the recommendation by the county Environmental Management Agency, each  supervisor whose district includes the North Tustin area would appoint one  member. The fourth would be appointed at large by the supervisors, and the  fifth would be selected by the Foothill Communities Assn. The group would meet  once a month in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Bill Weber, president of the Foothill Communities Assn., said his group will  not take a position on the recommendation.  </P> <P> "We will see who they appoint, we will appoint our member, and the proof of the  pudding will be in what they do," Weber said.  </P> <P> Robert White, an acting manager of the EMA, said that appointments probably  will be made within weeks of the supervisors' decision. People who are  interested in serving on the advisory group should call White at (714) 834-5145  or write him at 12 Civic Center, Room G19, Santa Ana 92702, and include a brief  resume.  </P> <P> "It's helpful to have a group like that," White said. "People living in the  area obviously know some of the idiosyncrasies better than we do."  </P></p>

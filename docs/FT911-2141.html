			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Usdaw votes for and against pay restraint policy CONTROVERSY among unions over pay policy under a Labour government was re-kindled yesterday when the Usdaw shopworkers' union voted both for and against rejecting any form of wage restraint. The contradictory votes at the annual conference in Blackpool came after Usdaw's leaders called for delegates not to rule out wage restraint under Labour because pay would have to be discussed as part of a national economic assessment. Mr Syd Tierney, Usdaw president, said after the votes that he expected the union's national executive to accept the possibility of wage restraint under Labour. This would make Usdaw the first union explicitly not to rule out a form of incomes policy. The conference voted by 114,723 to 104,887 to reject opposition to 'any wage restraint policy under this or any future government'. However, it then voted by 112,005 to 103,821 to 'accept no wage restriction under any government'. Mr Tierney said: 'We are in lumber, facing ourselves coming backwards. It is the worst possible situation we can be in.' He said the executive would take into account the fact that more delegates voted against opposition to wage restraint. Usdaw was among the only unions at the Scottish Trades Union Congress last month to vote against the call to rule out wage restraint. Mr Garfield Davies, Usdaw general secretary, said that it would be unrealistic to exclude discussion of wage levels from an economic assessment. He said that a national minimum wage which helped Usdaw members would be a form of incomes policy. Mr Davies said that blanket opposition to wage restraint before a Labour government came to power could become a millstone around the neck of unions. He said unions should leave their options open until after an election. The votes came after controversy over Labour's support for an economic assessment under which the government, employers and unions would discuss the economy and its implications for taxation, training and wages each year. Opposition to the idea in the TUC has been led by the AEU engineering union. The votes at Usdaw are among the first in a series on wage policy at union conferences.</p>

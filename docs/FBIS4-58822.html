			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Hizballah considers the participation of an  official Zionist delegation at a conference on water in Oman a  grave and fatal step encouraging the enemy in its aggression and  absolving it of its heinous crimes.    The party stressed that cooperation with the Zionist enemy  "accelerates the collapse of the Arab bond and the common Arab  concepts of security, economy, politics, and even culture and  history." It warned that the Arabs will pay for this policy, as  their dignity, rights, independence, economy, and identity will  be violently crushed and confiscated by an enemy wearing the  cloak of a cooperative friend.    In a statement, Hizballah viewed the participation of an  official Zionist delegation at a water conference in Oman as a  move within the context of the Arab regimes' failure to take a  position concerning the boycott of Israel.    The statement said: "Showing readiness for cooperation with  the Zionist enemy while it perpetrates the most horrible crimes  against the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples only encourages  this enemy to continue its aggression and exonerates it for its  heinous crimes. Oman's step is one of the wrong and fatal steps  that some Arab regimes, urged and encouraged by the United  States, began to take to bypass the facts and diktats of the  historical conflict with the Zionists, to remove the evidence of  the crime, and to open the region's doors to an onslaught of  normalization that will subject all the region's capabilities to  American and Zionist tutelage and domination.

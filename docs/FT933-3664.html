			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / West End offices go to French for Pounds 62m TWO FRENCH insurance companies have paid Pounds 62.5m for an office building in London's St James's Square, in one of the largest West End property transactions this year. The deal illustrates the prominence of overseas investors in the UK property market, resulting from the devaluation of sterling, the reduction in UK interest rates and the opportunity to buy properties at historically high yields. Foreign buyers are likely to spend about Pounds 1.75bn on UK property this year, compared with Pounds 1.33bn in 1992, says a report by DTZ Debenham Thorpe, property advisers. The building at 20 St James's Square has been acquired by GAN and UAP, two of France's largest insurance companies, from Kumagai Gumi, the Japanese developer, on a yield of just under 7.5 per cent. The 70,000 sq ft offices - occupied by Grand Metropolitan, the food, drinks and retailing group - generates an income of Pounds 4.75m a year from one of the highest rents in London. Grand Metropolitan has a 25-year lease, agreed in 1990. DTZ Debenham Thorpe says demand for UK property is the highest for at least five years. UK financial institutions are preparing to invest more than Pounds 7bn in the next 12 to 18 months as money flows back into commercial property. Overseas investment in UK property totalled Pounds 837m for the first half of this year, according to DTZ - about the same level as the last six months of last year. Hong Kong and Chinese investors have been the most prominent source of demand, accounting for nearly a quarter of investment so far this year. Investors from the Far East have spent Pounds 195m for the first half of this year, compared with a total of Pounds 63m last year. Money into Property. Research Division, DTZ Debenham Thorpe, 44 Brook Street, London W1A 4AG. Pounds 50.</p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Gulf war allies may act over Iraqi Scuds THE US, Britain and France have hinted strongly that further military action may be taken against Iraq if it fails to comply with United Nations resolutions requiring the scrapping of its weapons of mass destruction, The Gulf war allies also hope they can topple Mr Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi president, by harnessing domestic discontent with his regime. Yesterday, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, underlined mounting frustration with Iraq's prevarication over meeting UN ceasefire terms, saying: 'We do not rule out going back to military action.' His remarks follow those on Saturday by Mr Thomas Pickering of the US, who read a statement in the name of the Security Council's 15 members warning that Iraq 'must be aware of the serious consequences of continued material breaches of' UN orders. Iraq announced yesterday that a delegation being sent to the UN would be headed by Mr Tariq Aziz, the deputy prime minister. He is expected to try to avert a potentially serious clash over Iraq's latest defiance of the UN. The US wants Iraq's delegation to go to New York by March 9. It has hinted military action may follow if Baghdad fails to comply with UN resolutions. The US still has 25 ships, including two aircraft carriers, in the Gulf and more than 200 combat aircraft in the region. The confrontation with Iraq flared over its refusal on Friday to follow orders from the latest UN team of ballistics experts to destroy manufacturing equipment for Scud missiles. The UN team left Baghdad in protest on Saturday and is in Bahrain preparing a report for the UN commission charged with overseeing destruction of Iraq's weapons. Mr Christopher Holland, the Briton leading the ballistics team, said his mission had been 'very successful' in finding equipment used in manufacturing Iraq's long-range missiles, but Iraqi officials refused to destroy machines they had identified. Although Mr Holland declined to give details of Iraqi missile equipment, he said it included machines 'specifically identified with the production of missiles with ranges more than 150km'. Iraqi officials claimed the technology had civilian uses, but Mr Holland said there was no doubt the equipment formed a key production line for Iraq's missile programme. Britain and France are pushing for a new Security Council resolution instructing Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, to send a special envoy to examine the political situation in northern and southern Iraq. They hope an inquiry will focus grievances and help destabilise the government. The US, while generally sympathetic, has not yet committed itself to this idea, fearing that any side-issue might help Mr Saddam avoid giving a straight answer about his weapons programmes.</p>

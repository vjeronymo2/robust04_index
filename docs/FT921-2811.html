			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Tokyo holds back from intervening in markets THE Japanese authorities yesterday showed no sign of following past practice and intervening to revive the country's stricken stock market. Instead, Finance Ministry officials indicated they would rely on general monetary and economic policies eventually to restore confidence in both the market and in the economy. A finance ministry official said: 'This is now a free market. We are not going to try any of the old tricks. They will not work.' He was speaking soon after the market closed yesterday after the Nikkei index failed to regain the psychologically important 20,000 level and finished up 80.47 at 19,917.63. On Monday, the index had fallen to its lowest level for five years. The last time the Nikkei index fell through the 20,000 level was in October 1990 when Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, the finance minister, relaxed regulations to encourage investors to buy stock. This time, his successor, Mr Tsutomo Hata, has given no indication of making a similar move. The ministry change of heart is a recognition that officials' power to manage the markets has been undermined by the financial liberalisation in the 1980s, including the introduction of stock futures trading, the admission of foreign companies and interest rate deregulation. It also a reflects a belief that even with the support of stockbroking companies the ministry may lack the financial resources to shore up equities. In the 1960s, the last prolonged bear market in Japan, officials encouraged broking companies to club together to buy stocks to maintain prices. But this time the volume of stock bought at inflated prices is so great that officials believe such a fund would be swamped. Stockbroking company executives have made the odd discreet call for intervention. But most seem resigned to waiting for a change in sentiment. As Mr Atsushi Saito, a managing director of Nomura Securities, the Japanese broking group, said in a recent interview: 'The cause of the weakness of the market is the weak economy.' The brokers also recognise they have contributed to their misfortunes by their involvements in stock scandals, including recent cases of helping investment clients to window dress accounts. So the industry is in a poor position to plead for a rescue. At a press conference yesterday, Mr Minoru Nagaoka, chairman of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, made no calls for Finance Ministry market support, as his predecessors might have done. Instead he asked for fiscal and monetary measures (meaning more government spending and lower interest rates) to boost the economy.' This is now a free market. We are not going to try any of the old tricks. They will not work.'</p>

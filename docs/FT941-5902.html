			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Builder for Channel link sought The government may be able to avoid making any direct cash contribution to the Pounds 2.7bn Channel tunnel rail link, Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister said yesterday. He was speaking at the launch of a competition to find a private-sector consortium to build the 68-mile rail link between London's St Pancras station and the Channel tunnel. It is expected to be the largest joint public-private sector construction project this decade. The size of the public contribution will depend on negotiations with the private consortia that bid to build the line, but it is expected to consist of: The Pounds 800m assets owned by European Passenger Services, the company which will run trains between London, Paris and Brussels. These comprise Waterloo International station, the North Pole rail depot in north-west London and the Eurostar rolling stock. The government will not transfer the Pounds 1bn of debt incurred to acquire these assets. The right to revenues from EPS's train services when these start this summer. The right to charge domestic train-operating companies a fee for running trains over the rail link's tracks. The intellectual property built up by Union Railway, the company which has been developing the rail link for the past six years. No formal value has been given to this. The winning consortium is expected to be the one which bids for the smallest amount of government contribution to the link. The government expects there to be three or four serious bidders. Companies have until April 25 to express an interest in the project but the formal tendering process will begin in June and bids must be made by December. The winning consortium will be required to build a line capable of carrying at least six trains an hour each way at speeds of up to 140 mph. The government expects to introduce a bill authorising the project by the end of the year with the aim of passing the legislation in 1996. The rail link could then open in 2002. In a new move the government said it would also pay 33 per cent of bid costs  -up to a maximum of Pounds 1.5m - for each failed bidder.</p>

Liu Huaqing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau Standing Committee and vice chairman of the Central  Military Commission [CMC] attended a panel discussion at which  Zhang Wannian, CMC member and chief of general staff; Yu Yongbo,  CMC member and director of the General Political Department; and  Fu Quanyou, CMC member and director of the General Logistics  Department took the floor.    Deputy Zhang Wannian emphatically stated that, in order to  accomplish the glorious missions of the party and the people,  the armed forces must heighten their awareness in three  respects: Preparedness, national defense, and fighting modern  battles. He said: Although world tension is generally easing,  the world is still not peaceful. While we are at peace, we must  always be prepared for crisis.    Deputy Yu Yongbo stressed: We must unequivocally follow the  correct guidance provided by the media [jian chi zheng que de yu  lun dao xiang] and energetically promote ethical construction in  the armed forces. We must, through deep-going and meticulous  ideological education, heighten the armed forces' awareness of  implementing the party's basic line and all general and specific  policies, firmly safeguard the authority [quan wei] of the party  Central Committee and the CPC with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the  core, and firmly embrace and support all major reform measures  which the state has adopted for establishing a socialist market  economic system.    Deputy Fu Quanyou pointed out: We must increase the  intensity of logistical operations reform, speed up the pace of  reform, and achieve higher efficiency and greater logistical  capability through reform. We must carry forward the fine  traditions of plain living and arduous struggle, strive to  display the five types of revolutionary spirit initiated by  Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the 64-character pioneering spirit  initiated by Chairman Jiang Zemin, and expedite the PLA's  modernization of logistical support through reform.</p>

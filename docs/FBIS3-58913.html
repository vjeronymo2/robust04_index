Following a meeting yesterday of the Defense Chiefs of Staff  and other military authorities, Fabbri reported that the first  substantial contingent to return home will be about 600 men  making the trip before the end of this month. He explained that  the general plan is for the "redeployment of the contingent in  the Belet Uen area, in the north of Somalia, towards the main  base at Balad and then, towards the Mogadishu port and airport."    All phases of the gradual repatriation of the Italians, said  the minister, have been "agreed to with the UNOSOM command and  the commands of the U.S. and German contingents" and the plan  "provides for the replacement of the Italian troops with the  troops of other nations."    On maximum security, Fabbri said that though no large scale  military operations against the departing Italians were  expected, "the risks of possible displays of hostility from  local elements, especially in the phases when our forces are  most vulnerable, cannot be ignored." Thus, "information  activities managed by national sources, making use of the  cooperation of competent agencies in the United States and  within the United Nations," will be drawn on, he said and  reported that among the first to return to Italy will be  logistics units, leaving to last tank divisions, armored units  and the helicopters, "the most effective components for defense  purposes."    The minister cited as "of special significance" for security  the decision to deploy a naval unit with helicopter, medical and  logistics support off the coast of Mogadishu as of March 1 for  "the most critical phase of the withdrawal process."    Another step in this area of planning will be the arrival of  Italian Air Force planes to the Nairobi airport, just across the  border from Somalia, and alert status for "some aircraft in  Italy for possible emergency interventions."    Fabbri told the committee that the ship off the Somali coast  "will give our command and their units a high degree of  operating autonomy by allowing the departure of men aboard  landing craft from areas outside the Mogadishu port or airport,  which could be tied up."    Concluding his remarks to the committee, the minister noted  that the "reconciliation process among the Somali factions has  not yet taken the path likely to lead quickly to agreement" and  underscored the need for further political and diplomatic  efforts in this area.    On December 29, the cabinet confirmed the withdrawal of  combat troops from Somalia and Mozambique and the defense  minister said the pull-out from Mozambique should be completed  by April 30, the same date set by the UN for the end of its  mission there. There are some 2,500 Italian troops in Somalia  and about 1,200 in Mozambique. The former operation began for  Italy on December 11, 1992. Five Italian soldiers have been  killed in Somalia and two in Mozambique.    Other Italian forces are taking part in UN missions in  Albania, Cambodia, Pakistan, Kuwait, El Salvador, Slovenia,  Morocco and Egypt, Fabbri said at the time.</p>

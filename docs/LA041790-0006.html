			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GASOLINE TAX  </P> <P> I have always found the Reagan and Bush administrations' inability to logically  distinguish between a tax and a user fee to be hilarious, in a sad and cynical  sort of way. Apparently, if a Democrat wants to raise revenues, it's a tax. If  a Republican wants to raise revenues, it's a user fee.  </P> <P> BRYAN D. LE BLANC  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

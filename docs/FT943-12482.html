			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Fewer companies at risk of collapse as recovery picks up The financial health of British companies improved sharply in the second quarter of this year as the economic recovery took hold, according to a study published today. The analysis of 360,000 UK companies contributing more than 75 per cent of Britain's gross domestic product finds a marked reduction in the number considered to be in a risky condition or in significant danger of collapsing. It is further confirmation that the recovery is gathering pace. Figures last week showed that the GDP was 3.3 per cent higher in the second quarter than in the same period of 1993 - the first time since 1989 that growth exceeded 3 per cent. The analysis, published by the broker Barclays De Zoete Wedd using figures from the Dun &amp; Bradstreet corporate database, shows that Pounds 6bn of bank debt moved out of the high risk category during the first half of the year. The upturn in credit quality was particularly marked in the south-east, south-west and East Anglia. Property and transport companies improved most strongly among industrial sectors, with manufacturing companies also stabilising. The study follows optimistic statements from the chairmen of Barclays and National Westminster bank about improvements in bad debt provisions, and BZW will today raise its forecast for banks' earnings this year by a total of Pounds 385m. The fall in the number of companies rated as significantly risky for banks to lend to is the first marked improvement in credit quality noted since the end of the recession, although quality has risen slowly since the end of last year. Mr Hugh Pye, banks analyst at BZW, said the figures showed a 'dramatic' improvement in credit quality. He said the ratings emphasised cash flow, and companies appeared to be benefiting from lower interest rates. The improvement in credit quality could help banks to feel more confident about lending money. Banks have reported only gradual increases in loan volumes during the recovery, partly because of a perceived lack of high-quality borrowers. The report says the upturn in credit quality in the south-east is significant, since the region contains 40 per cent of all UK companies by number, as well as 49 per cent of all companies with a poor credit rating. The regions with the best corporate credit quality are in the north of England - with 13.5 per cent of companies in a poor condition. This compares with 17.3 per cent in the UK as a whole.

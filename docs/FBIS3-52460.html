			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Finally, Some Response"] </F>   [Text] PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat has every right to demand  and work for the establishment of an independent Palestinian  state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip; and, we think, his people  will eventually get what they want. But he must have realised  by now that for the Israelis to agree to such an eventuality,  and for the world community to bless it, the PLO leader needs to  play his cards right, wait for a while and give priority to  building Palestinian institutions that would be mature and  healthy enough to deliver such a state.    In undertaking this major task, Mr. 'Arafat cannot afford to  alienate everybody he knows. There are a few toes around,  anyway, that he can step on. On the other hand, he has every  reason to cultivate the support of especially those who are most  ready and willing to help him achieve full rights. Jordan is on  top of the list of those countries which not only back the  PLO-Israel agreement, but whose national security also depends  on the success of the accord. True, Jordan is not yet ready to  discuss a confederation with Chairman 'Arafat, simply because  such a link can take place only between sovereign states, but  there is no question that the Kingdom is fully committed to  helping our Palestinian brethren in their quest for realising  their legitimate rights, including self-determination and  statehood.    Jordan, however, has its own interests, which, incidentally  or otherwise, in no way clash with Palestinian aspirations fo  independence. Furthermore, what the leadership of this country  has been asking of the PLO leader is no more than what Mr.  'Arafat himself has been demanding of other Arabs, namely  coordination and cooperation on vital issues.    It was the Palestinians who insisted right from the  beginning  of the Madrid talks in the fall of 1991 on full coordination  among the Arab parties to the peace process: Jordan, Syria,  Lebanon and the Palestinians. As a result of its secret  agreement with Israel the PLO managed to alienate Syria and, by  extension, Lebanon. Jordan, as the PLO is fully aware, has not  taken such a position. To the contrary, it has forgiven Mr.  'Arafat for reaching a separate deal with Israel, and His  Majesty the King went as far as congratulating the PLO leader on  his courage in reaching the Oslo accords.    But while Mr. 'Arafat might understandably be occupied with  everything under the sun, he must remember that the mind of the  Jordanian leadership is set on guarding the real interests of an  Arab state, whose wellbeing is of vital interest to the cause of  Palestine. Whatever agreement the Palestinians reach or fail to  reach with the Israelis is going to have its consequences on  Jordan. Therefore, coordination among the two parties is not a  luxury, it is a necessity. The Palestinian leadership certainly  realises that it has a stake in a strong Jordan both during the  transitional period and afterwards. And that is why the arrival  here this week of a delegation to start real coordination should  be such a welcome change.</p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Dividend cuts already built into the share price - Andrew Taylor previews the construction sector's interim results due next week HARDLY A day seems to have gone by this summer by without some stockbroker reducing a profit forecast for a construction or building materials company. The stockbrokers' views will be put to the test next week when some of the biggest companies in the sector are to due to publish results for the first half of this year. Fears that the figures may be accompanied by dividend cuts have already caused shares to fall. Since the beginning of June the FT-Actuaries Construction Index has under-performed the FT-A All Share Index by about 40 per cent. The building materials index has underperformed by a quarter. The ability of companies to maintain payments to shareholders by raiding reserves has been exhausted, says Mr Mark Stockdale, construction analyst for Warburg Securities. 'There is a growing realisation that housing and commercial property profits, bolstered by high inflation, will not be repeated even when these markets recover. Companies in the 1990s will not be able to afford dividend payments made in the 1980s.' Reduced dividends are expected from several companies. Others are likely to issue warnings that year-end payments may be reduced unless trading conditions improve - which nobody expects to happen. At best, dividends will stand still in cash terms representing a fall in real terms, says Warburg. Deepening the gloom is the fact that there is still no sign of a recovery beginning in the UK housing market, which has been in recession for almost four years. Margins have slumped as house prices have fallen by up to 30 per cent in some parts of the country. Builders meanwhile have been working through expensively priced land bought in the late 1980s, when house prices peaked. There is concern that some contractors may have to increase provisions against their housing and commercial property operations. This has made it more difficult than usual to forecast results. Building materials companies have suffered as sales and prices of building products have fallen as demand for construction has reduced. There is large over-capacity and further plant closures and redundancies are inevitable. Dominating next week's results will be first half figures, due on Tuesday, from Wimpey, Britain's second biggest housebuilder. Wimpey's share price fell by almost a fifth, from 97p to 79p, during four trading days days this week on fears that the company may reduce its interim dividend from 4p paid last year. Forecasts of first half losses at Wimpey range from Pounds 2m to Pounds 7m. In the first half last year the group made a Pounds 5m pre-tax loss. Taylor Woodrow, the construction and property development company which has seen its share price halved from 119p to 52p since the beginning of June, is also expected to cut its interim dividend. The company which publishes its results on Wednesday is thought likely to announce pre-tax losses of about Pounds 5m. In the first six months of last year the group made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 25.3m and paid an interim dividend of 1.86p. Amec, which so far has ridden out the recession better than most contractors, is due to report on Thursday. It is expected to maintain its interim dividend at 4p despite forecasts that interim profits will fall from Pounds 21.9m to about Pounds 14m. Other companies reporting on 'construction Thursday' include John Laing, the contractor, where profits are expected to be only slightly down on last year's Pounds 6.3m and Blue Circle, Britain's biggest cement manufacturer where profits are forecast to fall from Pounds 57.5m to a little more than Pounds 40m. Laing last year cut its final dividend from 10p to 6p but may decide to spread the cut more evenly by trimming its interim from 3p last year. Blue Circle is expected to maintain its interim of 3.75p. Rugby, Britain's third largest cement manufacturer, is likely to be one of the few building related companies, to announce an increase in interim profits which are forecast to rise from Pounds 27.4m to about Pounds 30m. It has been helped by improvements in Australia and the US, where a fragile recovery in construction output appears to have begun.

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Passenger duties for air travel amended Air passenger duties were extended and amended, following their introduction on November 1. Under the changes, the lower Pounds 5 rate of air passenger duty will be extended to include destinations in Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, which belong to the European Economic Area (EEA), but not to the European Community (EC) to honour UK obligations under the European Economic Area Agreement. APD is charged according to where the passenger's journey ends. For journeys ending in the UK or any other EC Member State the rate is Pounds 5. Return journeys in the UK are only taxed once. In any other case the rate is Pounds 10, except for journeys to Basle and Geneva - which are treated as Pounds 5 destinations because of their location on the Swiss-French border and the difficulty of determining whether a passenger to these airports will end up in France or Switzerland - and, by extra statutory concession, journeys to destinations in the EEA which are outside the EC. As of January 1 1995 the system for charging interest on arrears of APD will be brought into line with those for insurance premium tax and VAT to ensure uniformity between the taxes and to have an efficient system for collecting interest on arrears of APD, which would otherwise have to be collected by civil proceedings. Under changes in insolvency legislation, APD debts will have preferential status in Great Britain and Northern Ireland to bring the position on APD into line with that for other duties and taxes collected by Customs.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Pilot 'one-stop' business advice centres chosen THE GOVERNMENT has decided on the locations of 16 pilot 'one-stop' business advice centres which will form the core of a national network of 200 'one-stop shops'. A disproportionately large number are in north-west England and the Midlands. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is expected to announce the names of six areas which have successfully tendered to operate a 'one-stop shop', nine which will be granted official recognition if they modify their business plans and a special case, central London, which will receive additional funds to carry out further development work. Bids for 'one-stop shop' status were made by 57 partnerships of local business support organisations headed by Training and Enterprise Councils - which administer government training schemes in England and Wales - and comprising chambers of commerce, enterprise agency and local authority economic development departments. These were whittled down to a shortlist of 20 from which 16 have now been selected. The six areas awarded one-stop shops are south and east Cheshire, Manchester, Birmingham, Hertfordshire, Tyneside and Warrington. The nine areas which will qualify if they carry out further work on their proposals are Chester and the Wirral, south Derbyshire, Shropshire, Merseyside, Hereford and Worcestershire, Doncaster, Leicestershire, Surrey, and Dorset. The bias towards the north-west and the Midlands reflects the preponderance of bids from those areas in response to the original tender announcement last December. In some areas the 'one-stop shops' will be set up in areas with strong existing business support networks such as Manchester and Birmingham. In other areas such as Surrey and Hertfordshire they will be established in areas with fragmented support networks. In central London, Mr Heseltine has accepted a provisional combined bid from four Tecs - Central London, City &amp; Inner London, South Thames and London East. A separate bid from Aztec, covering Kingston and Wandsworth, has been rejected but it has been advised to combine with the four other Tecs. These five London Tecs, the London and Westminster chambers of commerce and the London Enterprise Agency, are to carry out a Pounds 500,000 study, part-funded by the government, aimed at establishing a central London one-stop shop linked to satellite advice centres in the outer boroughs. The central London bid was complicated by the large number of business support organisations including nine Tecs, more than 30 chambers of commerce and about 25 enterprise agencies, and further research needs to be done. The aim is to create a national network of business advice centres to equal the government-backed chambers of commerce in much of continental Europe and to end the fragmentation of support services for business. The Tecs are free to establish their own business centres outside the 'one-stop shop' network but official recognition guarantees government finance of about Pounds 230,000 in the first year and continuing government backing for the next two years. Ultimately the 'one-stop shops' are expected to become self-funding.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA correspondents Luobu Ciren and Bai Bin] </F>   [Text] Lhasa, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Yixi Cezheng, a  60-year-old Tibetan woman earns more than 2,000 yuan a year by  selling apples, grapes and Chinese prickly ash grown in her  courtyard.    Yixi lives in Nangxian County, Nyingchi Prefecture, in the  eastern part of the Tibet Autonomous Region.    Although Tibet is located on the roof of the world,  Nangxian,  Bowo, Mainling, Medog and other counties of the prefecture lie  at an altitude of less than 3,000 meters above sea level.    Farmers in the prefecture, known as the key regional  production centers for fruit and pork, have a tradition of  cultivating their courtyard economy.    "I was inspired by the high cost of transport of dried fruit  from outside to Tibet to expand my orchard and sell fruit on the  local market," Yixi said.    Almost all families in Nangxian County now have fruit trees  and many bring the fruit to nearby counties to exchange for wool  and meat.    A survey shows that the income from the courtyard economy  accounts for one fifth of the gross income in the rural county.    Farmers in Bowo County, on the Sichuan-Tibet Highway, are  more enthusiastic about raising livestock.    Dogye, a farmer in Xumo Township, Bowo County, obtains more  than 7,000 yuan a year from raising 40 pigs annually.    "It is common for a family to raise some 50 pigs a year in  my  hometown, just like me," he said.    In addition, farmers in this area have more than 30,000  apple  and walnut trees and produce 550 tons of dried and fresh fruit a  year.    The gross income from the courtyard economy in Bowo County,  with a population of less than 20,000, amounted to about six  million yuan in 1993.    An official of Nyingchi Prefecture said that the income of  farmers and herdsmen in the prefecture averaged over 1,000 yuan  per capita last year, twice as much as rural people in other  parts of the region.    The official attributed the rise of income to the courtyard  economy.    The Nangxian County government plans to increase the number  of courtyard-planted fruit trees by 23,500 this year by offering  saplings purchased from the interior parts of the country to  farmers free of charge, as well as technical services.    Gyaca County government has spent 100,000 yuan on buying  80,000 saplings of apple and peach from central Henan Province  for its farmers.    It also encourages and helps local farmers to raise pigs and  chickens.</p>

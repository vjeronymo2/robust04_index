			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Not at all costs NOBODY SHOULD think that last week's outline debt accord between Brazil and its leading creditor banks means the country has surmounted its foreign debt problem. The risk that the outline deal will never be completed is high and, even if completed, default would still be possible. Things are not totally bleak. The agreement might strengthen the position of Brazil's relatively competent economic team. The government is also publicly optimistic that its tax reform - essential to the accord's viability - will pass through Congress this year. Yet in no other country embarking on a Brady agreement has economic reform been so prone to reversal; in no other country has inflation been so high and the government's control over its finances so weak; and nowhere else has the government's hold on power been so fragile. Brazil cannot boast a record of fulfilling its debt commitments: its 1988 pre-Brady restructuring agreement lasted for less than a year. A 'Brady accord' is different from previous restructurings. Under this approach, most debt is converted into marketable bonds. Once these bonds have been sold into hundreds of portfolios, any future restructuring would make the current effort, hard as it is, look easy. Since the immediate cash benefits are modest, the main value of the Brady deal to Brazil would be improved access to external market finance. That access could be shut off quickly if things went wrong after the deal is completed. If so, the deal could make things worse, not better. While the banks may see short-term gains - the agreement should allow them to write back provisions and leave them with more readily marketable securities, instead of loans - a subsequent failure would hurt their portfolios, too. A possible knock-on effect would be a reduction in the value of their assets in other Brady countries. Successful implementation of this package will almost certainly require support from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But Brazil's current IMF standby programme has missed its first quarter targets and looks likely to miss its second quarter ones too. Both institutions are likely to come under political pressure - not least from a US administration that would like to claim it has solved the debt crisis - to back the deal. If the fundamental economic case for supporting Brazil is weak, however, they should not yield. This outline deal should not be completed at all costs. A deal that ultimately collapses would be worse than reaching no deal at all.</p>

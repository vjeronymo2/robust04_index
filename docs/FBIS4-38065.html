			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Arye Kiesel] </F>   [Text] An experiment to test the impact of a Scud falling  in a densely populated area was conducted for the first time  yesterday in the south of the country, in cooperation with the  United States.    Major General Ze'ev Livne, commander of the Home Front  Command, said that the command manufactured a missile containing  hundreds of kgs of explosives, similar to the Scuds owned by  Syria and other Arab countries. The missile was detonated in an  open training range strewn with reinforced structures.    The explosion was designed to test the efficacy of Israel's  security concept with regard to the home front: the "reinforced  structure," which is a thick-walled room.    The Americans who observed the experiment checked the  resistance of various types of windows in light of the  conclusions drawn from the World Trade Center explosion in New  York, as well as for other U.S. defense components. The results  of the experiment will be sent today to laboratories in the  United States, and the findings will be relayed to Israel.    This joint experiment is part of a series of tests conducted  over the last two years to prepare the Home Front Command.    Gen. Livne stated that 100,000 building containing  "reinforced rooms" have been built to date in Israel. These  buildings offer a solution to 300,000 Israelis, he said, and  within five years most buildings in Israel will be similarly  equipped.</p>

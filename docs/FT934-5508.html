			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Beijing urged to keep up inflation fight The World Bank has urged China to stay the course in its inflation fight and has warned of the risks of a painful retrenchment if credit restrictions are eased prematurely. The assessment, published prominently in People's Daily yesterday, seemed designed to bolster the arguments of those in the Chinese leadership advocating continued restraint. 'Relaxing the credit squeeze too early could ruin the hard-won fruit of controlling inflation, and inflationary pressures could emerge again,' wrote Mr EC Hua, a senior economist in the World Bank's Beijing bureau. The conspicuous use of the views of international institutions to influence a bruising internal debate in China is a relatively new phenomenon and one that indicates the growing importance of bodies like the World Bank and IMF as sources of advice. Mr Hua had prepared his assessment as an internal document in September, which makes its prominent use in People's Daily all the more significant. Mr Zhu Rongji, China's senior vice-premier in charge of the economy, has been engaged in a fierce argument with senior colleagues and provincial chiefs who believe credit restrictions imposed in mid-year are too severe. Mr Zhu is the chief architect of a 16-point austerity programme announced in July aimed at calming China's overheating economy which is expected to grow this year by 13 per cent for the second year running. Mr Hua described these projected rates of growth as 'unsustainable' . He warned that it was much too early to claim a 'complete victory' in the anti-inflation fight. Figures for October showed a resurgence on inflationary pressures to an annualised 21.1 per cent in the 35 main urban centres, up marginally from the previous month. The World Bank economist blamed spiralling growth in the money supply in the first half of the year for the surge in inflation. M1, the broad measure of money in circulation, grew 54 per cent in the 12 months to June. Mr Hua, in his preliminary assessment of progress in China's macro-economic reforms, said there was cause for optimism that the 'worst had passed'. Since his assessment was circulated, however, China's anti-inflation resolve appears to be weakening. Mr Zhu has been obliged to give ground to the state enterprise lobby. His case was not helped by remarks attributed to Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, in which he is said to have advocated growth at almost any cost. Foreign companies operating in China are facing steep rises in local labour costs, according to a survey, writes Alexander Nicoll, Asia Editor. The Wyatt Company, a US-based consulting firm, says salaries of Chinese nationals working for foreign ventures have risen 22 per cent this year, faster than the 15 per cent increase in 1992. Foreign managers in Beijing have reported that it is increasingly difficult to hang on to good Chinese staff because newly established enterprises lure them away with offers of high salaries. Inflation is also a factor. Salary levels are still, however, low by western standards. A manager working for a foreign representative office earns about Dollars 7,800 (Pounds 5,230) per year including allowances, while a manager in a joint venture earns about Dollars 3,000.</p>

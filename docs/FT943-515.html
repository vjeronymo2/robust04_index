			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Callback services help reverse Asia charges - Phone services that undercut monopolies Only the most profligate managers could fail to be tempted: businesses in thrall to national telecommunications monopolies in Asia are being offered savings of up to 50 per cent on international telephone calls by US 'callback' companies. Such companies have already made an impact in Latin America and Europe. In south-east Asia, the growing popularity of money-saving callback services has been highlighted in recent weeks by protests from the state-controlled monopolies in Singapore and Thailand. Aimed at first at US expatriates and travellers seeking to avoid exorbitant international telephone rates and hotel surcharges outside the US, the callback services are finding new customers in stockbroking firms and other businesses with high volumes of international voice and data calls. Customers typically save money by dialling a designated number in the US and hanging up after one ring. A computer from the callback company immediately rings back - a call from the US to Thailand is much cheaper than from Thailand to the US - and allows the customer to dial on anywhere in the US or abroad. Seattle-based Kallback, one of the leading US 're-origination' services, says that a caller from Thailand dialling the UK via Kallback in the US would make savings of 38 per cent over the rate charged by the Communications Authority of Thailand (CAT) on an average call; a call to Australia from Thailand using Kallback would be 23 per cent cheaper than a conventional call by direct dialling. 'It's an arbitrage situation between countries,' said Mr Joel Eisenberg, Kallback's chief executive. 'We have found a new market developing among businesses in countries that have very high rates like Thailand.' Most of Kallback's customers worldwide are individuals, but companies account for more than half its call volume. In Thailand, where traffic congestion in Bangkok keeps business executives in their cars for hours at a time, half Kallback's accounts are for mobile telephones. The state-owned CAT shares revenue with foreign tele-communications networks on calls both out of and into Thailand, but on outgoing calls it uses its monopoly control of all international traffic to add hefty premiums. Officials from the CAT, an organisation with close links to the Thai air force, recently denounced callback services and said they undermined Thailand's national interest. Similar protests were made in Singapore; international charges there are more moderate than Thailand's, but the partly privatised Singapore Telecom (ST) has a monopoly until the year 2007. 'It became a major issue,' said Mr Eisenberg. 'They said it (callback service) was illegal. Now Singapore Telecom has backed down.' The Singapore government decided that ST should respond to the challenge by offering better service at competitive prices, although the callback companies, which already have about 40,000 users on the island, are not allowed to advertise in the Singapore media because they are not licensed to operate there. In Thailand the CAT has accused the callback companies of breaking the law, but no-one can find any law they are violating and the companies have been advertising their services in the press. 'Thailand will probably have to do something similar to Singapore,' said a Bangkok stockbroker whose company recently subscribed to Kallback, 'which is to admit that it's part of the service. The CAT are more concerned about their bonuses at the year-end rather than the consumer.' There have been some cases around the world of national telecommunications monopolies harassing callback companies by dialing their numbers repeatedly and jamming their systems, but Mr Eisenberg said this had not happened to Kallback. He added that it was probably not worthwhile for monopolies to alienate telephone users by attacking callback companies, given that the callback services still account for less than one per cent of the total international market. Thai monopolies do not give up easily, however. The Telephone Organisation of Thailand (TOT) - another body influenced by the armed forces which has the monopoly of all domestic fixed-line traffic in Thailand - is attempting to enforce a concession agreement giving a company called Lines Technology the exclusive right to provide domestic on-line data services. Critics of the TOT have ridiculed the deal, pointing out that several companies, including banks and business information companies, are already providing data services to their customers via TOT lines and are unlikely to stop. The CAT, as it tries to stifle competitors in its international fiefdom, has vowed to use unspecified 'protection techniques' against the callback providers, although it has yet to act. 'Thailand has still maintained the CAT monopoly and the CAT is fighting tooth and nail to hold that,' said Mr Daniel Fineman, a senior stock analyst at stockbrokers Jardine Fleming Thanakom. 'I see no sign that they are willing to give it up any time soon.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- CALLBACK SAVINGS*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Savings on         Through      From calls from         domestic    hotels Thailand to:       exchange  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Argentina            28%         73% Australia            23%         72% Belgium              23%         72% France               28%         73% Germany              28%         73% Italy                23%         72% South Africa         28%         73% Switzerland          28%         73% UK                   38%         77% US                   38%         77%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Kallback-supplied percentages based on a 'typical' call with rates effective in March 1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

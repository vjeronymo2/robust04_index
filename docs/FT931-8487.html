			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Economists take control until the snow melts: Old guard confronts Tajikistan's economic ills during a lull in fighting HAVING quieted its civil war, the ex-Soviet Tajikistan government has embarked on an ambitious economic programme, including oil, gold and cotton projects. But success is far from assured, hinging on whether Islamic-dominated opposition forces, now trapped behind deep winter snows, will regroup in spring. In a promising region with largely untapped natural gas and oil reserves, the ramifications of new fighting go far - Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Tajikistan's neighbours are more worried than ever that instability will spill over their borders. The chief source of their anxiety is the presence of thousands of Tajik fighters in rebel training camps in Afghanistan, who are expected to try to return home in spring. Already, hundreds of fighters and thousands of arms have come over the border. Against this backdrop, Tajikistan leader Imamali Rakhmanov is leading a Commonwealth of Independent States' effort to hold the line against upheaval in otherwise quiet, conservative Central Asia. But he is not doing it alone. His Commonwealth allies are providing prodigious military assistance. 'If we manage to seal the border and stop the weapons coming from Afghanistan for one or two months,' Mr Rakhmanov said in an interview, 'we'll be able to manage our other problems.' Two years ago, rigid communism in Tajikistan began to give way to a democratic and Islamic state. But a year ago the Soviet Union collapsed, and in its poorest republic a series of coups, counter-coups and civil war ensued. The trouble shattered the nation of 5m people, tucked between China, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. About 7 per cent of the population, or 350,000 people, were displaced, with about a quarter of them fleeing to Afghanistan. In November, the tide turned. The old-guard Soviet leadership reasserted itself, crushed its Islamic-dominated enemies, and by December retook power in the capital of Dushanbe. Today, the civil war is calmed, and the government is conducting small operations to try to finish off its opponents. Assistance has been provided by those who, like Tajikistan's old communists, have the most to gain. Both Uzbekistan and Russia deny any combat role in Tajikistan. But military and diplomatic sources, and independent foreign observers, say both republics have been on the front line with Tajik forces. According to these sources, since October, Uzbekistan has sent MiG and Sukoy fighters and attack helicopters on numerous bombing runs on behalf of Tajikistan's old guard. In some cases, Uzbekistan has also sent troops to battle the Islamic-dominated forces, the sources say. Russian tank forces, the sources say, participated in combat operations in January and this month in opposition strongholds east of Dushanbe, at Obigarm, Rogun and Ramit Canyon. Russia has also agreed to send an additional 2,000 troops to seal the border with Afghanistan. Afghan rebels have armed, trained and even led some of the Islamic-dominated forces into battle. Right now, the opposition is concentrated in the snowbound town of Komsomolabad and across the border in Afghanistan, where about 5,000 Tajik opposition fighters are believed to be awaiting the spring thaw. Mr Rakhmanov considers these forces the greatest threat to his government's efforts to reverse an economic decline that, next to Armenia's, is the ex-Soviet Union's worst. The year of fighting prevented the harvest of 70 per cent of the 1992-93 cotton crop, or 600,000 tonnes, costing a potential Dollars 200m (Pounds 138m) in foreign exchange, according to the government. The instability, plus a shortage of material and spare parts, reduced aluminium production in the last year by one-third, to 340,000 tonnes from the expected output of 500,000 tonnes; which cost Tajikistan Dollars 170m in potential foreign exchange. Wheat was not planted at all in the autumn, and light industry closed down entirely eight months ago in southern Tajikistan. Mr Rakhmanov, however, talks of building up a prosperous republic. The first foreign deal has been with the American company Kerry Energy. Kerry has won a Dollars 32m contract to refurbish oil wells and build a refinery in Tajikistan's industrial north, between Kenibadan and Isfaran. The deal is meant to restore Tajikistan's Soviet-era oil production of 400m tonnes a year, from its current output of 40m tonnes, and then to develop new reserves. Much of the rest still must be proven. Satellite photographs indicate other oil and natural gas deposits in southern Tajikistan, Mr Rakhmanov said, and silver deposits are also being explored. Iron ore has been found in Leninabad - one field contains 60m tonnes - and gold deposits are being examined at Penjikent. Tajikistan also plans to plant an additional 1.6m hectares to cotton. However, few people believe that anyone can seal the porous border with Afghanistan, which runs along the Amudarya river, and most observers expect the war to rage again in spring. Still, Mr Rakhmanov - and his Commonwealth allies - plan to try. 'This is the anointed government. Every one wants this government to work,' said a diplomat in Dushanbe. 'If they can bring these fighters under control, they will have the thing wrapped up.'</p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese boost for gold demand THIEVES HAVE been throwing grenades and using automatic weapons during raids on Hong Kong jewellery stores to help satisfy China's sharply increasing appetite for gold. Stolen merchandise is swiftly transported to the mainland where the street price of gold, depending on the exchange rate used, is equivalent to USDollars 550 to Dollars 600 a troy ounce, about Dollars 200 an ounce above the world market price. This is one example provided by the Gold Fields Minerals Services consultancy organisation of the way unprecedented gold demand in China is extending well beyond its own borders. Jewellery producers in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Taiwan are working flat-out to keep pace with demand from Chinese wholesalers. Mr Tim Green, GFMS's chief consultant, says jewellery shop raids have always been a fact of life in Hong Kong but the number of incidents and their ferocity have risen dramatically as local organised crime bosses have brought armed gangsters in from China. In its latest annual gold survey, GFMS says China emerged last year as the world's largest consumer of the precious metal and private purchases exceeded 350 tonnes - or more than was produced at all the US gold mines. It also suggests that China's central bank might have bought a substantial part - perhaps 250 tonnes - of the 400 tonnes of gold sold by the Netherlands central bank late in 1992. 'In a nation with over one fifth of the world's population, the phenomenon of gold purchasing, previously limited mainly to the southern provinces, has expanded northwards, taking in Shanghai and now Beijing, where consumers eagerly buy pieces of chuk kam (or 'pure gold') jewellery, sometimes weighing up to 100 grammes each,' the survey says. 'In late 1992 and early 1993, with growing fears about inflation, workers decided to spend rather than save their year-end bonuses, also to the benefit of jewellery consumption.' The survey warns that the present Chinese gold boom is similar to the one in 1988 at a time when inflation there reached 18 per cent, prompting widespread hoarding of consumer goods and a surge in gold buying. The situation was then brought under control by the authorities clamping down with a two-year austerity programme that caused a sharp drop in gold consumption. However, 'the degree of market liberalisation and devolution of economic control now make it unlikely that the authorities would repeat this policy,' the survey suggests. Apart from Chinese demand, hedging by gold producers and sales by central banks will be the important determinants of the gold price this year, says Mr Stewart Murray, GFMS chief executive. If supply from these two latter sources 'proves not to be overwhelming, the prospects for sustained investment demand, and consequently a continued recovery in the price, will improve enormously'. GFMS is owned by Gold Fields of South Africa, Newmont Mining, the biggest North American gold producer, and Renison Goldfields, an Australian natural resources group. Other important points from the survey, widely considered to be the most authoritative in the industry, include: Total gold supply last year rose by 12 per cent from the 1991 level to 3,182 tonnes. This included a 3.7 per cent increase in newly-mined gold in the western world, to 1,841 tonnes. When the former eastern bloc is included, the increase was of 2.9 per cent to 2,217 tonnes; Central bank and other official sales were the highest since 1968, at 910 tonnes. But substantial purchases reduced the net supply from this source to 599 tonnes; Hedging by producers contributed a net 155 tonnes of accelerated supply; On the demand side, total fabrication demand rose by 11 per cent to 2,859 tonnes, and therefore exceeded the combined supply from western world mine production and old gold scrap by 583 tonnes. Jewellery fabrication remained the most important component of demand, rising 15 per cent to a record 2,461 tonnes and accounting for 86 per cent of all fabrication demand. Average western world gold production cash costs fell by 5 per cent to USDollars 247 an ounce and total costs were down by 4 per cent to Dollars 300.

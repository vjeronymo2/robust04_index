			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Vibroplant shares fall 9p after warning Vibroplant, the plant hire group, lifted pre-tax profits 88 per cent in the six months to September 30. However, the share price fell 9p to 120p following a warning by Mr Jeremy Pilkington, chairman, that after a good summer the past six weeks had seen some softness in the UK commercial and industrial markets. October, November and December were usually the group's strongest months, he added. Pre-tax profits climbed to Pounds 2.78m (Pounds 1.48m) in the first half, on turnover down slightly at Pounds 35.7m (Pounds 36.9m). An 11 per cent fall in US turnover to Pounds 16.1m (Pounds 18.2m) disguised a 5 per cent increase in the UK to Pounds 19.7m (Pounds 18.8m). Mr Pilkington attributed the decline in the US to the reduced size of the US fleet, fewer machines sold and the adverse effects of a 6 per cent change in the exchange rate. However, between group trading profits, which slipped to Pounds 9.6m (Pounds 9.67m), and group operating profits, which rose to Pounds 3.47m (Pounds 2.51m), depreciation costs fell from Pounds 7.16m to Pounds 6.13m. Mr Pilkington said the group had changed its method of charging depreciation. Previously it had made a full year's charge in the year of purchase, regardless of whether a machine had been bought in the first month or the twelfth; now it charged on a monthly basis from the date of purchase. Interest charges dropped to Pounds 690,000 (Pounds 1.03m) as borrowings fell to Pounds 20m, for gearing of 35 per cent against 45 per cent a year ago. UK pre-tax profits grew 86 per cent to Pounds 2.64m due to increased volumes and prices, with capital spending of more than Pounds 10m. In the US, where profits doubled to a 'very modest' and 'unsatisfactory' Pounds 144,000, capital spending totalled Dollars 6m (Pounds 3.6m). Group capital spending is expected to total Pounds 25m this year. Earnings per share rose to 3.87p (2.08p) and the interim dividend is 1.35p (1.22p).</p>

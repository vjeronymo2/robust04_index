			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / UK Company News: Friendly Hotels advances Although the anticipated improvement in trading conditions did not materialise, Friendly Hotels managed to achieve increased turnover and profits in 1993. On turnover up from Pounds 29.6m to Pounds 32.4m, pre-tax profits for the year to December 26 came out at Pounds 2.61m. That compared with restated profits of Pounds 374,000 for 1992, although the company said the advance was rather more modest when compared with the pre-FRS 3 figure of Pounds 2.54m. Earnings per share were 6.3p (9.5p losses) and a final dividend of 3.5p is recommended, maintaining the total at 5.7p. Two new hotels were opened towards the end of last year, and were 'trading encouragingly' in 1994, the company said. In September Friendly raised some Pounds 10m through a rights issue, reducing net borrowings to Pounds 30.1m and gearing to 37 per cent.</p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Late program buying helps Dow to improve Wall Street US SHARE prices ended firmer yesterday after gains in certain sectors - notably transportation and brokerage stocks - and some late program buying helped the markets recover from losses incurred earlier in the week among consumer issues, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 19.45 up at 3,397.02. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index gained 1.57 at 442.73 and the Nasdaq composite firmed 4.74 to 668.88. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled 298m shares. The markets still lacked an overall clear direction, a reflection of nervousness following the recent sell-off in leading consumer stocks such as Wal-Mart and Home Depot, and of the cautious approach investors were adopting ahead of the all-important inflation news due out today and tomorrow, when the March producer and consumer indices will be published. Recent gains in commodity prices, coupled with continued strength in certain areas of the economy, have revived fears that inflationary pressures may be building up. Those fears have trimmed prices in bond and stock markets and, if the March prices data comes in stronger than expected, analysts warn that equity prices could tumble. Some individual sectors performed strongly. Airlines were generally higher amid hopes that the recent restructuring in the industry would eventually lead to a return to profitability for the country's biggest carriers. Among the leading stocks, UAL (which announced further cuts in aircraft order costs yesterday) jumped Dollars 9 7/8 to Dollars 137, Delta added Dollars 3 3/4 at Dollars 57 1/4 , USAir advanced Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 24 1/4 and AMR, parent of American Airlines, climbed Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 69. Brokerage issues were also in demand, following record quarterly results from Bear Stearns for the January-to-March reporting period. Bear Stearns ended Dollars 1 1/8 ahead at Dollars 19, Merrill Lynch up Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 69 1/4 and PaineWebber Dollars 1 higher at Dollars 24 7/8 . Home Depot bounced back from losses incurred earlier in the week, rallying Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 58 in volume of 3.6m shares. US Surgical fell Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 46 1/2 after a Dean Witter analyst changed his recommendation on the stock to 'sell' from 'neutral' and cut his forecast for 1993 sales and profits because he fears the company has over-estimated future sales of its tools for laparoscopic surgeons. Advanced Micro Devices rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 25 1/8 in volume of 2.3m shares after Warburg, the securities house, raised its investment rating on the stock from 'add' to 'buy', citing the company's better than expected first-quarter results. Canada AFTER trading in negative territory for most of the day, Toronto saw a modest last-hour rally which left shares closing mixed with just a slightly easier bias. Trading was again heavy. The TSE 300 index was finally up 2.6 at 3,601.4 but declines led advances by 358 to 324 after volume of 59.0m shares valued at CDollars 513.8m.</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / UN action plan for Somalia THE United Nations yesterday presented to donor nations a 100-day action plan for Somalia intended to strengthen UN relief operations in the war and famine-ravaged country, Frances Williams reports from Geneva. This follows strong criticism that the UN aid effort has been feeble and badly co-ordinated. It is appealing for Dollars 82.7m (Pounds 46.4m) to implement its plan for a massive infusion of food aid, alongside provision of shelter materials and medical supplies, a mass measles immunisation campaign and the start of a longer-term programme of recovery and rehabilitation, including delivery of seeds and tools.</p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / International Company News: Modest advance by Marriott MARRIOTT Corporation, the large but indebted hotels group, yesterday revealed a modest improvement in second-quarter profits and said it hoped recent domestic air fare wars would boost its summer business. In the second quarter, to June 19, Marriott made an operating profit of Dollars 125m, compared with Dollars 123m, on turnover of Dollars 2.03bn (Dollars 1.94bn). After-tax profits were up from Dollars 27m to Dollars 29m. The shares closed unchanged at Dollars 16 1/8 . Marriott said, however, that the figures included a number of non-comparable items. Without these complicating factors, it claimed, that operating profits would have shown an 8 per cent rise, while after-tax profits would have been up by 28 per cent. The company's lodging division showed a 6 per cent sales gain, year-on-year, while operating profits were up by 9 per cent. Minus the non-comparable items, this latter figure would have been up by 19 per cent. On the contract services side, Marriott posted a 4 per cent sales increase but saw operating profits fall by 16 per cent,. - a decline which it blamed on the slow economic recovery.</p>

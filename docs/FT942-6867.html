			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Danes propose two-tier pricing system for EU milk Dairy farmers in the European Union could produce some of their milk at world prices and then sell it outside the EU as a way of beating restrictions imposed by EU milk quotas, according to a suggestion by the Danish Dairy Federation. The federation made the proposal to the European Commission in February, but is now working out details of the plan, which is yet to be debated by agriculture ministers. 'We are still evaluating the pros and cons, but it would be a way of coping with the Gatt deal,' said Mr Prebben Mikkelsen, head of the federation's economics department. The Danish proposals would operate a two-tier pricing system with farmers producing the bulk of their milk under an 'A' quota for which they would receive high EU prices. But 'B' quotas would also be available for farmers who were able to produce a little extra milk at marginal cost for the export market. Producers would be paid for this 'B' milk at world prices, which are up to a third lower than internal EU prices. The system would also be voluntary for producers who wanted to add a few cows to supplement their income. Mr Jens Jakob Jakobsen, a dairy farmer in northern Jutland with 112 cows echoes the scepticism of other producers when he says he is not sure he would produce more milk under such a system. 'We could take on more cows but it depends on the price: I wouldn't do it at prices less than a third of what we get now,' he says. Many farmers are also concerned that the system would be difficult to police and would lead to erosion of prices for the rest of their output. Denmark needs to secure its export markets as it produces three times more milk than it consumes. British farmers are sceptical that such a scheme would benefit them when quotas restrict output to only 85 per cent of the UK's needs. Overall, farmers in the EU currently produce 4bn litres or 4 per cent more milk than is consumed. Some of this finds its way into the manufacture of dairy products and the EU's intervention system: the controversial butter mountains. In addition, the EU pays a subsidy for dairy products to be exported outside the union. These subsidies must be cut under the terms of the Gatt settlement, making it hard for European exporters to retain overseas markets. Mr Finn Christiansen, executive director of MD Foods, the large Danish dairy co-operative, says the two-tier system would be one way round the problem of losing part of the world market. The EU has to cut subsidised cheese exports from a reference tonnage of 407,000 tonnes to 305,000 tonnes by 2000. But Mr Christiansen says the problem is more serious and will hit cheese hardest as EU exports to third countries reached 480,000 tonnes last year so the cuts will be greater. In addition, the EU must open up its market to provide access for other dairy exporting nations, meaning it must absorb another 105,000 tonnes of cheese.</p>

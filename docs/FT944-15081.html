			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Ex-BCCI chief given 11-year prison term Mr Swaleh Naqvi, former chief executive of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, was sentenced to 11 years and three months imprisonment in the US yesterday for his role in the multi-billion dollar fraud at the collapsed bank. He was also ordered to pay Dollars 255.4m (Pounds 161.6m) restitution. The sentence, which was handed down at a federal court in Washington, was the maximum permitted under a plea agreement worked out between Mr Naqvi's lawyers and the US Department of Justice. It makes Mr Naqvi the most senior BCCI officer yet jailed over the fraud. However, the sentence will be reduced by the three years and one month Mr Naqvi has already spent in detention in Abu Dhabi and the US. The Justice Department said it would apply for a further reduction if Mr Naqvi assists with its investigations into BCCI over the next year. Mr Naqvi pleaded guilty in July to three criminal charges of fraud and conspiracy at BCCI, which was closed by international regulators three years ago. He admitted he engaged with other BCCI executives in a racketeering conspiracy secretly to control several US banks. Mr Naqvi will face additional charges in New York tomorrow when he is due to be arraigned before a state court there. Prosecutors acting for Mr Robert Morgenthau, the New York district attorney, are pushing for a further, higher sentence. The move is seen in part as an attempt to force him to help with their own inquiries into the BCCI affair. Mr Joseph diGenova, Naqvi's lawyer, said his client has already given considerable help to a number of investigators since being being sent to the US by Abu Dhabi five months ago. These include the Federal Bureau of Investigations, the Internal Revenue Service and the Immigration and Naturalisation Service, he said. Mr Naqvi has also been interviewed before two federal Grand Juries in the past three weeks, in Atlanta and Washington. One investigator who has followed the BCCI case from its inception said that these Grand Juries were weighing whether to indict junior BCCI employees, implying that the Justice Department has halted investigations into whether outsiders, including prominent figures in the US, may have aided in the BCCI fraud. However, Mr diGenova said Mr Naqvi was helping with inquiries into several people outside the bank, including some who resided in the US. Jim Kelly adds: BCCI creditors have agreed to accept Dollars 1.8bn in compensation from Abu Dhabi, a creditors' spokesman said in London yesterday. Mr Tony Scott of the British-based BCCI Depositors Protection Association (DPA) said creditor committees in Luxembourg, the Cayman Islands and Britain, where the collapsed bank was registered, had now accepted the offer.</p>

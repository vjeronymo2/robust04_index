			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 17 (XINHUA) -- China and the United  States signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on bilateral  textile trade agreement here today, thus avoiding a textile  trade war between the two sides.    The agreement was reached with the conclusion of the fourth  round of negotiations on the issue.    Chinese chief textile negotiator and Vice-Minister of  Foreign  Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng said that during  the three-day negotiations, the U.S. side agreed not to insist  on reductions of between 25 and 35 percent in import quotas of  Chinese textiles.    According to him, the United States has withdrawn articles  of  arbitrary deduction regarding illegal transshipment of textiles  from the proposed new agreement.    Shi said that the Chinese side also made substantial  concessions during the talks.    China has agreed to accept a quota reduction of no more than  three times the amount of textiles conclusively proven to have  been illegally transshipped.    Besides, China also agreed to major adjustments of some  categories of the textile quota proposed by the U.S. side.    The new agreement is the fourth of its kind China and the  United States have reached.    Shi and U.S. top textile negotiator Jennifer Hillman signed  the new document on behalf of their respective governments.    He attributed the success of the talks to the fact that,  during the talks, both sides took into consideration the overall  interests of bilateral trade and economic ties and adhered to  the principle of equality, consultation and mutual understanding  and accommodation.    He said he believed that signing the new agreement will be  conducive to a healthy development of textile trade as well as  other economic and trade ties between the two countries.    Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic  cooperation, met with Hillman and her delegation before  attending the signing ceremony.    The previous textile trade agreement expired at the end of  last year and the first round of talks on the new agreement  started last September in Beijing.</p>

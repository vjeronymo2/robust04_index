			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Arts: Why videos are not so nasty - Censorship removes insights as well as so-called 'incitements' Christmas approaches, season of jollity and good will, and the only video anyone is talking about is Childs Play 3. Did one of James Bulger's killers watch it in the days before the murder and might it have spurred him on? The boy's parents, police interviewers and lawyers all said they believed not. But that has not stopped the trial judge from rounding up the usual scapegoat and issuing another public warning about so-called Violent Videos. Old habits die hard and it is no disincentive to our nation's wig-wearers that we live in a country whose repressive screen legislation is already a source of amazement, sometimes derision, to neighbour countries. As they note on the continent, football hooligans and violent crime statistics like Britain's are a grand advertisement for the success of a censorship-prone society. Childs Play 3 is a foolish little shocker with two chance similarities to the Bulger case: paint thrown in victim's face, journey to murder spot. Draw a line at screen fare like this and little short of Home Alone 2 would escape censure. Yet the madness of the More Censorship lobby marches on, and attempts to make them pause by raising questionable precedents have little impact on their zeal. Twenty-five years ago Mary Bell, the 11-year-old killer of two small boys, said she was inspired to her murder by watching TV's The Saint. Should we have banned that? And 12 years ago a US President might have avoided an assassination attempt if the films of Jodie Foster had not inspired his assailant. Should we ban Taxi Driver and Bugsy Malone? (Long before the moving image, of course, brutal murders were committed without any help from the screen. See Jack the Ripper, Lizzie Borden and company). Imitation is the mechanism most censorship lobbyists ring alarm bells about. But imitation has little or nothing to do with most filmgoer's response to TV, videos or films. Take four varied movies about violence issued on cassette this month. Henri-Georges Clouzot's classic French shocker Les Diaboliques (Simitar) has a tale more gory than Childs Play 3. A brutal headmaster is graphically killed by two women - wife Vera Clouzot and schoolmistress Simone Signoret - after which he returns, or seems to return, to terrorise them. What should we do with this film? It is searingly convincing dramatically; it will purvey emotion, catharsis and even psychological insights to 99.9 per cent of viewers; and yet it might be 'imitated' by the other 0.1 per cent. So might more recent, populist fare like Falling Down (Warners) and the notorious Belgian film Man Bites Dog (Tartan). In the first, disgruntled yuppie Michael Douglas takes the law into his hands and goes on a citywide violence spree. In the second a serial murderer shows off his killing prowess to two camcorder-wielding friends. Same problem. Emotion, illumination, thought-provocation for 999 viewers; blueprint for action for our lone Citizen Psychotic. If we intervened in screen culture, given these odds and unpredictable indicators, where would we stop? Why would we not harry into oblivion other films immortalised on videotape this month? Bergman's The Seventh Seal (Tartan): mediaeval brutality, disease, fetishisation of death. Fellini's La Dolce Vita (Electric): decadence and lust in swinging Rome. Sally Potter's Orlando (First Independent): war, transexualism, single motherhood. Taken to its extreme, the mad logic would be unerring. We would end up having to gear all our films towards sedating the disturbed or potentially dangerous mind. So long as violence and other aberrant behaviour, actual or arguable, exist in the world, so should their representation in our culture. The decrying of films and videos as a spur to delinquent behaviour has become a tired catcall, as lazy and irresponsible as it is unproven. 'Out of sight, out of mind' is the creed of those who believe that moving images are a trigger to violent crime. But a disturbed mind will find the stimuli it wants to find, if necessary from material that can seem bafflingly innocuous to others. And the 'disarmament' that is censorship can remove the insights as well as incitements offered by violent art and entertainment: leaving society's true defenders, not just society's aggressors, less well-equipped to act and think in response to the signals offered by a troubled time.</p>

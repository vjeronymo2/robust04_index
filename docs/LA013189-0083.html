			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Because of a slight dip in the median price of housing in December, more  Californians were able to afford a home, the California Assn. of Realtors said.  The $5,000 drop to $172,405 in the median price of a California home marked the  first time in two years that housing costs actually declined, narrowing -- at  least temporarily -- an affordability gap that had been widening by the month.  The group said 23% of the state's households earned enough income -- $54,764 a  year -- to purchase a median-priced, single-family, detached home in December.  </P></p>

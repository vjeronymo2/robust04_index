			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Poland launches 'beauty contest' for TV licence - Public hearings this weekend may decide the future of Polish commercial television The future shape of Polish commercial television may depend on the outcome of unprecedented public hearings which begin in Warsaw tomorrow. The hearings, chaired by Mr Marek Markiewicz, head of the nine-man Television and Radio Council, the regulatory body, will decide which of 10 competing foreign and national media groups should be awarded the first Polish commercial television licence. The stakes are high. Major international media companies, including Bertelsmann of Germany, the Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion (CLT), and Time-Warner of the US, are in the ring. CLT is linked to Reuters while Time-Warner is harnessed with CNN and Capital Cities-ABC. Sofirad, a French government-linked company, is running together with CEDC Media Enterprises, controlled by Mr Mark Palmer, the former US Ambassador to Budapest. The French pay-TV company, Canal Plus, has put in a separate bid. Meanwhile, Top Canal, a local pirate broadcaster, has enlisted the services of Kinnevik International, the Swedish media group, while Italian interest is represented by Mr Nicola Grauso. Mr Grauso, a broadcast and print media owner from Sardinia, obtains some of his programming and advertising from Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest group. The hearings have been designed to give maximum transparency in view of the potentially lucrative nature of the licence and its political sensitivity. The proposed new channel will carry news and current affairs programmes as well as entertainment and sport. It will, therefore, bring an end to complete political control over the most influential opinion-forming medium in Poland. With over 38m inhabitants, Poland is the largest of the post-communist states of central Europe and the first to emerge from the recession which followed shock therapy economic reforms. Over 50 per cent of the economy is now in private hands and 4.5 per cent economic growth is expected for 1994, after a 4 per cent rise in GNP last year. Whether the new licence will prove to be 'a licence to print money', as in the early days of UK commercial TV, however, remains unclear. Last year, the total advertising spend on Polish TV is estimated by advertising industry sources at around Dollars 130m. Industry estimates put the initial investment required to get the proposed new channel off the ground and running at between Dollars 60m and Dollars 100m. Clauses in the law require that around 50 per cent of broadcast output is produced locally, so raising costs, while foreign shareholdings in the competing groups have been limited by law to 33 per cent. This means that all the international players have had to find local partners, whose financial resources are in most cases limited. Another drawback for the successful bidder is that initially the new 'national' channel will reach less than half the potential audience. The military say they can only free the frequencies needed for nationwide coverage if they are given funds from the cash-strapped budget to modernise air traffic control equipment. Mr Piotr Kolodziejczyk, the defence minister, has said this could take up to three years. Such a delay means that the new channel will face losses of revenue to local and regional TV stations, which are also applying for licences and whose applications are to be decided at a later date. The problem with frequencies could possibly be resolved sooner if President Lech Walesa, who is responsible for defence, was better disposed towards the broadcasting council. However, the council has already infuriated the President by appointing Mr Wieslaw Walendziak, an independent-minded, 31-year old journalist to head state-owned TV. The decision led Mr Walesa publicly to call for the resignation of Mr Markiewicz, as well as two colleagues nominated by him last year. The three refused to resign and the row has since died down, but it showed how precarious the council's position is. Mr Markiewicz, the council's chairman, is a soft-spoken, 42-year old lawyer from Lodz who represented the Solidarity trade union in the last parliament. He tends to pick his words with the thoughtful attention of a man who knows he is in a political minefield. The council was originally appointed last year by the president and the former Parliament. Its members were chosen from the 29 parties represented in the old parliament, which reflected all strands of political opinion in the country. Despite their differing political origins, the council members have developed an esprit de corps. But they no longer reflect the political realities of the recently elected current parliament. The September elections eliminated most of the smaller parties and parliament is now dominated by a centre-left coalition with its roots in the communist past. In March, the council will present its first annual report to parliament. Should this be rejected, its members will have to resign. As the council is charged not only with granting licences but also monitoring broadcasting activity, the implications for media freedom and the future of the proposed commercial channel are serious. So far, the government has been careful not to back President Walesa in his attempts to get Mr Markiewicz replaced. However, as Mr Leszek Miller, the labour minister who is attuned to feeling on the left wing of the ruling Left Democratic Alliance (SLD), says: 'President Walesa has put the thought that Markiewicz and his colleagues might be replaced into people's minds, so who knows?'</p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN'S CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS SHRINKS 63% IN JULY  </P> <P> Surprisingly robust imports helped shrink Japan's current account balance of  payments surplus, the broadest measure of trade in goods and services, by more  than half in July, and economists say the trend could continue if oil prices  rise further.  </P> <P> The Finance Ministry reported Friday that the current account, the widest  measure of a nation's trade in goods and services, shrank 63.27% to an  unadjusted $2.02-billion surplus in July, from $5.50 billion a year earlier.  </P> <P> A Ministry of Finance official told reporters that Friday's figures support the  view that Japan's current account surplus is in a declining trend, although  there have been monthly variations.  </P> <P> Economists said robust imports and a surprisingly large deficit in invisible  trade were responsible for the month's sharp decline.  </P> <P> Within the overall current account, the merchandise trade surplus narrowed  22.9% to $5.42 billion from $7.03 billion a year earlier.  </P> <P> Imports rose 12% to $17.92 billion from $16 billion a year earlier. Economists  attributed part of the gain to higher oil prices but said Japan's insatiable  appetite for foreign art also boosted the imports figure.  </P> <P> Indeed, the official said the ratio of imported manufactured goods to overall  imports was 54.4% in July, a record after a former high of 52.4% in June, 1990.  </P> <P> Exports were $23.33 billion, against $23.03 billion a year ago, easing concern  that Japanese industry was about to pour more products into nations already  sensitive to trade imbalances.  </P></p>

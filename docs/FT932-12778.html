			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Travelling the Globe - An innovative export scheme which might be just the ticket for unemployed managers Stephen Elliott covered 4,000 kilometres of German motorway in eight days earlier this year, visiting 14 companies in process. Like any other export salesman, Elliott was attempting to interest potential buyers in his company's products. HVR International, a Tyneside-based manufacturer of high voltage resistors used mainly in electrical switchgear, is keen to get more of its products used in industrial applications. Unlike other salesmen, Elliott was not on the full-time payroll, though HVR does employ 36 people. He was on a five-month assignment to the company as part of an innovative exporting scheme devised by Project North East (PNE*), a Newcastle-upon-Tyne enterprise agency. PNE's Globe programme places unemployed managers who have a degree or a professional qualification with small and medium-sized companies trying to develop their export business. Globe (the Graduate Level Overseas Business Exchange) allows companies which could not afford to take on a full-time export manager to test overseas markets. 'Smaller companies often don't have the time, the resources or the contacts to do this on their own,' says Colin Weatherspoon, manager of the Globe programme. Globe is intended primarily for companies which are 'passive exporters', responding to the occasional overseas order but unable to develop an active exporting strategy. They pay up to a quarter of the Pounds 4,000 cost of the programme while the secondees have continued to receive their unemployment benefit. PNE hopes this year to replace this with a system whereby companies pay a salary to secondees, of about Pounds 150 a week, but make no direct contribution to the programme. The unemployed managers start in October with eight weeks of training from PNE and the University of Northumbria in international marketing, negotiating and selling skills. They then spend three months on assignment with a company learning about its products and its business and carrying out market research. Towards the end of their assignment, in February, they spend a fortnight in continental Europe following up phone leads and visiting potential customers. Another Tyneside company, Kirkdale Engineering, fitted the Globe criteria perfectly. Kirkdale, a sub-contract engineer with sales of Pounds 1.7m and 38 employees, makes only 2 per cent of sales outside the UK. But co-founder and director John Jobling sees good prospects overseas for his company's speciality, rotational moulding tooling used in making plastic products such as road cones and litter bins. 'To survive we have to grow and the only growth can come from exports,' says Jobling. At the suggestion of PNE, which was already providing financial advice, Jobling acquired the services of Charles Scales, an unemployed manager in his late 30s with experience of manufacturing. Working much of the time from home, Scales researched the continental marketplace before spending a fortnight visiting potential customers in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. Jobling says he expected to wait six months for Scales's efforts to produce results but earlier this month he received his first order, worth Pounds 11,000, from Germany. He believes two other inquiries, one from Germany, one from the Netherlands, will become orders. Elliott's company, HVR International, was already an experienced exporter, selling 80 per cent of its Pounds 1.5m turnover overseas. But existing export business took up all the time of the company's three-strong sales and marketing team and there was no one available to open up new markets. Roger Manning, managing director, had drawn up a five-year growth plan which envisaged an increase in sales to Pounds 3.5m. Vital to the plan was a reduction of the company's dependence on the switchgear market and expansion into fields such as industrial controls and factory automation. HVR had one particular product on its books developed for a US customer but never exploited in Europe. Elliott took this product to potential German customers and has already produced two small orders. Like many of the other Globe participants, Elliott did not have a marketing background - he has qualifications in mechanical engineering and accountancy - but this was not a handicap, says PNE's Paul Sampson. An engineering background gave participants a head start in understanding the products they were selling and their applications. Language skills were a bonus but did not prove absolutely necessary for participants, says Sampson. Elliott spoke enough German to get through to the design engineers he needed to reach and once he had found them they were willing and able to speak English. But helping north-east companies get into overseas markets is only half of the Globe project. It is also intended to help the unemployed managers find jobs, if possible in the company to which they are allocated. Kirkdale was not able to offer Scales a job but HVR has kept Elliott on for a further six months. If this works out he can expect to be offered a senior job, says Manning. As the Globe initiative has evolved - Weatherspoon is now working on the third programme - it has had to move upscale. It started out supporting companies with between 10 and 15 employees but these were too small to sustain the export drive or to offer a job to the secondee. The third programme is targetting companies employing between 30 and 250 people though Weatherspoon is concerned that this shuts out the smaller business. 'Maybe there are other ways of helping them,' he muses. Pitched at companies of a suitable size, Globe appears to provide a valuable service. 'If we hadn't taken part in this project we would have had to do the job in-house in the tea break,' says Jobling. 'It would have taken us two years to get this far if we had been doing it ourselves.' *PNE is an enterprise agency - though it prefers the label business support agency - funded by corporate sponsors, Training and Enterprise Councils and by charging for its consultancy work and programmes. It is at Hawthorn House, Forth Banks, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 3SG. Tel. 091 261 7856.</p>

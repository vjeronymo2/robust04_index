			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VISITING ARMENIAN LEADER IS PESSIMISTIC;  </P> <P> EASTERN BLOC: 'WE DO NOT HAVE PERESTROIKA,' SAYS RAFAEL KAZARYAN. HE CALLS  GORBACHEV A 'NEO-STALINIST.'  </P> <P> To be born and raised in these United States is to be told that, in this land  of opportunity, you can grow up to be President. Getting straight A's and  eating your broccoli is thought to help.  </P> <P> To be born Armenian and raised in America is to be steeped in another dream.  </P> <P> "Many of us are hoping one day to have a free country again," said teacher  Linda Bulbulian, whose classroom at Ramona Elementary School in Hollywood is  packed with Armenian immigrant children. "Many of these children want to go  home."  </P> <P> Bulbulian's pupils on Monday met a page from their sad, proud, hopeful history  -- although the significance of their visitor, Rafael Kazaryan, seemed lost on  the youngsters. When students were asked if they had any questions, one eagerly  raised his hand and announced to the class that he had seen Kazaryan on TV.  There was no question.  </P> <P> Kazaryan, a leader of Armenia's nationalist movement and the first  non-communist vice president of the Soviet Armenia parliament, spared the  children the harsher truths of life and politics back home.  </P> <P> To the children, the 66-year-old Kazaryan -- who is on a week-long tour of the  United States and Canada -- seemed more the gentle grandfather than the  intellectual firebrand who challenges Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> He did not discuss with them, for example, the chemical spill last week that  sickened more than 100 Armenians, and the assault on KGB headquarters in the  Armenian capital that followed. Nor did Kazaryan share the tale of his  political rise -- a path that included a six-month prison stint in Moscow in  1988. His jail time, in a sense, carried on a family tradition: Kazaryan's  father and grandfather had been imprisoned in the gulags of Josef Stalin.  </P> <P> For all Gorbachev's efforts in Eastern Europe, "It's a pity, but in his  country, he is a neo-Stalinist," Kazaryan said in an interview.  </P> <P> "We have glasnost in Armenia, or we wouldn't be talking," Kazaryan said,  referring to the opening of foreign relations. But as for internal reforms  heralded by Gorbachev, "we do not have perestroika."  </P> <P> Time and again, Kazaryan would preface his remarks with the phrase, "it's a  pity." But pity is not want Armenia wants or needs, Kazaryan said. Although its  economy has been ravaged by the devastating 1988 earthquake and territorial  strife with neighboring Soviet Azerbajian, Armenia needs political support and  investment more than relief supplies, he said. "We don't want to be a beggar.  We don't want you to pity us."  </P> <P> Before stopping by Ramona Elementary, where about 300 children are first- or  second-generation Armenians, Kazaryan met with senators in Washington, Armenian  scholars and members of the Armenian and American press. Armenian leaders  estimate that their community in Southern California, centered in Glendale and  Hollywood, numbers 250,000.  </P> <P> A leading physicist, Kazaryan also met with scientists and industrialists,  hoping to lure support for his homeland's budding high-tech enterprises.  </P> <P> Kazaryan predicted that independence will come for Lithuania ahead of the  five-year time schedule proposed by Gorbachev. Other Baltic states will follow,  and Armenia's time will come later, he said.  </P> <P> Economic strength is one reason the Baltic states will achieve independence  first, he said. Another, he said, is the Western perception that strife between  Azerbajianis and Armenians is between "two wild peoples." He suggested the two  republics could co-exist peacefully without Moscow's intervention.  </P> <P> "Of course, it's a pity," he added, that nationalist extremists had attacked  the KGB headquarters. He stressed in interviews that the violent incident came  about after a recent raid on Armenian villages by Soviet soldiers and the  chemical leak at a controversial industrial plant.  </P> <P> After learning of the attack on KGB offices in a telephone call Saturday, "I  did not get much sleep," Kazaryan said, adding that he is fearful of a stronger  crackdown by Moscow.  </P> <P> To outsiders, Kazaryan's transformation from political prisoner to a leader of  the Soviet Armenian government has made him a symbol of greater political  freedom within the Soviet Union. But Kazaryan, who was jailed along with other  members of Armenia's so-called Karabagh Committee, said his release grew out of  a changing political atmosphere and pressure from groups such as Amnesty  International as well as scientists in the Soviet Union and outside the  country.  </P> <P> After spending several weeks in a cell with hard-core criminals, Kazaryan  threatened to commit suicide unless relocated. The threat worked, he said,  because Soviet officials were fearful of scandal. "After that, I was among very  honest thieves who were proud to be with me," he said with a grin.  </P> <P> In a brief reception at Ramona Elementary, Kazaryan told Los Angeles school  board President Jackie Goldberg to expect more Armenian students. "It's a pity,  but there will be more refugees, more immigrants," he said. ". . . There's only  one way to minimize the number of immigrants -- and that's to improve  conditions in our country."  </P> <P> Armenia may be many years from independence, but Kazaryan proudly pointed out  that the Armenian nationalists took to the streets before the Lithuanians did.  Lithuanian leaders are said to have been emboldened by the efforts of Armenian  nationalists -- a notion that Kazaryan finds comforting.  </P> <P> Kazaryan confessed that as an 18-year-old radio operator in the Soviet army, he  had participated in Stalin's takeover of the Baltic states.  </P> <P> "It's a pity," he said, ". . . but it's true."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In Kyrgyzstan President Askar Akayev has spoken of  the need to strengthen all levels of government in the country.  He said the deepening of economic reforms is the prime concern  of the authorities. He spoke on Monday at a closed session of  the cabinet attended by the heads of local administrations.    The presidential press secretary Iman Rysaliyev told  INTERFAX  that the president pointed to the need for strengthening the  akimat -- community of heads of local administrations. He also  stressed that the current decline in production should not be  linked to a crisis in government structures. He said that  despite the difficulties in economic restructuring certain  achievements have been gained primarily in monetary policy.  Last month inflation dropped to a 5-percent level and prices  stabilized. The main task is to reorganize the economy so that  it would operate to 90 percent on local raw materials.    The president also spoke for stopping all political rhetoric  concerning gold and gold mines. He thinks the government should  take steps in the nearest future so that foreign companies, in  particular from Canada and the United States, would finally  begin gold mining in Kyrgyzstan.</p>

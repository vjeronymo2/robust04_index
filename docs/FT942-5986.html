			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Australian growth rate surges to 5% Australia's economic growth rate surged to 5 per cent on an annualised basis in the March quarter, well in excess of both federal government and private sector economists' forecasts. The previous set of data, for the 1993 calender year, had indicated that the economy was growing at 4 per cent - itself the best figure clocked up for five years. But, according to data published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics yesterday, there was even stronger growth in the March quarter, with gross domestic product rising by 1.9 per cent in that three-month period alone. The first quarter increase was driven primarily by government and private consumption, rather than business investment or net export performance. The government's own budget estimates, published last month, suggested an annual growth rate of 4 per cent for the year to end-June, followed by 4.5 per cent in 1994-95. News of the surging economy exacerbated worries that interest rates might have to rise fairly soon, prompting a fall in bond prices and a sharp rise in the Australian dollar. The dollar reached a 20-month high, closing in London at 74.07 US cents, up from 73.83 cents. Interest rate policy, the pessimists argue, could become a dilemma for the government, since business investment remains at very low ebb (and actually fell in the March quarter). The government, therefore, could have difficulties restraining private consumption without choking off business expansion. Yesterday, however, Mr Ralph Willis, the federal treasurer, claimed that there were no signs that inflationary pressures were increasing, and hence that the data had no implications for interest rates. 'One can determine movements in interest rates as when we see a likely pick-up in inflation. We are not looking at anything here which shows you some pick-up in inflation,' he said. The government was still comfortable with its inflation forecast of around 2 per cent in 1993-94, Mr Willis added. The treasurer also noted that the 'early' Easter had affected consumption data, and contributed to the unexpectedly high growth figure. The federal government meanwhile announced yesterday that it had reached agreement with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the umbrella body for labour organisations, on minimum national wage increases to apply in 1994 and 1995. The deal was reached under an accord unveiled in early 1993 and the latest in a series of compacts between the ruling Labor government and Actu. The agreement provides for a ADollars 16-a-week 'safety net' wage rise to be paid to low income earners, spread across two years. This follows an ADollars 8 'safety net' increase awarded in last October's national wage decision - representing a ADollars 24-a-week wage rise over three years for workers who are not covered by individual 'enterprise-based' agreements. Mr Paul Keating, prime minister, said the deal should 'deliver wage restraint that will lock in the low inflation rate'. But the Australian Chamber of Manufacturers attacked the deal, saying the across-the-board rises, unrelated to productivity gains, would discourage business from employing more people or investing.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper's continued recovery buoys base metals - Market Report COPPER prices yesterday continued to claw back the losses recorded in last week's dramatic Dollars 120 sell-off at the London Metal Exchange and this spread confidence throughout the market, traders said. The three months delivery reached Dollars 2,544 before easing when Southern Peru Copper Corporations's workers ended a strike. Last business was at Dollars 2,536 a tonne, up Dollars 13 from Wednesday. Dealers noted that copper's fundamentals were the most promising of the base metals with a relatively low stocks/consumption ratio. ALUMINIUM prices were given an early boost by European merchant demand, which came in when the three months price dipped to Dollars 1,640 a tonne, and this soon saw the market nudging against Wednesday's resistance around Dollars 1,650. But again the barrier held and the price drifted back to Dollars 1,647, up Dollars 7. Compiled from Reuters</p>

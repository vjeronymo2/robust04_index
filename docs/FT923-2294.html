			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Sunday matters AMID THE tumult on the currency markets this week, attention has been distracted from the event that helped to bring it about - France's referendum campaign about the Maastricht treaty. Some are arguing that the vote has suddenly diminished in significance - that since the financial apocalypse foretold as a consequence of a French No is already upon us, the referendum somehow matters less. That argument is wrong. What happens on Sunday remains of central importance to Europe and to France. It is important for Europe because of the pivotal role France has played in the integration process from the beginning. And it is important for France because a commitment to Europe - and in particular to Franco-German co-operation - has defined the country's history and identity since the second world war. Indeed, until this year it appeared the French had identified themselves so completely with efforts to create a closer European union that the subject did not merit serious domestic debate. Impossible as it seemed when President Francois Mitterrand called the referendum last June, all those assumptions have now been thrown open to question by the possibility that voters will reject Maastricht this weekend. To understand that is the reason to hope that France will vote Yes. A No vote would not just destroy the treaty on European Union, or force EC institutions to tread water for a while. It would mark the biggest reverse in the Community's history, and one from which it would take years to recover. Rightly or wrongly, it would also be seen as undermining France's relationship with Germany at the worst possible political moment. Rumblings to this effect have been evident not far beneath the surface of the referendum debate, with French politicians on both sides of the argument referring to 'German demons' and German politicians struggling to contain their irritation. Approval of Maastricht is needed to banish such atavistic noises from mainstream politics, and permit the countries at the core of Europe to concentrate on steering the Community through the troubles that lie ahead. Even in the unlikely event of a resounding Yes, this will be exceptionally difficult. It will involve creative thinking by all EC governments, and a significant effort to assuage the concerns about the Maastricht treaty that have emerged in several member states apart from France. The treaty can only come into force when all 12 governments have ratified, and no one has yet come up with a remotely plausible answer to the problem posed by Denmark's vote to reject it last June. Moreover, the humiliation of the British government in the last two days makes it less likely that parliament will readily ratify Maastricht in its present form, and considerably less likely that Mr John Major, as current Community president, will be able to give much of a lead. As for Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl faces mounting political problems of his own - including domestic opposition to the treaty's provisions for economic and monetary union, which will have been fuelled by this week's market turbulence. All this points to the need for European governments to take another hard look at important aspects of the treaty - and in particular to obey economic logic in framing the timetable and scope for completion of monetary union, perhaps at variable speeds. But first we need a positive outcome on Sunday. A French Yes will not be sufficient to put the Community back on the rails. But without one, EC leaders will be hard-pressed even to begin trying.</p>

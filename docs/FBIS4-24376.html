			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, May 24 (XINHUA) -- Jozef Oleksy, speaker of  the polish Sejm (House of Representatives) [name and title as  received], has said that Poland and China should promote the  relations between them to a higher stage by strengthening their  cooperation.    Speaking to Chinese reporters on the eve of his trip to  China, the speaker said that Poland and China should cooperate  in many new fields, work out strategies that encouraged  cooperation and seek specific ways to undertake cooperation.    Oleksy, who will lead a parliamentary delegation to China,  said the visit was special in many respects.    The visit, the first by a high-ranking delegation from  Poland  since 1989, will be certain to promote cooperation between our  two countries, he said.    He went on to say that a dozen businessmen would accompany  him on his trip, which meant that it was mainly of an economic  nature.    He expressed the hope that during his stay in China the two  sides would do all they could to find new areas of cooperation  and work out relevant strategies.    He said that the Polish businessmen would take the  opportunity to discuss specific areas of cooperation with their  Chinese counterparts.    Referring to the prospects for Polish-Chinese relations,  Oleksy said that there was great potential for cooperation in  the fields of communications and transport and post and  telecommunications.    He said that the two countries should also expand their  cooperation in the fields of culture and science, create  favorable conditions for an increase in bilateral trade and  continue to make joint efforts to establish bilateral and  multilateral cooperation.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Society customers feel in the dark ONE third of savers do not think that building societies provide enough information about new accounts and 39 per cent of customers have been in a situation where they had to find out for themselves about a new account paying better rates, according to a survey by Continental Research, the market research agency. The survey, based on a sample of 200 customers, also found that those making their own decisions about a mortgage were more likely to choose a repayment mortgage than those advised by the building society, who are more likely to have an endowment mortgage. A quarter of those questioned said they did not think that societies should sell insurance, mainly because they thought it led to a conflict of interests.</p>

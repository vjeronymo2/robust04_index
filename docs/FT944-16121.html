			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Reliance prepares international debt issue Reliance Industries, the Indian petrochemicals group, is drawing up plans to launch an international debt securities issue as soon as government regulations permit, Mr Anil Ambani, managing director, said in London. To date, Reliance, which in 1992 became the first Indian company to offer global depositary receipts, has confined its international fund-raising to equity-related issues. Lack of official approval for debt issues was a competitive constraint, Mr Ambani said. 'You cannot ask Indian companies to become global while tying up our arms and legs.' Reliance's dependence on equity funding - net gearing is only 8 per cent - has pushed up its cost of capital and forced it to seek projects with an exceptionally high internal rate of return. Its current hurdle rate is 22 per cent in dollar terms. The addition of some debt funding, albeit cautiously, to its balance sheet would help bring its cost of capital closer to that of its main international competitors. Mr Ambani said he did not expect government approval for corporate debt issues before next year, but Reliance would be ready when it was granted. It has already sought a confidential credit rating from Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency. Though Reliance's current capital programme is fully-funded, the group plans to diversify within India and aims to raise overseas turnover to between 10 and 15 per cent of sales within the next three to four years, from 2 per cent at present. This could involve the establishment of overseas manufacturing plant, something which the govern-ment is starting to encourage. Reliance this week announced a 146 per cent increase in interim net profits to Rs5.1bn (Dollars 162.5m), in spite of a slight slippage in gross margins to 18.8 per cent from 19.4 per cent. This was blamed on a scheduled plant shut-down. Net profits were boosted by a sharp increase in investment income and a fall in depreciation charges, to Rs1.3bn from Rs2.1bn. Depreciation is likely to continue at a lower level, reflecting a change to Indian accounting rules, allowing assets to be depreciated over their full economic life.</p>

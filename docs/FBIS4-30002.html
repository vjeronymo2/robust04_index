			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Motohiro Matsumoto] </F>   [Text] Washington, 17 Jun -- The Toyota Motor Corporation  will set cost-cutting targets for U.S. auto parts makers which  have supplied auto parts to it. In Japan, automakers have  always asked their keiretsu [affiliated subsidiaries] auto parts  makers to reduce the cost of auto parts by setting numerical  targets. So far, Japanese automakers have not set any  cost-cutting targets for U.S. auto parts makers because of the  need to place importance on improving the quality of U.S. auto  parts. The automobile and auto parts sector has been one of the  priority sectors at the Japanese- U.S. economic framework talks,  and each Japanese automaker is in a hurry to expand its purchase  of U.S.-made auto parts. The Toyota Motor Corporation intends  to expand its purchase of U.S.-made auto parts by formulating a  long-term tie-up with U.S. auto parts makers, like the one it  has built in Japan.    The major Japanese automaker announced at an annual meeting  of U.S. auto parts manufacturers held earlier this week in San  Francisco that it would set the cost-reduction targets for U.S.  auto parts suppliers. The cost-cutting targets vary from  automaker to automaker, but each Japanese automaker sets them at  2 percent a year or 5 percent over five years, and then asks its  auto parts suppliers to meet these targets. Some Japanese  automakers have already notified their auto parts suppliers of  their targets.    In Japan, the formula has long been adopted whereby  numerical  targets are set for reductions in the cost along with  improvements in the quality of auto parts, and automakers and  auto parts makers work together to design auto parts and to  choose materials with which to manufacture auto parts. Only  some automakers have set numerical targets for cutting the  prices of parts, but automakers have come to seek cost-cutting  targets as the quality of auto parts has improved.    In March, the Toyota Motor Corporation announced plans to  boost its combined purchases of U.S.-made auto parts -- which  consist of imports and local purchase in the United States -- to  $6.45 billion in 1996 (from April 1996 to March 1997), an  increase of 38 percent over the total combined purchases in  1993. The major Japanese automaker has judged that it is  important to promote a long-term reduction in the cost and  improvements in the quality of U.S.-made auto parts by adopting  the Japanese-style keiretsu deal method to expand the purchase  of U.S.-made auto parts. While U.S. automakers are criticizing  the closed Japanese automobile and auto parts market, they are  vigorously embracing the Japanese-style keiretsu method in a bid  to bolster their competitiveness. Ford and Chrysler have  already pressed their auto parts suppliers to cut the price and  improve the quality of their parts. They have succeeded in  improving their competitiveness in the cost and the quality of  auto parts by strengthening their business ties with selected  auto parts suppliers in the areas of development and production.</p>

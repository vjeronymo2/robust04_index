			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report on Ministry of Railways Scientific and Technical </F> Council session by N. Davydov: "Let the Railcars Run a Little  Longer"]    [Text] When they say that we are living in an unstable and  unpredictable time, I ask myself: how is this manifested in  railroad transport? The overwhelming majority of the sector's  employees are continuing to perform their professional duties  conscientiously in spite of everything. Otherwise, the freight  and passengers would not be delivered to their destinations.    But this is being achieved at an increasingly higher price.  I  will not mention all the aspects of transport activity, just  one. In recent years, the number of freight cars in disrepair  has been increasing on railroads in both Russia and the CIS  countries. This is the result of a certain lack of  responsibility in their use and the forced division of the fleet  while they continue to be operated jointly, which leads to the  steady obsolescence of the rolling stock and sharp deterioration  in all types of repair work.    Generally speaking, this is not a new problem. It existed  even before the collapse of the USSR. But now the crisis in the  economy and inflation are aggravating the situation. Investments  in railroad transport have been reduced to zero and the purchase  of new rolling stock has been practically discontinued.  Accordingly, railcars are coming in for maintenance more and  more frequently, but there are not enough funds for this.    Quite naturally, the question arises: how do we stop the  trend of more and more railcars in disrepair? Specialists of the  VNIIZhT [All-Russian Railroad Transport Scientific Research  Institute] suggest that the railcars be assigned to railroads  for repair, which, they say, will make it possible to create a  self-regulated organizational-economic mechanism capable of  maintaining the railcar fleet in good technical working order.  Finding support from specialists in the MPS [Ministry of  Railways] Railcars Main Administration, they proposed that this  matter be submitted for discussion by the Scientific and  Technical Council.    While Professor V. Buyanov, head of the Transport  Development  Prospects Laboratory of the VNIIZhT, and I Glukhov, chief of the  Railcars Main Administration, were speaking, the impression was  created that after the railcars are assigned to the railroads,  the quality of their repair will improve and the expenses for  this purpose will even be reduced. But then their opponents--V.  Gorbunov, chief engineer of the Transpoort Main Administration,  and G. Bugrov, chief of the Statistics Administration--were  given the floor, and they cited numerous reasons to show that  the existing system for operating and maintaining the railcar  fleet must not be changed.    Without getting into the details of the dispute, it is still  necessary to dwell on the main factors which Deputy Minister A.  Kondratenko, who was chairing the session, repeatedly attempted  to clarify. What is your conviction--that assigning railcars to  the railroads will improve repair quality--based on? What is bad  about the system now in use and how do we correct this?    Running ahead, I will say that neither side cited exhaustive  and sufficiently persuasive arguments. There were many  analytical statistics and variations of organizational and  economic impact on the operations and repair processes, but on a  practical level they looked questionable at times.    For example, there are no justifiable grounds for the  statement that the railcars' assignment to railroads will make  it possible to improve the quality of depot repair, in their  opponents' opinion. In such a case, what is to happen to repair  cooperation and specialization, which is the basis for the  distribution of railcar depots in the railroad system? But the  main point is that there continue to be many rulers of the  railcar's destiny as before--chiefs of stations, the heads of  PTO's [technical inspection points], and so forth on the chain  over which it passes--but it has not had and does not have a  really responsible owner.    Returning to the reasons which forced the VNIIZhT  specialists  to conduct research on the problem, they were based on an abrupt  transition from a critical shortage to a large surplus in the  railcar fleet. It did not turn out to be so simple to adapt to  the new situation. But the continuing decline in transportation  services is leading to a further increase in the freight car  surplus. Under the conditions of rising inflation and  nonpayments, it is more and more difficult for the Ministry of  Railways to maintain them in good operating condition.    To emphasize the need to decentralize the railcar fleet, the  VNIIZhT referred to experience in the United States, where the  basic parameters--length of the system, the distances involved,  the freight handling, freight turnover, and so forth--are  similar in many respects to Russia's railroads. But there the  entire fleet is the property of the railroads and private  enterprises, and the railcar owners bear all the expenses for  their maintenance and repair. A special automated system follows  the 2 million railcars of the common fleet of the United States,  Canada, and Mexico. There are no problems with redistribution,  and record keeping has been organized at a high level.    But after all, it is the last condition which probably will  turn out to be a bottleneck for the Russian railroads in  assigning railcars. Though according to VNIIZhT calculations,  empty runs to "their" railroad and the average waiting time for  repair will increase substantially. However, taking into account  the undeveloped state of our information systems and the lack of  proper control over the transfer of railcars at junctions  between railroads, and so forth, V. Gorbunov said, the gain from  the innovation is very doubtful, but as far as the losses are  concerned, they are obvious. This includes losses in average  train weight and locomotive productivity (because of the empty  run), which leads to higher operating expenses.    All the same, let us return again to the situation that has  taken shape now. The MPS is not in a position to buy new  railcars in the quantity needed now. The railroads owe huge sums  for previous deliveries and repair of freight cars. Taking into  account the deterioration of rolling stock, it has not been  ruled out that there may be a substantial shortage of rolling  stock by the end of the decade, if the country finally begins to  emerge from the crisis, of course.    At the same time, according to information from the Railcars  Main Administration, there are about 110,000 inoperative  railcars in the system every day, and as strange as it seems,  this figure is not decreasing. Although last year 635,000  railcars were restored by all types of repair! The clearly  abnormal situation is forcing us to look not only for a solution  to reduce operating expenditures today, but so that we do not  end up where we were before if the freight flow begins to  increase.    I do not know who my neighbors were, but by the end of the  session, when it had become completely obvious that the prepared  version for assigning railcars to the railroads would not be  adopted, an interesting dialogue took place between them:    "Actually, they proposed a division for one purpose: to  assign a place of repair for each railcar."    "But they divided among the CIS administrations, you know,  and basically only Russia and Belarus are performing the repair."    "Not at all--others are creeping in little by little,  although I agree that a great deal depends on how the commanders  of independent railroads make use of their levers of influence."    "All the same, a transport worker is still in command of the  railcar; railcars administration employees essentially are not  the proprietors, and with our level of responsibility and  discipline in that administration, there will not be any!.."    The question automatically arises: did anything of value  come  out of the discussion that took place?    We can firmly say: yes, of considerable value. It defined  the  specific range of problems which must be resolved in order to  put economic levers into use for efficient operation of the  current system or a new system, as A. Kondratenko put it. First  of all, we need a balance inventory of the railcar fleet by car  numbers. In the event that there is a division among railroads,  the financing procedure will have to be changed. The principles  involved in the division also must be defined more specifically.  And so forth.    It is regrettable only if the main point is shifted  imperceptibly to second place after all these technical  problems: will the railcar have an owner, all the same? Whoever  receives income from its operation will take care of it. Not  because of an order to do so, but because he has an interest in  its good working order.    Perhaps those who have said that an inspector should be the  railcar owner are right? Yes, they are the ones who know "the  subject" like no one else and could take care of it. But this  "trifle" is needed for that: they must be given the right to  determine what happens to it, and neither the station chief, nor  the chief of the railcars service, nor even the one in charge of  the main administration would be able to countermand their  decision!    I ask myself: what kind of status and professional level  should they have then? And I respond that this is probably the  most complicated of all the questions. But we will have to  answer it anyway. If not today, then tomorrow.</p>

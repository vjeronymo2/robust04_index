			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HISTORY LESSONS  </P> <P> To set the record straight: The "halcyon days" of Roller Derby (to use the  quotation that Meyers attributed to Bill Griffiths) occurred when Griffiths was  50% partner in Roller Derby with Jerry Hill, from 1962 to 1971. Griffiths and  Hill were both responsible for the success of Roller Derby, along with many  other talented people.  </P> <P> To imply that Bill Griffiths was singularly responsible for rebuilding Roller  Derby into a business success that eventually led to RollerGames is both  inaccurate and unfair to Jerry Hill, my father.  </P> <P> DAVID A. HILL  </P> <P> President, Mediacom Inc.  </P> <P> Ft. Collins, Colo.  </P></p>

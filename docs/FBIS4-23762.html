			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Prison `Mayhem' -- The Johannesburg THE STAR in English on  14  June in a page-16 editorial criticizes the South African  Prisoners Organization for Human Rights, SAPOHR, for its role in  the recent prison riots. It is "worrying" that SAPOHR "launches  campaigns and then washes its hands of the consequences. Mass  action may have been justified during the apartheid years, but  SAPOHR's mobilisation tactics now border on the irresponsible.  It should rather focus on prison conditions alone. Calling for  a general improvement there is a legitimate pursuit; promoting  lawlessness and intimidation is not." Turning to the  government, the editorial then states that "both the  Transitional Executive Council, before the election, and now the  Government have vacillated in dealing with the causes of this  year's prison protests. Instead of establishing a moral,  ethical and legal basis for dealing with the franchise and  amnesty issues, the authorities appear to have made concessions  because of a lack of resolve. This kind of expediency sets a  dangerous precedent. It is something the country may yet come  to rue."  <H8>  CITY PRESS </H8>   Government Urged To Resist SAPOHR -- The Johannesburg CITY  PRESS in English on 12 June in a page-14 editorial states that  SAPOHR's Golden Miles Bhudu "must be told that he is playing  dangerous games by inciting prisoners to embark on so-called  rolling mass action to force the new government to grant amnesty  to the prisoners. The government must stand firm against any  attempts by SAPOHR to blackmail it. Any wholesale release of  prisoners would seriously undermine respect for the law."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   RSA Aid to Rest of Africa -- "Perceptions in the rest of the  continent, rightly or wrongly, are that South Africa is a honey  pot," begins the Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 14 June in a  page-6 editorial. "It is therefore inevitable, now that the  country has `opened up,' that people from more depressed  circumstances elsewhere will head for our borders." The SOWETAN  states that the government's approach to "economic refugees"  should be "threefold": first, treat refugees with "compassion  and humanity," second, get involved in resolving political  disputes "without becoming the `policeman' of Africa," and  third, "guard against using its economic strength to exploit  countries on the sub-continent." "Balanced economic growth  ensuring job opportunities and development for all in the region  is the most potent counter to the refugee problem."  <H8>  THE CITIZEN </H8>   Government's "Race Classification" Criticized -- "Strange,  isn't it? The previous Nationalist government got rid of race  classification three years ago. The new ANC-dominated  government intends to bring it back," states the Johannesburg  THE CITIZEN in English on 13 June in a page-6 editorial. The  government "is going to introduce race monitors -- defined as  `affirmative action monitoring mechanisms' -- to ensure that  affirmative action is carried out in the government and private  sectors. In some cases, according to the ANC, firms may be  required to keep records of the race of employees and even of  consumers." "Since race is no longer required to be stated in  identity books, one wonders how race will be established under  the ANC rules." Banks, businesses, and the civil service will  be brought under analysis. The editorial supports its  contention by quoting passages from the Reconstruction and  Development Program. "We hope the ANC will realise that any  form of race monitoring or classification is a throwback to a  system that could not be tolerated when it was enforced  previously -- and cannot be tolerated if it is imposed now.  Not, unless the ANC wants to destroy its nonracist image and  plunge the country into a new racial morass."</p>

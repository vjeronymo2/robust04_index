			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Oil ministers from the 12 OPEC member countries have  gathered since yesterday in Vienna to assess, within the 96th  session of the organization, the issues concerning OPEC.    Establishing the level of oil production ceiling in the  third  quarter of the current Christian year in view of market  conditions, electing a new secretary general, and deciding to  change the location of the OPEC secretariat are among the main  topics of the discussions of OPEC's 96th session.    It should be mentioned that in the last session of the oil  ministers which was held in the month of Farvardin [March-April]  of the current year the level of OPEC production was established  at 24.520 million barrels per day. In the past two month, as a  result of the commitment shown by the members to the fixed  quotas and of the emergence of signs of improvement in the world  economy, a new round was created to increase the price of oil.  It was thus that the OPEC oil marker price reached $16.    Although the price sought by OPEC for its marker price was  determined at $21 per barrel and the organization still has a  long way to go to reach its target, the existing climate at  OPEC's 96th session manifests the willingness of all the members  to maintain the present production ceiling. Despite the fact  that the demand for oil has overtaken its supply and despite the  increasing prices, OPEC's still aims to control the level of  production.    In the viewpoint of economic experts, the fluctuations in  the  oil prices have a very important effect on the development plans  of the members of OPEC. These countries are mainly dependent on  oil income and even a dollar reduction in the oil price will  reduce the income of the member countries by $9 billion.    Therefore, under the present situation, where it seems that  members of OPEC are united in their view in protecting the  production ceiling despite the oil demand and economic problems  of the member countries, this hope will be created that once  again OPEC, which has passed through three decades of  experiences and ups and downs, will find its true position and  authority in the international economic arena.    In the opinion of experts on oil issues, protecting the  production ceiling of 24.5 million barrels per day, taking into  account this prediction that demand will reach 26 million  barrels per day during the 3rd and 4th quarter of the current  Christian year, facilitates the process of achieving higher  prices. However, the Islamic Republic of Iran, which has always  strived to establish a just price for oil, supports any action  that will lead to an increase in the oil price and gives  authority to OPEC and believes that protecting the regular flow  of oil supply to the world economy depends on stable prices.  Such an aim will guarantee the interests of producers and  consumers alike.</p>

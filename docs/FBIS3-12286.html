He held the Israeli Government fully responsible for  this criminal act perpetrated by malicious Zionist settlers in  collaboration with regular Israeli military forces.    In a statement issued today after a meeting held by some PNC  members in Jordan, al-Za'nun added that the criminal practices  against our people's masses in the occupied homeland are a  natural result of the occupation and the Israeli settlements  that are spread throughout the occupied territories.    He demanded the dismantlement and removal of the settlements  and the repatriation of the settlers. He also demanded the full  withdrawal of the occupation army from occupied Palestinian  territories, including holy Jerusalem. Al-Za'nun called for  offering help and support to the steadfast kinsfolk in the  occupied homeland and for holding a PNC session.</p>

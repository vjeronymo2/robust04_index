			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HUD SCANDAL AND AREA HOUSING STAFF  </P> <P> The recent articles in the Times Orange County Edition about the way the Orange  County Housing and Community Development Agency has administered federal  Housing and Urban Development funds for housing rehabilitation are, from my  experience, completely in error or vastly exaggerated.  </P> <P> While I realize that you were only reporting the conclusions of other  bureaucrats and possibly bringing to your readers a local example of a national  scandal, I feel you have done a real disservice to Orange County HCD and its  housing rehabilitation staff.  </P> <P> In 1982, our family qualified for a low-income loan for housing improvement  under the then-applicable HUD guidelines. Before we even began planning our  improvement, we were reminded several times that the completed structure would  have to meet all current Orange County building codes, including the  preexisting part that was not to be remodeled.  </P> <P> A thorough inspection was made by a member of the HCD staff to determine if any  changes were required to the existing structure. Only after those changes were  made or included in the scheduled improvement were we allowed to proceed.  Inspections were made by HCD staff at several stages of construction and on  completion to make sure these changes were made. The financial side of the  project was carefully monitored during all phases.  </P> <P> I also know of several other projects that were completed in Midway City using  funds from HUD. In each case, the project was required to meet the building  code in its entirety at completion.  </P> <P> I think it is unfortunate that this fine program and the Orange County HCD  housing rehabilitation staff are being maligned as being part of a problem at  the national level.  </P> <P> ALAN L.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jan Rychlik: "What Does Customs Union </F> Actually Mean?"]    [Text] The broader reading public certainly does not  require a special introduction to the well-known fairy tale that  Jan Werich reworked in a more modern version under the title  "Queen Scuder I." And so, merely to refresh memory, I recall the  main point: A mountain woman was supposed to come visit the  young king "neither on foot nor riding in a cart, neither naked  nor dressed, and bring him a gift--which was not a gift." From  the Czech viewpoint, this is somehow what even the election  program for the currently governing HZDS [Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia] looks like, according to which a sovereign  Slovakia with independent international standing was to be a  component of Czechoslovakia in a common state.    It would seem that certain circles even visualize the  functioning of the customs union in a similar manner. This  includes not only the attempt by Ministers Ducky and Toth to  limit the importation of Czech foodstuffs to Slovakia with the  help of introducing special certificates to verify quality  (although more than 99 percent of all products are produced in  the Czech Republic as well as in Slovakia according to identical  standards, and a Czech certification would thus have to  suffice), but also the populist criticism by Petr Weiss, who  accused the Meciar government, this time absolutely  unjustifiably, of having signed the customs union agreement and  having thus made it possible for the Czech Republic to export  its unemployment to Slovakia, thus depriving the state of $90  million (see PRACE, 17 February 1994).    Translated into intelligible language: Slovak economic  circles would like to have such a customs union that would give  them access to Czech markets but that would, at the same time,  make it impossible for cheaper Czech agricultural production to  gain access to Slovakia. As can be seen, this is a project that  is similar to the notion that Slovakia can, simultaneously, make  use of the advantages of a common state with the Czechs, as well  as the advantages of independence. It is interesting that,  although developments in 1992 clearly showed that this is  impossible, some politicians continue to try to square this  circle.    It is time to state some things openly. Customs union means  the elimination of all of the quantitative obstacles to mutual  trade. The Czech Republic enjoys better conditions for  agriculture, and, therefore, its production is and will be  cheaper than Slovakia's. Because it does not lie within human  capabilities to transform the Tatra Mountains into a fertile  Hana [Moravian plain], there is no choice but to come to terms  with the given status and to see what the possibilities for  solving the problem are. Because the unfavorable balance of  mutual trade would soon exhaust the Slovak preserves of foreign  exchange, given a clearing type of accounting (as is well known,  the debtor must settle any excess in the marginal credit range  in freely convertible currency), there are, essentially, only  two possibilities: Either Slovakia disbands the customs union  and introduces customs duties and import surcharges at its  borders, a move by which it would protect its domestic market,  or it will devalue its currency, which will make Czech products  more expensive in Slovakia and Slovak products less expensive in  the Czech Republic, so that Czech production will no longer be  capable of competing on the Slovak market. In the first case,  this means the introduction of reciprocal measures by the Czech  Customs Administration because the Czech Republic has no reason,  on the basis of some kind of philanthropic purposes, to permit  Slovak goods to enter its market when it cannot export its  products to Slovakia. The second possibility is, of course, a  politically sensitive matter because it means devaluing the  savings of the citizenry, a rise in prices, and inflation. In  contrast to what it is possible to read occasionally in various  periodicals, the Czech side would not benefit from devaluation,  but this would obviously be the cleanest solution to bring about  the recovery of Czech-Slovak trade.    In no event do the Czechs desire to counsel Slovakia on what  to do. The decision lies fully on the Slovak side, although one  thing is clear: The notion that the Czech Republic and the  Slovak Republic will be exchanging, free of customs duties, only  the production that the other republic is lacking is absolutely  incompatible with the principles of free trade. It was a similar  principle, which we did away with with such great pomp, upon  which CEMA functioned under communism. The development of the  European Economic Area and the successful termination of the  negotiations of the Uruguay round of GATT clearly show that the  road to Europe does not lead via protectionist measures. The  would-be clever mountain woman is, therefore, proceeding very  foolishly this time.</p>

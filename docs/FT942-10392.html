			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / World Trade News: ABB to invest in China power projects ABB, the world's largest electrical engineering group, plans to invest Dollars 500m (Pounds 335m) on power projects and equipment in China by 1996; but low government-mandated returns of 12 per cent are discouraging equity participation in power stations. Mr Percy Barnevik, president of the Zurich-based company, told reporters in Beijing yesterday ABB was adopting a 'long-term perspective' in its approach to the Chinese market where there is enormous demand for energy. 'We are very optimistic about China's potential,' he said, 'even if economic growth is slower than the last five years'. China more than doubled its power generating capacity in the last decade but to reach Europe's electricity per capita consumption would mean harnessing 1,500 gigawatts of generating capacity - half of today's global capacity. (A gigawatt is equivalent to 1bn watts). 'China needs 15,000-18,000 MW annually - that is 30 power plants a year, or two-and-a-half a month,' Mr Barnevik said. ABB has some 11 ventures in China, including four power stations. It plans a further 10 projects in the next few years, mostly in the power sector. Beijing recently dampened investor enthusiasm for build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects by seeking to cap returns at 12 per cent. This compares with some earlier deals in southern China involving as much as an 18 per cent return on investment.</p>

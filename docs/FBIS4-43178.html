			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sigfrid Leijonhufvud: "Social Democrats Believe </F> in Higher Growth"]    [Text] Yesterday the Social Democratic Party [SDP]  presented the guidelines for a "new economic policy," which is  largely a carbon copy of the party's shadow budget from January.    But the emphasis has shifted yet a little further away from  last year's proposal for a consumer-driven increase toward an  investment-driven one. This is evident in part from the fact  that the party does not repeat its demand to restore the basic  deduction to 32 percent of the basic amount from the present 25.  (On that point the account in yesterday's SVENSKA DAGBLADET  regarding what could be expected was not correct.)    Through a number of incentives -- all of them temporary --  both as regards employment and investments, the Social Democrats  expect in their alternative that they will get the economy to  grow much more rapidly than if the Riksdag sticks to the  government's proposal. The government anticipated 2.4 percent  economic growth for 1994, both in the national budget and the  now current spring budget. With Social Democratic policies the  growth will be 3.3 percent, compared to 3.4 in the shadow  budget. For next year the government believes in 3-percent  growth, while the Social Democrats maintain that they can  achieve as much as a 4.5 upturn with their policies. Among other  established prognosis-makers Nordbanken has come up with growth  figures that exceed the government's. The Industry Association  and LO [Federation of Trade Unions] are at 1.3 and 1.2 percent,  respectively, for this year and below 2 percent for 1995.    One novelty in the Social Democratic party bill is the  proposal for a new "social contract" between wage earners,  employers, and the state.    Both Goran Persson, the party's financial spokesman, and  party secretary Mona Sahlin, at yesterday's news conference  stressed the course of mutual understanding which they now say  they want to pursue -- despite devastating criticism of the  government alternative. The new social contract would constitute  an important part of this.    However, the Social Democrats' intended minister of finance  wanted to dispel the fears/hopes that the state intends to  introduce an income policy by saying:    "It is not a matter of anything written, and I see neither  Haga nor Harpsund in front of me."  <H5>  Praises Backstrom </H5>   After the dissenting opinion on the appointment of Urban  Backstrom as new head of the Bank of Sweden, and the criticism  which the Social Democrats heaped on him after his open hearing  in the Finance Committee, Persson surprised everyone with a  confidence-creating statement about the new head of the Bank of  Sweden:    "I think that Urban Backstrom is doing a good job," Persson  said, but he did not go so far as to promise that the head of  the Bank of Sweden would remain after a potential change of  power this fall.    The fact that Goran Persson is making positive statements  about the contributions by the former under secretary of state  (Conservative) at least indicates that he realizes the danger of  fanning rumors that a change would be part of a new government's  plans. It would in all likelihood drive the interest rates up.    Goran Persson does not hide his opinion that the Bank of  Sweden has previously missed several opportunities to push the  interest rate down, but he had no criticism of the policy being  pursued in today's situation. It is evident from the party bill,  however, that monetary policy should be formed on the basis of  more indicators than the development of inflation. What the  party is aiming for is that the monetary policy outside the  inflation goal should also be designed for an ambitious growth  target for the entire economy.    The Social Democrats' new/old arsenal of stimulus measures  includes a program aimed at youth unemployment, in which the  goal is for every unemployed person under 25 to be offered a job  or other active measures within the period of 100 days.    On the investment side, an entire battery of measures is  included, with direct deductions as number one. Up to 70 percent  of the investments for machinery by business and industry may be  deducted during the first year. It is proposed that the measure  should take effect on 1 July this year and last for one year.  The investments are expected to increase by 6 billion in 1995 as  a result of just that measure. Business and industry  organizations are skeptical, and some critics are of the opinion  that the measure prepares for a tax planning which the Social  Democrats in other connections oppose.  <H5>  Incentive Subsidy </H5>   The expansion of the AXE [communications network] system is  moved up in the Social Democratic proposal, which also wants to  accelerate maintenance investments in the highway network. The  party further proposes 20-percent incentive subsidies for more  ROT [repair, renovation, expansion] activity in apartments and a  10-percent temporary investment subsidy for new housing  construction begun before the turn of the year.    For next year the Social Democrats propose savings --  agriculture, defense, etc. -- of 65 billion kronor and income  supplements in the form of tax increases amounting to 3.8  billion. They oppose child care allowance and oppose the  proposal for a new unemployment insurance.    "Unfinanced tax cuts and new social reforms must get off the  agenda," it says in the bill.    That opinion is not just aimed at the government side. Goran  Persson has not foreseen any new social reforms even in the  party's own version. If he becomes finance minister, he will  have a tough enough time anyway, one could imagine.</p>

			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAX BENEFITS OF IMMIGRATION  </P> <P> It sure seems like it's going to be easy to balance the federal budget. If  Moore's assumptions are correct (which is almost a certainty given his  pre-eminent position at the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution and Hudson  Institute), we could simply allow say 50 million people to immigrate to the  United States each year for the next 50 years.  </P> <P> Wow, just think what 2.5 billion consumer-taxpayers would contribute to the  national economy over their lifetime! The thought alone is enough to trigger  the salivation reflex in the most dispassionate chamber-of-commerce-types among  us.  </P> <P> OK, so there are going to be some naysayers, illiterate in the ways of  contemporary economics, who will argue that the addition of so many people to  our nation over such a short period of time will seriously erode the quality of  life for the 250 million-plus that are already here. Can you believe the  temerity of those who would embrace such heresy? Besides, there is no way that  Moore would have excluded a quality-of-life variable from his brilliantly  incisive "balance the budget" algorithm.  </P> <P> Or would he? Even if he did, as anyone residing in Southern California somewhat  continuously for the past decade knows, millions of newcomers can easily be  assimilated into a relatively small geographical region with minimal impact on  its social fabric. Indeed, it should be apparent to all living in this area  that our lives have been immeasurably enriched with better schools, less  crowded freeways, cleaner air, quieter, less violent neighborhoods and a  dramatic reduction in sociopathic behavior.  </P> <P> Let us hope that Moore's vision of America becomes reality. And to hell with  the spotted owl.  </P> <P> C.E. JONES  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

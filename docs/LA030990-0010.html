			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH AFRICA EMPTY CLASSROOMS;  </P> <P> BLACKS' BOYCOTT DRAGS ON, WHITE STUDENTS RACE AHEAD;  </P> <P> LACK OF SKILLS IS AS BIG A BARRIER TO POWER AS IS APARTHEID. NELSON MANDELA AND  THE ANC MUST ACT TO END THIS WHIRLPOOL OF DESTRUCTION.  </P> <P> Despite calls by Nelson Mandela for black students to return to school to  prepare themselves for a new society, on any given day one-fourth of South  Africa's black high school students are still not in class. This does not mean  that Mandela has failed. It does emphasize the seriousness and stubbornness of  the education crisis in the black community.  </P> <P> Central to the crisis is the rejection of the inferior education prescribed for  blacks since the National Party came into power in 1948. The present  government, trapped in its apartheid policies, argues that while improvements  are necessary, separate education for different race groups will not be  abandoned.  </P> <P> Anti-apartheid organizations reject this separatism and have made it part of  their confrontation with the government. In practical terms, this means that  for the past five years there has been little schooling of any kind in black  areas. This has eaten into the social fabric of the community. Drug and liquor  abuse have grown. Robberies and rapes are increasing. Girls, some as young as  13, are mothers.  </P> <P> The crisis is one of the biggest facing the recently legalized African National  Congress, particularly as education is what most blacks want for their  children. Any political organization that can resolve the crisis will have  grateful black parents voting for it lock, stock and barrel.  </P> <P> For Mandela and the ANC to consolidate their position as the de facto  government of a new South Africa, they will have to ensure, through their  allied community organizations, that students return to class. But events are  not moving in this direction.  </P> <P> In early March, more than 6,000 teachers in Soweto and Alexandra townships went  on strike, calling for a complete overhaul of the educational system. Many  parents angrily asked if a walkout would make children go back to class. They  noted that schools have been disrupted by protest over and over again, and that  Soweto has hardly had a week of effective learning this year.  </P> <P> Black teachers, at the front of the crisis, argue that the situation is beyond  their control. They have no option but to join their young charges in  anti-government demonstrations, demanding change.  </P> <P> Parents, unimpressed by this explanation, are now insistent in their demands  that political activism be reduced to prevent education from being sacrificed.  For instance, of 196,000 black students who took graduation exams last year,  only 18,000 qualified for college. The results predictably provoked a round of  recriminations between the government and community organizations. The ANC, the  major organization in black politics, had to carry much of the blame. Despite  denials by the ANC, when students five years ago adopted the slogan "liberation  now, education later," the ANC did not intervene. Instead it praised the  courage of the youth for challenging the government's inferior educational  system. Students chanted ANC slogans during their protest campaigns. Now, while  black schooling is caught in this whirlpool of destruction, white children  continue to learn. Close to 30,000 qualified for university from last year's  70,000 entrants. Black youths will have sacrificed their lives in vain, as  whites will still be in control of the country's future, this time because of  skills rather than color.  </P> <P> Everybody now realizes that when the government introduced separate and  inferior education for blacks, it was to keep them in perpetual servitude. But  when these same blacks directly and indirectly keep themselves out of class,  whose interests are they serving?  </P> <P> Conscious of this, and the clamor by parents, the ANC and other organizations  have embarked on a campaign to get pupils back in class. The ANC and Mandela  must show parents that they are concerned with the education of their children,  for education is the only hope that blacks have to genuinely control the  destiny of this nation.  </P></p>

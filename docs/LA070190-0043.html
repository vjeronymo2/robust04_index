			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHOULD UC ADMISSIONS SET ETHNIC AND RACIAL GOALS?;  </P> <P> UC DIVERSITY CRITICAL GOAL  </P> <P> As competition for places in the University of California has intensified, so,  too, has concern over the issue of accessibility -- a concern that is likely to  grow as the state's population swells and as tuition at comparable private  universities approaches $20,000 annually. California parents want assurances  that their children will have a fair opportunity to be admitted.  </P> <P> The term one hears regarding the admissions policies of the university is  "equity." To some, equity means a uniform admissions standard for all  applicants, generally based on a tabulation of high-school grades and scores on  standardized tests. To others, equity means enrolling a student body that  reflects the composition of the state's population in relation to such  characteristics as race, ethnicity and physical disability. Assembly Bill 462  explicitly defines equity in terms of a "diverse student body" and a  "multicultural democracy," while virtually ignoring the issues of grades and  standardized tests.  </P> <P> The bill's expression of commitment to diversity is laudable, and it is already  in practice. The UC regents strive for a student body that "demonstrates high  academic achievement or exceptional personal talent, and that encompasses the  broad diversity of cultural, racial, geographic and socioeconomic backgrounds  characteristic of California."  </P> <P> For UCLA's 1990 freshman class, for example, grades and test scores alone were  used to admit some 60% of the students. For the remaining 40%, supplemental  criteria were applied. That criteria includes: special talents, such as ability  in music or painting; special circumstances, such as physical disabilities; low  family income and education and ethnic identity. It should be emphasized that  in the absence of a solid academic record, the supplemental criteria would be  insufficient to insure a particular applicant's admission.  </P> <P> Freshman admissions procedures can be easily understood by comparing two  fictional but typical UCLA applicants. The first is Caucasian, a graduate of a  prestigious private high school with nearly a straight "A" average and test  scores in the 94th percentile. He lives in an affluent area of the San Fernando  Valley and has never worked during the school year. His parents are both  college-educated and have a combined annual income of $90,000. Applicant I has  traveled widely in the United States and Europe and expects to have a  successful career as a businessman.  </P> <P> The second applicant is Latino, the graduate of a public high school in a  working-class neighborhood in central Los Angeles. Her academic record shows an  "A-" average and test scores in the 55th percentile, despite the fact that  English is her second language. Applicant II works 20 hours a week during the  school year and full-time every summer. Neither of her parents completed high  school and together manage an income of $29,000. Applicant II has been out of  California twice to visit relatives in Texas. She has hopes for a career as a  lawyer, but is apprehensive about the expense of law school.  </P> <P> Applicant I has obviously made the most of his privileged position while  Applicant II has overcome various obstacles -- the learning of a second  language, the absence of educational role models in the home and the need to  work after school -- to arrive at the gates of UCLA. A rigid, uniform  admissions policy based solely on grade-point averages and test scores would  regard Applicant II as significantly less qualified than Applicant I. A truly  equitable admissions policy, would not only place her academic record in a  cultural and economic context but also recognizes her accomplishments as  equivalent to those of Applicant I.  </P> <P> There is no doubt that recent UC admissions policies have been instrumental not  only in providing greater access to all segments of the state's population but  in revitalizing the university -- particularly campuses at Berkeley and Los  Angeles where the movement toward diversity is most palpable.  </P> <P> More faculty of color will be appointed; the curriculum will expand beyond its  traditional Western civilization focus to include the histories of Africa,  Latin American and Asia. The university will emphasize the need to prepare its  graduates to function in the "multicultural democracy" of AB 462, all the while  maintaining its academic pre-eminence.  </P> <P> UC admissions policies also contain a substantial portion of economic  self-interest. As the Anglo population of California ages, the burden of  financing state government will fall on a largely minority work force. Unless  that work force is sufficiently well-educated it will be unable to generate the  income necessary to sustain the present standard of living in California and  provide benefits for the retired, largely Anglo population. The UC commitment  to diversity in its admissions policies is an investment in California's  economic future.  </P></p>

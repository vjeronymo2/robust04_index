			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Rosa Popova report: "Discussion About the Western </F> Outlands"]    [Text] The situation of the Bulgarian minority in the  Western Outlands [in southeastern Serbia] is a controversial and  crucial problem for Bulgaria. As a result of political  assimilation, the fate of those compatriots is not enviable, as  noted in a recent discussion organized by the Bulgarian  Socialist Party [BSP] Supreme Council's Commission on Ethnic and  National Issues. Representatives of the "Western Outlands"  Union, of the Orthodox Church, and of the U.S. Embassy in Sofia  participated in the meeting.    After nearly 70 years of neglect, the problem of the Western  Outlands is regaining prominence in the eyes of the public,  Prof. Momchil Todorov, chairman of the "Western Outlands" Union,  declared. In talking about assimilation we should not imply that  the number of Bulgarians in those areas is diminishing, but we  should take into account the emerging pro-Yugoslav trends and  the alienation from their Bulgarian roots and traditions.  Nevertheless, in discussing such delicate relations, we should  manifest great tolerance for the Republic of Serbia, academician  Ilcho Dimitrov pointed out in his statement. The question of  the Western Outlands should be dealt with in the context of a  general concept on the national question as a whole, Prof.  Dimitrov added. The fundamental solution of this issue and of  all other problems related to the situation of our compatriots  living abroad should be part of a comprehensive Bulgarian state  policy on the national question.    By opening up a similar discussion about all the crucial  problems related to the so-called Macedonian issue, as well as  to the situation of our emigres in Bessarabia and Moldova, the  BSP intends to submit a special document related to state policy  on the national question.</p>

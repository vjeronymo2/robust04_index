			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ASSOCIATION CAN SPEAK FOR ITSELF  </P> <P> I would like to clarify something regarding your article on the proposed  Pasadena property maintenance ordinance. You quoted David Gilmore, one of my  neighbors, as a member of the Bungalow Heaven Neighborhood Assn.  </P> <P> In so doing you left the impression that Mr. Gilmore was speaking for our  neighborhood association. Mr. Gilmore was giving his opinion as a private  citizen, not as a spokesperson for our neighborhood association.  </P> <P> In fact, the Bungalow Heaven Neighborhood Assn. has taken no position as yet on  the proposed Pasadena property maintenance ordinance. The board of directors of  the Bungalow Heaven Neighborhood Assn. feels the issue is a complex and  important one that requires careful study as well as the input of our  membership. A neighborhood position on the proposed ordinance is now being  considered.  </P> <P> In future, should you wish comments on issues from our neighborhood  association, I would hope you would contact someone who is authorized to speak  in our behalf. Being a dues-paying member, as Mr. Gilmore is, does not convey  that privilege or responsibility. The task of speaking for the Bungalow Heaven  Neighborhood Assn. is best left to its elected board of directors.  </P> <P> PAUL LITTLE  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

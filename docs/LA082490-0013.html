			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOT TO SHOP: A BONANZA OF CHEAP THRILLS  </P> <P> DEAR HOT: I'm broke. In debt. And I need a lift. Is there anything you  recommend that I can buy for about $5 to boost my spirits?  </P> <P>  -- B.G., Marina del Rey  </P> <P> DEAR B.G.: Pile up those nickels and dimes and lug them over to a $5 Clothing  Store. We've known ingenious, ultra-frugal fashion models who've put together  great-looking outfits in these places -- often for less than a meal at  McDonalds.  </P> <P> The shops (80 in California, 45 in the metropolitan Los Angeles area)  specialize in fun, youthful junior styles, with nothing priced over $8. We  know: The sign says $5. Explains Morrie Dym, the chain's founder and president,  "Nothing in the stores sold for more than $5 for the first five years."  (1981-1986).  </P> <P> But you can still pick up tank tops priced at $3, $4 and $5. Shorts for $4, $5  and $6. Jewelry, hair accessories, scarves and belts usually for less than $5.  And, if you want to get really extravagant and break out some serious bucks, go  all out and indulge yourself with a dress for $8. Better yet, visit during the  stores' "Dollar Days" promotions, which occur about twice a year. All the  previous markdowns are then sold for $1, and you can whip together a whole  outfit for $5! For $5 Clothing Store locations, call (800) 766-5555.  </P> <P> DEAR HOT: My 15-month-old little girl is taking her first steps -- very  tentatively. Mostly, she stands up holding onto something, like a chair, so  she's not really walking around yet. While she's in this phase, I'm not sure  what kind of shoes I should be putting her in. Those hard-soled shoes for  toddlers look so uncomfortable.  </P> <P>  -- C.S., Echo Park  </P> <P> DEAR C.S.: You're on the right track, making sure your daughter's tootsies feel  good as she learns to walk. In fact, Dr. Stuart Slavin, assistant professor in  pediatrics at UCLA, advises parents of toddlers to "find shoes that look like  they'd be comfortable; somewhat flexible, not terribly stiff. Also, the best  shoes are made of material that breathes -- something with a canvas upper is  probably better than heavy leather. Shoes are protection for the feet, so you  want to make sure the sole is thick enough. And don't get shoes that are too  small -- make sure the foot can move around."  </P> <P> Childrens' shoes don't have to cost an arm and a leg -- or a foot, either --  even though we've found some kids' clothes that cost as much as their adult  counterparts. The Nowa Li moccasins with a knitted sock upper and non-skid  suede bottom, are $14 from Cotton Kids in the Santa Monica Place mall. The  store also offers Mary Jane-style, canvas slip-ons for $16, sandals for $18.50,  tennis shoe slip-ons for $19 and high-top tennies for $19. The moccasins, in  various sizes, are also available through the store's catalogue (it's called  Tinibini); to order, call (800) 543-6665.  </P> <P>  Got a wardrobe as unresolved as Laura Palmer's murder? Send your gripes,  dilemmas and questions on all facets of shopping to Krier and Stein, Hot to  Shop, The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, Calif. 90053. Questions may also be  faxed to (213) 237-4712.  </P> <P> </P></p>

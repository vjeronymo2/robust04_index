			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program with host Juan Carlos Roque Garcia </F> and guests Eloy Concepcion and Renato Recio of TRABAJADORES  newspaper -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Garcia] As you know, some 80,000 meetings must be  held throughout the country, but the main points that prevail in  all these meetings are the people's willingness to work and the  desire to solve many problems, namely at the grassroots level.    [Recio] The subject we are to discuss today is very  important, and people are talking about it on the streets. It is  a topic on the streets because it refers to crucial problems,  problems that people are experiencing on a day-to-day basis.  These problems are also reflected in the workers' parliaments.  And, of course, there are people on the street who ask whether  these meetings are useful, important, or necessary.    Some people would answer, no. Many feel that the parliaments  are too formal, that they will not solve current problems, that  this is a matter to be dealt with by economists. There are  people who think that economic problems are technical,  scientific problems, and listening to the people's opinions has  no practical value. Of course, I do not agree with those ideas.    [Garcia] What do you think, Eloy Concepcion?    [Concepcion] I think these meetings are extremely useful. I  think these meetings are unique; they are not held anywhere else  in the world. And I say this is unique because the workers'  parliaments represent an opportunity for the workers to express  their opinions on important issues in the country, but mainly  because they are an opportunity to put the house in order. I  think the parliaments at the work places must have as the first  point on their agenda -- I remember attending one parliament and  it did have this on the agenda -- the analysis of problems  specific to that area, such as productivity, use of work time,  theft of products, use of resources, etc. Workers must meet to  discuss their local problems, that is, to become aware of  existing problems and of those they can solve without waiting  for national measures. I think this is sufficient reason to hold  the parliaments.    [Garcia] What conditions are necessary for the development  of  these parliaments, to be what people really want them to be?    [Recio] The first desire is to discuss internal problems,  and  this perhaps is the most important aspect of the meetings. The  other aspect is that the assessment of problems of the economy  by the workers in general is extremely important. Not only to  fulfill a formal obligation, and not to comply with a compulsory  practice, a theoretical practice by inexpert people dealing  wilth a complex matter, but because they must be protagonists of  any change.    The problems of a country such as Cuba, within a society of  workers, will not be solved by three, four, five, or six  formulas, or even by 10 technical formulas. That is to say, the  Cuban problem will not be solved by economists alone, although  they should be solved by economists. We cannot underestimate the  role of economic science, nor can we can overestimate it to a  point of taking it as the only view. The problem consists of  achieving a balance between the economy and politics, because  our system will never be an exclusively efficient system.  Efficiency must be combined with justice -- efficiency with  equity -- and to achieve justice, the workers must be present,  not only for the distribution of wealth but also for an exchange  of ideas.    [Concepcion] I agree with Recio on the first point: The  parliaments are to discuss internal problems. I recently  attended a parliament on Plan Six, referring to citrus fruits. I  thought then that these meetings should be better organized and  structured, because the administration's report is important.  That is, these parliaments constitute essential economic  training schools for workers. I would call them that. I think  that the administrative report must be structured in such a  manner that all the workers have in their hands the elements  they have never before had. In this parliament I attended, the  workers learned that last year there was a loss of 200 [words  indistinct]. Well then, the analysis should focus on the loss.  An important element broght to the workers' attention was that  in 1993 some 10,000 quintales of oranges, tangerines, and lemons  were stolen and taken to the black market. The workers,  themselves, said: In Havana, or in this or that town, tangerines  were lost because they were stolen. The other important issue is  that not only the administration is to blame for this.    I think there are three main factors that must be analyzed.  With a certain degree of complacence, I noted that there are  three factors: the administration, the union, and the workers.  We often talk about the lack of organization at work, or about  inefficiency, or misuse of labor hours, or even theft. The  workers, the union organizations, and the administration  officials are aware of what is going on; but they often just  acknowledge and try to coexist with indiscipline.    [Garcia] Concepcion, you mentioned an experience you had  when  you attended a parliament. I believe Recio also attended some  parliaments; he might also like to tell us his experience or  some anecdotes.    [Recio] I also agree with Concepcion when he says that this  is a good economic training school for workers. I fully agree  with that and I would add, not only for workers but for the  workers' leaders, for economic and political leaders, and for  everyone. As you said, there are three factors: the  administration, the union, and the workers. They often see  negative things but they do not change the course of events,  perhaps because of a total lack of action or because of  ignorance, because people cannot see the significance of all  this, because the economic process is very complex.    We decided on a given economy for reasons I cannot outline  now because it would take too long. This economy is based on  material production, but it does not take into account the  financial aspect, that is, that which has to do with costs,  prices, profit possibilities, the budget, money circulation,  etc. We have been practically negative in this aspect. We have  practically overlooked it. We have failed to train the people.  Then what happens? The first to take economic classes, in  addition to workers, are the administrative board members  because it is important for them to take these classes. The  administration must have an objective, and that objective must  be not only to produce, but to produce at the lowest possible  cost. That is basic. But it is not done. For instance, when  products are stolen, it affects the cost and production. If  expenditures are not well accounted for, how can you find out  the costs?    [Garcia] We are looking for points of agreement on the need  for these parliamants, but we also wonder what the parliaments  offer in the end.    [Concepcion] I think the parliaments must first adopt a plan  of concrete and not general measures. I attended a parliament  where I repeatedly heard worn out, obsolete words like  eliminating this or that, organizing work, reducing subsidy,  increasing production, promoting this or that, etc. These words  in practice do not say anything. I think the plan of measures  must be concrete, realistic, and with names. That is,  productivity must be increased and to increase production we  must do this and that, and Mr. So-and-so will do this and this,  and John Doe will do this and that, because when the clock  strikes five in the afternoon the workers leave, no matter what.  In this case, the brigade that has not yet completed its task  must remain until it finishes. These are concrete measures that  must be adopted because, otherwise, the parliament will remain  with its generalizations and theories, without achieving  anything concrete. I do not know whether Recio agrees with me,  but the country's economy will be saved to the extent that we  save it in each worker's center.    [Garcia] Motivation is good. I think these meetings can  motivate workers, create an environment favorable to increase  production, to solve the problems at the grassroots, so that the  companies, as Recio said, will be more profitable, so that costs  will be reflected in prices, and so that workers may also be  aware of what their centers can contribute to the development of  the nation.    [Recio] I want to insist on this point: Not only the workers  must be motivated, but the workers' leaders, as well. We must  talk straight here. There are leaders who do not care about  these problems, who do not lead anyone, and who do not discuss  anything. And the workers must also demand that their leaders  become more demanding. Because if the Cuban economy fails, who  will suffer the consequences?    [Garcia, Recio] The people, the workers.    [Recio] And if something must be done and is not done, who  will suffer the consequences? The people, the workers. And we  workers are the owners here. This society was created for us,  and we must show this ownership.    [Garcia] A brief summary, please, Concepcion, because our  time has ended.    [Concepcion] In sum, we can say that following these  problems  of leaders and workers, we all belong to the same human group.  We are workers, although we play different roles. The essence is  that workers who are directly working the land or driving their  machines must discuss their roles as workers, and the leaders  must guide them well, using rational and logical economic  measures. This is the objective and the goal of the parliaments.</p>

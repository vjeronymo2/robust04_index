			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The case in which a San Diego police officer shot a drug suspect six times and  killed him last month was sent Monday to the district attorney's office, where  officials will determine whether the officer is criminally responsible for the  death of Stanley P. Buchanan.  </P> <P> Buchanan was shot April 22 by veteran Officer Timothy Fay as two other officers  were arresting Buchanan for illegal possession of drugs.  </P> <P> Many leaders in Southeast San Diego have decried the shooting as an unjustified  use of force, and an attorney for the Buchanan family has filed a $15-million  wrongful-death claim against the city.  </P> <P> Police Chief Bob Burgreen met briefly on Monday with Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller  to discuss the case, and the chief said he requested an expeditious review of  the matter by Miller's office.  </P> <P> "The public and the involved officer deserve as quick a resolution as possible"  to the case, Burgreen said.  </P> <P> Fay remains on administrative duty.  </P></p>

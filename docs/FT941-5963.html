			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Nigerian exchange controls prompt rows: Bankers swap criticisms as system's defects come to light Efforts to resolve confusion in Nigeria's foreign exchange system continue today amid mutual recriminations between the central bank and the private sector. The outcome is seen as an important test of the military government's capacity to implement the 1994 budget, delivered in January, and criticised by the country's creditors as impractical. The government has pegged its official exchange rate at N22 to the dollar and banned all foreign exchange dealing outside its control, but the naira has fallen on the black market to N52. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has accused commercial banks of abusing the new arrangements, while bankers and other private sector leaders say that the CBN's allocation system is time-wasting and open to corruption. The new system is meant to channel all the nation's hard currency via the banks to the sectors which would most benefit the economy: half the foreign exchange going to buy goods for manufacturers, 10 per cent to agriculture, 30 per cent for finished goods, and the remaining 10 per cent at the discretion of the banks for invisibles. After a 10 week gap with no foreign exchange on offer, demand for the first allocation in late February exceeded the supply of Dollars 200m by almost six times and the CBN delayed allocation by a week while it investigated the top 26 banks for irregularities. On Monday the central bank's spokesman accused all 26 banks of submitting inflated or false demands or lending too much to their customers to fund the bids, then pardoned them with a warning of a one-year ban for the next transgression. Leading banks which have a reputation for strict compliance and who were cleared by the inspectors last week angrily reject the spokesman's accusations. 'For a long time the CBN made the best of a bad job,' said one international banker. 'Now it appears that they don't even want banks to lend money.' Other bankers believe that they are being made scapegoats for a system which is bound to fail. 'The categories for applications are a matter of interpretation and even after following the CBN's advice they still faulted us. They are basically involved in window-dressing to disguise the real flaws with the system,' said a senior Nigerian banker.</p>

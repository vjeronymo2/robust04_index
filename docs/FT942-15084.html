			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Arts: Sweet music to their ears - Saleroom In the eyes of the public, but not academics, the major auction houses have an outstanding reputation for scholarship. And yet their experts often wrongly catalogue an item for sale. Often this makes little difference to the price, but occasionally the percipient dealer can pick up for a hundred pounds or so an object worth hundreds of thousands, even millions. The most embarassing examples in recent years have involved Old Master paintings and Renaissance bronzes, but in a specialist London book auction last year an attentive browser came across a musical manuscript in a job lot which looked as if it might be valuable. For a start there were six staves on the page, which meant that it was English and pre-1720. The lot cost little, but on May 26 Sotheby's hopes to make at least Pounds 300,000 from what its experts Dr Stephen Roe and Simon Maguire consider to be the most interesting musical manuscript to have emerged in decades. The small calf bound volume contains 21 pieces for the harpsichord in the hand of Purcell, the only autograph keyboard music by the late 17th century British composer yet known. Pre-1700 autograph manuscripts are exceptionally rare. No one knows what music in the hand of Palestrina or Scarlatti or Monteverdi looks like: no certain examples have emerged. Hence the excitement over the Purcell. The auction record is for another discovery, nine autograph symphonies by Mozart, believed lost, which surfaced in 1987 and sold for Pounds 2.6m. Fortunately for Sotheby's, and the vendor, Purcell, along with Byrd, is the only British composer sought by the leading collectors. The fact that music is an international language ensures that there is a global market, and gives some protection from national recessions. But demand is selective. Elgar and Vaughan Williams appeal little to the major German and Swiss collectors, although Britten has some attracion. In the main the most popular composers command the top prices - Mozart followed by Beethoven (Pounds 1.1m for a piano sonata). And the major scores attract the keenest interest: the market really arrived when Stravinsky's Rite of Spring sold for Pounds 330,000 in 1982, at the height of a recession. Like Old Masters and Impressionists the great musical scores - the Mozart, Wagner and Puccini operas; the Beethoven string quartets; the Tchaikovsky symphonies - are now mainly in museums and secure collections. But some major works have yet to be pinned down. No one knows where Beethoven's manuscript for the Hammerklavier sonata is, or whether it still exists. Wagner's opera Rienzi is believed to have disappeared with Hitler when his Berlin bunker was destroyed, but might have survived. Puccini's La Rondine is another work which might leak into the saleroom one day. The inflation in prices has naturally attracted the forgers and fraudsters. Some of the most celebreated recent examples, like the apparant emergence of some unknown Haydn sonatas last year, were just attempts to make presumptious scholars look foolish. As soon as the actual manuscripts, rather than photographs, were studied there could be no mistaking the 20th century paper. But Christie's had to quickly withdraw half a dozen lots from its recent auction, and there are always attempts to add a forged signature to a composer's printed score or photograph. Sotheby's auction is its largest ever in the field, with over 430 lots, including manuscripts and letters by Haydn, Beethoven, Mahler and Verdi. The recession has depressed demand, but in the main musical manuscripts have borne up well.</p>

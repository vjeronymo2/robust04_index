			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: MOON PALACE BY PAUL AUSTER (PENGUIN: $7.95)  </P> <P> An odd, claustrophobic novel about a passive young man who stumbles onto the  mystery of his ancestry through a series of bizarre coincidences.  </P> <P> Marco Stanley Fogg's commitment to inaction eventually reduces him to sleeping  in Central Park and eating out of garbage cans. Paul Auster's evocations of the  rituals with which the homeless fill their hours constitute the most compelling  writing in the book.  </P> <P> Rescued from life in the park by his friends, Fogg discovers a convoluted  family history involving a decaying artist, his son and his grandson -- a set  of interlocking stories so wildly improbable that they seem credible. Auster's  daft, illogical logic makes this novel curiously readable.  </P></p>

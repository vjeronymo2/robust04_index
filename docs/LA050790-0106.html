			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUCKEY PROSECUTOR UNSURE OF WITNESSES' RECOLLECTIONS;  </P> <P> WITNESS RECALL QUESTIONED IN BUCKEY RETRIAL  </P> <P> Opening statements began today in the retrial of Raymond Buckey with a  prosecutor telling jurors he is uncertain what three children can remember of  alleged molestations at the McMartin Pre-School.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Joseph Martinez noted that the toddlers are now pre-teens  and their memories might have faded with time.  </P> <P> "I don't know how much they will recall, how much they have repressed," the  prosecutor said.  </P> <P> Buckey's attorney, Danny Davis, said the defendant will take the stand, look  jurors in the eyes and declare that he never molested anyone.  </P> <P> Davis noted that one child scheduled to testify was never a student of Buckey  at the McMartin school, which was owned and operated by his family.  </P> <P> "You will have the opportunity to see this man charged with these heinous  crimes, to look into his eyes and look into his soul," Davis told the jury.  </P> <P> The lawyers spoke after Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg dismissed an  alternate juror who came to court distressed by a fire that engulfed her boat  during a weekend family outing. She and others suffered smoke inhalation before  being rescued by the harbor patrol.  </P> <P> She also said she took a tranquilizer before coming to court, but "I feel very  nervous and upset."  </P> <P> The woman began coughing violently at the start of Martinez's speech and was  ushered out of court. She had said she might be too upset to go forward and the  judge decided to excuse her. That left five alternate jurors.  </P> <P> The interruption came as Martinez was beginning to recount for jurors the  evidence which he said would prove the three girls were molested by Buckey.  </P> <P> He told how one child began to have nightmares and showed other signs of  molestation during the two years she attended the McMartin school.  </P> <P> As Martinez spoke, Buckey's mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, sat in the audience  taking notes. The defendant's father, Charles Buckey, also attended, but the  spectator section was not as crowded as during the culmination of another trial  in which Buckey's mother was acquitted of all charges and Ray Buckey was  acquitted of the majority of allegations against him.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office decided to retry Buckey, 31, on eight counts  involving the three children, a greatly diminished number from the hundreds who  were once said to have been molested at the school.  </P></p>

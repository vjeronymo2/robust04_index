Announced by a UN spokesman, the postponement, for which no  explanation was given, put the future of UN-sponsored talks in  Nairobi into jeopardy. It was the second delay in the meeting,  which had originally been planned for last Sunday [20 March]  before this too was canceled at the last moment. On Monday, the  UN spokesman had high hopes for the planned ceremony, saying it  represented a major step forward for Somalia and he was certain  it would go ahead.    The faction leaders, including bitter rivals Mohamed Farah  Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed, have been engaged in talks in  Nairobi for the last eight days.</p>

The bald eagle also occurs in Alaska and Canada, where it is not at risk and is not protected under the Act; and in small numbers in northern Mexico. The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposed to reclassify the bald eagle from endangered to threatened in the lower 48 states except in certain portions of the American Southwest and to classify those eagles in adjacent Mexico as endangered. The bald eagle would remain threatened in the five states where it is currently listed as threatened. The special rule for threatened bald eagles would be revised. This action would not alter those conservation measures already in force to protect the species and its habitats. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice announcing the proposed rule was published on July 12, 1994 (59 FR 35584).

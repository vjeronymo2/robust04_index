			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the Cuban </F> Workers Federation, during the morning session of the National  Assembly of the People's Government in Havana, ANPP, on 1 May --  recorded]    [Text] Comrade Alarcon, I would now like to present to the  assembly a report on the results of the workers parliaments for  consideration during this session's debates.    We meet here today to summarize the meaning and possible  development of a democratic process capable of earning the  prestige of being useful and of establishing itself as a  feasible method for popular participation in the solution to our  economic problems.    Above all, we face a promising, encouraging path that  categorically confirms that the economic solutions demanded by  pressing reality must be identified by the people as their own,  based on the greatest possible consensus and in such a way that  their reasons are understood, so that the gates can open for  collective action on an efficient economy that ensures the  preservation and development of our socialist society.    In looking at the results of the assembly process, the  Parliaments in the Workplaces, which had the participation of  approximately 3 million workers throughout the country who  debated the economic problems of each center and added to the  arsenal of ideas that could be activated to restructure internal  finances, we express our profound joy that the workers  throughout the entire nation, in all work centers, in the  immense majority of their proposals demonstrated patriotism,  honor, and the will to do whatever is required to save the  Revolution, just as Fidel requested during his intervention in  the last special session of the ANPP.    The labor union movement can take credit for having  organized  the workers parliaments, for having interpreted Fidel's thoughts  and the conclusions of the fourth plenum of the Central  Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] regarding the  importance of avoiding a technocratic focus in the solutions,  beginning from the point that without the understanding and will  of the workers and the people, no problems can be solved and no  measures can do any good.    In the short time between December and today, we prepared  our  cadres, we summoned the workers to hold the parliaments, and we  held meetings with more than 80,000 labor union sectors, which  had the support of the party and government, as well as the  active participation of our deputies and the presidency of the  ANPP.    We believe that the administration of the work centers,  noticeably advancing with regard to their prior experience,  decisively supported this process and became worthy of the  workers' recognition, most of whom appreciated the quality of  the report to the assembly and their cooperation, for a frank  and realistic discussion on the problems of each center.    For 45 days, the country became an immense school on  economics and politics, in which much was learned and during  which it was realized that much remains to be learned,  investigated, and renovated in the specific economic sphere of  each work center.    The press has played a distinctive role, contributing with  convincing arguments and with real reflection in the debates to  enrich and stimulate the participation of the workers, who in  this process came to a greater understanding of the complex  situation we face and of the need to continue taking measures  with the greatest care, without anxious haste, focusing on  reactivating the economy, producing more and better with  available resources under conditions of the blockade and special  period.    Comrades, the work has just begun. Let us take heart in the  fact that the workers considered these parliaments worthwhile.  Above all, let us think of the long road ahead of us in all  senses. An analysis of the innumerable suggestions made by the  workers is not a one-day task. Today, we should confine  ourselves to synthesis of the people's thought, which is  essentially connected in economic terms with a more profound  political and ideological culture, but which does not achieve  the desired correspondence.    Let us make way for this synthesis and let us remember that  the assemblies included points that reconfirm the wisdom of the  collective intelligence and the provisions of immutable loyalty  toward the Revolution and socialism, as well as indications of  confusion; reminiscences of an economic mentality that should  develop even further; and, in some respects, ideas that have  nothing to do with today's efficiency reality.    The debates in the workers parliaments expressed a great  coincidence that the enterprises should reach profitability  based on efficient work and the proper use of materials and  financial resources, without elevating prices, and placing  emphasis on the reduction of costs.    In a great many meetings, the companies have been urged to  seek and find alternative formulas to increase their income by  means of a secondary, or side, production which, without  detriment to the principal production, will result in greater  exploitation of material and human resources.    The workers have underscored in many meetings the need to  reduce subsidies to companies to the point of eliminating all  but those that can be fully justified.    Another matter that was thoroughly analyzed in the meetings  was cost reduction. At the same time, measures have been  outlined so that workers will be able to participate in the  analysis and control of expenditures, and so that this control  will be resolutely carried out in those places where the  expenditures are incurred but not the way it is done now, and  that this situation be handled by exclusive areas that  centralize the information and analyses.    We must note that in many places, the workers have learned  that their respective companies have not been profitable. They  have realized the amount of losses and consequent subsidies. So  they voiced their complaints that positive actions must be taken  concerning costs and expenditures of both the budgeted units and  those conceived to attain revenues and profit.    Workers everywhere also noted the need for administrations  in  the future to provide systematic information on these aspects,  to the workers, with the purpose of encouraging the struggle for  efficiency and to facilitate the economic analyses in each unit.    One of the most often repeated proposals was that of  improving human services in all centers. Likewise, there is an  overwhelming consensus concerning the need to increase the  control of state assets, with the dual purpose of reducing  production costs and preventing the main sources from going to  the black market and to criminal acts.    The workers have repeatedly called for improvement of the  labor law in an effort to eliminate its paternalistic content  and to adjust it to the needs of production and labor efficiency.    The subject of labor and technological and administrative  discipline was discussed in several meetings and from differing  points of view. The workers especially referred to the lack of  administrative exigency and to the pernicious effect of the  current system of medical certificates and reports.    In many thousands of meetings, the workers stressed the idea  that an efficient increase in production and services is the  essential way to stabilize internal finances and to achieve an  adequate provision to the people.    The delicate and complex problem of the reorganization of  personnel rosters and reinstatement of personnel was broadly  debated. There was an overwhelming consensus on the need to  adopt measures to improve worker productivity, to reduce costs,  and to efficiently organize production.    In many places where there is an obvious excess labor force,  the workers themselves, whose posts can be the object of  rationalization, have called for the initiation of this process,  confident that in the Revolution, they will find just solutions  and that no one will be neglected; and that people will always  work for the development of economically justifiable job  opportunities.  <H5>  Streamlining Internal Finances </H5>   The issue of streamlining internal finances has gained major  impetus in the discussions in the workplace parliaments, to the  extent that these discussions developed.    The proposals to charge for services that are currently  free,  to change prices, to impose new taxes, and others, unlike the  subjects related to economic efficiency, have prompted various  reactions. However, it has been verified that the development of  the debates has contributed to clarification and consolidation  of the inevitable need to adopt effective measures to streamline  internal finances.    One fact has been confirmed by this process throughout the  country. It has to do with the overwhelming consensus among  Cuban workers that education and health care in our society must  remain free of charge, arguing that these are achievements of  the Revolution and must be maintained.    However, in many places, the workers proposed charging for  cosmetic surgery and similar services. Some have even proposed  charging for dental care services. Others have proposed charging  those responsible for traffic accidents and physical  aggressions, feeling that they should pay for the medical  assistance given to their victims.    Others have reaffirmed the proposal to pay for basic school  supplies and uniforms, although others proposed the payment only  in case of losses. To a lesser extent, workers proposed  distribution of expendable material free of charge the first  time, but selling it at accessible prices afterwards throughout  the year.    Some parliaments proposed charging for school supplies at  high school and university levels, while other parliaments  proposed charging in accordance with the income of the student's  family. Some parliaments proposed charging for university and  postgraduate studies in languages and others are not considered  basic education. Other parliaments proposed charging when the  student abandons his studies, or when as a graduate he does not  work in the field he studied.    Another proposal was that of charging at the semiboarding  schools as in the case of childcare centers, as well as other  free services in the education area, especially when there is a  change in career or in lodging, and also for the food the  students eat in boarding schools.    The workers also made repeated analyses of the possibility  of  charging for services which are not considered essential in  other aspects of the country's life. In several meetings the  workers underscored the idea that the state must consider  maintaining some free services that are suitable; in other  meetings, but in a lesser extent, the workers considered the  possibility of eliminating all free services.    Among the free services not considered essential, to which  the workers referred in the meetings, in addition to those  already discussed and which have to do with health and  education, are the following: charging for civil registery  office services and for some spraying services; eliminating free  delivery of products and foods to workers in certain places;  increasing taxes on vehicles; charging modest prices for  personal protection means, public bathrooms, and some funeral  services; charging drug stores for the distribution of vitamins;  charging cyclists for use of roads; charging tolls in tunnels,  on highways, etc.    In several meetings the workers proposed charging for  cultural activities, excepting entrance fees for children. In  some parliaments the workers proposed charging tickets at indoor  events and with professional artists. Workers also repeated the  proposal to charge modest prices for sports events. Very few  proposed not charging for these events.    Many parliaments also agreed on the need to charge for  recreational activities. Workers proposed the need to increase  these activities, especially for children and youth, proposing  in some cases turning movie theaters into video arcades because  the movie theaters are not being used.    The workers parliaments have also analyzed the use of prices  to reduce excess currency in circulation. They proposed the  direct sale to workers of products coming from the worker  centers, charging for services such as state transport,  including those with red license plates. The workers also  proposed the use of vehicles from the different organizations to  collect the money, incentivizing the driver with a percentage of  revenues.    In general, there was consensus concerning the idea of not  increasing transport tariffs, although some parliaments have  proposed this. Among the proposals made we can mention that of  increasing the prices of gasoline, lubricants, and accessories.    In many meetings the workers proposed eliminating alcoholic  beverages, cigarettes, and tobacco in general from the ration  book, selling them freely but increasing their prices. However,  some meetings were against the increase in prices, or at least  they proposed a moderate increase. Some also proposed keeping  them in the ration book.    In other meetings the workers proposed maintaining the  established cigarette quota but eliminating the additional quota  and imposing a fixed price for those that are sold freely. Among  the analyzed aspects we can also mention the alternative to  encourage the formation of accounts for workers' and peasants'  funds. The People's Savings Bank has also been urged to pay  higher interest rates so as to foment savings.    Concerning prices in the foods area, the workers have  proposed a revision, saying that prices must be in line with  quality. There were also proposals saying that prices of some  services are too high and that not all workers have access to  those services.    Concerning the price of food in the workers' cafeterias, the  workers also proposed a revision in order to adjust them in  accordance with reasonable costs and the quality of the food,  although many parliaments were against a readjustment of prices.    There were repeated proposals to charge for water,  especially  imposing a higher price on those who waste water. But there were  many more proposals to raise electricity rates, especially for  excessive use above a given quota.    Workers also agreed on an increase in telephone rates  provided that service is also improved. There were fewer  proposals not to charge for water or to increase the electricity  rate.    There was an overwhelming consensus against the imposition  of tax on salaries, although some parliaments were also in favor  of a tax on salaries.    On several occasions the workers proposed the idea of  subsidizing low-income families to protect them from price  readjustments.    In many parliaments there were proposals to take into  consideration the income of self-employed workers at the time of  implementing the new tax. Other parliaments have directly  proposed that high taxes be imposed on the income of  self-employed workers. Some also proposed charging a tax on  peasants in accordance with their income.    The complex [passage indistinct] in the workers parliaments  where there were many proposals to implement them. Fewer  proposals were against implementing them, arguing that the  country is not prepared for this and that it would not resolve  the financial problem.    There was almost absolute consensus in the discussions on  the  confiscation of the money and other resources of doubtful origin  from all those who have accrued wealth illegally.    During the discussions the workers in different parliaments  proposed the revision and amendment of the penal code, while  others proposed the implementation of stronger punishments on  those citizens who commit crimes, especially economic crimes.    We understand that the first duty of the union movement is  to  urge the workers to strengthen their fighting morale, to prevent  them from becoming discouraged, to strengthen their confidence  that we will be successful, and to assure that whatever we do  will preserve socialism and its essential achievements. We must  continue developing our awareness and spirit to understand the  sacrifice that is implicit in these measures, which are  inevitable to save what is essential.    Likewise, we must meditate on the great lines of action  awaiting the unions. The Parliaments in the Workplace have  demonstrated their validity as a method of rapport on the  situation that is in the interest of the workers and  administrative leaders for the study of basic problems and the  collective quest for solutions, starting from the individual  contribution and united with the administrations, the union  organizations, and the political leadership. We must learn  lessons from all this: the need to be more communicative and to  maintain a continuous presence in the centers, to teach and  learn, to learn how to establish a closer relationship with our  union members, to convey the experience of how to solve the  problems that are worrying the workers, to interpret them and  help them find a solution.    Changing what has been achieved in the workers parliaments  into a permanent style and method of union work implies, above  all, the revitalization and perfection of the role of the unions  which must use the authority bestowed upon them as  representatives of the true owners of the means of production,  and thereby to wage an ideological war against any way of  thinking that could obstruct the country's development and the  path to efficiency. To say it in another way: We must tirelessly  fight against anything that affects the workers' interests, be  it labor or technological indiscipline, lack of control, or the  bureacratic web which delays the solutions of problems; favors  apathy, idleness, irresponsibility; and does not concern itself  when resources are lost or are insufficiently exploited.    The battle for economic efficiency is not just a temporary  slogan under the difficult Cuban economic situation, but the  central aspect for which the unions and our CTC must work.    In compliance with the workers' demands in several centers  throughout the country, the CTC National Secretariat has decided  to give a new profile to the Assemblies of Production and  Service, replacing them by the Assemblies for Economic  Efficiency which will pay special attention to these decisive  objectives of our work. This objective is giving new life to the  spirit of the workers parliaments in each task or union activity  in which we might be engaged; that frank, critical, and  self-critical analysis must prevail everywhere, seeking not  justification where there is none but solutions that can be  implemented with the presence and active participation of all  those interested.    After verifying once again the workers' indestructible  loyalty to the Revolution, and after verifying in dozens of  thousands of meetings that the Cuban workers, above the current  sacrifices and deprivations, are willing to fight with all their  might to maintain the integrity of the fatherland and the  achievements of socialism, we cannot but strengthen our  commitment to Fidel and to the people, that the Cuban union  movement will be, today and always, a bulwark of the  revolutionary spirit, a tireless and tenacious force of the  resistance and of the victory our people deserve.    Fatherland or death, socialism or death, we will win.  [applause]    This has been our report, comrade president.</p>

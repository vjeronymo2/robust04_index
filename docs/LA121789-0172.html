			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ETHICS FEVER HAS COUNCIL SMOLDERING;  </P> <P> CITY HALL: PUBLICLY, MEMBERS SEEM AGREEABLE TO REFORMS. BUT A BATTLE IS BREWING  OVER PROPOSALS THAT COULD CHANGE THE RULES OF LOCAL POLITICS.  </P> <P> In the warren of offices at City Hall, a wickedly snide takeoff on new  proposals to govern the ethics of government officials is circulating.  </P> <P> "No elected official, officers, general manager or employee shall enjoy the  respect of the public for any reason," it declares, its form and language aping  the stilted bureaucratese of an ethics document crafted over the last eight  months by a mayoral commission.  </P> <P> The two-page spoof has drawn some fans. Hidden behind the agreeable nods of  City Council members who have studiously called for ethics reform in the wake  of conflict-of-interest allegations raised against Mayor Tom Bradley, an oddly  defined and occasionally angry battle is brewing over proposals that could  markedly change the rules of politics in the city.  </P> <P> As hearings begin into the package's future, the ethics debate has made for  strange and ironic maneuverings. Two council members usually identified with  political reform have lined up against it. Mayor Bradley, whose controversial  financial dealings spawned the proposals, has defended it.  </P> <P> But most council members have taken to their bunkers, fearful that any spoken  objections will be used to slay them at the polls. The reason, simply, is the  apple-pie nature of the ethics issue -- and the vows of the ethics commission  to take the matter to the voters if the council does not approve the package by  February.  </P> <P> Councilman-turned-lobbyist Arthur K. Snyder derides a 40-page draft ethics  ordinance as "a ridiculous amount of overkill" in response to Bradley's crisis.  But he nevertheless aptly describes the treacherous turf now treaded by the  council, particularly those members inclined to question specific reforms.  </P> <P> "It's sort of like being against motherhood. Maybe worse," he said.  </P> <P> The first public hearing on the proposals by the Commission to Draft an Ethics  Code for Los Angeles City Government, the group appointed by the mayor last  spring when questions about his behavior first surfaced, was held before the  council's ad hoc ethics committee on Thursday. Two hearings are scheduled this  week before the committee sends its recommendations to the full council in  January.  </P> <P> The commission's sweeping report, if approved, not only would outlaw the  financial transactions that drew Bradley into controversy, but would also vault  Los Angeles into the tight circle of cities nationwide that have launched  exhaustive reforms to quell public suspicion of government officials.  </P> <P> It would expand the city's financial disclosure requirements, ordering senior  and elected officials to release information not only about their investment  holdings but also other items like home mortgages. A city ethics commission,  modeled after the state Fair Political Practices Commission, would ride herd on  unethical behavior. The enforcement powers of the city attorney would be  broadened, a special prosecutor could be named in sensitive cases, and ethics  training would be required for city employees.  </P> <P> In what are considered the most controversial aspects, the reforms also would  outlaw the earning of outside income, all gifts and honorariums, and would  order the public financing of city political campaigns. In California, only  Sacramento County has approved public campaign financing.  </P> <P> In only the first council committee session on the matter, the touchy nature of  the future debate was unleashed -- paradoxically, by Councilman Ernani  Bernardi, who for years fought his peers to invoke campaign reform, and by  Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, whose successful 1987 campaign against then-Council  President Pat Russell established Galanter's reputation as an outsider willing  to take on the political Establishment.  </P> <P> "Please don't be rushed into this thing! Don't be steamrollered!" Bernardi  bellowed to his fellow council members Thursday, expressing particular  resentment at his longtime nemesis, public campaign financing.  </P> <P> Galanter too has voiced trepidation about adopting the commission's proposals  in total, arguing specifically that requiring up to 1,500 city employees to get  the city's and the commission's permission to take a second job could violate  their right to privacy.  </P> <P> Many council members are said to privately share the concerns spoken by  Bernardi and Galanter but have sat out the debate so far. Around City Hall,  Galanter's role in particular has drawn quizzical expressions. Most figure that  she is in the best position of any council member to articulate the concerns of  her silent brethren.  </P> <P> "She's just like Nixon going to China on this issue," said Chief Deputy City  Atty. John Emerson, a political veteran who equated her role with that of the  staunchly anti-Communist Republican President, whose overtures to a Communist  nation were arguably better received than a Democrat's would have been.  </P> <P> "Ruth Galanter can stand up and criticize an ethics package because there are  few in government who are as conscientious as she," he added. "My sense is she  is saying what a lot are thinking, but are wary of articulating in the context  of ethics fever."  </P> <P> But Galanter too is careful to note that her opposition is limited and she  favors some reform. Other council members suggest that her current role as a  lightning rod for debate on the issue is a dangerous one.  </P> <P> "There is some political risk for her to be raising this," said Michael Woo,  like Galanter a member of the council's ad hoc ethics committee. "She runs the  risk of forfeiting the political capital she's raised."  </P> <P> Woo and other council members have indicated they felt pressured to approve the  commission's recommendations virtually before reading them, given the heated  atmosphere surrounding the issue. Immediately after the commission issued its  report in late November -- and before it wrote a draft ordinance that spelled  out the reforms -- council members Gloria Molina and Marvin Braude endorsed the  package. Their move, in effect, posed a challenge to the others.  </P> <P> In his case, the ever-cautious Woo said he fears that by delaying an  endorsement, he has stoked suspicions of himself.  </P> <P> "I think it raised questions about . . . whether I as a councilman was less  enthusiastic about ethics than others," said Woo, who said he is still forming  his views on the matter.  </P> <P> Ethics reforms typically wind through legislative bodies at a snail's pace, as  does any issue that touches immediately on the livelihoods of council members  and their staffs. Indeed, the council ad hoc committee has been tied up for  months in a dispute over a competing ethics package proposed by Woo, Braude and  council President John Ferraro. Reforms aimed at regulating City Hall lobbyists  languished for years before the council last week ordered the city attorney to  draft new rules. And Bernardi sought for a decade to reform campaign financing  before taking the matter, in initiative form, successfully to the voters in  1985.  </P> <P> But any long-term delay on the new package has been virtually precluded by a  deft political move by the ethics commission that issued the proposals.  Geoffrey Cowan, the panel's chairman, vowed when he issued the report that if  the council did not approve the package by February, the commission and  prominent supporters would take the issue to the voters via an initiative. The  group appears to have the financial resources to back up its threat.  </P> <P> In the shorthand of a campaign, any reluctance to approve ethics reform could  easily be construed as an anti-ethics position -- or so many officials fear.  Cowan has indicated the commission will accept some changes in its plan, if  they are deemed improvements, but he said the commission remains insistent that  taxpayer financing of campaigns and the ban on outside income remain part of  the deal.  </P> <P> Asked whether he had the council votes -- the "head count" in political  parlance -- to guarantee approval of those reforms, Cowan smiled and pointedly  reinforced the commission's threat.  </P> <P> "In certain respects, my head count is the voters of Los Angeles," he replied.  </P> <P> Cowan and those who support the commission's report argue that taxpayer  financing is necessary to fight the public perception that council decisions  are dramatically affected by campaign contributions.  </P> <P> Under the formula currently being considered, City Council candidates who are  able to raise at least $25,000 on their own will be eligible for up to $133,000  in matching city funds for each election. City attorney and controller  candidates could receive up to $333,000 each and mayoral contenders up to  $667,000 each in matching funds.  </P> <P> At the same time, council candidates who asked for public money would be  limited to spending no more than $400,000 for each primary and general  election, while city attorney and controller candidates would have to stop at  $1 million and mayoral candidates at $2 million.  </P> <P> Overall, Cowan estimated that the financing would cost the city's taxpayers up  to $2 million per year, in addition to the $1.8 million per year operating  price tag for the city ethics commission.  </P> <P> Galanter said she is concerned that the costs could spiral.  </P> <P> "Nobody has looked in any detail at what the costs will be," she said. "What  the public is buying, when they write letters saying pass it, is (the council)  writing a blank check."  </P> <P> Another city official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity but who is  familiar with council opinions about the proposed reforms, predicted that "the  public financing of campaigns is going to be separated from the package."  </P> <P> Tinkering with the proposed ban on outside income -- which is included in both  the ethics commission report and the competing proposal drafted by Woo, Ferraro  and Braude -- may prove more difficult, for it strikes at the heart of the  criticism leveled at Mayor Bradley.  </P> <P> Bradley initially came under fire for accepting payments from two financial  institutions in exchange for serving as an adviser or director. Bradley  acknowledged that it was a "mistake" to take the money from the firms when they  were doing business with the city.  </P> <P> One official who has followed the council's informal discussions referred to  the ban as a "slam dunk" -- a move impossible to miss. Others suggest that the  council members, many of whom distanced themselves from Bradley when the  scandal broke, cannot possibly advocate anything but a ban on outside income  because of the political implications.  </P> <P> Council members privately say there are broad disagreements on those and some  other specifics, but that most of the proposals stand a good chance of being  approved.  </P> <P> "There is no doubt that ethics reform is extraordinarily popular at this point  in time -- and politicians certainly see that," said Mark Fabiani, Bradley's  chief of staff.  </P> <P> Curiously, and in marked contrast to the reaction the issue gets among elected  officials here and elsewhere, council members report few expressions of  interest from their constituents.  </P> <P> "Generally, they know that 'Ethics with a big E' is being talked about at City  Hall," said Woo, whose council committee has been convulsed by the issue since  spring. "I don't find an enormous amount of public interest."  </P></p>

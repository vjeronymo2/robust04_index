Carneiro explained that the agreement "is a landmark in  the history of international nuclear safeguards."    He said that the agreement explains how the IAEA will  inspect  nuclear installations in Brazil. Carneiro is the speaker for  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and was in charge of the  negotiations between the Senate and the Brazilian administration.    The timing of the visits was the most controversial aspect  of  the issue. Carneiro said the IAEA agreed to notify in advance  its intention to inspect Brazilian nuclear installations and to  make the inspection only after their construction is finished.  "The IAEA wanted to inspect installations while construction  was under way, but Brazil did not agree," Carneiro said.    He also reported that from the diplomatic viewpoint the  Brazilian negotiators gained status in the eyes of the  international community. "Brazil tied its ratification of the  accord to the fulfillment of certain conditions, unlike many  other countries that did not follow suit," Carneiro stated.    According to the senator, the IAEA was pressuring to gain  control over nuclear energy in Brazil. The agency wanted, among  other things, to visit Brazilian installations whenever it  received a report that Brazil was using nuclear energy for  nonpeaceful objectives. "Brazil did not accept this and  demanded that unscheduled inspections comply with auxiliary  regulations that clearly establish how this should be done, and  the IAEA agreed," the senator explained. "This was the aspect  that countries fear most, which is why Brazil has never signed  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), which will be  reviewed in 1995."    The senator also reported that the Brazilian-Argentine  Agency  for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Material (ABACC), not the  IAEA, will control nuclear material in Brazil. "This will be  done to make sure that the uranium enriched in Brazil using  Brazilian technology will not be diverted to manufacturing arms  in Brazil or abroad," Carneiro said. The Brazilian Senate will  have to ratify the agreement signed with the IAEA early in 1994.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / France's National Front takes big by-election lead FRANCE'S extreme right-wing National Front took a commanding lead in the first round of voting in Sunday's by-election in Nice, confirming recent indications that the party will make large gains in next month's regional elections. The by-election also saw a steep drop in the socialist vote, continuing a run of electoral setbacks for the government. Mr Jacques Peyrat, the National Front candidate, won almost 38 per cent of the vote in the 14th canton of Nice, well ahead of the centre-right UDF candidate, who secured only 15.8 per cent of the turnout. The Socialist party vote dropped more than 9 percentage points to barely 12 per cent. Mr Laurent Fabius, leader of the Socialist party, described the result as 'frightful' and called on party supporters to resist the National Front's advance. Mr Fabius also invited the Communists and centrist parties to join Socialists in thwarting the National Front and mainstream conservatives in the regional elections on March 22. The National Front's showing in Nice could well be repeated throughout Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur, a key political battleground, in regional elections. A recent survey suggested the traditional conservative parties were marginally ahead in the region, but that the National Front was a close second.</p>

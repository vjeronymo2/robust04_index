			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WALESA APOLOGIZES FOR NON-DEMOCRATIC STYLE  </P> <P> Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, seeking reelection as union chairman, apologized  today for his strong-handed rule but reminded his critics that the results of  his administration brought victory for Poland.  </P> <P> Walesa, his voice shaking with emotion as he addressed the union's second  congress, recalled when he jumped the shipyard wall in 1980 to lead the strike  triggering the rise of Solidarity, the East Bloc's first free trade union.  </P> <P> "You liked my jump over the wall and you elected me to drive the vehicle called  Solidarity," said Walesa.  </P> <P> He said the union had to operate under martial law imposed on Dec. 13, 1981, by  Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, now Poland's president, with thousands of activists  jailed. He said quick Solidarity decisions by one man were needed.  </P> <P> "If I obeyed some of you then I would have crushed the vehicle," Walesa said.  "I had no time for democracy."  </P> <P> He said union officials criticized him for not holding meetings deemed illegal  by communist authorities, but when he yielded and organized a meeting of  Solidarity leaders, "the result was their trial and multi-year sentences."  </P> <P> Walesa won an overwhelming vote of confidence from Solidarity after his  impassioned defense of his 10 years as the movement's leader.  </P> <P> Just 24 hours before an expected reelection bid, Walesa asked for a show of  support. Delegates present responded with a vote of 357 in favor, one against  and 22 abstentions.  </P> <P> "I apologize for offending some of you," he said. "I forgive you and ask your  forgiveness," Walesa said before the vote.  </P> <P> Referring to a resolution passed by Solidarity's congress to invite former  Solidarity members to the congress, many of them opponents of Walesa, the union  leader threatened to walk out if one particular man came. Walesa did not  identify him, but was apparently referring to a longtime rival, Andrzej  Gwiazda.  </P> <P> Leaflets tossed in the air in the hall Thursday by Gwiazda's followers said  Walesa formed a Solidarity dictatorship similar to the former communist rule.  </P> <P> Earlier, a Solidarity source said some delegates were considering a move to  limit Walesa's power as leader of the union.  </P></p>

			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Observer: Pylon the agony Top bosses of the 12 regional electricity companies are now looking at profits of more than Pounds 10m on executive share options they received three years ago. Nice work if you can get it. But they claim the customer has also done well out of privatisation, thanks to much improved services. That's open to question in the case of London Electricity, where chairman John Wilson is looking at a paper profit of over Pounds 500,000. Callers to London Electricity's main switchboard yesterday heard an automatic operator intone: 'Our emergency service is now in operation.' Holding on for further details, the operator then suggested calling another number because 'there is a telephone problem'. The new number referred the customer on to two further numbers. Finally an answering machine said emergency service telephones were busy: 'please call back in 15 minutes'.</p>

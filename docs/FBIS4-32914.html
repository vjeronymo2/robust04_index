			<p>BFN     [Text] Dajabon, Dominican Republic, 27 May (EFE) -- The  flow of individuals and vehicles across the Haitian-Dominican  Republic border has been suspended. This seems to indicate that  starting today, Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer is keeping  his promise to implement the blockade imposed by the United  Nations.    On Wednesday, Balaguer promised Dante Caputo, UN and OAS  negotiator for Haiti, and William Grey, special U.S. envoy, that  he would close the border completely, and yesterday, Balaguer  met with his secretary of the Armed Forces, Lieutenant General  Matos Villanueva.    Since early this morning, Dominican soldiers have been  preventing the entry of Haitians through the border crossing at  Dajabon, the Dominican town closest to Haitian territory.    The Dominican Government's efforts are also being supported  by Haitian guards, who are preventing their fellow countrymen  from getting closer than 700 meters to the border. As is common  on Mondays and Fridays, these Haitians had planned to cross the  border to buy and sell goods. In addition, hundreds of Haitians  normally enter the Dominican Republic every day to buy fuel and  take it back to Haiti.    The Dominican Armed Forces have increased the number of  soldiers on the border to enforce the total closure of the  border. The surveillance posts along the Dominican border are  located every 10 meters and are now under the constant  supervision of officers in vehicles. On the Haitian side,  soldiers are also preventing their compatriots from crossing the  Masacre River into the Dominican Republic. Since 0500, senior  officers have been personally ensuring that "neither Haitians  nor Dominicans" cross the border.    The parks and main streets in Dajabon also have been placed  under military control. The closing of the border surprised the  residents of Dajabon and hundreds of Dominicans who arrive from  other cities to buy clothes, shoes, liquor, and arts and crafts  from Haitians. It also affected Dominican merchants who travel  up to 300 km to sell food to the Haitians.    A Dominican Army officer at one border post warned: "No one  will be able to control these Haitians. When they are starving  to death, they will want to cross the border, even if they get  killed in the process."</p>

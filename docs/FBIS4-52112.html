			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam on  Friday instructed the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries  Ministry to work out thorough and effective farm and fishery  goods marketing programs at an early date.    "It is imcomprehensible that the ministry has prepared  little  for the implementation of the new law on farm produce  distribution and price stabilization and thereby allowed a room  for the recent farm goods market disturbance despite the lapse  of more than a year since the legislation of the law," Kim said.    The instructions were given at a meeting of senior  presidential secretaries at Chongwadae.    Chongwadae Spokesman Chu Ton-sik said the president stated  it  was not right for the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries  Ministry to try to make up shortcomings of a law with an  implementation decree.    "If you had found shortcomings in a new law, the  administration should have taken a lawful measure to rectify it  in consulation, if necessary, with the ruling party," President  Kim was quoted as saying.    Earlier in the week, farm goods market brokers staged a  two-day strike to paralyze major agricultural markets in protest  against the new law which they claimed would undermine their  interests.</p>

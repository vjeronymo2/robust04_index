			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Concerning the recent public remarks made by  U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary Hubbard, the U.S. side's  delegate to U.S.-North Korea New York working-level contact, on  the abolition of the National Security Law in our country, a  Foreign Ministry official said this issue was never officially  raised between the ROK and U.S. Governments. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, Ha Sun-pong, a spokesman of the ruling Democratic  Liberal Party, today made a statement pertaining to the remarks  of U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary Hubbard, who suggested the  abolition of the National Security Law. In the statement, he  said that logically his remarks are not appropriate, and if the  report on his remarks is true, it is regretful. Spokesman Ha  Sun-pong noted that he will further inquire into the truth of  the remarks.    Pak Chi-won, spokesman of the opposition Democratic Party,  in  a commentary pertaining to Deputy Assistant Secretary Hubbard's  remarks, said he agrees with the remarks in principle. He  maintained that Hubbard's remarks should be considered from the  standpoint of the promotion of human rights and not of  interference in our domestic affairs.    Spokesman Pak Chi-won said that he understood that Deputy  Assistant Secretary Hubbard also conveyed his position to our  government, and urged the government to expedite reviewing  whether the Security Law should be revised or abolished.</p>

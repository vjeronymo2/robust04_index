			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Arts: Betrayed by the system - When it comes to teaching students how to draw we have been led astray by Tom, Dick and Harry The idea of taking life drawing into secondary schools would seem as unexceptionable and high-minded as could be; and where better to celebrate it than in the Fine Rooms of the Royal Academy of Arts, bastion of the disciplined and objective study of the model? Since 1989, the Outreach Programme of the Academy's Education Department has been sending graduates of the Academy Schools into secondary schools around the country, to conduct day-long workshops (modern teach-speak) in life drawing. There is no doubting the sincerity of all those involved in the programme, nor that, at the most basic level of interest and engagement, some good has come of it. The children range, as the schools themselves decide, from A Level and art school aspirants to those who might never consider the art class to be anything but a good skive, and all are worked extremely hard. Once the initial shock at being confronted by the nude figure has worn off, that too proves salutary - for we all have our bodies to live in, and to look out at the model, unsentimentally and unsalaciously, is only to look at ourselves. So far so good, and on first sight the drawings now at the Academy seem full of expressive life and energy. But when we look again, what else is there to see but expressive life and energy? The truth begins to dawn that what we confront is not the fruit of study at all, but of therapy made up to pass as study. A great deal may well have been felt - of sympathy, excitement and release - in the making of these drawings, but what has been learnt? And if learnt, what remembered? Where is information that is actually retrievable, usable? What is so saddening is that here we might have had a programme that began at last to address the heresy that has betrayed art education at all levels these past 30 years. Instead we have its whole-hearted embrace. Do your own thing. Express yourself. Be an artist. Have fun - but if it requires any technical discipline or detached and objective critical consideration, above all if it is difficult, don't bother. The game is given away at the start in an introductory display which offers a glib travesty of the argument. A few dim and tired examples of the Victorian academic life school are set up, stump and smudge, to show the bad, dull old ways. There is nothing of Augustus John, or Sickert or Tonks, in the great Slade tradition of life drawing. Instead, in straight comparison, oh brave new world, sit those heroes of reform, Victor Pasmore, Tom Hudson, Harry Thubron and Richard Hamilton, whose example and polemic led directly to the reformation of the art schools in the 1960s. Chapter and verse are given in the catalogue. Right up until 1964, the last year of the old public examination for the National Diploma in Design, the study of the figure was the central discipline of the art school. 'The nude and costumed figure is studied in a variety of poses,' runs a Ministry report of 1950. 'These usually last a full day, but frequently short poses, action poses, or . . . poses sustained during two or three days are substituted, so that the student becomes familiar with the figure under a variety of conditions. By these methods allied to a thorough study of anatomy it is hoped to equip the student with a sound working knowledge of the human figure and a technique adequate to its expression.' So it did. 'This limited interpretation of drawing survived until the 1950s', the catalogue goes on. But then our Tom, Dick, Harry and Victor, all intelligent men but manifestly indifferent draughtsmen, knew better. 'They engaged the student in processes of drawing which were exploratory and analytical, as well as expressive. The figure was no longer viewed as a static object to be pinned down and delineated. It was a living, complex form which could only be approached in an 'open' and 'questioning' manner. Drawing became . . . a dynamic sequence of mark-making which . . . proposed certain ideas about form . . . The eye searched intently . . . the mind explored . . . There were no prescribed 'answers'. . . ' Ah. There we have it. No answers. Drawing at last as exploration and analysis, open and questioning - but no answers. When I look back on my own unreformed days and weeks in the life room, confronted by that fellow human being in living space, whose form in all its subtle articulation had somehow to be rendered credibly and intelligibly onto the flat surface of the board, I remember no simple descriptive exercise, no 'pinning down and delineating'. There were relationships to measured, shifts, balances and tensions sympathetically to be felt and understood, and a hand to be disciplined into making the marks that eye and brain required. Analysis, exploration, discovery, expression? Of course. And discipline, and technique? And here are these eager children on their hands and knees, paper on the floor, model on the move and nothing in fixed relation to anything else, to be analysed or explored, let alone expressed. But who is there now to teach them, show them how, and make them do it? They deserve more than this.

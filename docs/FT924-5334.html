			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Economy may be expanding AN INDICATION that demand in the economy may be expanding has come with the latest figures for the volume of banknotes in circulation, released yesterday by the Bank of England. They indicate that M0, the narrow measure of the money supply which is a good guide to overall demand, has risen this month by about 3 per cent compared with November last year. If confirmed when the Bank issues official M0 figures on December 18, that would be the biggest year-on-year rise for M0 in any month this year.</p>

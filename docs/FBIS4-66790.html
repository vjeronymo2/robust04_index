			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M.D. Nalapat: "Debate Over Prime Minister's U.S. </F> Trip"]    [Text] New Delhi, April 12--During the past month, there  has been a difference of opinion between the "pragmatists" and  the "nationalists" over whether the Prime Minister, Mr Narasimha  Rao, should or should not visit the United States at this  juncture in Indo-U.S. relations.    The pragmatists point to the U.S. emergence as India's  largest trading partner, foreign investor and supplier of  technology while pressing for an early visit. The "nationalists"  point to the Pakistan tilt, and now to the F-16s, as reasons why  Mr Rao should stay at home.    According to members of the Prime Minister's official  family,  the Prime Minister has plumped for the "pragmatic" line, though  the exact dates for the trip have "yet to be finalised." In an  earlier invitation--to which no reply was sent from the Indian  side--the U.S. president, Mr Bill Clinton, had suggested May 6  as a convenient date. A second invitation, brought by the U.S.  deputy secretary of state, Mr Strobe Talbott, did not specify a  date. It is this second invitation that has been accepted by Mr  Rao.    The 7 Race Course Road is of the view that the Talbott visit  "significantly succeeded" in removing the bad taste of the  earlier remarks of the U.S. assistant secretary of state for  South Asia, Ms Robin Raphel.    During his visit, Mr Talbott did not "press India to make  concessions on Kashmir," and instead made it clear that the  United States had no prescription to offer; it was for India and  Pakistan to resolve their differences by themselves. This stand  has gone down well with the Prime Minister, as also the explicit  delinking by Mr Talbott of India and Pakistan on the nuclear  issue. This is in contrast to the Pakistani stand of linking its  nuclear policy to India's capabilities.    It was considered significant that not just in Delhi, but in  Islamabad as well, Mr Talbott did not make any statement  "embarrassing to India." This reticence--in contrast to his  junior colleague--helped create an atmosphere for acceptance of  the invitation.    According to members of the Prime Minister's official  family,  one of the primary objectives of the visit will be to attempt to  "deter the United States from escalating the arms race in South  Asia through supply of F-16s to Pakistan. Indeed, this one  objective by itself makes the trip necessary."    During the visit, Mr Rao is expected to lobby against the  supply of the aircraft not just with the U.S. President but also  with other members of the U.S. power elite: members of the U.S.  Congress, academicians in leading think-tanks, and  representatives of the American media.    Mr Rao is expected to make clear that the supply of F-16s  under pressure from the Lockheed Corporation would lead to an  immediate response from India, in the form of purchase of fresh  high-performance aircraft and the deployment of additional  missile batteries for defense. The PMO [Prime Minister's  Offixce] is convinced that there will be few takers for the U.S.  administration line that the F-16s are "almost some kind of toy,  rather than efficient nuclear weapons carriers."    According to the PMO, the decision to go to Washington was,  apart from the need to pursue every avenue to block the F-16  deal, taken because of three factors:     -  As a signal to the emerging pro-India lobby among U.S.  business houses that India too is serious about better relations  with the world's largest economic power, and to establish direct  contacts with the million-strong Indian community in that  country.    -  To further the process of contacts between various  levels of U.S. and Indian officialdom. At present, numerous  contacts are taking place at all levels between India and the  United States. This process will gain speed after a Prime  Ministerial visit.    -  Because a Democrat administration has been,  thanks to the lingering Kennedy magic, always perceived as being  "closer to India" than a Republican one. The PMO "cannot see the  harm in going to Washington to meet a democrat president,  especially the one who has already been called on by leaders of  major countries such as China, Russia, Germany, the U.K. and  France, not to mention Pakistan." Rather than "sit on a high  horse," it is better to take advantage of the opportunity "to  expand the areas of agreement and narrow down the areas of  friction."     It is accepted that there will be some negative political  fallout from the visit, but this has been taken as being an  argument for an early visit, in that such a visit would give  time to contain the fallout before assembly elections fall due  in November. Thus, barring yet another Raphel-like  embarrassment, the Prime Minister should be in the United States  on a four-day visit by May.</p>

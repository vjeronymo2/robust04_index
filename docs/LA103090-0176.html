			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. THEATER;  </P> <P> TWO TOP ACTORS LEAVING RESIDENT ENSEMBLE OF SCR;  </P> <P> ANNI LONG AND JARION MONROE, HER HUSBAND, ARE DEPARTING FOR ARTISTIC AND  PERSONAL REASONS.  </P> <P> Two of South Coast Repertory's most versatile and well-regarded actors have  left the resident ensemble and moved to Northern California for a combination  of personal and artistic reasons.  </P> <P> Anni Long, who joined SCR in 1975, and her husband, Jarion Monroe, who made his  SCR debut in 1988, are already working in separate stage productions elsewhere  and will make their permanent home in Mill Valley outside San Francisco.  </P> <P> Long, in rehearsals for a starring role in Keith Reddin's "Life During Wartime"  at Berkeley Repertory, said in an interview last week from Mill Valley that she  and Monroe hope to retain a long-distance connection with SCR.  </P> <P> Monroe left Saturday for Yale Repertory in New Haven, Conn., where he will  reprise a multiple role that he originated last season at SCR in the world  premiere of Howard Korder's "Search and Destroy." Reddin's play opens Nov. 7.  </P> <P> SCR artistic director Martin Benson confirmed that Long and Monroe left on  amicable terms and that SCR playgoers could expect to see "both of them back  here" from time to time "working in significant roles."  </P> <P> "They haven't lost us," Long said. "We talked about this with Martin and David  (Emmes, SCR producing artistic director), and they feel it's nothing but good  for actors to work with others and come back broadened."  </P> <P> Long admitted that she had been miffed at not being asked to audition for the  starring role of Ann Whitefield in Shaw's "Man and Superman" earlier this  season on the SCR Mainstage. But, she insisted, neither that nor Benson's  failure to cast her in the major supporting role of Violet -- for which she was  allowed to audition -- had anything to do with her departure.  </P> <P> "The casting of 'Man and Superman' was a great disappointment to me," Long  acknowledged. "I was very upset. You will have to ask Martin why he didn't cast  me because I frankly do not know. But that is not why I left."  </P> <P> Benson said: "I had a stronger cast, and I didn't feel Anni would have been  better. But in no way does that value her less. After all, I was the one who  cast her as Lemon in 'Aunt Dan and Lemon.' "  </P> <P> A major factor that contributed to his casting decision for "Man and Superman,"  he said, "was making sure with a resident company that the audience doesn't get  a steady diet of the same actor."  </P> <P> Long said that family reasons lay at the heart of her decision to leave. Monroe  has a 10-year-old son from a previous marriage who lives in Northern  California, she said, and they want to see him more frequently than was  possible from Orange County. She also said she wanted to escape the county's  "crush of development," which she said was making her "spiritually sick."  </P> <P> Long also cited artistic reasons.  </P> <P> "Other theaters have offered me work over the years, and I have not taken it  because I felt so good at South Coast Rep," she said. "I felt safe, which is a  part of the reason I need to work other places. For an artist to get real  comfortable is to relax and maybe not play quite up to risk, maybe not go for  broke every time.  </P> <P> "Although I feel I hadn't fallen into that trap, I wanted to protect myself  from letting that happen. Why not keep myself really fresh and alive in my work  and bring back new energy that I get from working in a different environment  with new people for a totally different audience? It's very exciting."  </P> <P> Long said Berkeley Rep had asked her last spring -- well before she decided to  leave -- to read the script of "Life During Wartime." She said she felt "a  special affinity" for Reddin's work, having been in SCR's world premieres of  his "Highest Standard of Living" and "Rum and Coke."  </P> <P> "I have a history with this writer," she said. "I also enjoy doing multiple  roles, and in this play I get to do three characters."  </P> <P> Because Long ultimately was cast in "Man and Superman" as Miss Ramsden, a tiny  role, she said she felt that it would not be a hardship for Benson to let her  out of the Shaw production two weeks before it closed earlier this month so she  could begin rehearsals for Reddin's latest play. "I told Martin that doing it  meant a lot to me, and he graciously agreed to find a replacement and let me  go," she said.  </P> <P> In 16 seasons with SCR, Long has appeared in more than 50 productions,  beginning with "Jumpers" and including "Benefactors," "As You Like It," "The  Time of Your Life," "Equus," "A Doll's House" and "The Ruling Class." She  starred as Lemon in "Aunt Dan and Lemon" on the Mainstage three seasons ago, as  Sally Talley in "Talley's Folly" on the Second Stage two seasons ago and as  Kate in "Emerald City" on the Second Stage last season.  </P> <P> But that is only a fraction of what she has done recently. Long also played  multiple roles in productions as different as "Hard Times" and "Search and  Destroy," and she lent key support in productions from "A Chorus of  Disapproval" to "A Christmas Carol" to "The Crucible."  </P> <P> Monroe, who married Long on New Year's Day, 1989, has been even busier than she  has in recent seasons. Ever since his SCR debut in "The Crucible" -- the couple  met while performing in that 1988-89 season opener -- Monroe has worked  virtually nonstop in an assortment of roles so strikingly varied that the  audience sometimes did not recognize him.  </P> <P> Most recently seen as both Mendoza and the Devil in "Man and Superman," Monroe  starred with Long as an Australian screenwriter in "Emerald City" and as the  Dickensian Gradgrind in "Hard Times." In "Search and Destroy" he was an icily  dictatorial self-growth guru and an officiously bureaucratic tax collector. He  also was an indelibly smarmy libertine in "A Chorus of Disapproval" and an  elegant Ghost of Christmas Past in "A Christmas Carol."  </P> <P> Ironically, Long's departure with Monroe has given Benson similar ideas. "I've  begun to think of working somewhere else myself just as a tonic to get some  perspective on SCR," he noted. "It's so easy to lose track of the world by  staying in one place."  </P> <P> Benson, who co-founded SCR in 1964 with Emmes, has staged more than a third of  all its productions. He has a shelf of directorial awards but has never worked  professionally outside SCR. The last time he staged a play elsewhere was eight  years ago at Chapman College in an amateur outing, he said.  </P> <P> Benson hastened to add, however, that directing at other professional theaters  is "a long-range idea." His next production is Mark Lee's "Pirates," scheduled  to open on the SCR Mainstage in January.  </P> <P> IN LIMBO: Theatre in Exile has canceled "Miss Julie" because of dismal  attendance during the opening weekend at the Forum Theatre in Laguna Beach.  August Strindberg's 19th-Century naturalist drama, which ran from Oct. 19 to  21, was to reopen Nov. 9 to 11. But producer-director Joseph Karimbeik said  fewer than 100 paying customers showed up for the first three performances,  which made the cost of remounting the show prohibitive.  </P> <P> BURN THIS: Elysium, the company that took William Hoffman's "As Is" to Los  Angeles after its run at the Forum Theatre last season, has raised more than  $10,000 to stage Lanford Wilson's "Burn This," also at the Forum.  </P> <P> The production, to star Dan Millington as Pale, will be the play's Orange  County premiere and will run from Jan. 10 to Feb. 10, 1991. "We've got about  five sold-out houses so far," Millington said. Peter Henry Schroeder, who  teaches acting at South Coast Repertory's Adult Conservatory, will direct.  Schroeder just staged "Countess Dracula" at Santa Ana's Way Off Broadway  Playhouse.  </P></p>

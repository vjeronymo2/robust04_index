Engineer  subunits of mobile forces are equipped with it.    The machine consists of the following: Base chassis,  universal bulldozer equipment, excavation equipment, hydraulic  drive for operating equipment, and a set of engineer equipment  and supplies (motorized drill, heat drill, explosive charges).    The machine's design, the composition of its operating  equipment, and the set of engineer equipment and supplies make  it possible to dig ditches and trenches in category I-IV soil,  lay cross-country routes in brush and over unpacked snow, and  clear lanes in roadblocks of rock or rubble.    The ADZM can be transported in the cargo compartments of  IL-76 aircraft, MI-26 helicopters, and also suspended externally  from these helicopters.

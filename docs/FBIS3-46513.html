In meeting with  representatives of those organizations, the delegation called on  them to "prevent the recurrence of the accident" and "change a  flying course to prevent U.S. military helicopters from flying  over residential areas."    In response, each representative said: "We will make all-out  efforts to prevent the recurrence of the accident." However, in  reply to the delegation's call for a change of the flying  course, Lieutenant Colonel Charles R. Steed [as published], who  is chief of the government-related affairs section of the USFJ  Headquarters, said "Okinawa is so small that it is impossible to  avoid flying over the residential area," thus indicating change  of the flying route is impossible. He said the cause of the  accident is "under investigation," stressing "we will do our  utmost to prevent the recurrence of accidents from now on."    Nobukatsu Kanehara, principal deputy director of the  National  Security Affairs Division under the North American Affairs  Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, said: "We have called on the  U.S. military to prevent the recurrence of the accident and take  safety measures." Tadayuki Nakada, director of Compensation and  Operation Division of the General Affairs Department under the  DFAA, said: "The DFAA cannot make any direct petitions to the  U.S. forces."</p>

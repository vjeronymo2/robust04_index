Will  Russia Get Back Billions of Dollars from Arms Exports?"]    [Text] A session of the Russian Federation State Committee  for the Defense Sectors of Industry [Goskomoboronprom] Collegium  was held last week. The main question being the results of  exports of arms, military hardware, and civilian output from the  military-industrial complex, and the prospects for the future.  Unprecedentedly, in addition to the committee leadership,  leading Russian weapons designers, and directors of the major  weapons manufacturing enterprises, journalists too were invited  to the collegium session, which would recently have been  considered secret. Oleg Nikiforov, head of the Goskomoboronprom  Main Directorate for Foreign Economic Activity, delivered the  report. According to him, arms exports are today becoming a  top-priority for military-industrial complex enterprises since,  following the drastic reduction in Defense Ministry orders,  defense sectors derive money for conversion and internal needs  mainly from exports.    In 1993 representatives of the aviation, radio,  missile-space, and shipbuilding industries operated most  successfully on the foreign arms market. There was a decline in  arms industry indicators as well as munitions and special  chemicals. Over the year Goskomoboronprom delegations went to  31 countries for talks on arms exports and 186 meetings were  held in Moscow, as a result of which a number of protocols and  agreements were signed and licenses issued granting the right to  trade with 26 countries (there were previously 47 of these  countries) worth 40 percent more than in 1992. The largest  customers for Russian Goskomoboronprom military and civil  equipment were Hungary, India, China, Iran, the United Arab  Emirates [UAE], Syria, and Turkey. Some $543 million were  received for exports of civilian output (88.4 percent of the  1992 level), which amounts to one-fourth of total export  revenue. It is forecast that in 1994 total Russian revenue via  the Goskomoboronprom will rise to $4 billion.    It was particularly emphasized that last year Russia  succeeded in making a mighty breakthrough in an area previously  closed to it -- arms fairs -- and exhibited military-industrial  complex output in a number of countries -- from West Europe to  the Persian Gulf and Southeast Asia. According to Nikiforov,  all this gives reason to hope that the situation will gradually  start to improve over the next few years following the collapse  in 1992 and the lack of decline in 1993.    However, in subsequent speeches by a number of general  designers and directors of military-industrial complex  enterprises some doubts were voiced over such an optimistic  forecast. Regrettably, not everything depends on development  and production personnel. According to General Designer Arkadiy  Shipunov, in arms exports Russia is at the moment living off its  old achievements. However, compared with previous years  research and development funding dropped by a factor of 10-15  and in five years the country runs the risk of finding itself  unable to offer anything new. "For instance, we recently held  talks with one country and they told us bluntly: We will only  buy things from you that we cannot find in the West. We have  increasingly few of these products," Shipunov said.    A second factor that has jeopardized Russian arms exports  is the accompanying switch to world prices of energy sources and  the rapid rise in the prime cost of military-industrial complex  output. The result is that, whereas previously goods were taken  by virtue of their relative cheapness, now they may be even more  costly than their Western counterparts.    A third factor is the extremely difficult situation that has  arisen with the production of munitions, the range of which is  steadily tending to decrease. It will soon be simply impossible  to produce some types of so-called artillery rounds in Russia.  And even the most state-of-the-art aircraft and ships cannot be  sold without ammunition and arms for the aircraft and ships.    The collegium repeatedly criticized the ill-conceived system  of customs duties and taxes, which has resulted in total  deductions sometimes exceeding the value of the output.    The extremely harsh criticism of certain leading military  manufacturers regarding the quality of their products is also  worthy of note. In particular, "Kurganmashzavod," which  supplies the UAE with infantry fighting vehicles, came in for  criticism: The Arabs recently complained about the quality of  the armor. The upshot being, in the opinion of the  Goskomoboronprom leadership that all future military-technical  cooperation with the Gulf countries may be in jeopardy. "We  made a considerable breakthrough in the UAE, but if we operate  like that, we will shortly not have a presence there,"  Goskomoboronprom Chairman Viktor Glukhikh said. "You realize  that it was not 'Kurganmashzavod' that made the breakthrough  into the Gulf, but the whole country. Boys from the Defense  Ministry worked in the desert till they dropped, dozens of  people held talks at various levels. But the plant has now  forgotten everything and is trying to earn a faster buck. I  realize that it is hard to tailor vehicles to specific Gulf  conditions, but we will not nonetheless permit this approach."    And there is another factor. Civilian output comprises  three-fourths of the total output of Russia's  military-industrial complex, while military output makes up the  remaining one-fourth. However, the ratio is reversed in exports  -- sales of weapons and military hardware account for 75 percent  of revenue. That was why the committee's deputy chairman,  Gennadiy Yanpolskiy, said that one of the main tasks for 1994 is  to bring "nonmilitary" output up to a competitive level.    In the opinion of the committee's specialists, major state  support is needed in order for the planned escape from the  crisis in exports of arms and military hardware to be feasible.  Measures proposed include adopting programs for Russian  military cooperation with foreign countries and foreign economic  activity in the sphere of civilian output, providing export  incentives by creating attractive terms in the spheres of  finance, credit, tax, customs, investment, and price, and  simplifying the system for exports of spare parts. And,  importantly, it is finally time to give military-industrial  complex enterprises the right to autonomously export arms and  military hardware that is manufactured over and above the state  order.    One last point. In our view, it would be a good thing for  certain other departments, the Defense Ministry in particular,  which has shrouded itself in a tight veil of secrecy, to learn  from the Goskomoboronprom's openness. However, practice shows  that trivial breaches of the law and departmental anarchy often  lurk behind this veil. In spite of everything, secret Defense  Ministry materials vanish westward, not to mention the strictly  internal information that floods into newspapers like grain from  a holey sack.</p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> REMELMEYER, CITIZEN OF YEAR, COMES HOME FROM HOSPITAL  </P> <P> Retired Torrance City Atty. Stanley E. Remelmeyer had two things to celebrate  on Saturday: getting out of the hospital and winning the Torrance Area Chamber  of Commerce's Distinguished Citizen of the Year Award.  </P> <P> Remelmeyer, who had open heart surgery at Torrance Memorial Hospital Medical  Center on May 26, said in a brief telephone interview Saturday that he felt  unwell last week and re-entered the hospital Wednesday.  </P> <P> He said doctors removed fluid from his chest cavity, and by Saturday he was  feeling "much better" and expected to go home. Hospital officials said  Remelmeyer was discharged Saturday afternoon.  </P> <P> The 71-year-old Remelmeyer just missed being able to accept the Chamber of  Commerce award Friday evening. He said his wife, Becky, accepted it for him at  a banquet at the Torrance Marriott.  </P> <P> Known as the dean of South Bay city attorneys, Remelmeyer served as Torrance  city attorney for 32 years. He is regarded as a major influence in Torrance's  development from a small town into the fourth-largest city in the county. He  continues to serve as a legal consultant to the city.  </P> <P> The Chamber of Commerce chose to honor Remelmeyer because of his "significant  achievements" on behalf of the community, including volunteer service for the  American Red Cross, said Ida Aube, the chamber's economic and community  development manager.  </P> <P> Also honored by the chamber were Cherryl Liddle, who helped raise $2.9 million  for United Way, and John Alter, who was honored for volunteer service to the  chamber.  </P> <P> Remelmeyer retired from the city of Torrance in November, and in May was  appointed interim city attorney for Hermosa Beach. Just two weeks later, he  suffered chest pains while attending a political fund-raiser in San Pedro and  later underwent triple bypass surgery.  </P> <P> On Saturday, Remelmeyer said he was pleased to to win the chamber honor on  Friday and "to go home today."  </P></p>

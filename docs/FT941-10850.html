			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / African obsequies French and African leaders yesterday bade farewell to President Felix Houphouet-Boigny of Ivory Coast, whose death marks the eclipse of France's special relationship with its former colonies, Reuter reports from Yamoussoukro. Huge crowds gathered at the basilica in Yamoussoukro where the requiem mass began two hours late. French President Francois Mitterrand arrived late, as did many of the African leaders who came to pay their last respects.</p>

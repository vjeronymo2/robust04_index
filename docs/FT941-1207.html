			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / French students in clashes over pay Tens of thousands of students marched through Paris yesterday in a display of opposition to a youth wage law, which has become a thorn in the government's side. More than 30,000 students were watched by some 2,500 police in riot gear and another 800 in plain clothes, after Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister, warned that any repetition of the looting on recent marches would be punished. However, several hundred demonstrators started throwing stones at police, who responded with a baton charge and tear gas. The march followed a night of clashes in Nantes, where a protest turned vicious when protesters hurled petrol bombs at police. Several thousand students also demonstrated in Bordeaux and St Etienne yesterday against the government's move to allow employers the freedom to pay young workers less than the minimum wage provided they provide some training. Students, backed by trade unions and left-wing politicians, have been calling for Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to withdraw completely his youth wage law, ever since it was published in decree form last month. Mr Balladur has modified it slightly to take account of complaints by graduates that their qualifications were being ignored in the pay provisions and also to tighten the definition of training under the law. The prime minister now appears to be standing firm, with his interior and education ministers warning students to stay off the streets. Protest and affray, Page 9</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Healthcare insurers prepare for a shock to the system - Richard Waters previews a US medical revolution RUNNING a health insurance company used to be a simple business: you raised premiums each year to match escalating medical costs, and processed mountains of claims. Not any more. Even before President Bill Clinton's planned healthcare revolution, to be unveiled tonight, the largest US health insurers have been going through a quiet revolution of their own. For those that can stay the course after the shock to the system delivered by the president's plan, that process is likely to accelerate. Insurers, whose escalating premiums are for most Americans the clearest sign of a medical system out of control, have long been regarded as the villains of the US healthcare industry. That popular perception, they claim, has made them an easy target for politicians. The Clinton plan will effectively take control of underwriting away from health insurers. According to an early draft of the plan, premium increases will be controlled by a new National Health Board. Insurers would also lose the power to refuse cover to people they consider to be bad risks, or even to charge them a higher premium. The president's plan envisages a return to 'community rating', a system of assessing insurance premiums which insurers have turned their backs on in the past 20 years. This requires good and bad risks to be pooled, with a single premium. Deprived of control over their pricing and underwriting, the Clinton plan would force the health insurers to look again at their costs, continuing the restructuring that has already been under way. The attack on costs has already turned the big health insurers increasingly into medical delivery companies. This involves them in everything from making on-site inspections of hospital procedures and providing second opinions on medical conditions, to contracting directly with networks of hospitals and doctors to establish health care networks for their customers. In this, they have been responding in part to the health maintenance organisations (HMOs) and other managed care providers who have made big inroads into US healthcare. Since the beginning of the 1970s, the number of people covered by managed care arrangements has grown from less than 10m to nearly 90m, rivalling the numbers covered under traditional indemnity insurance plans. Cigna and Aetna have moved faster in this direction than the three other 'big five' health insurers - Prudential, Travelers and Met Life. Aetna, for instance, provides health insurance to 12m people of whom 3.1m are in managed care arrangements such as HMOs (which provide healthcare services for a fixed annual payment) and preferred provider organisations (or PPOs, networks offering a discount to cover a large group of people). For the other 8.9m people, Aetna has been striving to hold costs down by reviewing medical procedures and getting second opinions. The result has been an increase in overhead costs, but falling payments to providers. 'For every Dollars 1 you spend, you save between Dollars 4 and Dollars 10,' says Mr Will Jones, a director of Aetna's health insurance business. The move into managed care, combined with three years of sharply rising premiums and slowing inflation in healthcare costs, has made health insurance a profitable business again after losses for much of the 1980s. Cigna will make operating profits of Dollars 400m from the business this year, compared with Dollars 275m at Aetna, estimates Mr Western Hicks, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. At a time when their property/casualty operations are struggling to make a profit, such earnings are bailing out some of the biggest insurance groups. The regional health alliances, through which all consumers will end up buying cover, will recommend only a handful of plans in their area: getting on this list will make the difference between securing a large local market and losing out altogether (only companies employing more than 5,000 will be able to buy cover outside the alliances, providing too narrow a market to support many local providers of health plans). The big insurers, which tend to be thinly spread, could yet be squeezed out of many areas by local HMOs and Blue Cross/Blue Service plans. A large local market share gives a managed care organisation more clout to negotiate with providers, says Mr David Koppe, treasurer of United Healthcare, an HMO which covers 2.3m people. United, one of the largest HMOs, has concentrated on being one of the two biggest providers in the 18 cities in which it operates. In this business, the big insurers have a long way to go. 'We don't feel the competition is from the large insurance companies,' says Mr Koppe.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by A.B.S. Jafri] </F>   [Text] Pakistan and the United States have expressed their  full support for global and regional efforts to prevent  proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the missiles  capable of delivering them. In a joint statement issued in  Islamabad today at the end of the visit of U.S. Deputy Secretary  of State Mr. Strobe Talbott, the two countries supported the  early convening of multilateral talks on arms control,  nonproliferation, and security in South Asia. The joint  statement says Pakistan supported the objectives underlying the  proposal, especially regional and global nonproliferation.  However, the two sides agreed to continue discussions so as to  develop an approach acceptable for both sides. Meanwhile, the  foreign secretary, Mr. Najmuddin Sheikh, said there was no  question of an agreement on nuclear nonproliferation, but  discussions will continue in order to arrive at a mutually  agreed approach. He said Pakistan explained its stand and  position on the nuclear issue and Mr. Talbott had [word  indistinct] a much clearer understanding about Pakistan's  position.    The most notable outcome of the talks between Mr. Talbott  and  Pakistani leaders in Islamabad during the last two days is that  both sides appeared to be satisfied. What the U.S. official  described as the cluster of issues discussed included the  suspended sale of F-16 aircraft and a capping, reducing, and  eventual elimination of weapons of mass destruction in South  Asian subcontinent. The wide-ranging discussions were  attributed by Mr. Talbott to what he called the multidimensional  relationship between the United States and Pakistan. Mr.  Talbott has emphasized that the United States wants the best of  relations with Pakistan on the issue of nonproliferation of  nuclear weapons in South Asia, which is a major concern of the  United States. Mr. Tabott told to Pakistan side the United  States fully realized that Pakistan was not going to accept any  initiative unless it served the security interests of the  country. The United States, he assured, respected this concern  and its initiative will be aimed at promoting security.    Knowledgeable sources in the Pakistan capital are describing  the talks as positive and productive. The Government of  Pakistan agrees that further consideration of the U.S.  initiative should be carried on through normal diplomatic  channels. Mr. Talbott has (?taken some pains) to dispel the  apprehension that the United States might apply pressure on  Pakistan to obtain its acceptance of the Washington line on  nuclear nonproliferation in South Asia. He clearly told newsmen  here that there was no question of any pressurization of any  kind. Official circles in Islamabad have noted that the United  States remains interested in promoting a regional approach to  the security concern of the South Asian nations. Pakistan, for  its part, welcomes any move which is essentially fair,  even-handed, and equitable. This principle would apply to all  issues, including nuclear nonproliferation, sale of defense  equipment, Kashmir, and other issues which call for settlement.  A regional approach to contentious issues holds better promise  of success.    It is now apparent that the United States understands  Pakistan's stance better as a result of Mr. Talbott's talks with  the leaders in Islamabad. The issues under discussion have not  been finally settled or resolved. What these exchanges have  contributed is a much clearer appreciation of each other's  position. For instance, the United States now says it is not  insisting on any rolling back of Pakistan's nuclear program.  This clear statement is seen in Islamabad as acceptance of  Pakistan's point of view. There is good reason to see this as  progress in the right direction. Two days of talks on matters  of profound complexity are not expected to produce instant  results, and no instant results were either sought nor have  concrete results been achieved. What he has said and (?will be)  accomplished is clearing of the atmosphere of some doubt; some  feeling that the United States was unable to sympathize with  Pakistan's sensitivities. Mr. Talbott's exposition of the  United States policies in South Asia has produced the positive  conditions needed for progress in the right direction.</p>

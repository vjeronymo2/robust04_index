			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISANDROSY AND MILLS COLLEGE STUDENTS' BATTLE TO BAR MEN  </P> <P> Arnold gives misogyny a bad name. His raving attack on the Mills students --  and all women -- is a good example of why Mills students want to keep their  school the way it is -- distinct and independent.  </P> <P> It is obvious that what they want at Mills is "their own space." It has nothing  to do with man-hating or hating of anyone else. And if it did, that's their  business!  </P> <P> When I attended Cal Berkeley and visited friends at Mills, there never was any  hatred evident. And Arnold complains of the notion that men are perceived to be  "good (only) for making money." But Michael Milken, Ivan Boesky, Ronald Reagan  and Charles Keating didn't come from Mills, did they, Father?  </P> <P> ANDREW LIBERMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

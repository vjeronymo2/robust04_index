			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas (Mexico), 5 Jan (EFE) --  Today, several Social Security workers confirmed to EFE that  some 1,000 rebels of the Zapatist National Liberation Army  [EZLN] are still occupying the city of Guadalupe Tepeya, located  only 800 meters from the Guatemalan border.    The workers, who traveled from Guadalupe Tepeya to San  Cristobal de las Casas today, said that the rebels have mined  the road leading to Guadalupe Tepeya and kidnapped 100  civilians. The informants could not state whether there are any  members of the Public Forces among the hostages. The workers  added that the residents of Guadalupe Tepeya had noticed some  unusual activity since 19 December, and that in the last hours  the power lines were sabotaged.    Thus far there are no reports of confrontations between the  Army and the rebels in that area of the Mexican State of  Chiapas. Guadalupe might be the only city that remains occupied  by the EZLN, following its declaration of war on the Mexican  Government on 1 January.    Meanwhile, some fighting is still being reported in the  neighborhood of Ocosingo as well as bombings on the outskirts of  San Cristobal de las Casas. A radio station commentator said  that the Mexican Army bombed three vehicles with 16 reporters  that were heading to the combat zone near San Cristobal de las  Casas, but the reporters escaped unharmed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A meeting was held at the Ministry of Planning and  Development today with a number of the ambassadors to our  country from fraternal and friendly states, as well as officials  from certain international organizations.    Mutahhar 'Abdallah al-Sa'idi, deputy minister of planning  and  development, spoke at the meeting about the emergency needs  faced by the country in the fields of health, water, sewage,  electricity, and education that have resulted from the military  operations carried out by the secessionist clique in the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP] leadership. He said many of these  facilities were damaged during these military operations.    He also spoke about the pressing need to extend urgent aid,  food and shelters to the citizens who were harmed during that  period.    'Awni al-'Ani, representative of the UN program in Sanaa,  spoke during the meeting. He stressed the urgent need for this  aid, hoping that these states will cooperate, either directly,  or within the framework of the United Nations, to extend the  necessary aid. He noted that committees to assess damages will  begin their work as soon as possible to determine the actual  needs.    The under secretary of the Public Health Ministry attended  the meeting.</p>

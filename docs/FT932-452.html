			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / MP urges refit work for Swan Hunter THE GOVERNMENT's promise last week to Rosyth naval dockyard of 12 years' work on warship refits yesterday prompted a call for a guaranteed programme of work for Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership. Mr Nick Brown, Labour MP for Newcastle East, last night tabled Commons questions urging the award to Swan Hunter of a core programme of refits. Mr Brown said the promise to the Scottish yard of warship work until 2005 had signalled a 'substantial change in what we understood the marketplace to be'. He added: 'If it's ideologically sound for Devonport and Rosyth to have core programmes promised, then it must be right for Tyneside.' Mr Brown said he was not calling for a large programme for Swan Hunter, but for a 'statement of faith' in it from the government. Three refits are due to be offered for tender this year or early next year, he said. Awarding these now to Swan Hunter would be a lifeline, he added. Reacting to Mr Brown's call, the Ministry of Defence said that last week's announcement for Rosyth and Devonport was made to confirm the future of the two dockyards. 'We are running the defence of the realm, not a business of trying to ensure the future of warship yards,' the department said.</p>

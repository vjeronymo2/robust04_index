			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / People: Finance moves Roger Barton, managing director of business development at the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, yesterday announced he will be leaving LIFFE in the near future. The date of his departure has not yet been set. 'I decided that, after an enjoyable career at LIFFE, I needed to move on to a fresh start,' 39-year-old Barton said. He explained that he intended to find a related position in the securities industry, before adding that 'there's nothing quite like LIFFE'. Barton has been with the exchange for 12 years, masterminding the launch of several of its products, including the Euroswiss futures contract, the BTP futures and option contract, the Eurolira future and the Ecu future. His position will not be filled directly, but his areas of responsibility will be divided among members of the business development department, said Daniel Hodson, LIFFE's chief executive. Philip Bruce will be put in charge of strategic business development, while Ralf Herklotz will be responsible for developing interest rate products. Karin Forseke will remain in charge of equity products, he said.</p>

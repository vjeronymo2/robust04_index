			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Home and away: Refugees and other displaced people pose a growing problem Every single day in 1992 nearly 10,000 people around the world were forced to leave their countries, bringing the total number of refugees to 18.2m by the beginning of this year. An even larger number - at least 24m - have been forcibly displaced without technically becoming refugees, since they are still inside their own country's borders. Add the two figures together and you get the population of a fair-sized country. The de facto ruler of that country is the UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR), Mrs Sadako Ogata. The size of her 'government' has doubled since 1989. At last count she had a staff of 3,703 people - 810 at her Geneva headquarters, 2,893 deployed in 106 countries across the world - administering a budget of Dollars 1.4bn. UNHCR's finances are almost as precarious as those of the people it is trying to help. Less than 5 per cent of its annual expenditures are covered by the UN regular budget. All the rest comes from voluntary contributions, mainly from national governments. Every new emergency triggers an appeal for funds. This system has its merits: it decreases the risk of UNHCR developing into a large permanent bureaucracy with little to do, as has happened with some of the UN's more autonomous specialised agencies. But it does make it very directly dependent on the goodwill of the main donor governments, whose priorities do not necessarily coincide with the interests of the refugees. Partly for this reason, there has been a marked shift in UNHCR's emphasis over the last three years. In the past its main focus was on the right of asylum. Now it has broadened its approach. Both in northern Iraq and in the former Yugoslavia it found itself supporting displaced people within their country of origin in an effort to prevent them from becoming refugees, at least in the technical sense. Drawing on those experiences it has devoted more and more resources to preventive work, seeking to identify root causes of refugee problems, to be better prepared to cope with them and, where possible, to propose solutions. In short, from a lobbying-cum-placement-agency it has developed into something close to a full-fledged government, supplying its clients with a full range of services and dealing with other governments on their behalf. The report Mrs Ogata published yesterday on 'the state of the world's refugees'1, the first of its kind, is a kind of policy statement. Clearly she is right to draw attention to the causes of the problem and to advocate that as far as possible they be dealt with at source. Yet many independent observers are uneasy about the extent to which UNHCR is now taking on political tasks, and fear that it is failing in its traditional role of upholding the right of asylum. Prof Gil Loescher, for instance, a leading expert in the field who is himself a member of UNHCR's advisory board, nonetheless argues in a new book2 that 'UNHCR's dependence on voluntary contributions forces it to adopt policies that reflect the interests and priorities of the major donor countries'. He cites the example of aid levels per Afghan refugee during the 1980s, which were more than three times higher in pro-western Pakistan than in anti-western Iran; and the 1991 Gulf crisis, when international aid to Iraqi refugees in Iran was much lower than to those in Turkey and elsewhere. Similarly, it is clear that the operation in the former Yugoslavia, where nearly 4m people are now dependent on UNHCR relief, is in essence an exercise in containment, designed to keep those people where they are. Without it, at least a third of them would probably be spreading across Europe, doubling the number of asylum seekers. Yet even as it is, west European governments are spending an estimated Dollars 7bn a year on processing asylum applications. Western Europe is becoming a fortress, guarded by a moat of impoverished but 'safe' countries which asylum seekers have to pass through, and to which, under currently prevailing doctrine, they can therefore be sent back unexamined. UNHCR is critical of this policy, but its criticism is muted by the need to retain support of donor governments. Meanwhile, as Barbara Harrell-Bond, director of the Refugee Studies programme at Oxford, points out in the latest issue of War Report3, the relief programmes in host countries like Slovenia and Croatia are based on a model 'which serves to marginalise refugees and displaced persons as dependent minorities'. They inevitably become the object of growing resentment among the indigenous population, rather than being encouraged to support themselves and make a useful contribution to the host economies. It is true that host governments prefer this model, hoping it will encourage the refugees to go home as soon as possible. But they may well be mistaken about this. According to Ms Harrell-Bond: 'Experience suggests that the first people able to return home are those who have succeeded in securing themselves and in saving up for rebuilding their lives on their return.' They are going back in Cambodia, Afghanistan and Mozambique, where cold-war-related conflicts have been or are being resolved. But where conflicts reflect ethnic divisions, as is more and more often the case, the chances of restoring ethnically mixed populations to their homes are much slimmer. We have to face the fact that many refugees will never be able to return. They must be allowed to find new homes, and helped to rebuild their lives in a new homeland. 1Penguin, Pounds 8.99/Dollars 14. 2Beyond Charity, Oxford, Pounds 25/Dollars 35. 3Bulletin of the Institute for War &amp; Peace Reporting, 1 Auckland Street, London SE11</p>

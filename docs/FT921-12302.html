			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Facing down the telephone cartel A BLIND SPOT in the UK government's largely enlightened telecommunications policy has been its failure to introduce competition in international communications. Last year's White Paper abolished the BT/Mercury Communications duopoly for domestic communications but did not open the door to competition for carrying international calls. Ministers' intentions to open up the international market to 're-sellers' - which lease telecommunications capacity in bulk and then sell it on to customers - will go some way to remedy this defect. But the government's inclination not to allow competitors to build their own networks is disappointing. The recent licence application by Sprint, the third largest US long-distance telecommunications carrier, will put this policy to the test. The market for international calls, where cartel practices keep call charges at about three times costs, is more in need of competition than any other part of the telecommunications sector. Even in the UK, competition between Mercury and BT has had only a modest success in bringing prices down. Although re-sale would exert further downward pressure on prices, this is likely to benefit only large business customers. Full network competition, on the other hand, would bring benefits to the whole economy, as well as exerting downward pressure on underlying costs. The construction of more fibre-optic cables landing in Britain would also enhance the UK's position as Europe's telecommunications hub. Paradoxically it is the industry's cartel practices which make it difficult for the government to open up the market. But doing nothing will only serve to delay the cartel's demise. Closed markets One concern is that most foreign telecommunications markets are closed to British companies. Rather than use this as an excuse, ministers' response could be to award licences to those companies which are not able to rig competition by relying on unfair advantages at home. Some argue that no foreign governments would pass this test because no market is fully open. Even the US - and therefore Sprint  - would be barred because it imposes a heavier regulatory burden on foreign telephone operators than on US ones. Such a purist attitude would be a recipe for stagnation. It takes no account of the fact that the US has recently agreed to change these regulations. It also ignores the fact that foreign companies are able to operate in the US, as shown by Cable and Wireless's long distance network and BT's US-based Syncordia venture which aims to sign up multinational business customers. Distorting competition Another concern is that granting a foreign telephone company an international licence might distort competition in the UK. This is principally because of the arcane accounting rate system which determines how much telephone companies in one country pay their counterparts in other countries for delivering international calls. The particular fear is that the foreign company would discriminate in favour of its UK affiliate by charging it less for delivering calls from Britain than it charges BT and Mercury, and by giving its affiliate all its international traffic to deliver in the UK, bypassing the British operators. Again, although such fears have some validity, the response should not be a blanket ban on new network competition. It is possible to imagine a range of different safeguards to prevent foreign companies distorting competition in the UK. Some have already been pioneered in the US market, such as requiring all international operators to agree the same accounting rates in dealing with foreign carriers to guard against discrimination. The government should therefore award full network licences to any applicants which can show that they will not distort competition. Rather than being defeatist in the face of cartel practices, it should use its imagination to open up a part of the market which is crying out for competition.</p>

			<p>Inspections   <F P=102>   SK2103043694 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0419 GMT 21 Mar 94 </F> <F P=103> SK2103043694 </F> <F P=104>  Pyongyang KCNA </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement of DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman on U.S. </F> Perfidy" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, March 21 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement today clarifying the  position of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea toward the  United States' perfidious act of reversing the agreed  conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York.    The statement reads:    The United States has committed a perfidious act by totally  reversing the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S.  contact on February 25 in New York.    As is known, the DPRK and the United States at the New York  contact on February 25 agreed upon four immediate steps of  simultaneous action for a package solution to the nuclear issue  -- suspension of the Team Spirit 94 joint military maneuvers,  resumption of the working-level contact for the exchange of  presidential envoys between the North and South, acceptance of  an inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  for maintaining the continuity of safeguards holding of the  third round of the DPRK-USA talks in Geneva on March 21.    The agreement on these steps of simultaneous actions marked  an important occasion in bringing back to its track the  detracted process of a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue.    Out of our sincere desire to achieve a negotiated solution  to  the nuclear issue at any cost, we have honestly fulfilled our  obligations pursuant to the agreed conclusions.    We accepted the IAEA inspectors' group at the designated  date  and sincerely provided them with all conditions so that they  could conduct inspection activities of enough scope for  maintaining the continuity of safeguards at the seven declared  facilities.    Even when the IAEA side rudely requested sampling and  measurement that go far beyond the agreed scope for the  continuity of safeguards, we met its demand as much as possible,  showing our utmost good will.    We have held several rounds of working-level contact with  the  South side and made every effort possible for an early exchange  of special envoys between the North and South, proposing  detailed ways and reasonable measures. The U.S. side, however,  has fulfilled none of its obligations, making empty talk since  the publication of the New York agreement of February 25.    Although the United States announced suspension of the Team  Spirit 94 joint military exercises and the date of the opening  of the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, it unreasonably made them  conditional, saying that it would keep that promise only after  the inspection by the IAEA had been made satisfactorily and the  special envoys exchanged between the North and South.    This was a violation of the New York agreement based on the  principle of simultaneous action.    The United States has gone so far as to break the New York  agreement on the steps of simultaneous action, alleging that the  IAEA's inspection of the DPRK's nuclear facilities was not  satisfactory and the exchange of presidential envoys between the  North and South has not been realised.    The United States threatens that if the DPRK does not allow  inspection by the IAEA and does not realise the exchange of  special envoys between the North and South, it will resume the  Team Spirit joint military exercises in 1994, will not have the  third round of DPRK-U.S. talks and will transfer the problem of  the DPRK to the United Nations Security Council.    In the meantime, the secretariat of the IAEA is going to  convene a meeting of the Board of Governors to adopt a  "resolution" against the DPRK.    Thus, the United States has openly reversed the New York  agreement and totally destroyed the foundation for the third  round of talks, darkening the prospect of the settlement of the  nuclear issue, at this crucial moment when its settlement is in  sight. This is motivated by its consistent hostile policy  toward the DPRK.    It is obvious that the United States set unreasonable  preconditions which are not specified in the New York agreement  because they sought from the beginning the political purpose of  stifling the DPRK, not a solution to the nuclear issue through  DPRK- U.S. talks.    The United States is distorting the fact, claiming that  their  unreasonable preconditions were included in the agreement with  the DPRK. But they had been refuted by the DPRK's reasonable  argument at the time of the discussion of the New York agreement.    Even after the publication of the agreed conclusions, they  are insisting on the unilateral preconditions rejected by the  DPRK. This cannot be construed otherwise than a deliberate  scheme to break the New York agreement and create a phase of  confrontation.    In actuality, the United States is playing first fiddle in  an  international campaign for putting pressure on the DPRK, openly  revealing its intention to stage the team spirit 94 joint  military maneuvers and let the U.N. Security Council take  "sanctions" against the DPRK on the pretext of the problems in  the IAEA's inspection and the exchange of special envoys between  the North and South.    All the facts clearly prove that the United States has  neither the intention to continue talks nor the will to solve  the nuclear issue but only schemes to isolate and stifle the  DPRK with the nuclear issue and the DPRK-U.S. talks as an  expedient.    This perfidious act of the United States is creating a grave  situation on the Korean peninsula, which may bring the Korean  nation back to the phase of confrontation and war.    Now that the United States has broken the New York agreement  and brought the DPRK-U.S. talks to a rupture, leading the  situation to the extreme pitch of strain, we can no longer  unilaterally fulfil our obligations concerning the steps of  simultaneous action.    Therefore, we have decided not to send our delegation to the  third round of DPRK-U.S. talks.    Since the United States and the IAEA are deliberately  distorting the results of the recent inspection for the  continuity of safeguards and using it as a pretext for putting  pressure on the DPRK, we will no longer deem it our obligation  to ensure the continuity of safeguards.    This measure of ours accords with the principle of the New  York agreement of February 25, which stipulates that the  fulfilment of each simultaneous action agreed upon is necessary  for the implementation of all the agreed conclusions.    Unshakable and consistent is our position that we are not  bound by our promise with the United States once the latter  breaks its promise with us.    The DPRK Government in its statement dated March 12 last  year  said that our declared withdrawal from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) was caused mainly by the U.S.  nuclear threat to the DPRK, including the Team Spirit joint  military exercises, and its policy of stifling the DPRK and the  partiality of the IAEA.    In the DPRK-U.S. joint statement of June 11, 1993 in New  York, we made it clear that we would unilaterally and  temporarily suspend the effectuation of our withdrawal from the  NPT, on condition that the DPRK-U.S. talks for a solution to the  nuclear issue continued.    If the United States avoids the DPRK-U.S. talks and  increases  nuclear threat to the DPRK, resuming the team spirit joint  military exercises in 1994, and if the IAEA widens its  partiality and resorts to strong-arm politics and pressure,  distorting the results of the recent inspection of the DPRK  nuclear facilities, we have no alternative but to carry into  practice the measures declared in the DPRK Government's  statement of March 12 last year in order to defend the  sovereignty of the nation and the security of the state.    Even if the settlement of the nuclear issue is delayed  because of the failure of the DPRK-U.S. talks, we are not in a  hurry at all.    The United States must ponder over the prevailing situation,  looking straight at its seriousness.</p>

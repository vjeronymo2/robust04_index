			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RELIEVER HOWELL UNDERGOES KNEE SURGERY;  </P> <P> DODGERS: TORN CARTILAGE WILL SIDELINE THE BULLPEN ACE FOR AT LEAST THREE WEEKS.  DODGERS OPEN SERIES WITH THE CARDINALS TONIGHT.  </P> <P> The Dodgers bullpen lost its heart and saves Monday with the announcement that  relief pitcher Jay Howell will miss at least three weeks because of  arthroscopic knee surgery.  </P> <P> Howell, who recorded 78% of the team's saves last season with a club-record 28,  was diagnosed as having a partial tear in cartilage in his left knee.  </P> <P> He will undergo surgery this morning and has been placed on the 21-day disabled  list, although he could be out longer.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't be surprised to see him pitch within a month," said Dr. Frank Jobe,  Dodger medical director. "It's not a real bad problem. It's not the whole  cartilage, just a little tear. We can cut it back and he can come back and not  even know anything had ever happen."  </P> <P> Tennis star Ivan Lendl had similar surgery and was back on the court within  three weeks, according to Jobe.  </P> <P> However, the injury is serious for a pitcher because of the use of the legs in  delivering the pitch.  </P> <P> Howell, who said the knee had been bothering him late last season, was given a  cortisone shot in spring training.  </P> <P> But the knee did not respond.  </P> <P> On Monday morning, the team's first off day this season, he underwent a  Magnetic Resonancy Imaging exam that revealed the tear.  </P> <P> "The knee does not affect me pitching-wise," Howell said Sunday afternoon  before the exam, even though he had allowed two runs in the ninth inning that  cost the Dodgers a lead and thegame Saturday night against Houston.  </P> <P> "But it hurts all the time, and I can't do any conditioning exercises," Howell  added. "It's been bothering me long enough (to) where I want to get it fixed."  </P> <P> According to the Dodgers, Howell was unavailable for comment Monday.  </P> <P> He is 1-1 with a 4.50 ERA in three appearances this season after missing the  first week with shoulder stiffness.  </P> <P> To replace Howell, the Dodgers will recall a player to be announced today from  triple-A Albuquerque.  </P> <P> He may not be a pitcher. The Dodgers already have 11 pitchers due to rosters  being expanded to 27 players because of the spring training lockout. A better  guess might be middle infielder Jose Vizcaino.  </P> <P> Howell's loss leaves the bullpen, which has already contributed to half of the  team's six losses, with the following:  </P> <P>  -- Two rookies, Mike Munoz and Mike Hartley, who have yet to record a  big-league save.  </P> <P>  -- Three veterans, Tim Crews, Ray Searage and Don Aase, who entered this year  with a combined three saves in the last two seasons.  </P> <P>  -- One starting pitcher, John Wetteland, who has one career save and a 12.46  ERA in four games this season.  </P> <P> Which will take Howell's place? The Dodgers don't know any more than you.  </P> <P> The answer could be Jim Gott.  </P> <P> "Gott's role could be a significant one," said Fred Claire, Dodger executive  vice president.  </P> <P> Gott's surgically repaired right elbow is nearly ready to allow him to join the  active roster.  </P> <P> He will pitch his third simulated game either Wednesday or Thursday, and if he  is ready he likely will be sent to Class-A Bakersfield team for one or two  relief appearances.  </P> <P> That process could cover the next 10 days, during which the Dodgers will  probably attempt to work the hard-throwing Wetteland into the stopper role,  with help from Aase, who has one save this year.  </P> <P> After about 10 days, sources say, the Dodgers will examine Howell's recovery  and Gott's rehabilitation and determine their next move.  </P> <P> Only as a last resort will that move involve trading for a front-line relief  pitcher.  </P> <P> "I'll be looking, but a closer is not easy to find, and market price is high,"  Claire said. "I don't know if you can find more capable people than somebody  like Jim Gott, if he is healthy. Gott could make a very timely contribution."  </P> <P> Another club source put it differently.  </P> <P> "If we tried to get a stopper now, everyone would put a gun to our head. They  would all ask for Ramon Martinez and John Wetteland and (minor league  shortstop) Jose Offerman," said the source. "If this had happened in late  August and we were in a pennant race, it might be worth it. But right now, we  have time to let the smoke clear."  </P> <P> It's not a pretty picture for Howell, who at age 34 already has suffered  through elbow surgery and tendinitis in his forearm and, most recently, a stiff  shoulder.  </P> <P> If nothing else, the surgery will cut down on the Dodgers' frequent use of  Howell, who, because of his effectiveness, appeared in 56 games last season --  most since 1985.  </P> <P> "One of the causes of this is age," Jobe said. "As you get older, the cartilage  gets more brittle. The more you push down on the knee, the more likely it is  that something will get affected."  </P> <P> Tom Lasorda, Dodger manager, also was unavailable for comment.  </P></p>

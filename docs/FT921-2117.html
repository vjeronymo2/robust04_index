			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Appointments: Bucking the trend at Salomon Salomon Brothers, the investment house suffering from waves of defections after last summer's Treasury bond scandal, is congratulating itself on having lured a team from Continental Bank to set up an international structured arbitrage group based in London. The three, Richard Briffett, 44, Lee Resseguie, 44, and Christopher Warner, 28, previously made up Continental's London international treasury consulting group. Their combined expertise is very much in the tax and legal sphere, and they will be working on complicated cross-border transactions, particularly in the equity field. Salomon is keen to stress that they will in no way be acting as clients' tax advisers. Briffett, who set up the group at Continental in 1987, spent eight years with the Inland Revenue before joining Continental; Resseguie has worked as a tax attorney at Sara Lee Corporation and Atlantic Richfield; and Warner is a law graduate with a year at Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte. They are also a highly international bunch - British, American and Dutch respectively. Salomon is understood to have made the approach before the scandal hit, but negotiations were on hold for some months until the investment house was clearer about its future. Continental, however, plays down the Salomon 'coup', pointing out that it has severely cut down its own London operation. While the team left of its own accord, the US bank says it will not be replacing them. Meanwhile, Jeremy Bradburne, who resigned as Salomon Brothers International's chief financial officer some months ago, has surfaced at JP Morgan Securities also in the structured finance area. He joins as a managing director in the European capital markets division with responsibility for structured finance products.</p>

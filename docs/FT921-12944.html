			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Investment in Malaysia falls PROPOSALS to restrict the level of foreign participation and shareholdings have led to a large drop in the number of applications for manufacturing ventures in Malaysia. The value of inward investments last year fell by 52 per cent to MDollars 23.6bn (Dollars 8.7bn) from MDollars 48.8bn in 1990. Ms Rafidah Aziz, international trade and industry minister, attributed the drop to the unusually large number of investment applications in previous years and to the general climate of uncertainty facing foreign investors. Proposed investments with majority foreign shareholding dropped from MDollars 13.2bn in 1990 to MDollars 2bn last year, while those wholly foreign-owned fell from MDollars 13.7bn to MDollars 10.9bn. Last year, the Malaysian budget included tough qualifying rules and shareholding requirements for foreign investors and abolished tax holidays. Malaysia says the new rules are necessary to stem the deterioration in the national current account deficits, projected to reach 10 per cent or more of GNP.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Government pledge on market testing THE GOVERNMENT is determined to push ahead with its market-testing programme in the public sector, in spite of doubts about the legal framework for transferring employment protection undertakings to private industry, Mr William Waldegrave, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, told the IoD conference. He announced a fresh initiative to publicise the programme, involving regular publication from the summer of a market-testing contracts bulletin. This will announce the future programmes of all government departments, and all individual contracts as they are put out to tender. 'This bulletin will provide full information to companies who wish to compete in our market-testing programme, and will be of particular importance to smaller companies,' Mr Waldegrave said. 'The programme is moving forward, contracts are being let in-house and out-house, and will result in high standards in the service delivered and substantial savings to the taxpayer in the cost of delivery . . . It is a rolling programme which will continue to build on achievements year by year.' He said if the government did not win efficiency gains in the public sector comparable with those in private industry then the government share of gross domestic product would increase inexorably, whether or not new public sector commitments were taken on. In any modern democracy, Mr Waldegrave said, the government was always going to direct about 40 per cent of the national wealth because of spending on defence, welfare, education, science and health. What could not be shirked was responsibility for how that 40 per cent was managed.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / International Company News: BHF-Bank rises 24% to DM267m in 10 months Group operating profits at BHF-Bank rose almost 24 per cent to DM267m (Dollars 157m) in the first 10 months of 1993, the bank reported yesterday. Partial operating profits, which exclude results from own-account trading, climbed about 29 per cent to DM306m, it said in an interim report. While both figures showed modest advances on first-half results, published in August, provisions for bad debts were up sharply at DM132m compared with DM97m in the comparable part of 1992, and DM67m in the first six months of this year. Mr Wolfgang Strutz, senior partner, said there had been no spectacularly bad loan cases and that provisions had been increased as a result of the difficult economic environment and BHF's strict criteria for risk assessment. Provisions for the full year would probably reach DM160m, he added. Lending losses for 1993 would show 'hardly any increase worth noting' over 1992's 0.17 per cent of outstanding loans. In the period under review, interest earnings rose 15.7 per cent to DM516m, provision income was 14.5 per cent higher at DM284m, and the bank's assets increased more than 17 per cent to DM55bn.</p>

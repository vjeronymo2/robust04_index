			<p>BFN     [Text] A Foreign Ministry spokesman has termed the Saudi  authorities' prevention of the performance of the Disavowal of  Polytheists ceremony as breach of promise and condemned it.    Referring to the Oman agreement between the foreign  ministers  of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Saudi Arabia concerning the  marking of the Day of the Disavowal of Polytheists, the Foreign  Ministry spokesman said: Not only is disregarding that  agreement breaking a promise by the Saudi authorities;  preventing the Disavowal of Polytheists, while Muslims are being  subjected to oppression and injustice by infidels and  polytheists, has no political-ideological justification either.    Expressing deep regret about the preventive measures of the  Saudi authorities, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said such  actions are like raising objections and imposing restrictions on  the freedom of action of pilgrims of the House of God to perform  the political-ideological hajj rituals and an effort to render  the Abrahamite hajj meaningless.</p>

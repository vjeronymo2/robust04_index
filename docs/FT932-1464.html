			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading STOCK index futures traded in a 21-point range as bouts of profit-taking signalled a pause for breath after the recent advance, writes Joel Kibazo. Hopes of a base rate cut that have underpinned the recent rise appeared to fade yesterday and the September contract on the FT-SE 100, which opened at 2,941, drifted gently down on sporadic selling. Lingering hopes of a cut remain, however, and yesterday's economic data was taken to signify a reduction may still be possible. The day's low was reached just ahead of a poor opening on Wall Street. The premium to cash was gradually eroded throughout the session. September finished at 2,920, down 7 from its previous close and just three points ahead of its fair value premium to cash of 11 points. Volume just exceeded 9,000 contracts. In traded options, heavy dealing in the stock options led to a large total turnover of 39,122 contracts. BT saw 6,264 lots traded, with the November 460 calls particularly busy. It was followed by GEC with 3,409 contracts dealt. Kleinwort Benson was the main player in J. Sainsbury options, which were the third most actively traded with a total of 2,625. British Airways and Zeneca were also active. Just over 11,000 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100 Index option, but a mere 1,974 contracts were traded in the Euro Footsie option.</p>

However, They Should Not Be Reformed Indefinitely Either, the  State Duma Chairman Thinks"]    [Excerpts] [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Each country has its own  national security concept on the basis of which it organizes the  activity of its special services. Given that the Russian state  security agencies are being reformed for the sixth time in the  past two years, can one say that our national security concept  has changed six times?    [Rybkin] As for Russia, we do have a concept. Reform is  under way in the special services. Sometimes it is very  painful, unfortunately. They say correctly that there is  nothing more wasteful than reorganization. Special service  staffers are probably realizing that. This sphere is very  sensitive, so there is no need to go into particular detail  regarding this subject. Russia must be securely covered from  this flank regardless of political changes.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Each year our country is rocked by  conflicts between the branches of power. Not long ago, the mass  media carried reports about yet another coup allegedly designed  to remove President Boris Yeltsin from power. There have been  reports that this "version" was advantageous for some people in  the government. What can you say in that respect?    [Rybkin] What I have is information required for my work as  chairman of the State Duma. My main work today is the budget.  The country is living without a budget for 1994. That won't do  at all.    As for emergency scenarios. I think all of us have enough  powers to act within the framework of the law, and effectively  so, even in conditions of an all-encompassing crisis suffered by  the economy. But this is possible only when there is civil peace  in society. We must not let what happened on 4 October 1993  recur; 4 October was our common defeat.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] How realistic is the recurrence of  that situation?    [Rybkin] I think that given the collaboration between the  authorities that has currently been emerging, its chances are  nil. If, of course, the collaboration holds out. The president,  the chairman of the government, the chairmen of the State Duma  and the Federation Council, leaders of all prominent parties  that have been chosen by the voters, representatives of various  confessions and trade union leaders will sign an agreement on  civil peace. This is a condition for our moving ahead, for our  reform. [passage omitted]    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Let us recall the not so distant past.  Formidable KGB units were operating against a handful of  dissidents; now, when attempts to shake the Constitution loose  are being made all the time, this area of the special services'  work is being scaled down. Maybe it would make sense to give  the functions of protecting the Constitution back to the special  services?    [Rybkin] I would probably agree with you. Even what we have  does not work. The Constitutional Court at least operated in a  normal fashion...    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] So what is to be done? The  Constitutional Court is no longer in operation; the militia  combats terrorism, it has no time for other things. Who is  protecting us then?    [Rybkin] I do not want to be the special services' or the  militia's advocate. The protection of the constitutional order  is a multifaceted process, it must come to the attention of both  the special services and the Constitutional Court. Now we are  ready to pass the law on the Constitutional Court. It has  already been drawn up. All tensions between the Main Legal  Administration and the Constitutional Court have been  eliminated. The next meeting will consider these matters.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] You claim that the tensions have been  eliminated. This is a questionable statement. At a recent  press conference, Nikolay Vitruk, Constitutional Court member,  had complaints to make against the Main Legal Administration,  the Main Security Administration, and the Federal Agency of  Government Communications and Information. For instance, he  said that Mikhail Barsukov (Main Security Administration chief  -- editorial board) allegedly tapped all his telephones and that  no one could do anything about it.    [Rybkin] I approach this matter rather philosophically.  When I dealt with the economy, a man was sitting above my  office who was in charge of my communications, and he was  probably able to listen to my telephone conversations at any  moment. At present, this also accompanies me. He who installs  telephones can tap them, too. It is another matter that this  should be done in accordance with the law. I cannot bring such  charges against Barsukov, Ivanov, or Petrov. If someone is  tapping somebody, he must be doing so if state interests are at  stake, but such actions should be regulated by law. He who does  so without legitimate reasons is a criminal. But until I can  prove that he is a criminal, I do not have the right to accuse  him. [passage omitted]    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] As of today we have effectively no  special services. They have been "victimized." Professionals  have been abandoning them for commercial businesses. The only  real effective law-enforcement agency we have been left with is  the Internal Affairs Ministry. Do you agree?    [Rybkin] No, I do not. My view is not so pessimistic. It  is very regrettable that some professionals in the prime of  their career have found themselves out on the street. But you  should agree that the special services cannot be stretched  indefinitely. Presently we are parting with the past, the  differentiation of people is under way -- this is, naturally,  painful -- but necessary.    The sphere of the special services' activity is very  sensitive. The intelligence services of Great Britain, the  United States, France, Israel, and other countries are operating  both against us and against each other. But at the same time  they cooperate. We should forge a partnership, but carefully  so. I have Yevgeniy Primakov's (Foreign Intelligence Service  director -- editorial board) proposal sitting on my desk saying  that we should keep as much as to make our relations  "transparent," so that we will trust each other. What is  redundant may be cut. [passage omitted]    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] But it is our own authorities that are  beginning to slice and cut the special services, trying to fit  them into some models; as a result the new does not emerge, but  the old stops working...    [Rybkin] This is not an easy time. Everything is undergoing  reform, but reforms should be carried out so as to make them  less painful. People ought to find application for their  knowledge and talents.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Or, maybe, reform in the structures of  authorities should be temporarily suspended until we get back on  our feet economically?    [Rybkin] I think we should take into account the so-called  Parkinson's Law. The country has shrunk to one-half its former  size. But the number of bureaucrats has doubled. How should we  combat this trend? There are plenty of prescriptions: both  American experience and the experience of other countries. In  Russia, however, drawing on foreign experience is often  counterproductive. [passage omitted]</p>

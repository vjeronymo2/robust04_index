			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: The European bridgehead - Kevin Done discusses the runaway success of Japanese carmakers in the UK. Nissan has now won a Queen's award for three years in succession while Honda joins the ranks of winners for the first time Japanese carmakers have quickly established the UK as their main bridgehead in Europe and last year accounted for three of the top six places as UK car exporters. Nissan, which has now won the Queen's Award for Exports for three years in succession, emerged as the leading UK car exporter last year outstripping the traditional heavyweights of the motor industry in Britain, Rover group, Ford and Vauxhall. Honda has joined the ranks of export award winners for the first time, as production builds up at its plant at Swindon, Wiltshire. Its award this time, however, is largely based on exports of cars produced for it under licence at Rover's Longbridge, Birmingham assembly plant. Car output is also rising quickly at the Toyota car assembly plant at Burnaston, near Derby. By the second half of the 1990s Japanese carmakers will be accounting for around a third of UK car production. Nissan, which has the largest share of any Japanese carmaker both in the UK and in the overall western European new car markets, was the first Japanese producer to begin car production in Europe in 1986. By last year output at its Pounds 900m plant at Sunderland in north-east England, had jumped to 246,281 of which 74 per cent was exported, although production is forecast by the company to fall to between 200,000 and 240,000 this year. Nissan's car exports have climbed from 59,739 in 1990 to 112,700 in 1991, to 157,234 in 1992 and reached a peak of 182,207 last year. Exports accounted for around 90 per cent of output in both 1991 and 1992, when the UK market was in recession, but the export share fell last year, as demand picked up in the UK and markets weakened in continental Europe. Measured by the volume of car exports, Nissan moved ahead of the Rover group, a subsidiary of BMW of Germany, for the first time last year with shipments of 182,207 compared with the Rover group's 161,932. The Rover total included some Honda Concertos produced for the Japanese car maker under licence at Rover's Longbridge, Birmingham, plant. Trailing in the wake of these two groups were General Motors of the US with its Vauxhall and IBC Vehicles subsidiaries with car exports of 72,090, and the Ford group of the US with total car exports of 34,217. The Ford total included 22,999 Jaguars and only 11,218 cars exported under the Ford badge. Ford car exports, excluding Jaguar, have plunged under the impact of the recession in continental European new car markets falling from 120,178 in 1991 and 72,825 in 1992. The volume of exports of Ford-badged cars was overtaken last year by all three Japanese carmakers producing in the UK. Toyota car export volumes of 27,735 and Honda exports of 27,121 (excluding cars produced under licence by Rover) also exceeded exports by Peugeot Talbot, a former Queen's Export award winner. Peugeot's shipments of cars from the UK fell to 25,975 from 52,099 in 1992 and a peak of 83,591 in 1990. Honda and Toyota both began production in the UK at their own plants in late 1992, although the assembly of Honda-badged cars under licence by Rover in the UK began in 1986 with the export of such cars starting in 1987. Honda itself produced 32,139 cars (the Accord large family car) at its Pounds 370m plant at Swindon last year, of which 84 per cent were exported. Output at the plant is planned to rise to 50,000 this year and to 100,000 in 1995. Its export effort, which until late 1992, was based on cars assembled by Rover, is set to gather pace rapidly, when it adds production of a second car range at Swindon late this year. Production of the Honda Concerto by Rover will cease later this year, and the replacement car will be produced at Swindon. Output by Toyota at its Pounds 700m Burnaston car plant (it is also investing Pounds 140m at its Deeside engine plant) totalled 37,314 last year, of which 74 per cent was exported. Output is planned to reach 100,000 already this year. Nissan said that the export earnings of its Sunderland plant totalled Pounds 967m in 1993 compared with Pounds 911m in 1992 and Pounds 695m in 1991. It said the overall contribution by the plant to the UK balance of trade totalled around Pounds 500m after subtracting the value of imported components. Honda said that the value of its exports rose from Pounds 160m in 1991 to Pounds 188m in 1992 and Pounds 304m in 1993, although in the first two years the exports were solely of cars assembled for it by Rover under licence.</p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Construction Contracts: Dry docks scheme in Bahrain JALAL COSTAIN WLL has been awarded a contract worth Pounds 6.4m for civil works for two floating dry docks in Hidd, Bahrain, by the Arab Shipbuilding &amp; Repair Yard (ASRY). Four reinforced concrete mooring dolphins, each weighing about 2,500 tonnes, will be precast nine kilometres away from the site on a barge moored at a yard in North Sitra. When the dolphins are half finished, the barge will be transferred to ASRY, where the 1,200 tonne structures will be lifted off the barge, floated in the water and completed. They will then be sunk in position and the mooring "furniture' added to accommodate the floating docks. At the same time, 135 precast concrete blocks, each weighing 100 tonnes, will be cast at Sitra, transported by barge to the site and laid on diver-prepared foundations to create a jetty pier, thus providing access to the floating docks. The project also includes landfill of 210,000 cu metres and rock armour slope protection, on which dock buildings and facilities will be con structed. Jalal Costain WLL is 49 per cent owned by Costain Engineering &amp; Construction.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Gas pay rises 'outstrip others' Staff in the gas industry have experienced pay increases above the average for the whole economy, the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy says today, Motoko Rich writes. Following attacks on British Gas for giving Mr Cedric Brown, its chief executive, a 75 per cent pay rise, a study by the institute found that gas industry earnings have risen 42.8 per cent since 1990 as opposed to 23.8 per cent in the whole economy. The study also found that among all the privatised utilities - gas, telecommunications, electricity, and water - employees have received increases above the average rate in all industries. When looking at weekly earnings, the study also found that in the economy as a whole 30 per cent of full-time adult workers earn less than Pounds 220 per week. But in the regulated industries under 10 per cent of employees earn less than that.  ------------------------------- UTILITY PAY RISES  ------------------------------- Average increases     Cumulative for all staff           % change                     1990 to 1994  ------------------------------- Telecommunications          49.6 Electricity                 36.1 Gas                         42.8 Water                       32.6 Whole economy               23.8  ------------------------------- Source: Department of Employment  -------------------------------</p>

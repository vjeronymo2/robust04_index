			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria April 7 SAPA -- South African Defence Force  [SADF] Military Intelligence Chief Gen "Joffel" van der  Westhuizen, prominent in the Goniwe inquest, retired from  service on March 31, an SADF spokesman confirmed on Thursday.  He cited medical reasons for his retirement.    Maj-Gen Dirk Verbeek was acting in his place, said an SADF  statement. According to evidence in the Goniwe inquest, Gen van  der Westhuizen had in 1985, when he was the officer commanding  Eastern Province Command, allegedly instructed one of his  deputies, Col Lourens du Plessis, to send an order to the State  Security Council in Pretoria for the "permanent removal from  society" of three Eastern Cape activists.    In June that year Mr Matthew Goniwe, Mr Sparrow Mkhonto, Mr  Fort Calata and Mr Sicelo Mhlauli were killed near Port  Elizabeth. Gen van der Westhuizen has denied involvement in the  deaths of the "Cradock four".    Eastern Cape Judge President Mr Justice Neville Zietsman,  who  presided at the inquest, will deliver his findings on May 13.</p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Labour shortages hold back Singapore growth TIGHT labour supply will limit Singapore's economic growth this year to between 4 and 6 per cent, according to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). The economy grew by 6.7 per cent in 1991, AP reports from Singapore. Rising labour costs will curb exports, the MAS, Singapore's central bank, said in an annual report. Weak US demand is likely to dampen exports by a leading Singapore industry, computer disk drive manufacturing, and consumer electronics will be depressed because of high inventories in Japan and Europe, it said. Overall, however, 'increased spending on public infrastructural projects, a revival in exports to the US and increased trade with China will provide the main impetus to growth.' Pharmaceuticals and special chemicals should continue to prosper, while petrochemical exports will be hit by a regional glut, the report said. 'The appreciation of the Singapore dollar since 1988 served to neutralise foreign inflationary pressures and exerted a cooling effect on the overheated labour market,' said Mr Richard Hu, MAS chairman and finance minister. 'A weaker exchange rate may indeed help achieve higher export and gross domestic growth in the short term. It comes, however, at the cost of higher inflation, which must eventually undermine competitiveness,' said Mr Hu. 'There is no lasting gain in output arising from a weaker currency. More often than not, persistent inflation erodes investor confidence, engenders social divisiveness, and impairs long-term economic growth.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The transfer transactions occurred using market values as of the close of business on Friday, November 20, 1992. The securities transferred from the CIFs were the same as the securities received by the Funds. The applicant states that the value of the securities was determined in a single valuation by M&amp;I as investment adviser for the Funds, in accordance with the requirement of Rule 17a-7(b) that transactions be effected at the ``independent current market price'' of the securities. The valuation of the securities was performed in the same manner for both the CIF and the corresponding Fund at the close of the same business day. Specifically, as required by the Rule, securities listed on exchanges were valued at their closing prices on Friday, November 20, and unlisted securities were valued based on the average of bid and ask quotations at the close of the market on Friday, November 20, obtained from three brokers independent of M&amp;I. Any fees charged by the independent brokers for the bid and ask prices were paid by M&amp;I.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each Client Plan that approved the CIF asset transfers to the Funds received account statements describing the asset transfers either in mid-December 1992, if such Plans were on a monthly account statement schedule, or mid-January 1993, if such Plans were on a quarterly account statement schedule. The statements showed the disposition of the CIF units from the Client Plan account and the acquisition by the account of Fund shares, both posted as of Monday, November 23, 1992. <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>  This information provided the affected Client Plans with written confirmation of the number of CIF units held by the Client Plan immediately before the transfer, the related per unit value and the total dollar amount of such CIF units as well as the number of shares of the Funds held by the Client Plan following the transfer, the related per share net asset value, and the total dollar amount of such shares.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The applicant has provided the following example: Assume a Client Plan held 12,506 units of the M&amp;I Employee Benefit Stock Fund prior to the asset transfers. The account statement showed a disposition of 12,506 units of M&amp;I Employee Benefit Stock Fund, at a value of $72.08 per unit, on November 23, 1992, with total proceeds of $901,432.18. The statement also showed a purchase on that same date of 90,143.218 shares of the Marshall Stock Fund, the Fund corresponding to the M&amp;I Employee Benefit Stock Fund, at $10 per share, at a total cost of $901,432.18, the same amount as the proceeds of the disposition from the M&amp;I Employee Benefit Stock Fund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Thus, the applicant represents that as of November 23, 1992, Client Plans that were formerly invested in the terminated CIFs held Trust Shares of the corresponding Funds which were of the same value, based on the Client Plans' pro rata share of the underlying market value of the securities transferred to the Funds, as their assets in the CIF as of the close of business on Friday, November 20, 1992. M&amp;I represents that the other CIFs may be terminated in the future and that all such terminations and subsequent transfers of CIF assets for Trust Shares of the Funds will comply with Rule 17a-7 as described above and the conditions of this proposed exemption. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 19  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> On Friday, October 1, 1993, M&amp;I terminated the M&amp;I Dividend Fund and transferred its assets upon written approval from the investors to a new Marshall Fund, the Marshall Equity Income Fund. The transfer of assets occurred in the same manner as the asset transfers which occurred on November 20, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> M&amp;I states that for all subsequent transfers of CIF assets to a Fund following the publication of this proposed exemption in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , M&amp;I will send by regular mail to each affected Client Plan a written confirmation, not later than 30 days after completion of the transaction, containing the following information:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The identity of each security that was valued for purposes of the transaction in accordance with Rule 17a-7(b)(4);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The price of each such security involved in the transaction; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The identity of each pricing service or market maker consulted in determining the value of such securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Securities which are valued in accordance with Rule 17a-7(b)(4) are securities for which the current market price cannot be obtained by reference to the last sale price for transactions reported on a recognized securities exchange or the NASDAQ system. M&amp;I states that such securities are valued based on an average of the highest current independent bid and lowest current independent offer, as of the close of business on the Friday preceding the weekend of the CIF transfers, determined on the basis of reasonable inquiry from at least three sources that are broker-dealers or pricing services independent of M&amp;I.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, for all in-kind transfers of CIF assets to a Fund that occur after the date this proposed exemption is published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , M&amp;I will send by regular mail to the Second Fiduciary no later than 90 days after completion of each transfer a written confirmation that contains the following information:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The number of CIF units held by the Client Plan immediately before the transfer, the related per unit value, and the total dollar amount of such CIF units; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The number of shares in the Funds that are held by the Client Plan following the transfer, the related per share net asset value, and the total dollar amount of such shares.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> M&amp;I believes that the interests of the Client Plans are better served by the collective investment of assets of the Client Plans in the Funds rather than in the CIFs. The Funds are valued on a daily basis, whereas the majority of the CIFs are valued monthly. The daily valuation permits: (i) Immediate investment of Client Plan contributions in various types of investments; (ii) greater flexibility in transferring assets from one type of investment to another; and (iii) daily redemption of investments for purposes of making distributions. In addition, information concerning the investment performance of the Funds will be available in newspapers of general circulation which will allow Client Plan fiduciaries to monitor the performance of investments on a daily basis and make more informed investment decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

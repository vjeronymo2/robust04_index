			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Revenue contests BES tax relief ruling THE INLAND Revenue is appealing against a High Court judgment that overturned its decision to deny tax relief to two Pounds 25m business expansion schemes. The schemes were issued by National Westminster Bank in conjunction with Hambros Bank and BZW, the securities arm of Barclays Bank. The High Court agreed with the banks last month that their loan-back BES schemes were eligible for tax relief. BES schemes give tax relief to investors at their highest marginal rate if they hold their investment for five years. In his March Budget Mr Norman Lamont, who was then chancellor, abolished loan-back BES schemes, which allowed investors to withdraw after six months instead of five years. He ruled that shares in BES companies had to be issued by the midnight before the Budget if loans were to be made against them. The banks had allotted shares but had not listed the shareholdings in the companies' register of members by the Budget deadline. In May the Revenue decided that the shares had not been 'issued' and would not be eligible for tax relief. But the High Court ruled that the word 'issue' had no fixed meaning and there was no reason to think that the availability of BES tax relief was dependent on actual registration of shareholders. The Revenue said yesterday that it opposed the judgment because it blurred 'the distinction between the issue and allotment of shares, and this could impinge on other areas of tax legislation'.</p>

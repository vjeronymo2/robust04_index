			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / French Property: Leaseback pioneer hits environmental snags  -'Greens' make life tough for leisure leader TRAVELLING around the coasts and ski resorts of France, you might have noticed the name Pierre &amp; Vacances. You might even have thought it rather odd in translation: Peter and Holidays. In fact, it is not really translatable. 'Investment in leisure' is probably the closest you get, for the group is a leading French leisure/property developer and tour operator. On the one hand, it builds and sells holiday properties; on the other, it rents them out. It is expanding into Spain and Portugal and has just opened an office in London (071-495-2414). The group's interest in leisure began in the 1960s when, during a period of tremendous expansion in the industry, it created the traffic-free resort of Avoriaz in the French alps, offering apartments and facilities for holidaymakers. It then undertook their management for private owners and institutional investors. As it increased the number of its developments, it provided a growing range of services for owners and now has 100 complexes in 50 locations in France, representing 20,000/25,000 apartments and 72,000 beds available for letting. Overall, the average price of its apartments is Pounds 60,000, although it has villas on the Cote d'Azur at up to Pounds 1m. Surveys by the group showed that people who bought holiday apartments used them for only four to eight weeks a year. So, leaseback was born. If a buyer wishes, he can pay 30 per cent less for an apartment, furnish it, and lease it to the group for 11 years. During that time, he can use it himself for six weeks annually. He has no maintenance or management charges to pay and P&amp;V guarantees to hand the property back at French government 'three-star' standard. The group has sold 15,000 of its apartments under leaseback (of which there are variations), although many buyers still prefer outright ownership and the freedom to use their property when they choose. P&amp;V has a range of resorts and complexes in the mountains and along the Mediterranean coast, while others are appearing on France's Atlantic coast and in the Channel area. It plans its apartments carefully. There is a warehouse near Paris where mock-ups of new designs are built and tried out and where there are experiments with finishes and furnishing. The group's integrated resorts may have restaurants, hotels, swimming pools, tennis, riding, perhaps a lake for water sports. A number have golf courses, including Port Bourgenay on the Atlantic coast. Built as a seaside village in 290 acres, it also has a small marina and a sandy beach. Three-bedroom terrace properties with views over the fairways cost Pounds 89,000 for outright ownership and are available now. Apartments start at Pounds 33,000 for studios (outright ownership) or Pounds 22,900 (leaseback). Available in June. Aiguemer takes in 225 acres on the shores of the St Tropez peninsular. Its 18-hole course will run alongside the beach and a selection of properties is being built there. One-bedroom apartments are from Pounds 77,000 (outright ownership) and Pounds 45,000 (leaseback) while two-bedroom golf houses are Pounds 132,000 (outright ownership). The completion date is 1997. There are various similar projects in hand by P&amp;V, a private group of companies in which the Bremond family still holds nearly 80 per cent. Partners include Credit Agricole, Credit Foncier and the insurance group Axa, Net profit last year was something over Pounds 7m. So is it all plain sailing for P&amp;V? Not quite. Some people say leaseback is not a good system in times of recession and that units could be difficult to re-sell part-way through a contract. The group disagrees and says: 'Of course people can re-sell' - but they have to do so subject to the rental contract, or negotiate another. It adds that, normally, there is somebody quite happy to buy within the contract. P&amp;V has another problem: the 'green people,' as staff call environmentalists who claim it is spoiling the landscape. For obvious reasons, the group's leisure developments are in attractive areas and some of the sites are large. Permission for a golf course can lead to a lot of housing around it and the environmentalists have been objecting. A new resort, Cap Esterel, a short drive from Cannes, spreads over 500 acres. It has a golf course, swimming pool complex and Provencal-style village, with shops. But the greens protested to the authorities and the planned 18-hole course was cut to nine. The number of residential units has been reduced and an area of the development 'frozen' for building. Another project, at Gassin near St Tropez, was to have had a 27-hole course, town houses, villas, apartments, a 40-bedroom hotel and swimming pool. Development had been under way for a year when green protests resulted in planning permission being revoked. P&amp;V has appealed. There were objections, too, about Aiguemer, and the group appears to have taken these to heart. Advance drawings of the project show the properties wreathed in flowers and creepers and a landscaping company has been brought in to find a succession of plants that will provide flowers and greenery thoroughout the year. Now, P&amp;V appears to be changing tack. It has taken a 5.6 per cent (likely to be increased) stake in the 4,000-acre Sotogrande estate in southern Spain and says it will be responsible for running the estate and future development. The opportunity came with a change of ownership of Sotogrande, which has been taken over by the Spanish company Cofir. There are ambitious plans to bring the estate 'alive' by building an inner lagoon and marina and a large number of town houses and apartments. There will be two new golf courses and more villas inland. P&amp;V's joint managing director, Michel Gasteau, says the group will be starting leaseback at Sotogrande next year. It also has other plans in Spain and has been discussing a joint venture involving apartments with a bank. Meanwhile, Cofir is involved in Vilamoura, on Portugal's Algarve coast, and P&amp;V also plans to move into Portugal as well as increasing its sales network in Italy. So, is P&amp;V being driven out of France by envirnomentalists? Sales manager Francois Mautaint denies this although he admits it is becoming more difficult to get permission for beachside locations there. But the group was becoming international and in no way retreating from France, he said.</p>

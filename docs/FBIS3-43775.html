			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] It looks as if the Guinea-Bissau opposition leader,  Joao da Costa, may escape a prison sentence altogether following  a dramatic development of his trial on the charges of plotting a  coup last year against the government of President Vieira. The  trial began just over a week ago and da Costa and 16 others were  in the dock. But today one of the main prosecution witnesses,  an Army officer, took the stand to talk about the alleged plot,  and the soldier's testimony came as something of a surprise, as  Eduardo Lubao reports in this telex from Bissau for VOICES news  agency:    Army Sub-Lieutenant Amadu Mane withdrew his accusations  against Joao da Costa in a testimony today at the military court  in Bisalanka outside the capital, Bissau. Mr. Mane said he had  not met Joao da Costa for two years since the time when Mr. da  Costa left the ruling PAIGC [African Party for the Independence  of Guinea- Bissau and Cape Verde] Party in order to form his own  opposition party. He said the government security chief had  persuaded him to falsely accuse Mr. da Costa of plotting a coup  d'etat.    Mr. Mane, who is now an outspoken critic of poor conditions  in the Army, explained how he had shot Major Obolo da Pino in  March last year after da Pino has tried to kill him. Maj. Obolo  da Pino was a close aide to President Nino Vieira and head of  one of the Army's crack military units. Mane denied government  charges that the killing was aimed at sparking off a mutiny  against the government. He described how he fled abroad after  the shooting, was captured in neighboring Gambia, and flown back  to Bissau under military escort.    He said that the interior minister, Abubacar Balde; the  director general of the government security services; the chief  of the Presidency; and the commander of the Frontier Guard then  persuaded him to accuse Joao da Costa of plotting a coup d'etat.  Mane said they had told him several other arrested soldiers had  already agreed to accuse Mr. da Costa of plotting a coup and  that he would be freed after the trial if he went along with the  story.    Last week, several other witnesses who appeared before the  military court withdrew earlier accusations against Mr. da  Costa, saying they had been obliged to sign false statements.</p>

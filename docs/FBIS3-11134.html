Most of the heads of the  delegations present at the meeting, most of which are countries  bordering the Caribbean, participated in yesterday's opening  session.    Vice Foreign Minister Ramon Sanchez Parodi said that Cuba  supports efforts to establish the Association of Caribbean  States during the technical meeting in Kingston. In an interview  with PRENSA LATINA, Sanchez Parodi pointed out that the event's  highlight was the coincidence of criteria by specialists in  creating the association.    Sanchez Parodi also said that the delegations are analyzing  other aspects of regional organization. Sanchez Parodi went on  to say that experts from Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela, and  representatives of the French Government for Caribbean  departments voiced their points of view on the scope and  perspectives of the future organization.    Today, the agenda to create the Association of Caribbean  State will focus its technical discussions on membership, its  main departments, the adoption of decisions, and financing --  elements that make up the project of creating the association.  Observers believe that another meeting of specialists may be  necessary prior to the summit of heads of state and government,  who will approve the organization.</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Devaluation brings divergence to bourses European bourses diverged last week as currency turmoil pushed the UK, Italy and Spain into devaluation. With the FT-Actuaries World Indices measured in local currency terms, fluctuations in these markets tended to obscure clear gains in the strong D-Mark bloc - Germany, the Benelux countries and Switzerland - and in France. In dollar terms, however, another picture emerges which reflects the comparative strengths and weaknesses of European currencies. In these terms, Austria, which is also firmly locked into the D-Mark, stands out as one of last week's best performers, while the UK's 8.5 per cent gain in sterling is translated into a fall of 1.8 per cent, reflecting its effective 13 per cent depreciation since last week. Similarly, Italy is 8.2 per cent weaker in dollar terms. Austria's solid performance was made in an illiquid market, with very little foreign or domestic institutional activity, said Mr James Stratton of Girozentrale Gilbert Eliott in London. Turnover was higher than average throughout the week, but much of the trading came from short-covering and interbank business. 'There was also the fact that the market was due for a technical correction,' he said, 'having dropped some 30 per cent from its high earlier this year.' The situation in Italy, where last Monday's devaluation led the BCI index to an eight-year low on Wednesday in exceptionally large turnover of some L200bn, was followed by a rally as the market welcomed Thursday's tough budget proposals. There was also some satisfaction, said Marie Christine Keith, Italian analyst at County NatWest, that the lira had left the ERM. However, in spite of the budget measures receiving support from non-coalition parties, which may ease their passage through parliament, the release of a batch of first-half results over the next few weeks is expected to bring further disappointment.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  % change   % change in               % change in local currency**       sterling** US Dollars**             1 Week   4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of   Start of     Start of                                                    1992         1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      +9.12    +8.83   -22.34    -5.16     +3.31        -3.92 Belgium      +3.83    +1.03    -2.80    -2.77     +5.74        -1.66 Denmark      +0.79    -6.66   -29.65   -25.49    -19.03       -24.70 Finland      +5.74    +1.98   -32.84   -20.29    -24.67       -29.95 France       +3.88    +6.38    +0.99    +5.87    +14.84        +6.80 Germany      +4.23    +4.76    -7.20    -2.56     +5.88        -1.53 Ireland      +2.81    -2.21   -18.19   -12.07     -4.53       -11.21 Italy        +3.82    -7.18   -29.19   -23.86    -25.08       -30.32 Netherlands  +3.34    +1.78    +2.17    +4.93    +14.43        +6.42 Norway       +8.92    +6.89   -32.32   -16.84    -12.13       -18.28 Spain        +3.42    +3.23   -19.52   -12.29    -13.76       -19.79 Sweden       +8.09    +2.28   -20.51    -4.34     +1.76        -5.36 Switzerland  +3.93    +6.39   +10.68   +12.49    +25.60       +16.80 UK           +8.54    +8.26    -2.65    +2.26     +2.26        -4.90 EUROPE       +5.88    +5.35    -5.31    -0.31     +3.90        -3.30 Australia    +1.52    -2.56    -5.07    -9.80     -6.49       -13.05 Hong Kong    +3.13    +3.11   +44.70   +32.54    +43.44       +33.41 Japan        -1.16    +7.65   -23.69   -20.20    -13.98       -20.00 Malaysia     +1.63    +6.24   +10.50    +3.85    +20.69       +12.25 New Zealand  +1.14    -0.41    -1.99    -9.53     -2.15        -9.00 Singapore    -2.83    -0.52    -9.33   -16.39     -9.43       -15.76 Canada       +0.31    +1.51    -1.73    -3.07     -0.91        -7.85 USA          +0.71    +1.94    +9.74    +1.42     +9.06        +1.42 Mexico       +2.26    -5.37    +4.16    -9.61     -4.39       -11.08 South Africa +3.55    -1.33    -9.71   -10.38    -24.38       -29.68 WORLD INDEX  +1.58    +4.07    -5.24    -5.84     +0.16        -6.85  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on September 18th 1992.

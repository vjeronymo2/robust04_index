			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Letter: Late payment - new businesses being fatally undermined Sir, Michael Cassell restates much conventional wisdom which, in my experience, is fundamentally flawed. There are bad payers and would-be non-payers who warrant heavy-handed letters or nocturnal telephone calls, but these are a minority. Most customers expect to pay for goods and services received, and payment delays are largely supplier caused. Over time I have developed an approach to improving cash collection performance based on this premise and its validity is consistently demonstrated by the results achieved. Recently this was done to dramatic effect (debt more than 60 days old reduced by 95 per cent) for a company operating in an overcrowded market. In the international programme I am now leading, my experiences have been similar to those I had in the UK. If suppliers take steps to implement efficient internal processes, not just in the credit department but throughout the sale and supply process, and manage customer relationships effectively, they can largely eliminate the causes of significantly overdue debt. This is not down to finance alone. Success requires the chief executive to secure commitment to the objective across the full spectrum of the organisation.

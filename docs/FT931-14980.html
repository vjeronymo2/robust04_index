			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Halt urged to debate on Maastricht THERE WAS pressure at Westminster last night for progress on the bill implementing the Maastricht treaty to be suspended in the wake of the resignation of Mr Poul Schluter, the Danish prime minister. As detailed consideration of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill neared the end of its fourth day, Conservative Euro-sceptics demanded clarification of any consequences for the proposed second Danish referendum. Mr Tony Marlow, Conservative MP for Northampton North, said it was 'futile and fatuous' for debate on the measure to continue. But Downing Street said it saw no reason to suppose that Mr Schluter's departure would affect Danish referendum plans - even if it led to a general election. For Labour, Mr George Robertson, a frontbench spokesman, said that only the Danish prime minister had resigned. As Labour knew to its cost from events succeeding Baroness Thatcher's exit, 'that does not automatically mean a general election.' Mr Schluter's resignation further encouraged the Euro-sceptic camp, which had sought to build on its success in framing new provisions for insertion into the ratification bill which would require a referendum to be held before the treaty is given legal effect. Euro-sceptics were later brought back down to earth, however, when a batch of amendments on general Maastricht issues was defeated by 304 votes to 74, a government majority of 230. Labour signalled its unwillingness to let the government dictate the pace of the debate by opposing the motion to end discussion of this group of amendments. The motion was nonetheless carried by 298 votes to 240. Mr John Major has assured MPs that the third reading of the ratification bill at Westminster will not take place until after a second referendum is held. As a newspaper opinion poll showed that a big majority of British voters wanted a Maastricht referendum, Sir Teddy Taylor, Tory MP for Southend East, called for the new provisions to be debated much earlier in the committee stage than is intended. Sir Teddy said there seemed to be 'a widespread feeling' among MPs that if such a step were agreed consideration of the bill could be completed very quickly. Three days have been set aside next week for continuation of the committee stage but as much as a further 20 days would be needed for the completion of the stage, which would drag it out until early summer. A Gallup opinion poll for today's Daily Telegraph indicated that while 71 per cent of voters wanted a referendum, turnout in any such vote would be low.</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Anger over County Hall sale MR John Major, the prime minister, is set to intervene in the growing controversy over the future of London's County Hall, amid expressions of deep resentment by the Japanese purchaser of the site at the government's continued failure to confirm the sale. The cabinet is known to be divided on the sale. Several senior ministers - including Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, and Mr John Patten, education secretary - are believed to support consideration of the bid by the London School of Economics (LSE) to take over the site. A clause in the sale contract allows the government to withdraw at any time until the end of this year. A cabinet committee last week reportedly decided to allow the LSE to submit a full proposal to move to County Hall, the former headquarters of the defunct Greater London Council, from its present site in central London. Mr Makoto Toyota, London representative of Shirayama, the Japanese property developer, denied reports that the company had indicated its desire to withdraw because of the controversy. But he added: 'The present situation is totally exhausting. We are begging the British government to make clear its intentions soon if we are to carry on.' The LSE said last night it was pursuing its bid 'very seriously', and was 'confident' it could match Shirayama's bid for the building - believed to be in the region of Pounds 60m. Shirayama plans to turn County Hall into a hotel, retail and sports complex. The LSE wishes to use it to combine a university campus with a social science park with office space for applied research units. The disposal of County Hall is formally the responsibility of the London Residuary Body, which acts on behalf of the London boroughs. It is legally obliged to accept the best price for its assets, but the government has the power to override any deal. More than 140 MPs have signed a cross-party Commons motion calling on the government to delay the sale for there to be full consideration of the suggestion that the LSE should move there. A Commons debate is planned later this week. Support for the LSE was unanimous in a Lords debate earlier this month.</p>

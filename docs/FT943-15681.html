			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Brussels tackles Italy over TV The European Commission has begun legal action against Italy over its failure to comply with European Union legislation on television advertising. Brussels says Italy is contravening the 'Television Without Frontiers' directive by allowing broadcasts that last less than 45 minutes to be interrupted by advertisements more than once. It also says Italy has failed to ban advertisements from news, children's programmes and religious broadcasts that last less than 30 minutes. Further, the Commission objects to an Italian law stipulating that public authorities must reserve at least 25 per cent of their advertising budget for local private TV and radio stations. The case could pit Brussels against Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, whose company owns three national networks in Italy which together control almost half the broadcasting output. The Commission is currently considering some assurances sent to it by Italy.</p>

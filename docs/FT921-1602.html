			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (19): Barking up a wrong track RAILROADS TRIUMPHANT by Albro Martin Oxford Pounds 25, 442 pages I FEAR that Professor Martin and his distinguished publishers are guilty of switch-selling, offering us one product and providing another. In his Preface, Professor Martin claims that he was once introduced at a conference as the man who made deregulation academically respectable. This claim was based on an earlier book, Enterprise Denied, Origins of the Decline of the American Railroad. So he should have been the ideal author for a book answering the question he poses in the Preface, one of the most fascinating and under-explored aspects of the social, economic and political history of the US over the past 150 years: how did it come about that the railroads, so crucial in creating, developing and binding together such a disparate land-mass, were despised and rejected by a politically contentious people who made them the scapegoat of their discontents? Unfortunately Martin makes only the most token attempts to answer any of these questions. Instead he gives us a fascinating, deeply personal, albeit rambling and ill-organised, panoramic view of American railroads, from July 4 1828, the day Charles Carroll, last surviving signatory of the Declaration of Independence, turned the first spade of earth for the first railroad in the country, up to the present day, ten years after the century-old shackles on the railroads operations had been removed by the Staggers Act of 1981 - a long-overdue piece of legislation barely glanced at in this infuriating book. In fact the railroads had asked for trouble by their arrogance and greed. The first warnings came as early as the 1870s with the Granger movement, a radical rural revolt in the Mid-West by farmers angry at the excessive prices they had to pay to get their grain to market (needless to say, Martin has nothing to say about this crucial uprising). Inevitably railroads were the first American industry to be regulated ('shackled', Professor Martin would say, but then the concept that they could ever have abused their power never seems to have occurred to him). They suffered further restrictions as a result of two world wars, whose regulatory effects lasted far longer than the conflicts which triggered them. But - and this is the central political mystery of the subject - the restrictions, particularly on long-overdue amalgamations, remained in force long after the railroads had been reduced to impotence as a competitive force; by the end of the 1970s trains were averaging just 12mph because of the appalling state of the infrastructure. Then, as a political scientist once put it, 'the American people found the right solution after they had tried all the others', and since deregulation the railways have been able to start repairing the neglect of generations through amalgamations (and the hiving-off of shorter lines). The come-back has a long way to go: the railroads are still struggling against crippling work practices imposed by unions long ago in response to the same abuse of power which created the original regulatory framework; and tracks suitable for ultra-heavy freight trains are unsuited to fast passenger traffic. But there are numerous plans for improvements or new lines for passenger trains on numerous routes - such as the North-Eastern Corridor from Boston to Washington via New York, Dallas-Houston etc - where trains travelling up to 200mph can compete with aeroplane and car. But perhaps we should not expect the Prof. to bother with such details.</p>

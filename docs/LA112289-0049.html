			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> JERUSALEM;  </P> <P> PROTEST ERUPTS OVER GIRL'S DEATH  </P> <P> Dozens of enraged Israelis blocked a street with garbage cans and burning  bushes to protest the death of a 7-year-old Jewish girl struck by a garbage  truck driven by an Arab city employee. "Death to the Arabs!" the rioters  shouted in the working-class Shmuel Hanavi district. Police Chief Arye Bibi  told reporters: "The driver indeed was an Arab, but it had nothing to do with  the accident. The driver was arrested and his interrogation raised no  possibility at all that he did it for political reasons." The driver's name was  not given.  </P></p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Busines and the Environment: Eco-design on the line - Hugh Aldersey-Williams considers how telephone companies are tapping into green issues Telephone companies have long trumpeted the virtues of communication. Persuading people to dial more numbers helps to boost revenues. Now, however, they are starting to latch on to the environmental arguments for increased phone use. At a conference held by the Royal Society of Arts, senior managers in the industry agreed on a number of actions, including the more aggressive promotion of videoconferencing and telecommuting as a means to cut down on environmentally damaging business travel. Delegates resolved to build on the industry's 'clean' image to contribute more to the debate on sustainable development. Their first action will be to issue a joint global environmental policy statement. 'The telecommunications sector is going to be critical in achieving (environmental) sustainability,' says Braden Allenby, a research vice-president at AT&amp;T in the US. 'It is the ethical responsibility of our industry to address these issues.' The new emphasis could have profound implications for the transport and travel industries. Although telecommunications is not perceived as a leading polluter, manufacturers also announced their intention to improve the environmental qualities of their products. 'Those companies which address environmental criteria at the design stage are likely to be the ones that emerge with a competitive edge,' says Colin Hicks, head of environment and energy technologies at Britain's Department of Trade and Industry. British Telecommunications has given informal indications that it may take the lead in producing a flagship 'green' telephone product. The RSA conference was intended as the first in a series of environmental design workshops covering 'eco-design' in various industries; future seminars may cover white goods, office products, transport and building design. Telecommunications is not, perhaps, the most obvious sector to pick for a first outing. People buy comparatively few phones, which are, in any case, small objects. In use, the equipment accounts for a scant 1.2 per cent of the UK's energy consumption, according to figures from BT. In 1992, BT collected 2.9m telephones under its recycling scheme, but complete disassembly and recycling of these products is not yet possible. Products designed to be taken apart and made of materials that could be recycled more efficiently than the present hard-moulded plastic could streamline the process, possibly transforming what is currently a cost into a modest profit, according to David Mercer of the BT design unit. In addition, telephones that work, but which users have reported as broken - known in the trade as 'fault-not-found' - currently find their way into this recycling stream rather than being rescued for resale and re-use. The fast growth of this sector is another reason for considering its environmental impact now. The volume of electronic data communication is forecast by BT to multiply a thousand-fold in the first half of the next century, although advances in technology should ensure that its environmental effect does not increase commensurately. Telephones and related products are well suited for snap-together plastic components that assist disassembly. Moulded eco-labels, like those widely used in packaging, could also be incorporated at the design stage, although it is not currently possible to eliminate all toxic materials and processes such as the use of solders and solvents. Telefonica, the Spanish telecommunications monopoly, is exploring the possibility of a questionnaire that will require its suppliers to state  - and prove - the environmental impact of their parts and materials. In order to work at the pace required in day-to-day business, the questionnaire would invite respondents to fill in simple 'figures of merit' on a check-list of materials and procedures. These figures would be weighted according to the amount of material or processing and then added, with scores for more general questions about a supplier's environmental policies, to arrive at a total figure. Such a procedure is more flexible than relying on standards which, because of both rapid advances in communications technology and changing views about relative environmental merits of particular materials, are often out of date by the time they are published. The scorecard approach also means that designers are able to spend less time attempting the confusing task of weighing the relative environmental merits of materials and components that they might use. The method could be taken a stage further, believes AT&amp;T's Allenby. Rather than attempting to turn every designer into an environment specialist, it would be possible to incorporate the data on materials into computer-aided design software so the most appropriate choice is made automatically for the task in hand. The evolution of such design methods means that giving greater consideration to the environment need not be an added cost. Such scrutiny of design, manufacture and reclamation processes can actually lead to unexpected savings, as Dutch companies found out through a year-long environmental manufacturing project. Hans van Weenen of the UN Environment Programme's Workshop for Sustainable Product Development in Amsterdam, said they made savings in both materials and energy costs of between 30 and 50 per cent across a wide range of product manufacturing, including office chairs, coffee-makers and car dashboards. But perhaps the greatest potential for telecommunications companies lies in exploiting the relative environmental benefit of their services. The energy used in flying to New York and back is equivalent to five weeks on the telephone, according to Graham Davies, BT's head of corporate research. (He omitted to say, however, that such a call would cost around Pounds 20,000, enough to fund a fairly stylish trip.) More telecommuting would bring cuts in transport use. There would also be a potential knock-on effect as telecommuters rediscovered the joys of more local amenities, feels Stephen Potter of the Open University's technology faculty, thus cutting the length of many other journeys as well as reducing the number of trips to the office.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pumping up profits at BP's Andean fortress - Christina Lamb visits a Colombian oil production facility that looks more like a military installation AT FIRST sight it looks like a military installation. But beyond the khaki-clad figures manning machine guns from sandbagged tents, and the two rows of flood-lit razor-wire, lie the hopes of oil giant British Petroleum for improving its ailing fortunes. The Cusiana 2A production facility is one of a series of heavily guarded oil rigs nestling incongruously in the rolling foothills of Casanare in Colombia's eastern Andes. An area until recently inhabited only by Angus cows and subsistence farmers, the rigs mark the discovery last year that Casanare was sitting on an underground sea of 2bn barrels of oil. BP's richest find since the early 1970s, the Cusiana-Cupiagua field adds 5 per cent to the company's world-wide reserves and is the basis for Colombia's aims of doubling its oil production. Oil companies are used to operating in difficult conditions but, as the elaborate security measures at Cusiana 2A illustrate, BP Colombia faces an unusual problem. Cusiana is on the front line of the Colombian government's long-running battle against guerrillas - a prime target of the nominally Marxist groups who explode pipelines in an attempt to force out multinationals from the country's vast, violence-ridden backlands. Although Cusiana is on land only 60 km (100 miles) east of the capital, its rigs are run like offshore facilities with workers staying on site for 28 days and then helicoptered off. Mr Phil Mead, operations manager, says, 'it's very frustrating for our people working out there that they can't just drop round to the local hacienda or go out to a bar'. However the government and oil companies have a shared interest in combatting terrorism. Not only is President Cesar Gavriria anxious to end the violence that so mars the country's reputation, but oil represents 22 per cent of Colombia's export earnings and half of last year's foreign investment, making the industry a vital key to future prosperity. 'There is a real synergy - the government and foreign companies have the same goal,' says a presidential adviser. He points out that the oil is in areas where the government is weak and the population poor and thus susceptible to guerrillas. In Casanare, for example, half the population is below the poverty line. 'Not only could oil money help development of these areas,' the adviser explains, 'but the oil companies can help the government reduce terrorism by providing an alternative source of income.' As its own investment in the oil industry, the government has installed an army battalion at Yopal, the capital of Casanare, to protect BP and its partners Total and Triton, and is offering sizeable bounty for information leading to the capture of guerrillas. It is now illegal for companies to pay protection money, on pain of expulsion, reinforced at frequent meetings between military high command and business leaders. The new measures are already showing results. So far this year there have been seven pipeline explosions - a big drop from last year's 86, which cost state oil company Ecopetrol Dollars 100m in lost sales. To operate without paying off guerrillas, companies must win over local communities using what Mr Harding calls a 'hearts and minds strategy'. He explains that 'we are working with the peasants and farmers to help them understand that the benefits for them lie with helping the oil companies and not the other side'. To do this BP has public relations officers based at rigs to go out explaining what they are doing. The company supports community projects in 55 villages and gave jobs last year to 2,500 local people. Winning over local inhabitants is also crucial for acquiring seismic data. Mr Tony Hayward, exploration manager, points out that 'it is much harder to protect 2,000 people scattered over a large area than fixed installations'. Last December BP began an innovative system, establishing a series of local co-operatives from which the seismic company contracts labour for removing vegetation, cutting and drilling lines and placing dynamite, the latter kept under army guard. 'This has been very successful in letting us do our work while bringing money into local communities,' Mr Hayward says. 'We now have no security problems because the locals have a vested interest in seeing this work carried out.' Security is not BP's only headache. According to Mr Hayward the light crude produced is of 'top quality - Latin America's only low sulphur metal free oil'. But it lies at depths of 14,000 to 16000 feet and drilling conditions are very difficult because of the mountainous terrain. Tectonic presures cause hole instability making it slow work and the casing frequently collapses or the pipe sticks. Cusiana 2a took 18 months to reach its target. However, for new wells the time has been considerably reduced; the completion target for the latest well Los Cedros is 66 days at a cost of Dollars 8m, compared with last year's average of Dollars 20m. Of the six wells completed so far on Cusiana and Cupiagua only Buenos Aires 1 is currently in production - producing 10,200 barrels a day since last September. The field will be declared commercial next month, triggering off a Dollars 1.1bn investment programme to boost production to 150,000 b/d by 1995 - the maximum under current pipeline limitations. As a 19 per cent equity holder BP's share will be about Dollars 200m, on top of the Dollars 250m it has invested since arriving in 1986. According to Mr Nick Connolly, BP's Commercial manager for Latin America, under phase II of the project production will rise to between 600,000 and 800,000 b/d by 1998. For this a new pipeline must be built - no easy task as it must cross two mountain ranges to reach the port of Covenas. Estimated total investment over the next four to five years is Dollars 4.8bn. The Cusiana production will make Colombia the second largest oil exporter in Latin America and provide an estimated annual revenue of Dollars 4bn-5bn, pushing the country's annual growth rate from last year's 3.6 per cent to more than 5 per cent. This is causing some worry among directors of Colombia's Central Bank who fear having to revalue the peso. In fact production may be higher. While refusing to give specific figures, BP officials believe that the estimate of 500,000 b/d for Cupiagua where only two wells have been spudded so far is low. Mr Hayward says, 'this is one of the hottest patches in the whole oil industry. There is a definite upside but we don't yet know how much'. He believes the trend continues to the north into the Piedemonte area, which BP owns 100 per cent. The company plans to drill two wells there this year. Operating in Colombia may present unusual challenges but for BP security measures are just part of the production cost. The company employs more than 600 security officers, and Mr David Harding, chief executive for Latin America, has to travel in a bullet-proof car with guards and motorcycle outriders. 'We believe its worth it,' he says. 'We're here for the long term.'</p>

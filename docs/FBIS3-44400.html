The agreement, reached between Heihe city in the  northeastern  Chinese province of Heilongjiang and Blagoveshchensk city of the  Amur region of Russia in the Far East, was made public here at a  seminar named "special economic zones for regional development",  jointly sponsored by the United Nations and Heilongjiang  Province of China.    Under the agreement, the free economic and trade zone will  extend from either end of the pontoon bridge to be built soon to  span the boundary Heilongjiang river.    The zone, initially blueprinted to cover 20 sq km, will  consist of 10 sq km of land from each of the two countries while  respective state land ownership remains unchanged.    As outlined in the agreement, the zone, to be mainly engaged  in trade, finance, high-tech industries, transportation and  catering, is expected to become a transit center for goods and  passengers. It is also designed to be an export-oriented  processing base.    The agreement said the zone will be administered by a joint  management commission, to be formed by state-appointed personnel  from both China and Russia. The commission, meanwhile, will  adopt internationally-recognized practices and regulations  governing economic, social, cultural and legal affairs.    The zone will not be subject to the administration of either  single government, the agreement noted.    Within the zone, both goods and currencies will be allowed  to  circulate and be exchanged freely, and citizens of both  countries will be allowed to go in and out with a border pass  issued by the management commission while citizens from other  countries will be allowed in and issued visas upon arrival.    Participants in the seminar from the United Nations and 11  countries, including Japan, Russia, China, Bulgaria, Thailand,  the United States and the Republic of Korea, held that the  framework for the free economic and trade zone is workable.    Heihe and Blagoveshchensk are the two largest and closest  cities on the border between China and Russia.    Since 1987, border trade between the two countries has  surged, with Heihe alone reporting a two-way trade volume of  more than two billion Swiss francs up to the present.    To date, the two border cities have helped build connections  between 2,000 companies in ten members of the Commonwealth of  Independent States (CIS) and over 3,000 Chinese firms.    An official from the UN said the free economic and trade  zone  represents a brand-new type and can serve as an example for  cross- border economic zones among other countries.    The zone, once established, is expected to be a development  force for regional economies in Northeast Asia as well as a  spark to lead development of the neighboring areas.    Currently the local governments of the two border cities are  conducting detailed negotiations on the agreed project, which  still awaits state approval by both China and Russia.    Last December China and Russia officially agreed to build a  pontoon bridge across the Heilongjiang river separating the two  countries.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Prime Minister] Felipe Gonzalez has just  concluded a one-hour news conference. We are going over to the  Moncloa for a full report from Jose Luis Garcia del Pozo.    [Garcia del Pozo] [passage omitted] In conclusion, the prime  minister spoke of Bosnia and of the situation of our troops  engaged in humanitarian tasks there on the United Nation's  behalf. He said that everything possible is being done to  protect the men and that there will, of course, be no unilateral  withdrawal. He said that, and I quote, we are not going to make  a unilateral decision to withdraw our troops. We will talk to  our partners because the effect of such a decision on our  country's international credibility would be very negative.  This would be linked to the fact that our country has already  spent a long time (?enshrined)--as Gonzalez put it--in isolation  from the international community.</p>

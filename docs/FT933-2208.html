			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Venables faces more allegations FRESH allegations of irregularities at Tottenham Hotspur Football Club were made in the Channel 4 programme Dispatches last night, writes Barry Riley. Two weeks after Mr Terry Venables, former chief executive, left the club in June this year, two bundles of cash totalling Pounds 8,750 were found in the safe at Spurs. The money, according to the programme, was VAT originally added in error to a cash payment of Pounds 50,000 in August 1992 to Mr Frank McLintock, a former star footballer who is now a partner of a players' agency. At least in part, the money was a payment for handling the transfer of Mr Teddy Sheringham from Nottingham Forest to Spurs late in 1991. Such payments are against Football Association rules and both Mr Venables and Mr McLintock told the programme's producers that the invoice was misleadingly made out in order to get around this. Another payment to an intermediary, an Italian restaurateur called Mr Gino Santin, was highlighted by the programme as the original trigger for the eventual breakdown of relations between Mr Venables and Spurs' chairman, Mr Alan Sugar. When Mr Santin was called in by Mr Venables in July 1991 to assist with the complex and protracted negotiations to sell Mr Paul Gascoigne to the Italian club Lazio, Mr Sugar was told by Mr Venables that Mr Santin would act for nothing. In 1992, however, Mr Santin submitted an invoice for Pounds 200,000 in respect of 'activities and assistance regarding the transfer of Paul Casgoigne (sic) to Latio (sic) Rome'. Mr Santin, the programme reported, said that what started as a favour soon developed into a different role. There are contradictions between the claims of Mr Venables, who insists Mr Santin was instrumental in raising the price from Pounds 4.825m to Pounds 5.5m, and Lazio, which says that the Pounds 5.5m offer was made two weeks before Mr Santin became involved. However, Lazio agreed, according to Dispatches, that Mr Santin was crucial in keeping the deal going.</p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Czech Republic prepares to alter bankruptcy law THE CZECH government is preparing to revise the country's bankruptcy law to protect companies facing serious financial difficulties. Unamended, the existing law could force hundreds of companies out of business. The law was approved by the former Czechoslovak parliament last year, and ministers are expected to discuss draft amendments today. The government wants the revised law in place by April 20, when current provisions expire, Mr Karel Dyba, minister for the economy, said in an interview with the Financial Times. The need to amend the law is highlighted by a recent spate of calls by large companies for urgent financial help from the government. Many companies are locked in a circle of bad debt caused by unpaid bills from customers. Some of the biggest Czech companies whose main markets were in the former Soviet Union and other communist countries have been particularly badly hit by the collapse of these markets. They cannot pay their bills to suppliers who threaten to cut off essential supplies. Officials fear that many other companies could be affected if major companies, which have called on the government for urgent financial help, are allowed to go bankrupt. 'We want to avoid a chain reaction, but a little more pressure on a non-paying company is needed. It's a question of how big a dose of medicine needs to be given,' Mr Dyba said. He rejected suggestions that thousands of companies are near bankruptcy. 'That's rubbish. Nobody has the data. People talk about inter-enterprise debt as too high, but it's quite normal in a market economy. One should not worry too much about its increase. The real problem is bad debts of some enterprises to banks. That's what we must solve.' The government wants the law to allow out-of-court settlements. 'The (revised) law will force interested parties to act and give them time to reach out-of-court settlements.' The courts were overburdened with thousands of bad debt cases, and had neither the capacity nor the ability to solve all these problems, he said. The revised law may allow companies initially to pay back only part of their debt. The government wants the National Property Fund, responsible for privatisations and a big shareholder in many companies, and the Consolidation Bank, set up to deal with state-owned companies' bad debts, to help by taking equity in companies threatened by bankruptcy or by providing finance. The government may intervene directly if there was a clear company commitment to resolve its financial situation. 'But there will be no bailing-out without guarantees,' said Mr Dyba, adding that the government's role would be that of a catalyst. Government intervention would be limited to at most 12 big companies. A solution would have to involve 'sharing the burden among workers, managers, owners or would-be owners, the banks and the government.'</p>

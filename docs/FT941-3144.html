			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Westland order prospects under fire GKN yesterday accused Westland, the helicopter manufacturer, of inflating its order prospects in an attempt to fight off a Pounds 497m hostile takeover bid by the engineering and industrial services group. Sir David Lees, GKN chairman, claimed the Yeovil-based manufacturer was trying to win shareholder support by laying claim to future sales which could prove illusory. In what he admitted was a more robust approach to the takeover, Sir David described Westland's firm order book as 'unremarkable and unexciting'. Writing to the group's shareholders, he warned: 'Prospects in the past have failed repeatedly to turn into orders.' He cited unfulfilled hopes for previous helicopters, such as the Westland W30 and Black Hawk, as examples of the group's 'uncertain business judgment'. Westland has so far rejected GKN's offer of 290p per ordinary share, claiming it undervalues its Pounds 1.4bn order book and the potential of its flagship helicopter - the EH101. Mr Alan Jones, Westland chairman, said the company's share price - unchanged yesterday at 326p - reflected market sentiment about the offer. 'GKN's tone has turned arrogant. Why should my shareholders kow-tow to his protestations that 290p is a good offer?' Sir David, however, claimed the price increase had been driven by bid speculation rather than the underlying value of the helicopter business. 'Until speculation started at the end of November, the Westland share price traded in a range of between 210p and 250p. This is consistent with GKN's view of Westland's value as a stand-alone business.' GKN, which has promised logistical, marketing and financial support for the helicopter group, said Mr Jones had refused to meet Sir David to discuss the offer. 'A meeting would not have resolved anything unless there was a substantially increased offer on the table,' according to the Westland chairman. Both companies have now begun courting institutional investors in an effort to win their support. They are expected to concentrate on M&amp;G and Schroders, which control a combined 9.5 per cent in GKN and more than 25 per cent of Westland.</p>

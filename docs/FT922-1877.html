			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / The Maxwells: MPs find cheer in Bank meeting MPS CAMPAIGNING on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners were encouraged yesterday that Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England, would take a more active role in assisting in the recovery of assets. Three MPs from the all-party group - Mr Richard Page, Mr Frank Field and Mr David Shaw - met Mr Leigh-Pemberton to express their concerns about what has been seen at Westminster as too passive a role adopted by the Bank over the Maxwell affair. They came away with the impression that the Bank had been acquiring information more actively behind the scenes, and that it would be working closely with the special unit to help the pensioners which has been set up in the department of social security and is led by Sir John Cuckney. The MPs were also cheered that while Mr Leigh-Pemberton was very conscious of the limits of the Bank's legal powers, he recognised also the powerful influence that it could exert. They expressed confidence that once he was sure of the information on which he could act, he would be ready to do so, in order to contribute to ensuring that the government's moral pressure on some banks and financial institutions was effective. He is to circulate to the MPs a note of the discussion which will set out the Bank's position, and is ready to meet them in the autumn if that is still wanted. The MPs had written asking him to talk to the group, but in the event he may instead give evidence to the all-party social security committee once that has been re-established. Mr Leigh-Pemberton seems to have succeeded in softening the severely critical stance which many among the 100-strong all-party group had taken towards his approach. One or two of the group, however, are still unhappy that the Bank will not take a broader view of its duties and act as a City-wide regulator.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Some comfort for defeated party in Spain THE conservative People's Party in Spain is nursing its defeat but should take comfort from the results of the general election on Sunday. It has demonstrably shaken off the image of being only a right-wing party, having captured a sizeable proportion of the centrist vote. Nor is the PP a backwoods conservative party. It was the socialist party (PSOE) of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, that won the vote in the pueblos (small towns). The PP opposition, led by Mr Jose Mara Aznar, made strong gains in the big cities and the dormitory towns. Nor is the PP a nostalgic party of elderly traditionalists. The returns indicate that large numbers of first-time voters voters opted for the centre-right. The PSOE, by contrast, was strongly endorsed by pensioners. But, if the PP's appeal was so successful among moderate, middle-class voters, among urbanites and suburbanites, and among the young, why didn't it win? Part of the answer is the cushion of support that Andalucia, Mr Gonzalez's home region, delivers to the PSOE. With more than 5m voters - more than any other region - this southern swathe of Spain returns 61 members to the 350-seat Congress and 37 of those elected on Sunday from Andalucia were members of the PSOE. The PP returned 20. The other explanation is the competition that the PP faces from regionally-based parties that share the same middle-of-the-road policies. In Catalonia, the second biggest region after Andalucia, the PP won just eight seats out of a possible 47. The Catalan nationalists, CiU, returned 18 members and the PSOE 17. The PP was penalised by competing regional parties in the Canary Islands, in Aragon and in Valencia, as well as in the Basque Country where a strong nationalist party, much like Catalonia's CiU, is the second biggest. The absence of the regional parties, and a lowered Basque nationalist vote, would have meant as many as 10 more seats for the PP, perhaps 10 fewer for the PSOE, and could have put Mr Aznar's party ahead. With strong gains across the board, the PP gained 8.1m votes, 2.8m more than in 1989. Perhaps as many as 1m of the extra votes came from the CDS, the small centrist party that on Sunday failed to return one the 14 it had in the outgoing parliament. The rest of the PP's votes came from the 3m-plus new voters. Swings towards the PP were very marked in the big cities. In Madrid, it gained an extra 220,000 votes against a 70,000 increase for the PSOE and returned 16 members to the 13 elected by Mr Gonzalez's party. The PP also, in one of the bigger upsets, captured Valencia. Although the PSOE captured all eight of Andalucia's provinces, with about half the votes in each, the PP gained the largest number of votes in three of the region's provincial capitals. To gain power, Mr Aznar has to strike deals with regionalists and nationalists. In all other respects, as Spaniards move to the cities and up the social ladder, and as more young people register to vote, the PP has time on its side.</p>

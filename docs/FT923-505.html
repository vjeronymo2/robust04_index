			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: UK banks The clearing banks have been early and major equity market beneficiaries of the devaluation. While the FT-SE has risen just less than 10 per cent, HSBC and National Westminster are up 11, Lloyds 14 and Barclays no less than 21 per cent. Barclays' sharp rebound may reflect the reasonable assumption that its final dividend, which was in doubt, is now secure. HSBC is helped by its earnings power in Hong Kong dollars. For the rest, the underlying impulse seems to be investor belief that banks are interest sensitive businesses whose earnings should respond quickly to the government's change of tack. That argument is, however, easily overstated. It would not do to count on UK bad debt provisions falling especially quickly. The banks' fortunes are heavily linked to the property market. It will take some time before lower interest rates actually produce an increase in asset prices, restoring value to the banks' collateral and floating their customers off the rocks. Consider, too, that bankruptcies usually continue to run at high levels after the cycle has turned. On top of that there is no reason to assume that consumers or business will suddenly become less debt averse, allowing loan demand to grow. The clearers are unlikely to see much organic growth in the short run, while lower interest rates will reduce their earnings on their free cash balances. It might be different if the yield curve were yet more sharply upward sloping. Then, as in the US, the banks could make easy money investing in long-term government paper, an activity that ties up little capital. But that would require base rates to fall a lot further, perhaps to 6 per cent, which looks remote. The best that can be said is that the situation is not getting worse, but results this autumn from TSB and Royal Bank of Scotland could produce reminders of how many provisions remain to be made.</p>

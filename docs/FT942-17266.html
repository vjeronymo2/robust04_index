			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Exporters upbeat about prospects British exporters are more confident about their prospects than at any time over the past two years, says a DHL Gallup survey. But many are worried that UK manufacturers are pricing themselves out of world markets. Almost seven out of 10 manufacturers surveyed have good or excellent expectations for export orders over the next 12 months and 56 per cent believe prospects are good for the next three months. The outlook for British exports has improved since sterling left the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992. However, 31 per cent of manufacturers fear that companies are using the pound's competitiveness to raise prices and, as a consequence, are losing orders. 'We must use our competitive edge to strive for increased market share,' said Mr Ian Campbell, director-general of the Institute of Export. Most companies expect an increase in sales in European Union markets. But the US and Canada are seen as the most promising growth markets. The Pacific Rim countries are seen as posing the greatest competitive threat. The survey of 501 manufacturing exporters was conducted between March 10 and March 17.</p>

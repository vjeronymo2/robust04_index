			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: CIBC earnings rise 20% Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Canada's second-biggest bank, saw net profits rise 20 per cent in the second quarter, and 23 per cent in the first half. Retail and corporate banking results were strong in the second quarter, said Mr Al Flood, chairman, and net non-performing loans declined for the fifth consecutive quarter. However, the investment banking unit was slowed by volatile markets and lower trading activity. CIBC's net profit for the three months ending April 30 was CDollars 217m (USDollars 156m) or 86 cents a share, against CDollars 180m or 75 cents a year earlier. The latest period included CDollars 18m from the sale of the bank's UK mortgage subsidiary. First-half earnings were CDollars 431m, or CDollars 1.72 a share, compared with CDollars 349m or CDollars 1.49 a year earlier. Second-quarter return on assets rose to 0.61 per cent from 0.54 per cent, and on equity to 11.9 per cent from 10.8 per cent. Non-interest income was strong. Wood Gundy, the investment banking unit, could not keep up the pace of the record first quarter, but still registered an increase on a year earlier. Net interest income rose 4 per cent. Total assets reached CDollars 147bn, up CDollars 2.6bn. Net non-performing loans at April 30 were CDollars 1.98bn or 1.9 per cent of total loans and acceptances, down from 2.9 per cent a year earlier. Loan loss provisions for fiscal 1994 were unchanged at CDollars 880m, half of which was charged in the first two quarters. Actual loan loss in fiscal 1993 was CDollars 920m.</p>

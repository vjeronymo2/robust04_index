			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Safe options for savers Guaranteed equity bonds offer two options to savers, writes Gillian O'Connor. At worst, they will get back a minimum guaranteed sum. The other is a return linked to the performance of the FT-SE 100 index, which could exceed the guaranteed minimum substantially if the equity market does well over the investment period - usually around five years. The table above, supplied by Swire Fraser, shows some possible results of a Pounds 10,000 investment. It gives the minimum return to a basic rate taxpayer; and the returns to both a basic and a higher rate taxpayer assuming the FT-SE index rises first by 25 per cent and then 50 by per cent. Many of the bonds also have a maximum pay-out, not shown here. The bonds are suitable for building society investors hoping for a better return but unwilling to take risks. Swire prefers those with a high minimum and a reasonably good stock market link, such as Johnson Fry, Save &amp; Prosper and Royal Scottish. The Legal &amp; General unit trust (also available as a Pep) is most suitable for people who might want to pull out their money during the five-year term.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- GUARANTEED EQUITY BONDS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         ---- 25% GROWTH ----    ---- 50% GROWTH ---- Name        Guarantee   Basic rate  Top rate    Basic rate  Top rate  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- J Fry Gtd      13,500       13,500    12,975       15,200     14,420 S&amp;P            13,000       13,000    12,550       15,200     14,420 Eagle Star     10,000       13,538    13,007       17,575     16,439 Zurich Life     9,000       16,500    15,525       16,500     15,525 GA Life        13,000       13,000    12,550       14,250     13,613 Nat West       10,000       12,500    12,125       15,000     14,250 Lloyds         11,875       11,875    11,594       13,750     13,188 Royal Scot     12,500       12,750    12,338       15,500     14,675 Halifax        11,125       11,875    11,500       13,750     13,000 L&amp;G            10,000       12,350    12,245       14,730     14,630  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Terms are for 5 years apart from Johnson Fry and Eagle Star (5 1/2 years); Save &amp; Prosper (5 1/4 years); Halifax (5.1 years).

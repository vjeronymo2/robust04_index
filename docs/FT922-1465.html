			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (20): Cray One supremacy challenged - Supercomputers GLANCE OUT of the plane window as your flight comes in to land and watch a selection of flaps and slats reshaping the wing. The pilot alters the airflow to maintain balance and full control of his aircraft. Stupendous mathematical calculations went into designing that wing. Airflow was assessed at every stage of the flight. That required the science of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and the only way to accomplish painless CFD is to use a supercomputer. Supercomputers sit above the traditional top-end machine, the mainframe. This division becomes blurred, with IBM offering a vector-processing model of its biggest box, the 3090. And vector-processing is the key to supercomputing. A vector processor takes a string of numbers and hurtles through mathematical options in a quarter of the time a conventional mainframe would take. While CFD calculations can now be performed on a number of machines it is the Cray One that has come to symbolise supercomputing. It is a tall curved cabinet with comfortable seats projecting from the base. The amiable exterior conceals a processing power that can play games with the airflow over, under and through a jet engine. British Aerospace uses a Cray to experiment with new designs for the Airbus wing. When BAe isn't running calculations on it, Rover cars borrows the machine for crash simulation. Familiar from a dozen car commercials, these tests entail massive crumpling of metal. The supercomputer can predict how folding metal contracts and where that impact will end. It is a lot cheaper than wrecking cars every week. . The Cray has become part of a technological myth. Supercomputers were the repository of secrets. Intelligence services used them to break codes. Nuclear physics were thrashed out on their processors. NASA bought them by the dozen to keep the space programme on track. Under the Cold War Cocom rules on high technology the export of any Cray machine was attended by rigorous security checks. Both the British and French nuclear weapons programmes were wholly dependent on the US releasing Crays for sale. US intelligence officials were livid when a supercomputer delivered to the French atomic research programme resurfaced in China. Adrian Hiley, principal engineer at Rover Group, describes a supercomputer as 'the fastest machine available to do the job'. It is a definition that threatens the supremacy of the Cray - the advent of powerful computer workstations based around advanced microchips has transferred some supercomputer functions to desktop machines. And supercomputer makers are suddenly under pressure to deliver value for money. A Cray can cost around Pounds 1m, but as Hiley puts it 'you get a heck of a lot more for your money now than you did five years ago'. The latest workstations dedicated to graphics can generate flight images good enough for training aircrew. Previous simulators called on the services of a supercomputer to conjure up a fast-changing environment. Parallel processors - single computers housing several processing devices working in unison - have also encroached on supercomputer business. Used to turbo-charge large databases, the parallel processor can churn through millions of records per second. Littlewoods dedicates a parallel processor from Teradata to analyse purchase patterns among direct mail customers. Any method of bringing processing power to bear on complex problems may lay claim to the supercomputing mantle. Executive Information Systems (EIS) filter vast amounts of data through a network to put appropriate facts in a digestible form on the right desktop terminal. The end result is simple, and so it should be. But the EIS vendors are muscling in on the intellectual territory of the supercomputer. The physical limits of supercomputer's silicon chip have nearly been reached. With each improvement in speed it becomes more difficult to maintain a vital low temperature. By the end of the decade the supercomputer will be overheated from within and overtaken from without by fresh technologies. Supercomputers have seen off one challenge. The Inmos Transputer, billed as Great British Invention and the Computer On A Chip, was envisaged as a poor man's supercomputer. The idea of parallel processing was harnessed to a unique manufacturing technique. Practical applications proved hard to come by and the early promise of the Transputer has yet to be realised. And the inexorable trend towards smaller machines means that the Cray One is assured of a place in history. To the human eye it remains the most striking computer ever built.</p>

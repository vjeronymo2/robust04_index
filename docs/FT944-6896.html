			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Walesa vetoes tax proposals Polish President Lech Walesa has vetoed proposals to maintain income tax rates at 21, 33 and 45 per cent for 1995. Mr Walesa, who is due to stand for re-election at the end of next year, argued that the rates were raised from 20, 30 and 40 per cent as a temporary measure in 1994 and should return to those levels in 1995. The move could mean that the president is preparing for confrontation with the government coalition headed by Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the Peasant party leader, over the budget when it is passed by parliament early in the new year. A successful veto on the budget would lead to early elections for parliament whose term expires in 1997.</p>

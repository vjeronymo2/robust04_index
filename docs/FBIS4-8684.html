			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement from the Albanian Foreign Ministry issued in </F> Tirana on 15 April -- read by announcer]    [Text] Concerning the misinterpretations that have come  from the Greek side on several aspects of the contacts between  the Albanian and Greek sides on the criminal act by a Greek  terrorist unit on 10 April at an army recruit training center in  Peshkepi in the Gjirokaster district, we issue the following  statement:    Among other things, the letter that the Greek foreign  minister sent to the UN Security Council chairman on 13 April  1994 claims that the Albanian foreign minister has not yet  responded to his Greek counterpart's proposal to meet to resolve  the crisis. It should be stressed that through its ambassador  in Tirana, the Greek side proposed a meeting between the foreign  ministers of both countries in Geneva on the occasion of a  bilateral conference. This was done at a time when the Greek  official reaction was not at all characterized by a will to  treat the case at the proper level or with any seriousness or  analyze the criminal act and discover and convict those  responsible. The Greek statements did not even see fit to  express any regret for the victims and their families.    Despite this totally unjustifiable position and considering  that he had no invitation to attend the bilateral activity in  Geneva, the Albanian foreign minister expressed his readiness to  meet his Greek counterpart in the most recent bilateral  activity, that of Crans Montana held in Bucharest, of course,  after the Greek Government had given an official response. We  add that this answer arrived yesterday, on 14 April, through the  Greek ambassador in Tirana.    Today, on 15 April 1994, we have informed the Greek side  that  the Albanian Government is ready for dialogue. The foreign  policy of the new democratic Albania has left behind the period  of communist isolation and it has never closed the way to  dialogue for resolving all the problems that exist between  Albania and other countries. Its relations with the Greek state  do not make any exception from this principle of its policy.    Regarding the version contained in the Greek foreign  minister's letter addressed to the UN Security Council chairman  that the Albanian authorities were very late in informing the  Greek side about the act of 10 April 1994, we can refer to the  refutation by the Public Order Ministry on 13 April. According  to this, the Greek side was informed at 0500 on the morning of  10 April by a border guard officer at the Albanian border  crossing of Kakavije, who went and met a border guard officer on  the Greek side to inform him about the crime and to ask him to  help apprehend the criminals. Nevertheless, no offer of  cooperation came from the Greek side.</p>

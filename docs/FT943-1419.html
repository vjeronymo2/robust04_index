			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Adams to land in US today Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, is due to arrive in Boston today for his second visit this year to the US. American officials confirmed that the administration had waived restrictions that would normally have prevented Mr Adams receiving a visa because of his associations with terrorism in Northern Ireland. His stay is limited to two weeks, with fund-raising banned. However, Mr Adams's visa allows him to visit nine cities - on his last visit, in February, he was restricted to New York. Mr Adams will not be received by Mr Bill Clinton, the president, or by Mr Al Gore, the vice-president - unlike Mr John Hume, leader of the moderate Social Democratic and Labour party, who visited Washington this week. Mr Adams will, however, meet senior administration officials and members of Congress - starting with Senator Edward Kennedy at Boston Airport today. Mr Ken Maginnis, one of the three Ulster Unionist MPs who also visited Washington this week, said his party was not opposed to Mr Adams receiving a visa, 'in so far as there is a ceasefire'. But Mr Jeffrey Donaldson, UUP secretary, said: 'We don't think it's a good idea because there is a danger that Gerry Adams's role is going to be hyped out of all proportion.' Ulster Unionists said they wanted to sound 'a constant note of caution' in Washington because 'in our view there is a measure of euphoria which is not justified'. Sinn Fein said last night it would try to open more than 200 cross-border roads between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic in a protest action over the weekend. This follows London's reopening of six minor crossings on Thursday and 10 others a week ago.</p>

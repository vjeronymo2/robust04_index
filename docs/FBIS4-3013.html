			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, 14 Apr (XINHUA) -- The experts of both  sides of the Sino-British Liaison Group have held an informal  talk on the right of residence in Hong Kong, mutual exemption of  visas, and other issues. After the talk concluded, Chinese  representative Chen Zuoer indicated that to encourage the Hong  Kong people who have emigrated to other areas to return to Hong  Kong, the Chinese side will leniently handle the question of the  right of residence for these people.    Chen Zuoer said: The Chinese side welcomes Hong Kong's  permanent residents of Chinese nationality who have emigrated  to, and become citizens of, a foreign country to return to serve  Hong Kong, because they are familiar with Hong Kong and many are  experienced specialized professionals. Their return after  emigrating will demonstrate that they still have feelings toward  Hong Kong and China.    He stressed: To encourage Hong Kong emigrants to return, the  Chinese side will adopt a fairly lenient measure to handle the  question of the right of residence for those who return.  However, this is to help those who return to continue serving  Hong Kong. The measure is by no means aimed at encouraging  those who are still in Hong Kong to emigrate to foreign  countries. Chen Zuoer indicated no matter what measures are  used, the Chinese side will, on the basis of relevant laws,  strive to have the current relevant regulations and provisions  of Hong Kong converge with the relevant provisions of the Basic  Law of the future Hong Kong Autonomous Administrative Region.</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> 2 POLICIES ON COLLEGE BOOKS ARE RESCINDED  </P> <P> A requirement that books purchased for Saddleback Community College District  libraries "contribute to maintaining high moral standards" was eliminated this  week after teachers complained that it was too vague.  </P> <P> The board of trustees agreed on a 5-3 vote to rescind the 21-year-old policy,  along with a requirement that books "stimulate intellectual curiosity."  </P> <P> The majority agreed with teachers who argued that it was too difficult to  decide what constitutes high moral standards and what does not.  </P> <P> "The librarians should be choosing material that is academically sound and not  be deciding whose morals to uphold," said Trustee Shirley Gellatly, who voted  to rescind the policy.  </P> <P> "There have been people elsewhere who have tried to ban 'The Wizard of Oz' -- a  book that my family enjoys -- because they think there is no such thing as a  good witch," student Trustee Kymberly Pine said.  </P> <P> Trustee Iris Swanson said, "I see no conflict between saying that we are going  to maintain high moral standards and academic freedom."  </P> <P> Swanson, along with Trustees John C. Connolly and Joan J. Hueter, voted against  rescinding the requirement.  </P> <P> "If anybody in the community challenges what we teach or have in our library,  it would befall the members of the board to address the issue," Connolly said.  </P> <P> Irvine Valley College librarian Fred Forbes said the policy change will have no  effect on his purchasing decisions.  </P> <P> "The books and the materials that are purchased are related to our courses and  their content and not bought just to get them," Forbes said. "That's the first  level. Secondly, we buy reference books and other materials that are related to  lifetime learning."  </P> <P> Forbes said the library does not subscribe to "Playboy" or other magazines of  that genre, which can sometimes be found in college libraries. "But if we did,"  he said, "it would be because a teacher requested it in order to illustrate  something in advertising -- or maybe a women's studies professor who wanted to  have a discussion about such magazines. It wouldn't be for the students'  titillation."  </P> <P> Board President Marcia Milchiker and Trustees Robert L. Moore and Harriet S.  Walther also voted to rescind the policy.

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Shaftesbury reduces loss to Pounds 2.3m Shaftesbury, the commercial property company, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.3m for the six months to end-March, against a loss of Pounds 5.86m in the comparable period. Net revenue from properties improved from Pounds 2.34m to Pounds 2.53m but there was a deficit on sales of properties amounting to Pounds 403,000 compared with a profit of Pounds 47,000 last time. Provisions against the cost of development properties fell from Pounds 3.92m to Pounds 1.03m. Losses per share were reduced to 9.1p (23.9p). Mr Peter Levy, chairman, said that while there might now be some feeling of optimism, he believed there was no immediate prospect of a significant improvement in the property market.</p>

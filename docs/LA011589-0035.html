			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRUNCH: THE MISSING LINK  </P> <P> In the '70s, the decadence of ancient times could be found at big-city  discotheques, college fraternity toga parties and all-you-could-eat brunches  (champagne included) in Marina del Rey. King Tut was front-page news, Cher  looked like Cleopatra and Plato's Retreat was hot. Now discos are turning into  supper clubs, and Cher's Cleo look, like Tut and togas and Plato's, is a  distant memory.  </P> <P> All that remains is brunch.  </P> <P> Brunch is the culinary missing link to hearty eaters of the past. Look back in  history and you'll find that while brunch wasn't institutionalized until the  '60s and '70s, the concept of voluptuous eating goes back to ancient times. A  comparison between Barbara Norman's "Tales of the Table," an authoritative work  on the history of Western cuisine, and more contemporary sources from the '80s  reveals that the spirit of excess survives in the weekend brunch:  </P> <P> Then: "The scale of feasts of the past is almost unbelievable . . . literally  hundreds of cattle were slaughtered."  </P> <P>  -- "Tales of the Table"  </P> <P> Now: "The (hotel) goes through 60 gallons of eggs, 12 gallons of salads, 75  pounds of bacon and up to 16 cases of champagne, plus other offerings and  desserts."  </P> <P>  -- The L.A. Times on an Orange County brunch  </P> <P> Then: ". . . As many as 30,000 individual dishes (were) presented on the menu."  </P> <P>  -- "Tales of the Table"  </P> <P> Now: "Feed from the restaurant's eight stations, which include an eggs Benedict  station, a Belgian waffles stop, a build-your-own-omelet bar, a fajitas bar, a  fresh fruit and salad bar, shrimp and ceviche bar, an oyster and clam bar . . .  and a hot fudge sundae bar."  </P> <P>  -- The L.A. Times on a Mother's Day brunch  </P> <P> Then: "Food (was) ground to a pulp and mixed with sugar."  </P> <P>  -- "Tales of the Table"  </P> <P> Now: "Strawberry soup is refreshing, though creamy enough to clog the arteries  of a marathon runner."  </P> <P>  -- The L.A. Times on a resort brunch item  </P> <P> Then: " 'So the whole day long till sundown we sat and feasted on our rich  supply of meat washed down by mellow wine,' (Homer writes) as Odysseus and his  companion consume a large ram offered to Zeus."  </P> <P>  -- "Tales of the Table"  </P> <P> Now: Chuck -- "You say you're kind of wild?" TV game show contestant -- "That's  right, Chuck. For instance, my girlfriends and I will get together during the  weekend and go to brunch." Chuck -- "Brunch? Brunch is wild?" Contestant --  "Well, yeah. I mean brunch can last all day -- sometimes 14 or 15 hours." Chuck  -- "O-kaay."  </P> <P>  -- "The Love Connection"  </P> <P> Then: "The endless eating alternated with jousts or hunts."  </P> <P>  -- "Tales of the Table"  </P> <P> Now: "Not only will the Easter bunny hop about the premises and pose with  youngsters who want complimentary picture-souvenirs, there's a petting zoo too,  with real live rabbits, chickens and goats. Work up a healthy appetite at the  Easter egg hunt. "  </P> <P>  -- The L.A. Times on Easter brunches  </P> <P> Then: "Feasts were also politically useful, both in cementing ties and in  impressing . . . dignitaries."  </P> <P>  -- "Tales of the Table"  </P> <P> Now: "The women meet once a month in the Glendale YWCA on East Lexington Avenue  for political briefings, legislative 'action alerts' on bills in Sacramento and  the study of global issues, along with brunch."  </P> <P>  -- The L.A. Times on a Republican women's study group  </P> <P> Then: "Courses of food were interspersed with wild practical jokes, outlandish  pageants, and pantomimes with ingenious mechanical devices and animated  figures."  </P> <P>  -- "Tales of the Table"  </P> <P> Now: "At the brunch, the entertainment will begin with a marching band and will  continue with a jazz group, a mariachi band and a troupe of mimes and  jugglers."  </P> <P>  -- The L.A. Times on a Super Bowl day brunch  </P> <P> Then: "Feasting was not all fun. Starting with the early Greek religious rites,  public feasts were an instrument for satisfying the public and keeping the poor  under control."  </P> <P>  -- "Tales of the Table"  </P> <P> Now: "Amid the graffiti-covered warehouses south of downtown, brunch and Easter  services (were provided) to more than 2,000 homeless men, women and children. .  . . A block of 5th Street was cordoned off and metal folding chairs and tables  were covered festively with pink cellophane. Volunteers served up a meal of  hard-boiled eggs, corned beef hash, peaches, doughnuts and fruit punch."  </P> <P>  -- The L.A. Times on Easter activities  </P> <P> Then: "When there is too much wealth and leisure, cooking, like all arts,  lapses into a decadance in which cost and elaborate form take precedence over  taste and content."  </P> <P>  -- "Tales of the Table"  </P> <P> Now: "(Brunch) assumes, as do so many of our urban appurtenances, a measure of  social significance, and so the selection of where one . . . makes a brunch  appearance, becomes in many cases far more important than the quality of the  food to be consumed because in a real sense, when you choose your brunch you  choose your caste, you opt for a certain set."  </P> <P>  -- The New York Times on the chic identity of brunch  </P></p>

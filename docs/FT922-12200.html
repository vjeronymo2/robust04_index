			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Retailers report rise in Easter spending RETAILERS yesterday reported a growing sense of confidence as takings in many stores rose sharply. The City is still expecting retail sales for March - the figures are published on Friday - to be unchanged from February and to be down on March a year ago, but in the shops the Easter weekend has helped to remove the uncertainty created in the approach to the general election. In Oxford Street, London, Mr Tony Butler, general manager of DH Evans, reported brisk activity over the whole of the holiday weekend with 'an exceptionally good' Monday. He estimated that takings would be as much as 50 per cent higher than a year ago. At the MetroCentre in Gateshead, north-east England, Mr David Thomson, Littlewoods store manager and chairman of the shopping centre's tenants association, said: 'We are very pleased with the level of business. There does seem to have been a release of consumer spending. 'This is the first seasonal peak of the year, and it is nice to have it in a climate that is becoming more spending oriented. If Easter had fallen before the election, we would not have had a particularly successful period.' Mr Thomson said takings were about 9 per cent higher than Easter a year ago, when spending was boosted artificially by the imminent rise in value added tax. Even at the Brent Cross shopping centre in north-west London, where trading has been affected by the nearby IRA bombing 11 days ago, retailers reported better-than-expected levels of business. At the Lakeside Shopping Centre, Thurrock, Mr Richard Lusty, House of Fraser store manager, said: 'Good Friday was a bumper day. The car parks were full. Customers were definitely spending. We certainly had the feeling that the end of the recession had started. 'On Friday there was definitely a buzz. There is not spending in a silly mood, but there is a sign of confidence coming back to the stores.' Alton Towers, the Staffordshire theme park in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times has a stake, had about 20 per cent more visitors than last year. Mr Nick Varney, Alton Towers divisional marketing director, said: 'It's the most successful Easter ever.' Ms Bronwyn Gold Blyth of Lunn Poly, the UK's biggest travel agent chain, reported 'good business' on Saturday. The interest in Pounds 400-Pounds 450 package holidays to the Mediterranean has held up well in recent weeks, in spite of the recession and election uncertainty. Since the election, though, more people are again looking to more expensive locations such as the Caribbean Australasia and the Far East.</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Money Markets and Foreign Exchanges: Watching the polls THE MARKET will be looking for a stronger performance from the dollar this week while watching for the effect of UK opinion polls on sterling, writes Neil Buckley. The US currency was felt by many to have underperformed last week, failing to take advantage of data showing a sharp rise in retail sales, and a rise in non-farm payrolls. Many dealers feel a consumer-led recovery is now under way and will be keeping a close eye on this week's industrial production, inflation and housing starts figures on Tuesday, jobless claims on Thursday, and trade figures on Friday. If these are as strong as expected, they could give the dollar the impetus it needs to challenge the DM1.68 and Y135 barriers. Some analysts suggest that if the market overcomes last week's reticence, the dollar could reach DM1.70 and Y137. As sterling continues to look weak ahead of the UK general election on April 9, all attention will be fixed on the opinion polls, and on the opposition Labour party's alternative Budget on Tuesday. Thursday's unemployment figures, expected to show an increase of around 35,000, will also be crucial, for political as much as economic reasons. Mr David Deakin of Nikko Bank warned: 'It is only just now sinking in among the dealing fraternity that there is a reasonable probability of there being a Labour majority, and that is causing a lot of concern.' 'There is a big risk on the downside for sterling.' He said a strong showing by Labour in the opinion polls would see sterling continue to fall against the D-mark, dragging down with it the peseta, top-placed currency in the Exchange Rate Mechanism, possibly even as far as its absolute floor of DM2.7780.</p>

Since the massacre of  fasting worshipers in the al-Khalil mosque, the Zionist regime  has resorted to a policy of suppression and persuasion in a bid  to limit reaction to the tragedy inside occupied Palestine.  However, these policies have not yielded the results that Tel  Aviv wished.    The Zionist regime's decision to release 500 more  Palestinian  political prisoners yesterday, as well as the disarming of some  extremist Palestinian [as heard] groups and the payment of  compensation to the families of the martyrs of the tragedy at  the Ibrahimi shrine, are among the persuasive efforts that the  Zionist regime has resorted to hoping to prevent the Palestinian  Muslims from spreading the intifadah. The suppression of  Palestinian demonstrators who were protesting the massacre of  the worshipers in the Ibrahimi mosque, which has resulted in  several deaths and injuries, are among the terrorist acts that  the Zionist regime hoped would end the reactions to the recent  tragedy.    Political analysts believe that the Zionist regime's  policies  of persuasion and suppression have not yielded the results that  Tel Aviv wished but have further clarified the nature of this  regime. This regime, which has claimed that it does not have  even one political prisoner and that all prisoners are under  criminal charges, has displayed contradictory behavior with the  release of 1,300 Palestinian prisoners in the past few days.  This step by the Zionist regime, with which it is trying to  limit the wave of rage from the Palestinian Muslims, has  revealed that the Zionist regime's allegations on Palestinian  prisoners are not true, since according to the Zionist regime's  penal code criminals cannot be released without approval from  the cabinet.    Also, the Zionist regime's efforts to suppress the  Palestinian demonstrators, which has resulted in hundreds of  deaths and injuries, has only resulted in its disgrace. By  massacring the Palestinian Muslims in the streets and alleys of  the occupied territories, this regime, which stated that the  tragedy at the shrine was perpetrated by an insane person, has  revealed an aggressive nature that is not very different from  that of the allegedly insane criminal.</p>

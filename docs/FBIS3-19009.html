			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bosnia/Vatican: Pope Praises the UN </F> Protection Force"]    [Text] Vatican City, 10 Mar (ANSA) -- Pope John Paul II  today praised the work being done by United Nations forces in  Bosnia and solemnly reaffirmed the Holy See's pledge to do  whatever was in its power to encourage the search for peace with  respect for the people themselves, and for their family, social  and religious life.    The occasion for these remarks today was the pope's meeting  here with a group of soldiers from a Canadian regiment on its  way home from a stint in Bosnia as part of the UN peacekeeping  force.    The pope said he wished to underscore his great esteem for  the UN forces from diverse nations which are helping to limit,  despite extremely difficult conditions, the fighting underway in  Bosnia and who are doing everything possible to move that  country closer to peace.    The pontiff praised their perseverance and dedication in  serving as "efficient agents of international solidarity."    He told the Canadians that their presence had allowed  humanitarian aid to reach populations which had been reduced,  "through interminable sieges and fighting," to living under  material and psychological conditions pushed to the very limits  of what is humanly bearable.    Without the presence in Bosnia of United Nations forces, the  situation in that war-torn land would be even more tragic than  it is already, the pope concluded.</p>

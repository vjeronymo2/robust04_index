			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading Continued worries about inflation brought heavy selling in Footsie futures, helping to reverse an advance in the cash market, writes Joel Kibazo. Having opened firmly at 2,988, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 fell on inflation worries to trade around the 2,880 level for the next few hours. The lunchtime release of stronger than anticipated US durable goods data brought renewed fears of an increase in interest rates. Futures traders sold the contract heavily, with independent traders (locals), together with a leading US investment bank, noted as active participants in the trading. The strong downward pressure was soon having an impact on the cash market and after initial resistance it too buckled under the selling pressure, reversing an early advance. The contract traded at a discount to the underlying market for a large part of the session. September ended at 2,935, down 33 from the previous day's close and at a 20-point discount to its fair value premium to cash of about 13 points. Volume was 15,580. It was a dull day in the traded options sector and turnover was 24,025 contracts, against a previous 33,792 lots. The FT-SE 100 option only saw business of 9,236 contracts. British Gas was the busiest stock option with 2,627 contracts traded.</p>

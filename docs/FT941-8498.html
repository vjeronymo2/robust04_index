			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Newcastle and Birmingham to cut council tax Council tax levels for 1994-95 will be lower than last year in several of the metropolitan authorities which face elections in May. The government predicted last December that council taxes would rise by an average of 7 per cent. But this seems certain to conceal big variations caused mainly by last year's overhaul of the standard spending assessment system used for government grants. Birmingham, which is Labour-controlled, is reducing its council tax for band D properties from Pounds 657 to Pounds 632. Newcastle upon Tyne, also Labour-controlled, expects to cut council tax in this band from Pounds 791.81 to Pounds 771. Other Labour authorities in the north-east also expect reductions - of about 8.5 per cent for Sunderland and 6.1 per cent for South Tyneside. In London, Tory-controlled Westminster, recently accused of 'gerrymandering' by the district auditor, has cut band D council tax from Pounds 295 to Pounds 245, although many residents may pay more because of the phasing-out of government transitional relief. Cuts are also predicted in the council tax precepts from three counties  - Durham, Northumberland and Oxfordshire. County council precepts make up the bulk of the council tax in non-metropolitan areas, although the tax is collected by districts, and final council tax figures can be set only once district and parish figures have been added. Provisional figures from the Labour-controlled Association of County Councils show big variations. While Northumberland expects to cut its precept by 5.1 per cent from Pounds 491.31 to Pounds 466.68, five counties expect increases of more than 10 per cent - 10.3 per cent for Suffolk, 10.5 per cent for Nottinghamshire, 11 per cent for East Sussex, 11.5 per cent for Northamptonshire, 12.8 per cent for Cleveland and 13.9 per cent for Hampshire. Precepts range in value from Hampshire at Pounds 420.84 for band D properties to Cleveland at Pounds 578.70. Mr Paul Harford, leader of Labour-controlled Cleveland county council, which is due to be abolished next year as part of the review of local government, said the government was 'feather-bedding taxpayers in the south of England at the expense of people in this area'. The new system of grants is the biggest factor behind the shifts, although the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities said that some councils had collected much more in the first year of council tax than they had budgeted for, allowing them much more flexibility in setting this year's budgets. Falling interest rates have also cut councils' planned debt repayments.</p>

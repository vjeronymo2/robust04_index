			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Kwik Save Kwik Save has done well to improve earnings in a harsh environment. The food discounter suffered a 1 per cent decline in its selling prices in its first half year but managed to contain the decline in trading margins to just 0.1 per cent and increase earnings per share by 7 per cent. But it will be hard to repeat the performance. Price competition is intensifying while the scope to squeeze further costs out of the supply chain is probably declining. The main problem is in groceries, where the pace of price cuts has stepped up. Year-on-year deflation averaged 2 per cent during the half year but has since risen to 3.5 per cent. Moreover, Kwik Save is struggling to increase sales: like-for-like sales are currently running at 1 per cent less than their level of a year ago. Though chief executive Mr Graeme Bowler may be right to blame the government's tax rises, tougher competition from superstores and rival discounters must also be a factor. Kwik Save's strategy for growth is now dependent on its ambitious store opening programme. The group plans to double the number of outlets to 1,600 over seven to ten years. Its return of 35 per cent or more on capital clearly justifies further expansion. Still, given the sector's existing overcapacity and rival groups' expansion plans, further price pressure looks inevitable. Since Kwik Save's market positioning has exposed it to more severe price deflation than Tesco or J. Sainsbury, the recent underperformance in its share price seems logical.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>   [Text] Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs Juri Luik, who  returned from a visit to Brussels on Thursday [7 April], told a  press conference that despite the failure of the last, 18th  round of the Estonian-Russian inter-state negotiations in Moscow  yesterday, Estonia intended to continue the negotiations.    On Wednesday, Russia removed the clause in the draft  Russian-  Estonian troop withdrawal agreement obligating Russia to pull  its troops out of Estonia by 31 August 1994, saying the final  date would reappear in the draft agreement if Estonia altered  its legislation on military retirees, Estonian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs informed ETA yesterday. In essence this move set  talks back to last August, before Russia had proposed a final  withdrawal date, the Ministry said in its statement.    "There is always sense in continuing the negotiations," Luik  said, recalling that already after the 17th round the  negotiations were almost broken, but stressing that the  negotiations had to be continued with the aim of 31 August as  the Russian troop withdrawal deadline.    He added that in case of a wish from the Russian side Russia  could pull out its 2,500 troops from Estonia much quicker than  August 31. "There are no practical obstacles to troop  withdrawal, there is only a political inability from the Russian  side," he said.    Ago Tiiman, the secretary of the Estonian delegation at the  negotiations explained a press conference on Thursday that the  Russian delegation had made a proposal to grant residence  permits automatically to all retired Russian military, including  "the officers that will resign e.g. tomorrow". He said that the  Russian side demanded that Estonia give the flats used by the  retirees to their private ownership, saying that a privately  owned flat could be sold much more favourably by those that  leave than only the so-called "propiska".    Tiiman said that the Russian delegation made its proposals  in  "a sharp ultimatum style". As the demands were similar to those  adopted in the Russian-Latvian agreement, the text of which  Estonian delegation had at hand, Estonia was prepared to the  pressure of the Russian side, he added.    Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed ETA on  Thursday  that 30 House members of the US Congress sent letters on April 4  to President Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher  urging the Administration to insist that Russia honor its  commitment to withdraw from Estonia and Latvia by August 31,  1994.    "If we abandon our insistence that Russia remove its troops  from the Baltics on schedule, we will only strengthen the  hard-liners in Russia who wish to expand their influence and  regain lost territory. The removal of all Russian troops from  the independent yet fragile Baltic countries is crucial for  stability, peace and democracy in the Baltics, and for  continuing good relations between the United States and Russia,"  reads the letter.    Russian allegations of human rights violations in Estonia  and  Latvia, a claim Moscow uses to justify Russian military  presence, were rejected in this letter. Signatories also agreed  that Russian demands for housing, pensions and resident status  for former Russian officers are "completely unjustified, and are  simply intended to prolong the Russian occupation of the  Baltics."    Estonian Minister of Population Peeter Olesk told ETA,  however, that it was to be expected that Russia will "increase  pressure on Estonia at the final phase of the bilateral  negotiations" and "dispute Estonia's belonging to European  states". "Russia has always been interested in destabilizing our  independence and will not step back on the issue," he said.</p>

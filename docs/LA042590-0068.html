			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> POINT LOMA HOLDS OFF MIRA MESA  </P> <P> As far as Mira Mesa Coach Mike Prosser is concerned, the cast reaching to star  pitcher Mike Bovee's thigh, has immobilized more than his leg. It has paralyzed  the confidence of some of his players.  </P> <P> Bovee, playing shortstop, suffered a broken ankle Thursday against Serra in a  play at second base. Tuesday, he sat on the sidelines and watched Point Loma  jump all over top-ranked Mira Mesa early, then hold on for a 6-5 victory in a  pivotal City Eastern League game at Mira Mesa.  </P> <P> "Bovee is outstanding, and (Marc) Nielsen's a good pitcher," said Point Loma  Coach Rod Hall. "But I don't know who else they have."  </P> <P> Prosser is beginning to wonder as well.  </P> <P> "He's a big part of our team," he said, "but one player doesn't make a team. If  we think we can't win without him, then we have a problem."  </P> <P> Mira Mesa's problems began in the third. Point Loma took a 2-0 lead when Chason  Booher scored on an error by left fielder Joey Lo Duca and on Matt Ray's RBI  single to shallow right.  </P> <P> The problems worsened when Point Loma went through its order in the sixth and  scored four runs on three hits, one walk, one error and one hit batter.  </P> <P> Mira Mesa countered with a four-run sixth of its own, scoring on a walk, a hit  batter, and a two-run single by Nielsen.  </P> <P> About this time, Bill Hall, Point Loma's coach, was begining to feel his  stomach churn.  </P> <P> "We've lost two game in the bottom of the seventh," he said. "I didn't want to  see that happen again."  </P> <P> Hall was spared. Although Mira Mesa scored one in the seventh on two walks, a  sacrifice bunt and a fly ball to center field, the Marauders left the tying run  on second on a groundout to closer Dan Maringer, a sophomore, who came into the  inning to relieve Ray. With no outs and one on, Maringer walked the first  batter he faced, but got the next three in order.  </P> <P> Starter Mel Shanley (5-2) gave up three hits and walked three in five innings  -- he also faced three batters in the sixth -- and picked up the victory.  Maringer got the save.  </P> <P> Point Loma (11-10, 5-2) is in a two-way league tie with Mira Mesa (16-3, 5-2).  KIM Q. BERKSHIRE  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> OIL TANKER RAMS PIER  </P> <P> The 883-foot Overseas Juneau, a tanker carrying 17 million gallons of crude  oil, hit a pier and demolished a 100-foot section of a concrete catwalk while  trying to dock at the Chevron refinery at Richmond, narrowly missing a major  crude oil pipeline. Chevron port superintendent Charlie Adam told the San  Francisco Chronicle that "50 feet this way (and) it'd have been a total  disaster." The incident, which occurred three weeks after the Exxon Valdez ran  aground in Alaska's Prince William Sound, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of  oil, is under investigation by the state Board of Pilot Commissioners and the  Coast Guard. Maritime Overseas Corp. of New York, which operates the Overseas  Juneau, declined comment.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hanoi, February 17 (XINHUA) -- Vietnamese Foreign  Ministry spokeswoman Ho The Lan said today that normalization of  Vietnamese-U.S. ties should have no political conditions  attached.    She told reporters that Vietnam would hold dialogue with the  United States on all issues of common concern, including human  rights, on the basis of equality and mutual respect but  including non-interference in each other's internal affairs.    She said that the process of normalization of relations  would  depend on the efforts and sincerity of both sides.    Since the United States announced it was lifting its trade  embargo against Vietnam on February 3, the human-rights issue  has become the major problem in Vietnamese-U.S. relations.    The U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord, who is  in charge of Asian affairs, has said the relations between the  two countries would develop only if Vietnam demonstrates an  improvement in its approach to human rights.    However, Ho The Lan said that although Vietnam believes in  the importance of developing ties with the U.S. it would be on  the basis of non-interference in each other's internal affairs.    She added that the two sides have agreed to discuss in Hanoi  the set-up of liaison offices and will hold talks on the human  rights issue in New York at the end of this month.</p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDICARE DRUG BENEFITS PERILED BY RISING COSTS  </P> <P> Cost estimates of the controversial Medicare catastrophic care program have  risen so dramatically that Congress might have to reconsider coverage of  prescription drugs, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.)  said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The newly pessimistic appraisal of the program's cost is a dramatic reversal  for Bentsen and will give ammunition to critics who have pushed to delay its  implementation.  </P> <P> Previously, Bentsen had said that the drug benefit fund would have excess  revenues that could be used to reduce the surtax levied to finance catastrophic  care.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Serious Look' Needed  </P> <P> However, at a Finance Committee hearing Tuesday, Bentsen said that "a serious  look has to be taken at the benefits" in the catastrophic care legislation  because of rising cost estimates. High on the list of benefits to be considered  is "prescription drugs, whether that should be retained or dropped," he said.  </P> <P> Bentsen was immediately criticized by Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.), one of the key  Republican members of the committee, who said that it would be a "grave error"  to cut the drug benefit. By first promising a surtax cut and now saying that  the surplus funds have disappeared, Bentsen "has left himself and the rest of  us a bit out on a limb," Heinz said.  </P> <P> The drug benefit "has the best value and does the most benefit for the greatest  number of people," among all the provisions of the catastrophic care bill,  Heinz said. At least 5 million people a year would be helped with their drug  bills, he said.  </P> <P> Bentsen's pessimism on costs will intensify the already volatile debate over  catastrophic care, adopted by Congress last year as the biggest expansion of  Medicare benefits since the program was created in 1965.  </P> <P> Starting Jan. 1, the law provided unlimited hospital care after the beneficiary  pays the first $560. Future benefits are planned to include a cap on  out-of-pocket spending for doctor bills, and phased-in coverage of prescription  drugs for the first time.  </P> <P> Because of budget constraints, Congress decided to require all 33 million  Medicare beneficiaries to pay $4 a month for the new services.  </P> <P> But the bulk of the program's financing is to come from a surtax that will be  levied on only the 40% of beneficiaries who pay federal income taxes. This  surtax, which is called a supplemental premium, is calculated at the rate of  $22.50 for every $150 owed in federal taxes. Thus, a person with a federal tax  bill of $1,500 would pay another $225 for the catastrophic care program. The  premium rises with income, reaching a maximum of $800 a year for an individual  and $1,600 for a married couple.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Higher Taxes Opposed  </P> <P> The surtax, which will be paid for the first time with 1989 tax returns filed  next year, generated considerable controversy, particularly among retired  government employees, military personnel and union workers already enjoying  good medical coverage. These retirees argue that they will be paying higher  taxes for coverage that they already have.  </P> <P> Bentsen and other supporters of the law have barely fought off efforts in the  Senate to delay its implementation. In an effort to assuage the critics,  Bentsen had said that he would support a cut in the surtax of as much as 16%  because of an expected surplus of revenues.  </P> <P> But he met Monday with officials of the Congressional Budget Office who told  him that the cost of the drug benefit may be far greater than expected. The  benefit begins with a few rare drugs next year. In 1991, the program will pay  half the cost of prescription drugs and insulin after the patient pays the  first $600.  </P> <P> Although the benefit has yet to begin, estimates have been soaring because drug  prices are rising rapidly, as are estimates of the amount of drugs that the  elderly will consume when the government helps pay the bill.  </P> <P> The Finance Committee on Tuesday heard a long list of witnesses appeal for  delay or changes in the catastrophic program.  </P> <P> "There is a great desire for change in this area," said Sen. Larry Pressler  (R-S.D.). The special surtax is a "burden borne by too few people," he said.  </P> <P> Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.) called for a delay of one or two years in the full  catastrophic care coverage. Congress should take "a broad look at our future  direction in health care for retirees -- a topic of which catastrophic coverage  is only a part."  </P> <P> Some critics of the catastrophic care program say that it should be offered on  a voluntary basis, giving Medicare beneficiaries the chance to reject this  additional coverage.  </P></p>

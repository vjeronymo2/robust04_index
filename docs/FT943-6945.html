			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Pension reform a key to Italy's budget problems: Andrew Hill reports from Milan on a move which would not only yield much needed savings but represent, in theory at least, a permanent structural change in the country's public finances Two blind Italians have just come under police investigation. One is apparently a sharpshooting huntsman; the other drives a van for the local education authority. Both claim a state disability pension and an allowance for a sighted companion, which is good news for other drivers, but bad for ducks and the Italian Treasury. They are among the first targets of a nationwide sweep to eliminate widespread fraud in the state's invalidity pension scheme. They are also being cited by Italian ministers and the media as symbols of Italy's state pensions crisis. Pensions reform is by no means the only challenge facing Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government as it returns today from a short summer holiday. But analysts believe it may be the key to unlocking the central problem of Italy's public finances, posed by Mr Lamberto Dini, the Treasury minister, before the summer break: how to cut the budget deficit to L138,600bn (Pounds 57bn) or 9.4 per cent of gross domestic product next year, compared with L154,000bn (Pounds 63bn) estimated for this year. The government needs to find L45,000bn over the next year by raising revenue and cutting spending. According to one undersecretary at the Treasury, that figure could rise to more than L50,000bn, because of the additional cost of financing the national debt following the half-point rise in interest rates earlier this month. Mr Dini outlined some of the likely budget measures in July. They include an amnesty on the backlog of tax assessment cases which could generate L15,000bn of new revenues, and a similar pardon for buildings constructed without proper planning permission which could raise a further L5,400bn. The significance of pensions reform in this complicated equation is not that it could supply a further L7,000bn-L8,000bn of savings in 1995, but that it would represent, in theory at least, a permanent structural change in Italy's public finances. The bare statistics supplied by INPS, the national pension fund, illustrate the extent of the problem. According to figures released earlier this year, INPS expects to pay out L250,973bn in pensions and social assistance for 1994, while receiving only L178,823bn. The shortfall is covered by transfers from the Treasury, which helps explain why Mr Dini was one of the only government ministers not to take any summer holiday. Industry and investors are pressing for swift and decisive action to tackle the problem. 'What's needed is an across-the-board solution based on strong principles of equity for everybody,' said Mr Stefano Micossi, head of the research unit of Confindustria, the Italian employers' federation, yesterday. Such a solution, according to Treasury sources, would require an end to a number of obvious anomalies in the Italian system. Fraud. This is the area where there is probably the greatest consensus, although there are differences of opinion about the extent of the problem and whether it should be solved, like other fraud problems inherited from Italy's corrupt old system, with an amnesty for blind drivers and their like. Pensionable age. Mr Giuliano Amato, when prime minister, proposed a harmonisation of pensionable age to 65 for men, and 60 for women - but only by 2002. This is too slow, Treasury sources suggest, especially as workers in different sectors are entitled to retire at different ages. The yield for calculating pensions. Italians accumulate pension provisions at a faster rate than do citizens of most other European countries - 2 per cent a year. Thus, after only 15 years of contributions, Italians are already entitled to a pension worth 30 per cent of their average salary in the final years of employment. The average figure in France is 1-1.3 per cent, and in Germany 1.5 per cent. Pensions paid to workers. Certain pension benefits continue to be paid to workers who retire from one job, only to start a second career, for example as self-employed shopkeepers. Even if all these problems are solved, the government may still have to find a way to deal with a constitutional court ruling earlier this year, which could oblige the state to pay more than L30,000bn to top up existing pensions. Perhaps sensibly, the Treasury is waiting for confirmation of the legal position before acting. The difficulty for the Treasury in tackling the basic anomalies is that the prospect of cutting pension benefits is highly sensitive. Mr Clemente Mastella, Italy's labour minister, hinted in a newspaper interview published on Tuesday, that indiscriminate cuts would bring angry pensioners into the piazza to protest. Labour unions are also keeping an extremely close eye on the plans, and the Treasury itself is likely to propose at first a range of solutions to the problem to avoid inflaming the first cabinet discussion. In the past few days, however, the tone of the pensions debate has calmed somewhat. For one thing, the government has made it clear that there will be no attack on pension rights accumulated under the existing, albeit extravagant, system. Mr Mastella has also adopted a more sombre tone, warning that everybody will have to make sacrifices. Mr Berlusconi's chief of staff said yesterday that public finances would not be on the formal agenda of today's cabinet meeting, but Treasury sources indicated that the government will be looking to submit a 1995 budget to parliamentary scrutiny well before the end-September deadline. Amid the political brouhaha, Mr Dini is certain of one thing: any delay is likely to be pounced on by the political opposition, and by the markets.</p>

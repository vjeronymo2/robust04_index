			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Johannesburg Feb 3 SAPA -- There was good economic  news coming for South Africa, Finance Minister Derek Keys told  the National Party [NP] federal congress at the World Trade  Centre near Johannesburg on Thursday [3 February]. He said he  could not pre-empt any detailed announcement, but it sufficed to  say it was very good news. "It is the type of situation every  finance minister dreams of, when all the figures are running in  the right direction," he said.    Mr Keys was one of a number of ministers and senior party  members selected to address the congress on the party's new  election manifesto. He said there were three basic differences  between the NP and its main opponent, the African National  Congress [ANC], on economic policy.    Firstly, the NP's policy was for everyone, and not seeking  economic growth and advancement of any sector at the expense of  another.    Secondly, the NP trusted all the economic players -- labour,  the farmers, businessmen and entrepreneurs. "We are proud of  them," he said. The NP did not want to take away their capital,  monitor them or constantly watch to see they were not doing  something wrong.    Thirdly, he said, the NP government consulted widely and  timeously [as received] -- as with the National Economic Forum  and other bodies -- before formulating policy or taking action.    "These three things represent transparency," he said.</p>

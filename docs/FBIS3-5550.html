At the meeting held in North Korea's Unification House, the  South asked the North to drop four demands made at the previous  four meetings and to respond to Seoul's proposal on an exchange  of special envoys.    Vice Unification Minister Song Yong-tae, who led the South  Korean delegation to the meeting, warned that if North Korea  insisted on its "unreasonable demands," it would be accused of  "erecting a barrier to a special envoy exchange."    Stressing that the envoy exchange is a pressing issue that  cannot be put aside, he said he expects North and South Korea  will jointly work for reconciliation, cooperation and  co-prosperity by realizing an exchange of special envoys.    But chief North Korean delegate Pak Yong-su, reiterating the  four demands, offered a counterproposal calling for two  additional items, including maintenance of national  self-reliance, in the agenda for discussion by the special  envoys. He also proposed that the South Korean envoy visit  Pyongyang first for three nights and four days and that the  preparatory period for the visit be 15 days.    North Korea's four demands include suspension of the joint  South Korea-U.S. military exercise "Team Spirit," withdrawal of  President Kim Yong-sam's remarks on North Korea's nuclear  program and scrapping of the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot  missiles in South Korea.</p>

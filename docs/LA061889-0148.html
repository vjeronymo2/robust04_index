			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RUSHDIE LABELS REVOLUTION IN IRAN AS A FORCE FOR EVIL  </P> <P> British writer Salman Rushdie, in his first interview since being forced into  hiding by death threats, has described the Islamic revolution in Iran as a  force for evil.  </P> <P> The author of the controversial book, "The Satanic Verses," spoke bitterly to a  British newspaper about the revolution ushered in 10 years ago when the late  Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ousted the Shah of Iran.  </P> <P> "It ate most of the people that supported it. It ate the unions, it ate the  women's groups, it ate the socialists and left behind only its own bloated  members," he said in an interview published today in the Mail.  </P> <P> Rushdie has been under police guard since last February, when Khomeini  denounced the novel as blasphemous and ordered Muslims to kill its author.  </P> <P> Rushdie, who described himself as a lapsed Muslim, said he felt saddened by the  ban on his book by many Islamic countries and by the willingness of his critics  to attack it without having read it. "They're willing to say things about my  work which are not based on reading. But gradually the book will be read."  </P> <P> Rushdie indicated that the threats against his life were exaggerated, but the  interviewer described him as "paralyzed by terror" when a car crashed noisily  onto the pavement near a London house where they met.  </P></p>

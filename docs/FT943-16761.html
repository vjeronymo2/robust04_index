			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Dollar struggles The dollar limped to the end of a difficult week yesterday as the market cast its view ahead to next week's rash of important G3 central bank meetings and the G7 summit in Naples, writes Philip Gawith. The US currency flattered to deceive, being unable to hold onto early gains which saw it recover from a post-war low of Y97.68 reached in Tokyo. It closed in London at Y98.705, and DM1.5946 after earlier reaching DM1.6025. Elsewhere in Europe, the Swedish krona and Italian lira were the focus of attention with both currencies suffering from worries about the state of public finances in the respective countries. Sterling had an uneventful day, finishing at DM2.4525 from DM 2.4564, and Dollars 1.538 from Dollars 1.5435. Trade was fairly muted yesterday, with many investors taking to the sidelines ahead of the Independence day long weekend in the US, and next week's meetings. The nervous response of the market, however, to rumours that the Bank of Japan might cut its discount rate prompted some traders to predict a bumpy ride next week. Others said that investors would probably sit on the sidelines until after the G7 summit. Mr Mark Geddes, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, commented: 'Market expectations are building that we will get some sort of concerted G3 policy next week.' Rumours of BOJ intervention were fuelled by comments from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, that the dollar and world growth would be helped by German and Japanese rate cuts. The dollar gave up its earlier gains during late European trading. Some traders were disappointed that the central banks had not chosen to intervene, saying the combination of a rising currency and thin Friday trade was opportune. The June purchasing managers index, where the pricing component rose to a six year high, was largely ignored by the market. The krona and the lira were the focus of attention in Europe. After threatening in early trade to breach the L1,000 level against the D-Mark, falling as low as L999.70, the Italian currency recovered to close unchanged in London at L994.7. There were unconfirmed rumours that the Bank of Italy had intervened to support the currency. The lira touched a record low against the D-Mark of L1,010.50 on December 2, 1993. Apart from concerns about the budget deficit, traders said technical factors had also driven the currency lower. Volumes were reported to be low, and price movements volatile. The Swedish krona finished at SKr4.906, up from a low of SKr4.9650, against the D-Mark. Part of the weakness in the Swedish currency was attributable to rumours that Skandia Insurance was refusing to buy Swedish bonds, aggravating fears about a lack of progress in dealing with the budget deficit. Activity in the interest rate futures markets was very muted. The December eurosterling contract finished unchanged at 93.71, while the December euromark contract closed at 94.94 from 94.91. The Bank of England provided Pounds 700m assistance to the market after forecasting a Pounds 850m shortage.</p>

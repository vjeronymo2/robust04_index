Leonov: "You Give Us Collectivization!.."] </F>   [Text] Perhaps only this way, in true bolshevist  style, can you evaluate the process of mass circulation of new  kolkhozes in the republic which has been continued since the  times of the "glorious" Stalinist five-year plans.    If you think about it, our agriculture has been a vast field  of experimentation. All kinds of experiments were conducted over  the years! First they consolidated them, then they broke them  up, then they transformed them into sovkhozes and interkolkhoz  associations. There was a time when they even cherished the idea  of creating agrocities. But all these undertakings were  conceived at the top and implemented in a directive procedure.    But the process which has spread over the Azerbaijan  countryside during our democratic era is not connected with  government decisions, not obligatory for the lower strata to  carry out, and not imposed by the will of high authorities at  all. The initiative began in local areas, and the ones who  started it were persons who thirst for power and want to prosper  at the expense of their fellow countrymen: you see, some persons  were needed right away to become kolkhoz chairmen, surrounding  themselves with devoted people who dream of cozy homes in  management, a little farther from the fields and farms. Enticing  the masses, "activists" have shared their "brilliant" plans,  painted glowing pictures of economic prosperity, and led them on  with the ideas of unlimited independence that are in vogue now.    This is how the process of breaking up the  existing kolkhozes and creating new farms in the rayons was  begun and rapidly accelerated. While there were 608 kolkhozes in  the republic in 1985, there were 983 when the question of  decreasing and eliminating them arose in 1990, and there were  1,175 of them the year after, there are more than 1,200 of them  today! This means that there are twice as many chairmen and the  number of management personnel who are not working in productive  labor in the fields and pastures and on the farms has increased  accordingly, naturally. Some rayons have been especially  successful in their yearning for organizational activity.  Bilyasuvarskiy Rayon now has 22 kolkhozes instead of 13,  Ismaillinskiy Rayon has 17 instead of eight, Geranboyskiy Rayon  has 61 instead of 30, Agdzhabedinskiy Rayon has 40 instead of  24, and Babezhskiy Rayon now has 32 instead of five kolkhozes.  So many major changes have taken place in a number of rayons in  just 1 year.    Residents of four settlements in Sabirabadskiy  Rayon--Mugangendzhyali, Dzhengyan, Salmanly, and Tezekend--were  members of the rather prosperous "Oktyabr" Kolkhoz. After  promising their fellow countrymen rivers of milk and honey and  swearing to serve them faithfully, the new candidates for  chairmen urged the people to vote to divide the kolkhoz that had  been formed a very long time ago. As a result, each one of the  villages acquired its own kolkhoz--"Shakhiyar," "Shen Khayat,"  imeni S. Gazanov...    Though the efforts of those who aspired to be the leading  landowners were not crowned with success everywhere. As an  example, in Belokanskiy Rayon, there are fewer kolkhozes than  before.    I have been told that once they had assumed power, many of  the new kolkhoz managers rushed to provide themselves with an  official vehicle and driver for their personal use first of all  and began construction of a solid building for the kolkhoz board  with the indispensable main office and hall. A well-equipped,  spacious, personal farmstead was often quickly built at the same  time. As a rule, the persons who zealously assisted the  power-lover to occupy the administrative and economic throne in  a deserted, downgraded little hamlet were rewarded, depending on  the extent of their services.    But perhaps by taking care of themselves and those close to  them, the new chairmen were also concerned about kolkhoz  production?! In most cases, their activity has turned out to be  deplorable. Let us take Geranboyskiy Rayon, where the kolkhozes  were broken up so zealously. The average gross production on 100  hectares of agricultural land in 1992 declined by one-half as  much compared with 1985. In Bardinskiy and Salyanskiy rayons,  output also declined by nearly one-half as much during the same  period.    Overall profitability of agricultural production in the  republic slid from 36 percent in 1980 to 14 percent in 1992. The  yield of literally all agricultural products has dropped  sharply, and livestock breeding is in a disastrous state. Even  cultivation of vegetables has ceased to be profitable on the  kolkhozes. The figures on the increasing number of unprofitable  kolkhozes are depressing: there were only four of  them in 1985, but now there are over 200!    Of course, the causes of the agricultural crisis in  Azerbaijan are deep-seated; it stems from the extremely bad  state of the economy in general, the break in traditional ties  among the regions, and the political instability. However, among  the other reasons, the factor of overall  fragmentation of the kolkhozes has been very harmful. This  organizational intrigue has drawn workers away from production  and left the fields and farms without supervision. The division  of kolkhoz property has been scandalous in nature at times: each  of the new formations has strived to seize the arable land that  is a little better and equipment in a little better condition.    I read a letter from the countryside describing the painful  division of property when a large and prosperous kolkhoz was  broken up. One obtained a well-equipped repair base, and others  received tractors and cultivators which needed thorough  technical maintenance. They distributed few spare parts, and it  became obvious that none of the sides would benefit from this.  It turned out that one of the divided kolkhozes had most of the  cultivators, but two others did not know what to do with  unneeded agronomists and livestock experts. Bitter, long-lasting  disputes have broken out concerning who will be responsible for  the credits taken in preceding years, and to what extent.    It is clear that the separated collectives, in addition to  losing a substantial amount of material resources and often  deprived of specialists, have not only been unable to achieve  high labor productivity, but productivity that is barely  acceptable. Some of these farms that were created artificially  very quickly became completely bankrupt and incapable  of providing for even their own local residents.    The competence and morality of the kolkhoz chairmen who have  taken the reins of power lately are another matter. In 1992 and  the first half of 1993, because of party bias, persons who were  absolutely incompetent and far removed from agricultural  production were advanced to positions as kolkhoz managers. Out  of 18 new chairmen in Geranboyskiy Rayon, 13 have no  agricultural education. Drivers, medical attendants,  teachers, librarians, and photographers continue to hold  positions as chairmen here and there to this day. Kolkhoz  regulations and the principles of democracy have been rudely  flouted.    Practice such as this has been fertile ground for misconduct  and provided scope for the princelings to plunder kolkhoz and  public property. In Kyurdamirskiy Rayon, a clever kolkhoz  chairman made his 90-year-old sister-in-law the "manager" of a  cooperative and sold her kolkhoz motor vehicles, a tractor, and  a water pump at bargain prices; the building for a machine shop,  a transformer, and a bath house were transferred to her without  charge. The kolkhoz "let the cooperative have" 150 sheep at  little cost. Dozens of hectares of land suitable for cultivation  were dispensed left and right. And the creator of this self-rule  got away with it.    Many of the kolkhoz members who sincerely believed in the  advantage of breaking up the kolkhozes or who were deceived as  careerists and mercenary-minded individuals would not mind  reuniting the separated farms today. In Imishlinskiy and  Geranboyskiy rayons, six kolkhozes were consolidated and gained  as a result. But on the whole, it is not simple to put the  prevailing trend of possession in reverse. The managers of farms  in local areas do not intend to part with the positions which  provide them with an incredible salary, the opportunity to  command, and all kinds of privileges.    And it is hard to engage in organizational restructuring  once  again, especially in our troubled time.    The number of kolkhozes in the republic has increased partly  because a number of unprofitable sovkhozes in mountainous areas  were turned into kolkhozes. The state left its burden to the  rural residents and firmly proceeded to change the form of  ownership. But the unprofitable sovkhozes were not turned into  profitable kolkhozes for the most part, and this has given  persons an additional reason to maintain that kolkhozes in  general, no matter whether they are large or small, have become  obsolete and they have clearly shown that they are unsound.    Such categorical conclusions are not likely to be urgent  these days, when we are entering the market little by little  with huge and obvious losses, where privatization is only shown  by a dotted line, and the triumph of private property is still a  long way off.    In the current segment of history with its distinctive  contradictions and the cataclysms and extraordinary burdens for  the people, it is important to retain and make use of all  forms of ownership with the most possible benefit for  society and to efficiently utilize the best that is  incorporated in the kolkhozes. Casting aspersions on them  without making distinctions and rejecting a differentiated  approach would be an irreparable error. In accordance with our  old custom, the kolkhozes are still being commanded from  without, their free access to the market is being impeded, and  excessive taxes are being imposed on them.    I was told an interesting fact at the Kolkhoz Affairs Main  Administration of the Ministry of Agriculture. Livestock  raising, and milk production in particular, is unprofitable for  kolkhozes in the republic as a whole. Kolkhozes have been  compelled to give milk to the state dairy plants at a sharply  understated and "very ludicrous" price. But in Imishlinskiy  Rayon, one of the kolkhozes was authorized to sell milk freely  as an exception. As a result, in less than a month, selling milk  in the market at 70 manats [unit of currency] per liter in  January, the kolkhoz earned more than in the entire year of  1993! And the cash was most welcome to the kolkhoz.    It is hard to tell what will happen to the separated  kolkhozes now. I think in each specific case we have to be  extremely careful and cautious not to resort to severe  administrative pressure, to appeal to people's intellect and  aspirations first of all, and to encourage and support their  sense of economic expediency in every possible way.</p>

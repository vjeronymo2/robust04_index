			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Targets set for Post Office 'unreasonable' THE GOVERNMENT is imposing 'unreasonable and uncommercial' financial targets on the Post Office, the Post Office Users' National Council, the official postal services watchdog, said yesterday. Over the next two financial years the Post Office's contribution to the government will rise by more than Pounds 200m. The amount the Post Office has to generate from cashflow above its own investment needs - negative external financing limits (EFLs) - will increase from Pounds 68m in 1993-94 and Pounds 70m in 1994-95 to Pounds 180m in both years. In a letter to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, Mr Tom Corrigan, chairman of the council, said he was 'appalled to find that without prior mention or justification future Post Office negative external financing limits have been increased by over 250 per cent'. Given the recent Post Office pay settlement at twice the 1.5 per cent public sector rate announced by the government, Mr Corrigan fears the Post Office will have to find the extra cash by reducing services and investment and increasing prices. Wages and salaries account for about four fifths of the Post Office's costs. The watchdog predicts that there will be 'little or no improvement in postal quality', warning of significant increases in stamp prices in order to meet the 'tax on the post'. Mr Corrigan said: 'The arbitrary nature of the negative EFL target appears unreasonable and uncommercial'. Earlier in the year the group issued a report on Post Office financial targets. 'We hoped this would act as a catalyst for debate but regrettably so far has elicited no response from the government,' Mr Corrigan said. The Post Office described the targets as 'challenging', but said its record showed it could meet government targets. The Department of Trade and Industry said that since there was pressure on the public sector borrowing requirement 'it is reasonable that the government should look for a higher rate of return from the Post Office'.

			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GANDHI RESIGNS; OPPOSITION GOVERNMENT SEEN;  </P> <P> INDIA: THE PRIME MINISTER'S PARTY LOST ITS PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY IN LAST  WEEK'S ELECTIONS.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi resigned today, apparently clearing the way for an  opposition government, after his ruling party suffered its second-most  humiliating defeat in four decades in national elections now viewed as a  watershed in Indian politics.  </P> <P> Gandhi's resignation, which he personally delivered to India's largely  ceremonial President Ramaswamy Ventkataraman this morning, was seen by several  analysts as a strong indication that the ruling Congress-I party had resigned  itself to a new role in the opposition for only the second time in four  decades.  </P> <P> With almost all of the results now counted in the parliamentary elections that  ended Sunday, Gandhi's party had won just 190 seats in the 543-member  Parliament. However, none of the three major opposition blocs had secured a  majority either.  </P> <P> The opposition, led by Gandhi's defense minister, Vishwanath Pratap Singh, was  to meet later today in an effort to chose a prime ministerial candidate who  could lead a minority government. The new government already has been  guaranteed support from the country's extreme right- and left-wing minority  parties.  </P> <P> The resignation of the 45-year-old prime minister had been expected for the  past two days, after the election returns made it clear that Congress-I had  lost its majority for only the second time since Indian independence in 1947.  </P> <P> President Ventkataraman asked Gandhi to stay on as a caretaker prime minister  until the president selects the party that will form a new government. Gandhi  accepted.  </P> <P> The president also accepted the resignations of Gandhi's Cabinet ministers, who  will also stay on until a new government is formed.  </P> <P> As Gandhi was meeting with the president, the election commission announced  that Gandhi had retained his own seat in Parliament by a margin of 200,000  votes. But Gandhi's official resignation merely capped a grim week of reckoning  for the ruling party. Many analysts saw the elections as a total rejection of  the family dynasty that has ruled Indian virtually without challenge for 42  years.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, even the family and co-conspirators in the assassination of  Gandhi's mother were swept into office.  </P> <P> Five years after bodyguard Beant Singh shot and killed Prime Minister Indira  Gandhi, his widow, Bimal Kaur Khalsa, was declared a member of the Indian  Parliament.  </P> <P> The assassin's father, Sucha Singh, was also declared a winner.  </P> <P> In perhaps the ultimate rebuke to four decades of dynastic rule, voters in the  north Indian state of Punjab also delivered equally huge parliamentary  victories for the two men accused of masterminding the assassination. Both had  campaigned from prison.  </P> <P> As the political opposition sought to form a minority government, expected to  be unveiled today or Thursday, it became clear that the voters had repudiated  one of the longest-serving political dynasties in the modern world.  </P> <P> "To borrow a phrase from the old British Empire, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi  has just presided over the liquidation of a dynasty," analyst Rajni Kothari  said.  </P> <P> Rajiv Gandhi inherited the leadership of the Congress-I party from his mother,  Indira, and his grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister after  independence in 1947.  </P> <P> "As far as Mrs. Beant Singh is concerned," Prof. Kothari said, "her victory  certainly is an assertion of that anger toward the ruling family."  </P> <P> There were other signs that India's increasingly sophisticated voters finally  have lost faith in the Gandhi family.  </P> <P> Maneka Gandhi, the 33-year-old widow of Indira Gandhi's son Sanjay, also scored  an overwhelming victory, seven years after her mother-in-law threw her out of  the house and publicly declared her "Family Enemy No. 1" for challenging party  policies.  </P> <P> Arun Nehru, a cousin of Rajiv who publicly split with the family two years ago,  also won a seat in Parliament.  </P> <P> But as symbols go, analysts said, the victories of the relatives of Indira  Gandhi's assassins are the most dramatic.  </P> <P> All are members of the Sikh community, which for the past decade has been torn  apart by a secessionist movement in the state of Punjab, where Sikhs  predominate. And at least half of those elected to Parliament in Punjab are  either members of or sympathizers with the Sikh secessionist movement. One is a  terrorist who has confessed to public bombings and at least one airline  hijacking.  </P> <P> Beant Singh and Satwant Singh (no relative), his accomplice in the killing of  Indira Gandhi, were both Sikhs. One was killed by other guards just after the  shooting, and the other was hanged last year.  </P> <P> Hindu mobs took to the streets after the assassination, and thousands of Sikhs  were killed. But no one was convicted during Rajiv Gandhi's five years in  power. Several members of the Congress-I party are believed to have been  involved, and at least one was defeated last week.  </P> <P> Many Sikhs said they were voting against the ruling party as a way of  protesting.  </P> <P> "The vote, you see, is also an indication that the Sikhs are still in great  anguish," Prof. Kothari said. "It is an assertion against the ruling family  that declares: 'You have not yet punished the guilty. You have only hanged the  assassins.' "  </P> <P> Kothari is one of many analysts who see the election of secessionists and the  family and friends of assassins as something more than symbolic. They say it is  a potentially positive sign for the strife-torn state of Punjab, where fighting  over the secession issue has left thousands dead in recent years.  </P> <P> "Certainly some of the voting is a severe rebuke to the ruling family, but the  fact that it took place in the parliamentary process and not in street killings  is very reassuring and encouraging," Kothari said. "This will isolate the very  hard core of the terrorists."  </P> <P> Kushwant Singh, a Sikh newspaper columnist, agreed.  </P> <P> "I don't think this can be construed as a vote for (independence) or any other  such thing," said Singh, who is considered a moderate on the secessionist  issue. "This is just a very angry vote."  </P> <P> Kothari said the best indication that the Punjab results augur well for the  state's future was in the way the election was carried out.  </P> <P> "In an election where a record number of killings, fraud and vote rigging took  place almost everywhere else in the country, one must note that the most  peaceful poll of all was in Punjab," he said. "So in Punjab it was not just a  vote for change. Strange as it may seem, I really think it was a vote for  peace."  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> California's shield law does not protect media people from testifying about an  incident witnessed while covering another story, according to a state appellate  court decision in a Bakersfield case. Justice Marvin Baxter wrote that the  shield law was not intended to create an absolute privilege and immunity from  testifying about happenstance observations of public events. The case involved  Michael Gregerson, a cameraman for KERO-TV, who was covering a 1986 traffic  accident in which a load of packaged meat spilled on California 99. As he  filmed an interview with a California Highway Patrol officer, a car struck the  debris in the road and flipped over. The driver, John Liggett, was injured, and  he sued the meat company and subpoenaed Gregerson to testify. Gregerson's  station provided Liggett a tape of the accident but balked at having Gregerson  testify, contending that the cameraman was protected under the shield law.  </P></p>

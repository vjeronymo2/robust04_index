			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Rutskoi starts crusade to remove Yeltsin Former Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi launched a crusade at the weekend to remove President Boris Yeltsin and widen Russia to the boundaries of the old Soviet Union, Reuter reports from Moscow. Marking his return to the political fray, Mr Rutskoi proclaimed an end to any compromise with the man who, in his eyes, sought to humiliate him in the struggle that ended in bloodshed last October. Mr Rutskoi scored a political triumph in winning re-election as head of the renamed Russian Social Democratic People's Party, which appeared in October to have turned against him. Few in its ranks backed him publicly after he led an armed rebellion against Mr Yeltsin in the name of the parliament the president had summarily dissolved.</p>

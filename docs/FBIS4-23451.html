			<p>BFN     [Text] Kabuga, Rwanda, June 6 (AFP) -- Rwandan rebels have  repulsed a counter-attack by the government army near its  stronghold south of Kigali, the commander of the Rwanda  Patriotic Front (RPF) said here Monday [6 June].    Speaking from this RPF bastion around 20 kilometres (12  miles) east of Kigali, rebel commander General Paul Kagame said  his forces had repelled "some counter attacks that I wouldn't  call a counter-offensive" amid intense clashes in the Gitarama  region.    He said rebel units were stationed three or four kilometres  (about two miles) from Gitarama, a town around 50 kilometres (30  miles) south of Kigali where the interim government has  established its headquarters.    Earlier Monday Major Jean-Guy Plante, spokesman for the UN  mission in Rwanda, said governement forces had launched a major  counter-offensive around Gitarama and south toward the border  with Burundi.    Kagame added that the RPF also held various sectors between  Gitarama and the frontier.</p>

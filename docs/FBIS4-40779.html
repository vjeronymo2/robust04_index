			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 7, RIA -- The complement of officers in  the Russian military in 1994 is 4.3 per cent less than a year  ago, Deputy Defense Minister Valeriy Mironov told the State  Duma's Defense Committee members today, which means the Army is  90,000 officers and over 91,000 NCOs short. Col.-Gen. Mironov  said that every third officer released from the ranks last year  was under 30 years of age. More experienced officers under 40  were resigning for want of perspective - 43 per cent of the  total.    One trend is to discharge cadets right before the contract-  signing: a half of all cadets discharged from military academies.    Gen. Mironov cited several reasons for the situation: low  social security, low pay, and subsequent disillusionment in the  chosen vocation.</p>

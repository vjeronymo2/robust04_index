			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> TIPS ON REWIRING ALUMINUM FRAME WINDOWS;  </P> <P> HOME REPAIR: CHANGING THE SCREEN MESH IN YOUR WINDOWS CAN BE EASY AND  RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE.  </P> <P> Ah, spring! Long, warm days. Balmy nights. Baseball, barbecues, beach parties  and, of course, bugs . . . lots of miserable bugs!  </P> <P> But don't despair. Here are some tips for easy rewiring of aluminum-frame  windows and door screens that will allow you to beat the bugs without beating  your wallet.  </P> <P> Start by determining what type of screen mesh you have in the existing frame,  either aluminum, which is stiff, or fiberglass, which is soft and pliable.  </P> <P> In general, it is easier to rewire screens with new mesh of the same material  as the old mesh. From most any hardware store or screen shop, purchase enough  aluminum or fiberglass mesh to overlap the outside edges of the frame.  </P> <P> Also while you're at the store, buy a device called a "spline tool," which  looks like a pizza cutter with a wheel at both ends (under $5). One wheel has a  convex edge, the other a concave edge.  </P> <P> The next step is to remove the old mesh from the screen frame. Lay the screen  on a flat surface and with a pair of long-nose pliers or tweezers, pull on the  end of the "spline," the rubber cord in the frame groove that surrounds the  mesh.  </P> <P> Continue pulling the spline until you have removed it entirely. Put the spline  aside and remove the old screen mesh from the frame.  </P> <P> Lay the new mesh evenly over the screen frame. If you are working with aluminum  mesh, use the convex-edged wheel of the spline tool to push the material as far  as possible into the groove all the way around the frame.  </P> <P> Here comes the key to successful rescreening. Starting at any corner of the  frame, use the concave wheel of the spline tool to force the old spline  material into groove on top of the screen mesh. Use enough force to push the  screen and spline down into the groove as far as possible.  </P> <P> If the spline is especially difficult to force in, try pulling on the free  section to stretch it, causing it to "thin" slightly.  </P> <P> Continue working across to the opposite corner of the frame and cut the spline  there with a wire cutter or knife.  </P> <P> Now you have one side of the frame completed. To keep the mesh taught, draw it  snug over the frame and repeat the above procedure at the opposite side.  </P> <P> The screen mesh should now be smooth and flat without loose spots or wrinkles.  If so, complete the spline installation for the two other sides of the frame.  If not, pull the spline out of the groove near any wrinkles or loose sections,  straighten and tighten the mesh, and reinstall the spline.  </P> <P> Now the screen mesh is properly secured into all four sides of the window or  door frame with the excess mesh still attached. To remove it, hold the flat  part of the blade of a utility or pocket knife against the spline, with the  sharp edge against the loose mesh.  </P> <P> Draw the knife along the spline while cutting through the loose material all  the way around the frame.  </P> <P> That's it! The screen is like new, and you did it yourself!  </P> <P> Finally, a word about aluminum versus fiberglass mesh. As stated above, it is  usually easier to rewire a screen with new mesh of the same material as the  old, but you may wish to switch from aluminum to fiberglass or vice versa to  better suit your needs.  </P> <P> Aluminum screen mesh is sturdier than fiberglass and is better for doors or  window screens that are subject to assault from pets, kids and careless adults  who may be prone to pushing on the mesh rather than the handles.  </P> <P> Fiberglass mesh is a little cheaper, is more resistant to weathering and is  corrosion proof. Fiberglass is preferable in coastal areas or in humid  climates.  </P> <P> Two switch mesh types, the spline will normally need to be replaced. Buy one  size smaller to go from fiberglass to aluminum; one size larger to go from  aluminum to fiber.  </P></p>

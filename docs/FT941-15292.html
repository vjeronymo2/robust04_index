			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Markets: It's eyes down in the casino - The Bottom Line After 18 months of falling dividend yields, UK banks have come to resemble slot machines into which gamblers have put lots of coins without result. A small crowd has gathered in the stock market casino to watch for the long-anticipated moment when the bells ring, and money starts gushing out. The fall in the banks' dividend yield against the FT-A All Share index has been produced by the heady rise in bank shares over the past 18 months. The sector's performance has rewarded many investors who bet on banks recovering from the bad debt burden of the 1980s with very strong capital gain. These gains were sustained last year by the emergence of exceptional trading conditions. The fall in interest rates not only allowed banks to widen margins on loans, but produced turmoil in currency and securities markets which allowed banks' securities arms to profit heavily. Yet after TSB's announcement this week of full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 301m, accompanied by a 20 per cent increase in the dividend, sentiment is changing. Brokers' analysts think the best capital gains are past, and investors should look towards banks' ability to raise dividends. That was reinforced by movements in bank shares yesterday, with Abbey National gaining 13p to 520p on hopes that it would follow TSB in raising its 1993 dividend sharply. Along with TSB, Abbey is one of the best-capitalised banks, with a ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets of 9.4 per cent. Peter Toeman, of Hoare Govett, says banks have undergone a miraculous transformation because of their share rise, from being among the highest yielding sectors to the fifth lowest-yielding one. This is because investors anticipate that they will use accumulating capital to raise dividends. During the 1980s bank shares were bought for income from dividends rather than capital gains because banks are highly cyclical. They yielded between 1.4 and 1.6 times the All-Share throughout the 1980s. The steady fall to yesterday's 20 per cent yield discount started about three years ago. Toeman says that this discount - unusual for banks - has emerged because banks are seen to be building up capital which will be used to raise dividends to parity with the All-Share. 'Investors are driven by this expectation and are trying to work out the best prospects,' he says. The broad potential of banks to raise dividends is already clear. Three banks - Barclays, Standard Chartered, and Midland - cut dividends during the recession. Because domestic loan is likely to remain weak, the banks which are now generating cash are unlikely to absorb it by growing their assets. Even with five per cent growth in risk-weighted assets, Hugh Pye, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, estimates that Lloyds Bank would reach a core capital ratio of 8.1 per cent by 1995. This is both double the regulatory minimum of 4 per cent, and well above the comfort level of 6 per cent. Judging banks on dividend growth potential implies looking for those with strong capital, and the best chance of raising operating profits. Pye says this implies a switch 'from recovery to quality' - from banks like Barclays and National Westminster to those with better growth prospects. Abhey, TSB, HSBC Holdings and Royal Bank of Scotland all have strong capital already. Toeman argues that TSB shares are still cheap because its capital means it is capable of raising the dividend at a compound rate of 20 per cent a year if the bank's management absorbs capital in this way. Pye says investors should look for banks which not only have strong capital but can increase operating income in an era of weak demand. He says that Abbey is strongly placed in this respect because it has a good market share in home mortgages. But judging banks on dividend potential means taking the risk that managements of well-capitalised banks will not opt simply to retain the cash. As the wily slot machine gambler knows, a machine's failure to pay out in the past does not guarantee that it will do so in future.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The Week Ahead AT BICC, the cables and construction group, the impact of recessions in North America, Australia and the UK was previously softened by the resilience of the continental cables market. But last year that stronghold began to weaken and pre-tax profits are expected to have fallen to around Pounds 100m from (Pounds 183m). The range of estimates ahead of Wednesday's announcement is quite wide because of uncertainty about the level of exceptional charges for such things as property write-downs and reorganisation. Other areas of doubt include the margin-squeeze at Balfour Beatty, the construction wing, and the state of the balance sheet. General Accident, the general and life insurer, reports its 1991 results on Tuesday. Like Commercial Union and Royal Insurance, GA is expected to post losses. However, the company's exposure to mortgage indemnity losses, which contributed heavily to Royal's disastrous performance this week, is limited. Even so the company's underlying trading performance is weak and losses for 1991 are expected to be around Pounds 160m, compared with Pounds 121m last year. GKN, the motor components and industrial services group, is expected to show on Wednesday pre-tax profits virtually halved from Pounds 172m in 1990 to between Pounds 85m and Pounds 90m last year. Among the charges is the cost of job cuts, and that process is expected to continue. With most of its continental European markets turning down alongside the UK and US, the few cushioning factors have included its involvement in new models. GKN is credited with good cash conservation and the dividend is thought to be safe although uncovered. Cadbury Schweppes' premium rating among food-processing shares will be put to the test when it reports full-year results on Wednesday. Though last year's overall growth in UK confectionery and soft drinks volumes was unexciting, the company is thought to have benefited from a last-minute pre-Christmas buying surge and from steady price increases on the drinks side. Analysts' forecasts range from Pounds 310m to Pounds 316m pre-tax, up from Pounds 279.6m in 1990. Ladbroke, the leisure group, is expected to report on Thursday a one-third fall in pre-tax profits to around Pounds 210m (Pounds 305m). Three of its four divisions - hotels, betting and retail - will be worse off. Only Texas, the DIY chain, will be ahead. Property disposal profits and lower interest charges thanks to its August rights issue, will help offset the weak trading performance. The full-year dividend will probably show a modest rise from 10.6p to around 11p. On Tuesday Abbey National, the retail banking group, is expected to announce pre-tax profits for 1991 between Pounds 610m and Pounds 630m, up from Pounds 582m a year ago. This would make it the second most profitable bank in the UK, a whisker behind Lloyds (Pounds 645m) but comfortably ahead of Barclays (Pounds 533m). Provisions against loan losses will be sharply up from last year's Pounds 55m.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Renationalisation of rail wins unanimous backing Labour will reverse the break-up of the railways and bring them back into public ownership, Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, told the conference yesterday. Privatisation was 'so stupid that even Tories called it a poll tax on wheels', he told delegates, who unanimously approved a motion calling for renationalisation of the railways. Mr Dobson said more than Pounds 700m had been squandered on paying City advisers which could have been used to buy 57 InterCity trains. He described the money paid to private consultants as the 'evil consequences of privatisation' and pledged the next Labour government would 'reverse the break up and privatisation of Britain's railways'. By offering to contribute Pounds 1.7bn for the Channel tunnel high-speed rail link to London, Mr Dobson said the government had accepted that the link could not be built by the private sector alone. But he criticised the proposed arrangement whereby the taxpayer contributed 60 per cent of the costs without receiving a share of the profits. Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT transport union, said a new association of train-operating companies would be 'a cartel designed to exploit its monopoly position to extract concessions from the government against the interests of the passengers'. He also criticised the role of the Health and Safety Executive in the signal workers' dispute, saying he wanted a judicial review of their actions.</p>

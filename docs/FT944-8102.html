			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Ecuador determined to open public sector: Government is pushing ahead with opportunities for investors Despite considerable political opposition and legal obstacles, the Ecuadorean government is pushing ahead with measures to open its public sector to private investors. While strategic sectors such as telecommunications and electricity still require legislation before state monopolies can be put on the block, a host of concession contracts will be offered to private investors in other sectors traditionally operated by the state. One such move is to have the private sector manage the country's principal roads. A request for tender to operate large tracts of the Pan-American highway, which connects the country with its northern neighbour Colombia and with Peru to the south, will be held in December. The contracts for 10 of the most profitable sections of the road could be worth in excess of Dollars 100m in annual revenues. The government says it can no longer afford to maintain the road, which is in a dismal state and requires an estimated Dollars 45m (Pounds 27.4m) in annual upkeep. Less lucrative routes are later to be offered to public/private joint ventures. Some 14 enterprises, most of them foreign, have shown interest in bidding, but there are concerns that protests by motorists against road tolls, a novelty in Ecuador, may well cause repeated closures. The state modernisation council, Conam, also announced bids in coming months for several municipal drinking water projects. This opens a host of opportunities for the private sector to build and operate water purification plants in 200 municipalities throughout the country. In the coastal city of Esmeraldas a private company has already been granted the operation of a drinking water plant it had constructed. The Guayaquil port facilities, currently operated by the military-dominated port authority, are to be offered in concession in the first half of 1995. The port of Guayaquil, which moves 4m tonnes of cargo annually, is the first of several Pacific ports on the privatisation list. Despite much opposition to the construction of a Dollars 600m oil pipeline, the government remains determined to go ahead with the 15-year build-operate-transfer concession. After impeachment of one energy minister and parliament's intention to vote a second out of office over the issue, the government has had once again to postpone the bidding process until January 1995. A consortium of Prudential Securities and the international airline consultant SH&amp;E is to launch an international road show, promoting the sale of a 50.1 per cent stake in the Ecuatoriana airline via a special auction to a pre-selected group of buyers. It is hoped to sell an additional 25 per cent stake on the stock exchanges in Quito and Guayaquil. Conam officials decided that Prudential's recent settlement of charges brought by the US government related to the sale of high-risk limited energy partnerships to small investors in the US during the 1980s would not affect diminish its ability to promote Ecuatoriana. Meanwhile legislation that would allow for the sale of a 45 per cent stake in the telephone company Emetel is awaiting congressional approval. This proposal is more likely to be approved than the government's own telecommunications law, rejected in July. The current proposal was presented by the opposition Social Christian party, the strongest faction in parliament. Mr Mauricio Pinto, Conam president, says he expects to offer Emetel shares in 16 months. Mr Pinto is equally confident that a good portion of the state electricity sector can be privatised before the government's term runs out in mid-1996. 'The electricity sector is less controversial than telecommunications or petroleum,' he says. One advantage is that several public power plant operators are already constituted as limited companies. Ecuador's overall investment climate has improved considerably since the administration of President Sixto Duran Ballen took over two years ago. Macro-economic stability, liberalised foreign investment regulations, and a recent debt agreement have restored confidence among foreign investors. The recent bids for concession contracts in the exploration of oil and the installation of a cellular phone system suggested strong interest among some foreign investors. The securities market has seen dramatic growth in recent months. The Quito stock exchange has seen its trading volume increase by 70 per cent over last year while its price index for the month of October alone jumped by 30 per cent. Government statistics confirm growing foreign capital inflows. Direct foreign investment is to nearly double this year while significant amounts of repatriated capital continue entering the country. Mr Augusto de la Torre, general manager of the central bank, says: 'If we can maintain basic political stability in the near future, we're on our way to becoming Latin America's next emerging market.'</p>

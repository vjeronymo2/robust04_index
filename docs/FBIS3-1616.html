			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 25 (XINHUA) -- The China  Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) today expressed  satisfaction over the experiment for the first group of domestic  enterprises to issue stocks on the Hong Kong market.    Nie Qingping, vice-director of the international department  of CSRC, said that the issuance and transaction of "H" shares  were "satisfying".    Last year, China securities authorities approved nine large  domestic enterprises to issue stocks in Hong Kong. So far six  of them have been listed in the Hong Kong market.    Nie said that the six "H" shares were warmly welcomed when  issued. Demands for each one far exceeded the planned issuance.    The required number of stocks of Qingdao beer, Maanshan  steel  and Shanghai petrochemical were about 110 times, 68 times and  1.77 times the originally planned amount of issuance.    Transaction of "H" shares was encouragingly active in the  Hong Kong market. The daily transaction volume of "H" shares  occupied about one-tenth of the total. The present prices of  "H" shares are averaging 50 percent increases over issuing  prices.    Despite the undulating wave overshadowing the Hong Kong  market recently, "H" shares maintained an upward trend. The  average price earning ratio (per) of "H" shares now stands at 25  percent.    Nie Qingping attributed the success to overseas investors'  confidence in China's fast-growing economy.    "They want to share the benefits yielded by China's opening  to the outside world and economic development, through investing  in "H" shares," Nie said.    According to him, overseas investors were also encouraged by  strict checking and supervision of listed companies.    Nie also disclosed that so far the seventh batch of "H"  shares -- for the Jiangsu Yizheng chemical fiber company -- are  promoting sales of stocks worldwide. The company plans to issue  one billion Hong Kong dollars worth of "H" shares.</p>

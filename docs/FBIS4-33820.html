			<p>BFN     [Text] La Paz, 9 Jun (EFE) -- The Bolivian Foreign Ministry  confirmed today that Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de  Lozada and Chilean President Eduardo Frei will meet within the  framework of the Fourth Ibero-American summit to be held in  Cartagena, Colombia.    The Bolivian Foreign Ministry reported that the two heads of  state, who will attend the Fourth Ibero-American summit on 14  and 15 June, will take the opportunity to hold an informal  meeting.    This will be the second time Sanchez de Lozada and Frei have  met since August 1993; the other time was during Sanchez de  Lozada's inauguration.    The Bolivian president took advantage of another  international meeting, the Rio Group meeting in Santiago, to  meet with Chilean President Patricio Aylwin and then Chilean  President-elect Eduardo Frei.    Bolivia and Chile have had no diplomatic ties since 1962 --  except for a brief three-year period (1975-78) -- as a result of  a territorial dispute and Bolivia's demand for a sovereign sea  outlet to the Pacific across land that has belonged to Chile  since the 19th century.    The Bolivian Congress authorized Sanchez de Lozada to travel  to Colombia to attend the Ibero-American summit which will be  attended by the heads of state from Latin America, Spain, and  Portugal. The summit will be held in Cartagena on 14 and 15  June.    Congress also authorized Sanchez de Lozada to travel to the  United States, where he will attend the opening game of the  World Soccer Cup at Soldier Field in Chicago; Bolivia will play  Germany on 17 June.</p>

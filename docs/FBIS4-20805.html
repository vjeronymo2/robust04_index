			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by D. Ferhat: "Weapons for the Killers"] </F>   [Text] The recent seizure of weapons aboard an Algerian  vessel has revived questions about how arms are getting to  Algeria.    Neither the official Algerian news service, which first  reported the seizure, nor the broadcast news service, which  showed pictures of the weapons seized, has provided any further  information on the subject. No information has been released  regarding date or place of the seizure. All we can be sure of is  that the weapons were destined for armed terrorist groups active  in Algeria. And it is not the first time. Some countries known  for overt collusion with the Islamist movement appear to be  behind this illicit trafficking, which they encourage, either  directly by supplying arms or indirectly by providing the funds  to purchase them. Leaders of the dissolved FIS [Islamic  Salvation Front] received arms delivery offers from several  countries following the interruption of the electoral process,  and even much earlier. Heading the list were Iran and Israel.  The numerous weapons of Israeli manufacture (Uzi) found in the  possession of terrorists arrested by security services--for  example, in connection with last year's attack on Boughezoul  barracks--have confirmed that Israel was involved, at least  indirectly.    Iran, which gave its full support to the emergence on the  national scene of the now-dissolved FIS, had no scruples at the  time about selling it--with Israel's approval--Uzis acquired  during its war with Iraq. The $3 million, which the Terrorist  International, made available to the FIS last year on the eve of  Ramadan was used to pay for the acquisition. Other countries are  suspected of serving as intermediaries or directly financing  weapons purchases for armed groups active in Algeria. The prime  minister, Mr. Redha Malek, openly criticized certain European  countries last December for their reckless statements about  Algeria, even going so far as to point out to them that some of  the arms purchases for Algerian terrorists are made in Europe.  Also, during the trial of the authors of the attack on Algiers  airport, one of the defendants clearly and directly implicated  one of the major hubs of international terrorism--Sudan, in this  case--in financing weapons purchases for armed Algerian  terrorist groups. While the involvement of certain countries in  financing arms purchases for Algerian armed groups may be taken  as firmly established, a measure of uncertainty still prevails  regarding the involvement of other countries in transporting  these weapons to Algeria. On several occasions, Algerian  security services have focused on the Moroccan connection, and  President Liamine Zeroual, before his investiture, noted the  threat on the country's western borders. In 1991, Moroccan  security services reportedly signed with their Iranian  counterparts an accord that would make Morocco a transit center  for African fundamentalists. This report--which authorities have  never denied--appears to have been well-founded, in that several  armed individuals have since been intercepted by Algerian  security along the border between Algeria and Morocco. There was  also the Libyan connection, in particular the fact that the  wilaya of Illizi on the Moroccan border has served as a drop  point in recent years for Libya-based smugglers.    The cooperation afforded by reputedly "fraternal" countries  in transporting arms destined for terrorist cells was for a time  of such serious concern that consideration was given to closing  the borders with those two countries, especially the Moroccan  border, which was reopened in 1988 during the Chadli presidency.    Many of the facts about the security forces' recent seizure  of arms on a ship flying the Algerian flag are still hidden from  view, but it is a good bet that in the end the truth will not  come as a big surprise to anyone...</p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (22): Children of Aeroflot lack the freshness of youth - Leyla Boulton studies the emergent airlines of the former USSR AS RUSSIA and the other former Soviet states try to switch from Communism to capitalism, the air-related industries are going through turbulent times in taking off for a market economy. Aeroflot, the Soviet carrier which is being broken into separate airlines by the 15 former Soviet republics and other sub-entities, remains the logo on most civil aircraft in the former Soviet Union. Even though the stewardesses will welcome you to different names - say Uzbek Hava Yollaru or Lithuanian Airlines - the service, the aircraft, and the terminals remain depressingly inferior to world standards. Nonetheless, change is taking place, even if the signs are only visible on the surface. Within Russia, Aeroflot is creating a series of subsidiaries, again with different names - such as Moscow Airlines and Russian International Airlines. The latter has been set up specifically to operate five Airbus A310s which Aeroflot ordered before the Soviet Union collapsed. After financing for the aircraft had to be renegotiated when Russia succeeded the Soviet Union in December, the first of them arrived in Moscow in July. As for infrastructure, here too progress is being made in small steps. A joint venture with Accor has completed a Novotel at Sheremetievo airport, and the Irish who run duty-free shops at the airport have been training Russian staff in the art of selling duty-free goods in the air. Brand new airlines, such as ASDA, a project involving a group of Aeroflot pilots, are still scarce on the ground, however. Mr Yuri Mansurov, the chairman of ASDA, says the aim is to begin flights to the US next spring, with the novel idea of flying via the North Pole to cut down on flying time. He does not elaborate on how the project will be financed, except to say that plans to acquire Boeing-747s and 767s are being 'resolved'. With an eye on the future, British Airways is trying to put together a Dollars 900m package to set up a joint airline called Air Russia with the subdivision of Aeroflot which is based at the domestic terminal of Domodedovo. The other subdivision of Aeroflot which used to handle all international flights, based at Sheremetievo, is talking to Lufthansa, with which it already has a joint venture to modernise the airport, about possibly reviving an airline set up by Russia and Germany in the 1920s. Just as securing finance is the key question for airline projects, so it is an ever bigger headache for the Soviet Union's aviation industry. Although the West's aircraft makers are pushed to almost giving away aircraft so they can find buyers, Russia is hoping to capitalise on its relatively low costs to team up with western capital and know-how to manufacture aircraft which can compete in both quality and price on world markets. So far, the industry, starved of investment from its owner, the state, is finding it difficult to even meet internal demand. Aircraft long-promised to Aeroflot, such as the long distance Ilyushin-96, have not materialised on any significant scale. Aeroflot has taken delivery of just one Il-96 so far. And even those state enterprises which have succeeded in finding foreign investors, such as Aviastar, the manufacturer of the Antonov-124 transport machine which wants to switch to mass-production of the TU-204 passenger aircraft, is being hurt by the general crisis afflicting Russian industry. As the government cuts back orders and subsidies in an attempt to restore the country to some financial health, inflation and a physical shortage of banknotes to pay workers are hitting Aviastar like everybody else. Earlier this year, Aviastar set up a pioneering joint stock company with Robert Fleming, the investment management company taking a 50 per cent stake, to manufacture an upgraded version of the TU-204 for sale on foreign markets or for domestic buyers with hard currency. Plans are still on track to show a prototype fitted with Rolls-Royce engines at this year's Farnborough airshow. The price tag is to established somewhere beneath the cost of a Boeing-757 even though it is not yet clear just how far below that is going to be. Mr Dick Ciochetti, Rolls Royce's representative in Moscow, says that foreign companies wishing to do business in the former Soviet Union are finding the main problem is that nobody has any money to buy anything. 'Not only do they have no currency, they have no roubles now either,' he said. It is on a wing and a prayer that Russia is continuing its turbulent journey to a market economy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nikolay Semena report: "Ye. Saburov Has Problems with </F> Crimean Parliament"]    [Text] Sevastopol -- On 26 May the Crimean parliament  deferred the adoption of a decision on the formation of the  republic's government. Yu. Meshkov called this the third  government crisis in the Crimea.    After submitting to the Crimean Supreme Soviet a report on  the program for a solution to the crisis, Vice Premier Ye.  Saburov came under the fiercest criticism from the deputies.  Deputy V. Balla, chairman of the parliamentary economy  commission, called his speech "an economics lecture for  first-year students." Doubts were voiced about the report's  provisions on the role of the banks in the Crimean economy and  its view of privatization. Moreover, he was accused of lacking  confidence in local cadres of leaders and specialists, of  inactivity, and of not being in charge of the situation. Deputy  V. Shevza proposed that he seize the initiative and draft his  own program for a way out of the crisis instead of the  government. Deputies demanded that a law on the government be  submitted to the Supreme Council session first, then its concept  and structure, and only after that should personnel appointments  be made.    Crimean President Yu. Meshkov tried to convince deputies of  the need for the earliest possible solution of the question of  the government and asked that, in accordance with the results of  an opinion poll among inhabitants of the Crimea, he be empowered  to issue edicts with the force of law and form a government on  the basis of the structure envisaged by an edict already issued.  Yu. Meshkov said that the deputies' criticism of Ye. Saburov  was unethical and premature because there is no government as  such yet. Ye. Saburov himself also considered this criticism  wrong because he said that it was biased, uninformed, and  expressed from the Ukrainian Government's standpoint. He  described how at the meeting in Moscow "the wise Ye. Zvyagilskiy  had advised him not to sever ties with his institution once and  for all."    The deputies, however, with the active participation of the  "Russia" bloc, did not support the president and deferred the  question on the government. After that, deputy L. Krasnovskaya  announced that she was leaving the "Russia" bloc, and Yu.  Meshkov, Ye. Saburov, and all the candidates for ministerial  posts ostentatiously left the hall.    After examining the results of the talks in Kiev on the fate  of the constitution, the Crimean Supreme Council elected its  part of the general working group, which included five deputies.  It also recommended that several specialists be invited to take  part in its work. As for the agreed suspension of the law on  the restoration of the constitution, the Crimean deputies  decided not to do that for the time being but to return to the  question later.    Here are further details on one event.    At 1600 hours on 24 May, the Sevastopol militia discovered  two home-made explosive devices made from TNT cartridges  weighing in total 5.2 kg, plus six detonators and 36 meters of  fuse wire which had been hidden near a bridge across the  Fiolentovskoye Highway.    Later that night a suspicious individual was detained near  the same place as he was attempting to throw an object away into  the darkness. A search revealed this object to be a revolver.  The detainee was searched and more fuse wire was found,  identical to that found together with the concealed explosive  device.    The detained man was Veniamin Demin, a retired officer who  hails from Moscow. He used to be a miner in a special-purpose  team in Nikolayev Oblast. Back in December 1993 he was ordered  to leave his permanent place of residence in Ochakov and go back  to Moscow.    Competent organs have confirmed the discovery and the  detention. It is believed that the detained man worked for a  mafia grouping and that his mission was to commit an act of  terrorism, but other motives have not been ruled out. An  investigation is in progress.</p>

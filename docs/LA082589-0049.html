			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Grenada's government suspended Parliament amid opposition threats to bring  Prime Minister Herbert Blaize down with a no-confidence vote. Blaize, who lost  leadership of his New National Party, has been under intense pressure over what  critics call an increasingly authoritarian style. The suspension means Blaize  can govern without any parliamentary opposition until as late as February, a  month before general elections are due. Opposition leader George Brizan accused  Blaize, 71, of treating Parliament with "ridicule and contempt" during the  Caribbean island's most serious political crisis since the 1983 revolution and  subsequent U.S.-led invasion. Parliament is being suspended for an indefinite  period.  </P></p>

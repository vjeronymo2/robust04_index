			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Germans rule out Swan Hunter bid The board of German shipbuilder Bremer Vulkan, which had expressed interest in the troubled Swan Hunter shipyard, has decided not to bid, it emerged yesterday. The decision came after the company failed to find a partner for the venture. GEC, which is also believed to be a potential bidder for the shipyard, declined yesterday to reveal its intentions. The prospect of Swan Hunter, which has been in receivership since May, being sold as a shipbuilder now depend increasingly on whether the UK government is willing to assist a sale. The only company to confirm that it wishes to place a bid, French shipbuilder Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, has suggested that the government-funded Tyne and Wear Development Corporation buy Swan Hunter's main Tyneside sites and then lease the facilities to CMN. Such a deal would anger rival UK warship yards, which have already attacked the recent European Union decision, to grant Swan Hunter limited eligibility for intervention funding subsidy. Mr Fred Henderson, chairman of UK subsidiary CMN Support Services, said the idea of CMN leasing the shipbuilder's facilities from the development corporation was not a form of government aid because CMN would pay the market rent for the land. It was not out of the question that CMN might buy Swan Hunter's site, he said, but the more capital investment that was required, the more CMN needed to be confident of workload in the near future. 'We most certainly require a number of assurances and guarantees from the government on a whole host of matters,' said Mr Henderson. These included whether a CMN-owned Swan Hunter would be competing on an even basis for export work.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Business Law: Time for little sister to come of age Why can't building societies be more like banks? The Building Societies Act 1986 was intended by parliament to liberate societies from the constraints of their past so as to allow them to compete on more equal terms with the traditional rivals for the public's custom - the high street banks. Unfortunately, the Act left many areas of injustice, and building societies continue to be bedevilled by their past, and by the too easy assumption that their aims should retain the simplicity of those of the Friendly Societies from which they evolved. But times change, and the larger societies are rightly anxious to offer a full service to their customers in competition, if necessary, with the financial strength of the big banks. At present, their hands are tied by the legislative fetters of the 1986 Act, repeating as it does, the outmoded constraints of the past. For example, to be competitive, any financial institution must have ready access to funds, to take advantage of commercial opportunities as they arise. A bank can obtain funds in large quantities and at short notice at commercial rates. Not so a building society, which must not raise more than 40 per cent of funds in the wholesale market or hold more than 17.5 per cent of commercial assets except for first mortgages over wholly-owned residential property. This is all because originally the only object a society might legitimately have was to raise funds from the deposits and subscriptions of its members and use them so that they could buy residential properties for their own use on mortgage to the society. How different and diverse are the objectives of building societies now - or rather, how different are the financial services they would like to be able to offer their members were it not for the restrictions imposed by the 1986 Act. This is already outdated and it was always too restrictive. Societies in the 1990s face competition from banks in their traditional home loan market, and are unable to respond effectively with new ventures of their own. The unfair disparity between what a bank can do and what a society can do was highlighted soon after the Act came into force. The Abbey National, one of the largest societies, thought its best course to achieve a level playing field was to become a bank itself. Banks are public limited companies governed by companies legislation and can do what they please, since the objects clause of their Memoranda of Association are extremely wide. The 1986 Act, however, says only what building societies may do rather than what they may not do. Any activity not specifically permitted is automatically forbidden. This includes all new ventures and activities not thought of in 1986. At the time Abbey National converted to a plc it listed several areas in which previously it could not compete with banks. These included the raising of funds otherwise than by the deposits and subscriptions of members already mentioned. There were also such restrictions as the prohibition against lending more than Pounds 10,000 to any one individual unless secured; the baffling restriction against owning more than 15 per cent of a general insurance company; the inability to operate outside the European Community and then only through a subsidiary company; the inability to develop land except primarily for residential use; the inability to use some instruments available to banks for liquidity management. The results have not all been bad. No building society was able to invest imprudently in the American banking world because no building society could invest in America at all. But the restrictions prevent any opportunity for profit to be made outside the EC. Even in the UK, a bizarre result of the Act is that it is uncertain whether any society can take part in a syndicated loan designed to spread the risk of lending. A thriving market in the purchase by housing associations of entire stocks of local authority housing has developed comparatively recently. Sums between Pounds 30m and Pounds 100m are usually involved but there is a prospect of two deals of Pounds 200m or more occurring within the next year. Not many banks standing alone would wish to commit themselves to figures such as these; the situation cries out for syndication. But building societies, the traditional lenders for house purchase, are inhibited from taking part because this market was not in existence in 1986 and syndicated loans were not mentioned in the Act. Some believe this fact prevents any building society from participating. There is an urgent need for change by way of amending legislation. The essential nature of a building society could be preserved by a requirement that its members could only be investors and mortgage borrowers and that one of its principal purposes should be to make advances to them to buy houses. Societies could be required to have perhaps 25 per cent of their liabilities in respect of share deposits and loans represented by members shares. Subject to this, any society should be entitled to do anything set out in its memorandum, to be approved by the regulatory body. Societies would still pursue their original purpose of lending to their members but they should be able to raise funds with far less restraint than today. They should be able to engage in a greater range of financial activities. There must have been members of the Abbey National who were dismayed to find their rights in their own society transferred into a right to acquire shares in a public limited company supervised, not by the Building Society Commission, but by the Bank of England. How much simpler it would have been to remove the restrictions which caused the Abbey National to make the big change in the first place. Freedom to operate should no longer be confined to banks and there should be no need for societies to convert to limited company status to provide full financial services. All of this seems clear. A greater difficulty would lie in the choice of a regulatory body. The Building Society Commission, set up in 1986, has few friends among societies, which believe it has been restrictive and unhelpful. It has no experience of banking, but this could be remedied by the recruitment of those in the clearing banks and at the Bank of England who have. The only alternative is that all societies which seize the new opportunities created by an amending Act to provide banking services should be regulated by the Bank of England. But the Bank knows little of building societies. Its record as a regulator is badly flawed. Its recent history is strewn with avoidable disasters in spotting trouble that stretch from the failure of Johnson Matthey bank in 1985 to the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International last year. To take on new responsibilities in an unknown field would be to invite further disasters. It seems better that the Building Society Commission under its new chairman, Ms Rosalind Gilmore, should be given a chance to cast aside the restrictive characteristics of its past and to meet the challenges of an expanded role. The main purpose of a regulator is early detection and prevention of failure and fraud. In contrast to the Bank of England, the Commission's record in this respect is good. As Ms Gilmore said at the Building Society Association conference in Glasgow last summer: 'Our duty is to promote the protection by each building society of the investments of its shareholders and depositors.' Whenever a society has shown signs of difficulty, the Commission has acted with commendable speed. Larger societies have been asked to assist and the result has often been a merger of the weaker with the stronger building society. The Commission has enforced its liquidity and capital adequacy requirements well. It would be a pity to remove from its regulatory control the larger and more adventurous societies which would be likely to seize the new opportunities made available to them. But most societies feel there would be a need for a sea change in the attitude of the Commission. If there is to be a change in the statutory restrictions, the attitude of the Commission must also change so as to give effect to the new liberality and flexibility of the industry it would regulate.

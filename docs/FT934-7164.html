			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (21): The case for stylish travel / A look at luxurious accessories for gentlemen going on a journey THERE was a time when the requirement for membership of the Traveller's Club was to have journeyed for 500 miles measured in a straight line from the club. Nowadays, most day-trippers would therefore qualify. But if we are all now gentleman travellers, few of us maintain the kind of style and luxury in which those gentlemen used to undertake their journeys. And if we are looking for the ultimate travel kit, then it has to hark back to those days of grand travel. We have to ignore the modern middle manager's concern with the lightweight and the miniature (which inevitably become the flimsy and the meagre), and look instead for both substance and style. Remember that the Duke of Windsor went away for three months at a time, with up to 118 square leather trunks; all were numbered and inventoried, and all came, of course, from Louis Vuitton. Vuitton has long been regarded as the premier malletier; its upright steamer trunks are virtually fitted bedrooms with handles. But more practical for any man who travels under his own steam is their lighter but still luxurious new Taiga range, in a masculine, grained, dark green leather with brass fittings. This range brings a masculinity missing from many of Vuitton's lines; it includes a shrewdly-designed soft leather travel bag, called Helanga (Pounds 800), which contains a pop-out suit carrier, a laptop computer case (Oural, Pounds 995) and a pochette for a mobile phone (Baikal, Pounds 275). These confirm the essential principle of luxury luggage: that cases should cost more than the items they contain. Louis Vuitton may be the name which most evokes luxury luggage, but the particular item which recalls grand travel is not Vuitton's; it is the classic plain tan leather suitcase. Swaine Adeney Brigg (185-186 Piccadilly), still sells rigid leather suitcases, in three shades of sumptuous bridle hide. Built on a wood frame, with capped corners, and with retaining straps inside. They range from Pounds 825 to Pounds 890. Harrod's sells similar tan leather suitcases by Tanner Krolle (Pounds 850-Pounds 1250) but the leather has a glossier finish, new money to Swaine Adeney's old. Dunhill, another classic touring outfitter, has its Cambridge range of structured leather luggage, in rich shades of racing green as well as English tan; suitcases start at Pounds 860, with an impressive trunk at Pounds 2,050. And for sheer indulgence, the luxury traveller will demand Dunhill's Cambridge train case for Pounds 860. Along with your dedicated shirt case, you will require a special case for your ties, to keep your neckwear safely strapped and pressed. Leather tie cases are available from Swaine Adeney Brigg (Pounds 125). But the best design is that of the porta cravatte by Rodeo Star (Pounds 42, from Revelation, 170 Piccadilly) - less luxurious perhaps, but it incorporates a neat hanging device so that the creases can fall out of your ties when you arrive. And do not forget to exhibit a British attitude towards the weather, no matter your destination, by packing the most impressive travelling umbrella of them all. The Brigg M &amp; F umbrella (from Swaine, Adeney Brigg) unscrews into three parts - handle, body and ferrule - to fit into an attache case; unlike common travelling umbrellas it does not actually collapse, either intentionally or otherwise. With the silk cover, it is a cloud-busting Pounds 255.25; with the more plebeian nylon, Pounds 135. Once your luggage is safely stowed, you will need something to carry around your money and tickets. The truly aristocratic use a butler; for those just a notch down the social ladder, there is the travel document wallet from Gidden (Clifford Street, W1 and Burlington Arcade), saddlers to the Queen and makers of a range of classic leather goods. This paperback-sized folder in bridle hide (Pounds 186) has separate divisions for air tickets, documents, foreign currency, cash and travellers cheques, and also incorporates a removable leather passport holder. Gidden's leather writing case, in a folding, envelope design (Pounds 125), is also a necessity to write those letters home in style. Perhaps the greatest luxury of travel is time; the Grand Tours of the 18th century often lasted five years. Few of us now have such time on our hands, but we can still sport time on our wrists. The most sophisticated travel wristwatch is the Jaeger-LeCoultre Geographique, a hand-assembled, mechanical wristwatch which takes its owner around the globe. At a twist of the crown, the displayed time will leap to that in any of 24 cities, representing time zones from Los Angeles through Auckland. Only a limited number of Geographiques are made each year, with prices ranging from Pounds 8,500 to Pounds 13,000. Something similar is offered by the Ebel Voyager, which has a rotating bezel which indicates the time in major cities, but in a less sophisticated manner; prices are from a more modest Pounds 1,880. For those who will be flying their aircraft personally, the Breitling Chronospace, along with slide rule aviation calculations, offers two time displays simultaneously, one analogue and one digital, for time home and away; prices are from Pounds 820. All these watches are available from The Watch Gallery (Jermyn Street and Fulham Road). You will, of course, be woken by room service, so instead of the conventional folding travel alarm clock, the contemporary traveller packs the Braun world travel calculator. It combines the classic matt black Braun calculator with a world time clock and alarm; Pounds 42 from Oggetti (Fulham Road). And alongside it at the bedside, another contemporary item; the ultimate world radio, the Sony ICF-SW77 (Pounds 399), with memory for 162 frequencies, station-name tuning, a timer, and the ability with its short-wave reception to pick up the BBC World Service virtually anywhere on the planet. Once you have succeeded in travelling with style, a gentleman needs to travel in style as well. Grooming kits seem to contain devices ranging from the indispensable to the incomprehensible. At Liberty (Regent Street), there are the waxy nappa leather sets by W A Goold; a padded case containing full-size razor, collapsible toothbrush, nail clippers, mirror and comb is Pounds 34. Goold also make a traditional hair brush which contains a manicure set zipped into its body (Pounds 39.95). At The Conran Shop (Michelin House, Fulham Road) a leather case (Pounds 74) contains a clothes brush and sewing kit along with all the grooming essentials. But perhaps the most impressive contemporary set comes from Oggetti, a nine-piece toilet set in black leather pouch, where even the razor is matt black (Pounds 113.35). For those who insist on an electric shave, the neat little Payer battery-operated razor, designed by F A Porsche, is by far the most impressive (Harrod's, Pounds 37.80). But luxury travel is all about tradition, and that is embodied in Penhaligon's beautiful razor and shaving brush, housed in engine-turned nickel tubes (Pounds 45 each, from Harrod's and branches of Penhaligons). For sustenance, the traditional traveller turns, naturally, to Fortnum &amp; Mason (Piccadilly, W1), who offer a buckled leather roll containing a pewter flask and four pewter cups (Pounds 107). His destinations are kept in his beautiful Three City address book (Pounds 17.95) from Smythson's (New Bond Street), cleverly divided into three separate alphabetical sections for London, New York and Tokyo (or Paris). And his money is similarly divided, held in money clips by Murray Ward in Pounds , Dollars and Y designs (gold on silver, Pounds 45 each) from Simpson (Piccadilly). Surrounded by the beauty of this ultimate travel kit, a gentleman can indeed relive the days of grand travel; and perhaps he will recognise another truth in Emerson's statement - 'Though we travel the world over to find the beautiful, we must carry it with us or we find it not.'</p>

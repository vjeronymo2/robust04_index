			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Directors deny greed over pay HIGHLY PAID British bosses took cover yesterday after BTR chairman Sir Owen Green attacked them for the size of their pay packets. In an article entitled 'Greed: the curse that is corrupting Britain's bosses', published in yesterday's Daily Mail, Sir Owen complained that top people were awarding themselves rises irrespective of the performance of their companies. Speaking later he accused his peers of cowardice in their response. 'People have been saying to me 'you are absolutely right' but they are not putting their heads above the parapet,' he said. Sir David Plastow, chairman of the remuneration committee at Guinness which was recently criticised for awarding a 25 per cent pay rise to company chairman Sir Anthony Tennant, was one of the few to mount a public defence. 'I am totally unapologetic,' he said. 'When Sir Owen says that chairmen are paying themselves too much, he doesn't understand.' Sir David described Sir Anthony as an 'entrepreneurial and marketing genius', and said that his departing salary of Pounds 777,000 was determined by an independent committee and reflected the exceptional performance of the company. 'He (Sir Owen) also talks about chief executives being ordinary chaps. In fact it is an enormously demanding and stressful job,' said Sir David, who agreed in general that pay and performance should be more closely related. Sir Owen, who is paid Pounds 217,616 by BTR, said the maximum salary for a British chief executive should be 'around Pounds 500,000 for the top 10 companies in the country. It certainly shouldn't be Pounds 1m.' Prudential and Tesco, whose highest-paid directors received Pounds 769,000 and nearly Pounds 1m respectively last year, were among the companies that refused to comment yesterday. ICI pointed out that the 25 per cent salary increase for Mr Ronnie Hampel, who will be chief executive of the reorganised ICI, reflected his promotion to a more responsible job. Some executives said BTR should not criticise others as it had failed to disclose in its 1992 accounts the Pounds 460,000 pay packet of chief executive Mr Alan Jackson. Sir Owen said this was an oversight that would be rectified next year. But the Institute of Directors said yesterday: 'The fact that (Sir Owen) takes a public stance is totally to be applauded.' Mr Paddy Linaker, managing director of M&amp;G, the fund management group, complained that very large pay rises 'create a bad image'.</p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: Canal-Plus faces reduced profit Canal-Plus, the French media group, yesterday warned it may face a sharp reduction in net profits for 1994 because of an increase in investments in its operations. The company - in the 1980s one of the stars of the European media sector after the success of its original French pay-TV station - said it was on course to meet its profit forecast of around FFr1.2bn (Dollars 207m) for 1993. However, it expected a fall in net profits of up to 20 per cent next year. Canal-Plus last year faced its first setback by reporting static net profits of FFr1.1bn on sales of FFr7.94bn. It recovered momentum during the first half of this year, with a 33 per cent increase in interim net profits to FFr676m from FFr507m. However, the group faces a steep increase in investment during 1994. It is concerned it may be forced by the government to invest in France's struggling cable-television network as part of the terms of renewing its French pay-TV licence. Canal-Plus also expects increased investment in its pay-TV interests and its thematic channels outside France. Finally, it plans to protect its long-term position by adding to its library of programming rights and by increasing its own production activities. Canal-Plus strenuously denied recent speculation in the UK that it might join a 'white knight' consortium to rescue LWT, the London television company, now the target of a hostile bid by Granada.</p>

			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (8): Incentives are in place - Michael Holman examines the freeport plan IF VISION becomes reality, Port Louis harbour will play an increasingly important role in the economic development of Mauritius. Hand in hand with the expansion and improvement of the harbour and its facilities is the plan for a freeport, closely linked to the island's emerging role as an offshore banking centre. The port would serve as an international trade depot, providing warehousing for transhipment and facilities for processing or assembling of goods and materials for re-export to destinations around the world. Sir Edouard Lim Fat, chairman of the Mauritius Freeport Authority established earlier this year, and prime mover behind the establishment of the island's Export Processing Zone, acknowledges that it is an ambitious project. The publicity material for the project refers to the island's 'strategic location in the Indian Ocean.' But the natural economic hinterland is sub-Saharan Africa - which is responsible for only 3 per cent of world trade. 'It is nevertheless a significant market which we can help service,' counters Sir Edouard, who is just back from a promotional visit to the Far East. 'Membership of the Preferential Trade Agreement (an African trading bloc) is one of the biggest assets we have. We are a gateway to Africa, particularly for exports from Asia.' The success of the Export Processing Zone - selling knitwear to Europe and the US - shows that distance need not be an obstacle. Sir Edouard goes on to list a wide range of incentives. Machinery and materials imported by freeport operators will be exempted from duties and taxes, and goods destined for re-export will qualify for reduced port charges. Companies engaged exclusively in re-export qualify for concessionary tax rates; free repatriation of profits; freedom from exchange controls; exemption from duties; tax on imported office equipment and, in addition, tax breaks for expatriate staff. Double taxation agreements with Britain, South Africa, France, Germany and India already exist, while treaties with Italy, Zimbabwe, Sweden and Malaysia are scheduled to come into effect soon. These incentives, coupled with the harbour's improved facilities, political stability, good telecommunications, a well educated bilingual (English and French) labour force and pleasant living conditions, make up an attractive package, argues Sir Edouard. The port, which handled over 3m tons of cargo during the year ending June 1992, has ample room for expansion, with about 290 acres of land created by a dredging and reclamation programme. In addition to five deep water quays, an eight hectare container park with an annual throughput of 85,000 TEUs, has provision for refrigerated containers. A 7,500 sq. m. shed is available for freeport activities, while 37 acres of land have been earmarked for development, should demand warrant it. 'We have the facilities, we are providing the incentives - my job now is to put the freeport of Mauritius on the map,' says Sir Edouard.</p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Japanese watchdog aims to silence wagging tongues - Commission's quest to clean up stock markets and restore confidence BENEATH the flickering red lights of an electronic stock board showing Tokyo share prices edging higher, Mr Masami Ishizaka, the head of Japan's Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, had reason to be relaxed about his crusade to clean up the Japanese stock markets and restore investor confidence shaken by a flurry of scandals. Established in the heat of scandal, the commission, however, has found it difficult to cultivate the image of an aggressive and independent watchdog. It still shares a building with the finance ministry and takes its staff on a rotation basis. Mr Ishizaka, SESC secretary general, is mildly irritated by the often-expressed scepticism of Japanese business commentators, who have suggested the commission answers to a finance ministry which has restruck its close relationship with the securities industry. 'We are not at all controlled by the finance ministry,' he says. 'Each institution has its own responsibilities. The ministry issues licences to securities houses, but we are in charge of investigations. If we make a recommendation for action, something should be done about it.' The commission's 203 staff, also including ex-prosecutors and former tax investigators, like to compare themselves to the Fair Trade Commission, Japan's anti-monopoly body, which has become increasingly vigilant in the past three years, partly due to intense US pressure to clear away cartels. With well-publicised raids on bid-rigging printing houses and price-fixing electronics companies, the FTC has at least given industrial Japan cause for contemplation. It is still criticised by the US for not being tough enough, but has also been condemned by business organisations for its zeal. The same cannot be said of the SESC, which has released details of only one investigation: a case against Cosmo Securities, a second-tier broker found to be guilty of tobashi - shuffling stocks around client accounts to avoid booking a loss. Cosmo was told in December to suspend corporate business in Tokyo for a week, and to stop dealing in convertible bonds on its own account for four weeks. Promising to be even more vigilant than the FTC, Mr Ishizaka explains the SESC's low profile by emphasising: 'We are only getting started.' He said comparisons with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were not useful because of the different structure of the two financial systems. But he is confident his commission has put pressure on brokers to play by the rules. 'I think the securities houses see us as something that is quite frightening. We emphasise to them that we want to ensure that the prosperity of the industry is fair and just.' Over the past two years, the industry has been forced to confess that some of its prosperity was not 'fair and just'. Leading brokers admitted to stock price manipulation, compensating favoured corporate clients, and links to one group of unsavoury investors, the yakuza, or gangsters. After the controversy and condemnation, Mr Ishizaka said the industry appeared to have learned from the mistakes and was attempting to reform its management. Despite the favourable comparison with the FTC, he says the commission is 'willing to support this gradual change'. But the pressure for change has eased as Tokyo stock prices have risen over the past month. The SESC was commissioned when the Nikkei stock market average was languishing at around 16,000, and reassuring investors was a government priority. The SESC was to ensure that all were treated equally, and the bad habits of the 'bubble' era of the late 1980s were reformed. Yesterday, the Nikkei market average rose rose 1.4 per cent to 19,048.38, the highest close since last March 31, the end of the fiscal year, when financial institutions and industrial companies closed the books and calculated losses or gains on their stock portfolios. Japanese brokers say the market has bottomed and the boisterous, bullish trading days have returned. Daily market turnover has topped 800m recently, four times that of February, and speculative stocks have returned to fashion. Big turnover stocks yesterday included Nippon Housing Loan, a crippled home loan institution now under reconstruction, and companies involved in Aids research such as Meiji Milk, a dairy products group. It remains unclear whether stocks have really turned the corner - the market was trading yesterday on a price/earnings ratio of 65.8 times. The SESC was also formed amid severe criticism of the the intimate relationship between the finance ministry and financial institutions. The ministry's lack of will to control undisciplined brokers and often obscure administrative guidance were cited as causes of the stock scandals. Responding to the controversy, the ruling Liberal Democratic party decided the relationship, sometimes clouded by ministry officials' expectation of a future job in banking or broking, was in need of reform. Apart from investigation, the SESC was given the power to 'propose policies' to keep financial markers fair. Time has passed, and the debate has faded. Mr Ishizaka sees positive aspects in the traditionally close ties: 'The finance ministry has various administrative functions, and it is useful that the ministry and the brokers are close.'</p>

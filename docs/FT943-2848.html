			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Prices for finer Merinos rose even more rapidly in the earlier Australian sale days this week, with broader types also rising if more gradually. The Eastern states market indicator ended at 829c/kg, compared with 780c/kg a week before. The Western states indicator rose strongly at the first Fremantle sale but the market was a little erratic at the close, 5 cents down on the day if still 25 cents higher than at the end of last week. With prices at least double those a year ago, and for finer Merinos much more than that, ther is resistance among wool textile manufactures and particularly UK home market retailers, but a rising market does involve small-scale but steady support even during the unhappier times.</p>

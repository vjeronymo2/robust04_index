He added that most of them made this decision after the  announcement of [Shining Path leader] Abimael Guzman's and the  Shining Path leadership's call to lay down arms.    Espichan said: "Before Abimael's letters, we had recorded  about 400 repented terrorists. After Abimael's letters, this  number tripled."    Espichan noted that 780 Shining Path terrorists and 730 MRTA  [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] terrorists have sought  shelter so far under the Repentance Law.    Espichan said 1,300 terrorists, 300 of whom are serving life  sentences, were sentenced in 1993.  <H5>  Sabotage </H5>   EXPRESO also was able to determine that discrediting the  Repentance Law mechanisms to discourage the surrender of Shining  Path militants reportedly has become a key objective for Shining  Path subversion.    Experts on Shining Path subversion, who preferred to remain  anonymous, said that in order to achieve their objective the  terrorists now are presenting an alleged new group, reportedly  formed by former repented terrorists who allegedly have been  frustrated because they did not receive the Repentance Law's  benefits.    Thus, there allegedly exists a self-styled "5 de Abril"  group, allegedly formed by former repented terrorists and  allegedly headed by [Shining Path leader] Julio Cesar Mezzich  himself.    The experts said the Maoist gang actually is seeking methods  to prevent its supporters from repenting. The experts  emphasized that the Shining Path's concrete objective is to  prevent its supporters from seeking shelter under the Repentance  Law.    The experts noted: "The terrorists are engaged in a sabotage  campaign against the Repentance Law because it represents the  measure most threatening to them." [passage omitted]</p>

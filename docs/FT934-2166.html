			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Noble Lowndes fined Pounds 740,000 over poor investment advice Noble Lowndes and Partners, the financial adviser, has been fined Pounds 740,000 by City regulators for breaches of rules, including giving bad advice to customers. Imro, the self-regulatory organisation for the investment management industry, said yesterday that the firm had admitted four disciplinary charges. As well as the fine, Noble Lowndes must pay Imro's costs of Pounds 45,000 for the disciplinary action. So far it has also paid out Pounds 580,000 in compensation to customers. NLP said that the charges of giving unsuitable advice and 'churning' - buying and selling shares under management for no other reason than to earn commission - related to the activities of four personal financial services consultants. None of the four, who operated from offices in Leeds and the Midlands, is still working for NLP. Between May 1988 and February 1992 they engaged in 'systematic' switching of investments between products in ways that 'were not justified from the customer's objective'. Altogether, 225 clients were involved. Imro launched a formal investigation in April this year to examine possible breaches of its rules from one branch office which had been drawn to its attention by NLP's internal audit. In consultation with Imro, NLP appointed the accountancy firm Binder Hamlyn to conduct a thorough review of all the client files concerned. When it is finished in about six months, its investigation will have covered samples from the files of up to a third of the 240 sales consultants employed over the relevant period. Imro also found that NLP had failed to keep proper written records on, for example, customers' circumstances or their understanding of the investment risk, and it criticised the procedures for monitoring compliance and for identifying potential 'churning' of customers. All the costs are to be met by the TSB group, which sold Noble Lowndes to Sedgwick, its present owner, in September for Pounds 110m. Mr Robert Walker, managing director of personal financial services at NLP, said yesterday that the charges related to single-premium investment products, such as bonds or unit trusts. Although NLP provides actuarial consultancy services for the pensions industry as well as giving financial advice, the mis-selling did not relate to pensions business. Mr Walker and Mr David Strauss, NLP's chief executive, highlighted the changes in compliance procedures and in management that Sedgwick had made, and emphasised its commitment to ensuring that all clients were fully compensated. In June, Imro imposed a Pounds 750,000 fine on Invesco MIM, the fund management group, which admitted 55 breaches of City rules.</p>

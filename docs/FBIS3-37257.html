Previously, obedient to Saliy's call to boycott the last  December 12 elections and the national referendum on Russia's  new Constitution, his supporters did not go to the polls. Now  the neo- Bolsheviks have however changed their attitude toward  elections. According to the leader of Tatar communists, Russia's  political course may only be influenced and the status of  Tatarstan may be determined with the help of the State Duma.    Saliy told the press that the activists of his party will  run  for the elections in each of the five one-mandate constituencies  located on the territory of Tatarstan, where the December 12  elections were not held.</p>

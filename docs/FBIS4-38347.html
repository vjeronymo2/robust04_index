			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has declared that  Turkey's current difficulties should not prevent it from  exploiting the opportunities it encounters while a new world is  being established. Demirel stated: Turkey should not drown in  daily problems or stop seeing what is in front of it.    Demirel, who is currently visiting Ukraine as the official  guest of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, held a news  conference at his residence in Kiev yesterday and commented on  Turkey's foreign policy and his contacts. TRT correspondent  Yavuz Yorulmaz reports from Kiev:    [Begin Yorulmaz recording] In his news conference, Demirel  explained that Ukraine is an important country because of its  natural resources and its geographical position. If Ukraine  fails in its goals, Demirel noted, the world will be faced with  attempts to reactivate the old Soviet system. Stressing that  Turkey wants to continue its good relations with the newly  independent former Soviet republics, Demirel noted that Turkey  has enjoyed goodneighborly and friendly relations with Ukraine  for 70 years.    Demirel remarked that Turkey has not yet reached the desired  level of cooperation with Ukraine, adding that his visit is  aimed at further developing the existing opportunities for  cooperation even further. Within this framework, Demirel  recalled, a protocol was signed on the construction of the  Ceyhan-Samsun oil pipeline, and this project will enable the  transportation of Middle East oil through Turkey to Ukraine via  the Black Sea, and from there to Europe. Demirel said: This  benefits Turkey. It is an extremely interesting project. As it  stands, there is an oil pipeline from Yumurtalik to Kirikkale.  We can join Kirikkale to Samsun and this matter is solved for  the beginning. The project to construct an oil pipeline for 40  million tonnes, which was proposed by them, is an extremely  important project. We will only charge transit fees.    Demirel said that during his contacts, he had the  opportunity  to discuss the situation of Crimean Tatars with Ukrainian  officials. Noting that the Crimean Tatars were mistreated during  the Stalin period and the world remained a spectator to this  situation, Demirel remarked that it is Turkey's duty to extend a  hand to these people at a time when they want to resettle in  their motherland.    Tomorrow morning Demirel will proceed to Moldova, the second  leg of his tour. [end recording]</p>

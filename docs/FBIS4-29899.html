			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 21 (KCNA) -- An inaugural meeting of  the Indian Committee for the Repatriation to the North of Kim  In-so and Ham Se-hwan, unconverted long-term prisoners in South  Korea, was held in New Delhi on June 9 on the occasion of the  month of international solidarity with the Korean people (June  25-July 27).    It was attended by M. Farooqi, secretary of the National  Council of the Indian Communist Party, Jitendra Sharma, general  secretary of the Indian Association of Lawyers, and others.    The participants strongly denounced the South Korean  authorities for imprisoning and persecuting Kim In-so and Ham  Se-hwan, prisoners of war, for more than 30 years, in wanton  violation of the international law, far from sending them back  to the northern half of Korea where their families are waiting  for them.    A letter of protest to the chief executive of South Korea  was  adopted at the meeting.    The letter condemned the South Korean authorities for  unreasonably refusing to send Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan back to  the North and demanded that they be repatriated without delay so  that they may reunite with their families and relatives in the  North.</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities wind down ahead of holiday Wall Street AIDED BY technical trading in stock futures, US equities posted modest gains yesterday as the markets wound down ahead of the long holiday weekend, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up just 8.06 at 3,386.77. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 1.42 to 414.02, while the Amex composite finished 0.82 higher at 392.46 and the Nasdaq composite 1.20 higher at 580.30. Turnover on the NYSE was very light at 147m shares. With the Treasury market shutting at 1 pm so that traders could leave for home early, trading in equities was listless for most of the day. Stocks were initially led higher by the futures markets, and held on to those gains in the wake of gains in bond prices. The overall mood, however, remained subdued amid disappointment that the Federal Reserve chose not to cut interest rates this week. Share prices have been bid up recently in anticipation of an easing in policy and, now that it has not materialised, the chances of the market advancing much above 3,400 on the Dow have deteriorated, said analysts. Among individual stocks, General Motors firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 39 1/4 in turnover of 2m shares after Mr Robert Stempel, the chairman, said that GM was accelerating a restructuring of its unprofitable North American operations. Mr Stempel said that he expected productivity to improve by 7 per cent to 8 per cent per year as the restructuring takes effect. McDonalds fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 45 7/8 in spite of encouraging comments at the annual meeting by the food chain's chairman saying the company was experiencing positive sales momentum in most of the world. Raytheon rose in early trading on the news that the aviation electronics and weapons group will be making staff cuts in the wake of the reductions in US defence budgets, but gave up all of its gains by the close to end down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 44 3/8 . Rohr Industries slumped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 12 in active trading after reporting a fiscal third quarter loss of Dollars 1.42 a share, compared to the profit of 15 cents a share earned at the same stage a year ago. Oklahoma Gas &amp; Electric fell another Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 36 1/2 as investors reacted negatively to a company statement that its earnings were not sufficient to maintain the annual dividend. Gottschalks fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 11 after the broking house Smith Barney downgraded the California-based retail department store chain stock from 'buy' to 'avoid' because of uncertainty generated by a criminal investigation into the company by the Internal Revenue Service. In the same sector, Federated Department Stores firmed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 12 1/2 after Salomon Brothers initiated coverage of the stock with an 'outperform' rating. Canada TORONTO ended slightly higher in moderate trading. According to preliminary data, the composite index rose 14.10 points, or 0.42 per cent, to close at 3,372.15, for a loss on the week of about 19 points. Advances led declines by 310 to 263. Volume was 27,797,000 shares valued at CDollars 233m.</p>

			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Polly Peck finds buyer for fruit side: Hopes for creditors as Mexican group pays Dollars 499m for Del Monte Fresh Produce A MAINLY Mexican investor group has agreed to pay Dollars 499m (Pounds 260m) in cash for PPI Del Monte Fresh Produce, the fresh fruit side of Polly Peck International, the fruit and electronics conglomerate which collapsed in October 1990. The deal represents the last hope of securing a large amount of cash to pay the group's 23,000 creditors. Sources close to the group's administration said it still seemed likely that most creditors would only get a payment of between 3p and 11p in the pound. The investor consortium is led by Grupo Cabal of Florida, the holding company of Mr Carlos Cabal which holds a controlling interest in Banco BCH, the eighth largest commercial bank in Mexico. Grupo Cabal, a diversified business group, is already a leading producer of bananas in south-east Mexico. Other members of the consortium include Nacional Financiera, the Mexican government development bank with assets of Dollars 20bn, and other strategic investors. Nacional Financiera may put up around 10 per cent of the total. Mr Harold Schenker, executive vice-president of PPI Del Monte Tropical Fruit Company, said he was happy with the deal, which would be closed 'in a couple of months'. Mr Schenker said that when Del Monte was put up for sale, there had been 'more than 10 bidders', but that towards the end the number of finalists had been 'less than five'. Of these, some were investor groups and some were fruit companies. The administrators, who abandoned long-standing plans to float part of PPI Del Monte on the New York Stock Exchange in the spring amid worsening conditions in the banana market, were advised on the sale by Goldmann Sachs International. The price paid by Grupo Cabal is well below the Dollars 875m paid by Polly Peck for PPI Del Monte three years ago, but that figure included nine ships which were subsequently sold off. The management and structure of PPI Del Monte will remain 'unchanged and intact' after the sale, Mr Schenker said. The company is the second largest marketer of pineapples in the world and the third largest banana marketer. Its annual turnover is a 'bit under Dollars 1bn', Mr Cabal said. The sale of Del Monte may now open the way for the administrators to resolve the future of the remaining parts of the group.</p>

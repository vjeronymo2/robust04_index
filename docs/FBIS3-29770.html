			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At the lower house Budget Committee session held on  the afternoon of 18 February, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  commented on the issue of the suspected development of nuclear  weapons by the DPRK (North Korea) and explained how Japan will  deal with the situation in case the UN Security Council decides  to impose economic sanctions on North Korea, saying: 1) It is a  matter of course that Japan has to take responsible actions  should the Security Council decide to do so; and 2) Japan agrees  with the UN Charter and will take responsible actions within the  limit of the Japanese Constitution. In this way, he went into  more detail than before and disclosed a plan to cooperate with  the United Nations in wide-ranging areas to impose economic  sanctions on North Korea.    At the recent Japanese-U.S. summit talks, the prime minister  explained his view regarding the issue of economic sanctions  against North Korea, saying, "We will do our best in dealing  with the situation within the limits of our law." At the Budget  Committee session on the same day, Michio Watanabe asked  Hosokawa if what the latter meant by "the law is the  Constitution or another law?" In response, the prime minister  explained, "What I meant to say was the Constitution."  Moreover, Watanabe asked: "We need to revise the self-defense  law if economic sanctions are imposed on North Korea. Do you  mean to say that you will not hesitate, within the limits of the  Constitution, to revise laws needed for crisis management?" The  prime minister replied, "We will deal with situations within the  limits of the Constitution more than the limits of the UN  Charter." In this way, he indicated his opinion that he will  revise the relevant laws, including the self-defense law. It  seems that Hosokawa -- while keeping in mind the high  possibility that the United Nations may carry out a blockade in  the waters around North Korea should the Security Council decide  to impose economic sanctions on North Korea -- indicated his  stand that in addition to taking some measures regarding the  issue of remittances to North Korea by Korean residents in  Japan, it is possible to start making some contributions to such  UN activities.    Following the rupture of the Japanese-U.S. economic  framework  talks, the United States is strengthening its plan to impose  sanctions on Japan. In this regard, the prime minister urged  the United States to take a prudent stand. He then explained  how Japan will deal with the situation, stressing: "We can make  no guess, but must see what kind of measures the United States  actually will take. We should try to respond calmly." He  explained that Japan will bring the case to the GATT "in  accordance with international rules" if the United States  actually imposes sanctions on Japan.    Takashi Fukaya of the Liberal Democratic Party strongly  demanded that the prime minister assume responsibility for an  announcement on the idea of introducing a national welfare tax,  saying "the problem was the decisionmaking process." The prime  minister rejected this demand and said: "It was decided  hurriedly, so there might have been a problem with the process.  However, nothing is wrong with the fact that the ruling  parties' initial ideas were used as a springboard for  discussions, and I brought the whole matter to a conclusion on  the basis of my own decision."    As for the tax system reform, Hosokawa stated, "Efforts to  trim unnecessary expenses or to revise the unfair tax system  alone cannot support the aging society financially." In this  way, he explained his view that a hike in the consumption tax is  inevitable. He said this in response to a question by Yoshiaki  Matsumoto of the Japan Communist Party.</p>

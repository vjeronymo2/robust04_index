			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Observer: Legal problem Tony Ensor, the only casualty of the boardroom bust-up at Liverpool Football Club, is nowhere near as well known as Graham Souness, the club's embattled manager. But his departure raises an interesting question. Who advised the board on the legal side of the Souness row? Ensor may have been little known to many fans, but he is widely respected in the Merseyside business community as the senior partner of Weightman Rutherfords, one of the north-west's leading corporate law firms. He became a Liverpool director after the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985, and has been a source of stability in the boardroom ever since. Ensor's sudden exit must raise questions about how long chairman David Moores, a member of the wealthy Littlewoods pools family who became chairman in August 1991, can survive in the job. The least Moores should do now is find another top-notch lawyer.</p>

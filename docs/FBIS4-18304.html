			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bonn/Hamburg (DPA) -- The Federal Government  expects that all arms supplied by Germany to Turkey will be used  in line with bilateral agreements. This was emphasized by a  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman in connection with the discussion  on the use of German arms in Turkey. This means that Turkey  must use German arms only within the framework of NATO orders,  the spokeswoman said. This was also laid down in an exchange of  letters between the foreign ministers of the two countries in  1992.    According to Christian Democratic Union [CDU] Bundestag  Deputy Klaus Francke, the Bundestag's Foreign Committee will  deal with the issue on the use of German arms in the Kurdish  conflict on 13 April. The Federal Government will subsequently  comment on the issue, Francke said on North German radio NDR on  Saturday [2 April]. If Turkey were to use German arms in its  actions against Kurds, this would be a violation of the  arrangements made with Turkey. Arms supplied within the NATO  framework must not be used in internal conflicts. [passage  omitted]</p>

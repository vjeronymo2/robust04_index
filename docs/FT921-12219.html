			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / UN envoy talks peace to Serbs in Croatia UNITED NATIONS special envoy Marrack Goulding met Serb leaders from Croatia yesterday in an attempt to persuade them to accept a UN peace plan which provides for the withdrawal of the federal army from Croatia after the deployment of a 10,000-strong multinational peacekeeping force. Serb leaders in Croatia oppose the plan because they say it fails to offer guarantees for Croatia's 600,000 Serbs. However, Mr Goulding, who is responsible for peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia, said he was 'encouraged' after meeting Mr Goran Hadzic, a leader from the self-proclaimed Serbian region in eastern Slavonia. 'It is possible to say that a step forward has been made. . . We all have to do everything we can to convince the leaders of Krajina (the self-proclaimed Serbian republic in south Croatia) that it is a. . . plan which offers the possibility of establishing peace in Yugoslavia,' he said. Mr Goulding later met Mr Milan Babic, Krajina's president, who is a staunch opponent of the UN peace plan, which also envisages creation of UN-protected areas in Serb-populated regions, as well as the disarming of Serb and Croat irregulars. Mr Babic reaffirmed his opposition to the plan after meeting the envoy. 'The basic objection is it treats Krajina as a part of Croatia which will be placed under UN protection,' he said. 'This is naturally unacceptable from our side.' Serb insurgents, backed by the federal army, currently control a third of Croatia. President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia says he supports the UN plan but he appears to lack control over Serb leaders from Croatia. And in a sign of another shift in Serbian policy, Mr Ratko Markovic, a legal adviser to the republic's government, called for Serbia to 'reactivate' its independent status. Politika, a Belgrade daily and mouthpiece for the Serbian government, quoted Mr Markovic as saying: 'Serbia must elaborate its concept of an independent state and reaffirm its recognition which exists since 1878.' Mr Milosevic has insisted previously that Yugoslavia still exists despite the recognition of Croatia and Slovenia. Serbia did not apply for independent status or seek recognition. Mr Goulding is due to hold talks in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, where the truce continues generally to hold.</p>

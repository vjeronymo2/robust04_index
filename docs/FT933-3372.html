			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Nordic groups plan cement merger THREE Nordic groups plan to merge their cement activities to create a new regional force in the building materials sector in the face of the collapse in construction activity. Sweden's Euroc is buying Partek Cement and Lohja from the Finnish companies Partek and Metra. In return the two Finnish groups will receive 11.8m new shares in Euroc worth SKr1.2bn (Dollars 153m). This gives them a 25 per cent holding in Euroc, equal to the stake held by Skanska, Sweden's leading construction and property group. Mr Finn Johnsson, Euroc president said: 'Each one of our companies is too small to create the resources needed for necessary investments in plants, new technology, research, environmental measures and product development. Taken together we have overcapacity of around 50 per cent, against 25 to 30 per cent in the rest of Europe.' He said that there would be substantial rationalisation as a result of the merger, including the possible closure of a cement plant in Sweden and another in Finland. Mr Johnsson said the target was to cut costs by SKr200m a year from 1996.</p>

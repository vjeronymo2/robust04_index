			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Books: Suffer the little children CHILDREN FIRST by Penelope Leach Michael Joseph Pounds 14.99, 302 pages We have got it all wrong when it comes to our children. We treat them as hobbies. We refuse to listen to their views. We closet them in faceless daycare centres while we go out in pursuit of more money. We buy them Reeboks and Nintendos but will not give them the guidance and stability they need. We look down on anyone who gives up a job to be a full time parent. Penelope Leach's portrait of children in western societies makes uncomfortable reading. This leading childcare expert has decided that children are an under-privileged minority, and has written a tract to galvanise governments, schools, parents and adults in general into putting children first. Until now Leach's main audience has been the parent. More than three million own a copy of Baby and Child and know off by heart the importance of demand feeding, of never letting baby cry and of avoiding conflict with toddlers. The author now argues that this is not enough. Society is failing our children. According to Leach, things start going wrong the minute a child is born. Too often the baby is not allowed to 'bond' with its mother after birth, probably will not be breastfed for long, and soon may find itself rudely shoved into day care. This will be followed by a race for early development, in which the child is forced through the hoops by ambitious parents who will not allow them to develop in their own time. They are then disciplined by adults who mistakenly believe punishment is more effective than example. When children reach school, they are abandoned to overburdened teachers, computer games and classroom bullying, with parents playing a negligible role in turning them into moral social animals. If this picture is accurate - and Leach asserts rather than proves that it is - it is clearly something that we should be worried about. Yet her message is undermined by the humourless tone in which it is delivered. Children First is going to make some people very cross. Leach never says mothers should not work, yet the subtext is quite clear: parents should spend more time with their children. This is a daring thing to say to a generation of successful working mothers who have fought for the right to a career. Yet Leach is not just talking about those women, but about all parents, many of whom are having a wretched time trying to bring up their families in a society that gives them maximum responsiblity and minimum assistance. So what can be done? Leach argues for mass subsidies to end the growing horror of child poverty. She argues for safeguarding children's rights, for much longer paid maternity leave, for time off to tend sick children, and for shorter and more flexible working hours. She also wants staying at home to be made nicer. Families could live in communes with relations or friends with children of similar ages. Instead of commuting, parents could do more work at home, by telecommuting, and groups of parents doing this together could share the care of the children, and all local areas would have a child centre. Most of these ideas are admirable. Yet they are going to cost a great deal of money. Leach denies these are remedies we cannot afford - she says they are ones we cannot afford to ignore. She makes some attempt to prove that money spent on children today is money saved later. But mostly she expects you to take it on trust. Her liberal neighbours in Hampstead might be inclined to agree. But would Michael Howard?</p>

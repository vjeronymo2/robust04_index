			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Spanish interest rates raised THE BANK of Spain yesterday raised its benchmark intervention rate from 12.4 per cent to 13 per cent in an effort to dilute, in advance, the inflationary effects of a series of direct and indirect tax increases announced by the government on Tuesday, writes Peter Bruce in Madrid. Spain's biggest bank, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, immediately followed by raising its prime lending rate from 13 per cent to 13.5 per cent and most other banks are likely to follow. The government's emergency fiscal package, designed to stem unexpectedly sharp increases in its deficits this year, included a VAT increase from next month of 2 percentage points to 15 per cent. That will force year-end inflation to at least 6.5 per cent, well wide of the 5.5 per cent target. Yesterday's interest rate rise places official rates higher than they have been since May 1991.</p>

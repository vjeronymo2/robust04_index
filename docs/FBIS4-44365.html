			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Andrew Marr: "Major and the Two-Headed Beast"] </F>   [Text] Excellent Politics, Prime Minister: shame about  the strategy. Having reminded the country of the British veto,  John Major picked the perfect occasion to use it. From his  reception in the Commons, you would have thought he had ordered  Navy gunboats into action against some hated despot rather than  blocked a Belgian's bureaucratic ambitions in a stuffy hotel.  There was a perception among Tory MPs that the Corfu  confrontation was, somehow, a decisive moment. The trouble is,  they may be right.    At the core of Britain's hostility to the Dehaene candidacy  was not the man but his delivery system, the private and  powerful Franco-German machine. It was the "stitch-up" during  the Mulhouse summit between President Mitterrand and Chancellor  Kohl earlier this month that really irked Mr Major. When he  complained yesterday that the procedures before the Corfu summit  were not satisfactory, he was referring to what Sir Teddy Taylor  called "the blitzkrieg of the French and Germans."    There is a history to this that makes it rather more than  one-off disgruntlement about inadequate consultation. For  London in recent years, the problem with the European Union [EU]  has not been supranationality but nationality -- the parallel  national agendas of France and Germany. Throughout the post-war  period the relationship between Paris and Bonn has determined  the timing and nature of the project of European union.    Their bureaucracies, central bankers and political elites  have become ever more closely interlinked. Jacques Delors  derived his job and his power from his understanding of the need  to work closely with Helmut Kohl. Monetary union will depend on  Franco-Germania. So too will the nature of a new European  defence structure. Since the Mulhouse summit, there have been  complaints from different Whitehall departments about  Franco-German positions, well thought- out and co-ordinated,  being thumped down on the others' desks.    Nothing new there: for years, British European policy has  been aimed at trying to break into this axis (being "at the  heart of Europe") or, failing that, to neutralise it. The  nightmare remains a stronger core controlled by Franco-Germania,  from which Britain is excluded and which controls trade and  European policy along lines inimical to our national interests.    Corfu may have merely strengthened the axis. Mr Major spoke  optimistically of the need for "urgent bilateral contacts" to  find a commonly agreed new Commission president, but it is hard  to imagine the first calls being made to London. The Foreign  Office takes comfort that the German presidency of the EU now  makes it necessary for Mr Kohl to deal rather than to sulk. But  in the longer term, there is a more serious problem about the  direction of British policy.    For up to now, these national rivalries, including the issue  of the Franco-German axis, have been held within the EU  institutions. The Union appears as the virtual reality  battlefield across which old balance-of-power rivalries are  enacted. We tilt to the Italians, the Belgians cosy up to the  Germans, et cetera. Everyone talks about the EU as  "supranational," yet when you hear the nations talk about their  deal-making, it can sound more reminiscent of the diplomatic and  political tribalism of earlier generations.    But in the Thatcherite alternative to federalism, which is a  web of inter-governmental deals, the window dressing of "Europe"  and its institutions would be stripped away. The shifting  alliances between individual nations, including the power of  Franco-Germania, would be more blatant, unmediated by  commissioners and institutions. That is the logic of the  European strategy Margaret Thatcher and now John Major have  pursued. Are we sure that a return to naked balance-of-power  diplomacy would be an unequivocal sign of European progress?  After all, the dream of European political union, being happily  buried by the British Conservatives yesterday, had down-to-earth  origins.    As party leader and thus as Prime Minister, Mr Major has  been  greatly strengthened by the last few days. Even ardent Tory  Europhiles held no brief for Jean-Luc Dehaene and had no  appetite for attacking the Prime Minister The crassness of the  French and German bullying has drawn the sting of the criticism  he might otherwise have faced for using his veto. The prospect  of a Tory armisticg on Europe no longer looks absurd.    In the world of low politics, this is quite a triumph. Yet  under the cheers and the genuine expressions of hope that Mr  Major has finally hit a run of luck, thinking Conservatives  ought to be worried. Their leader has steadily been remaking  himself as a Eurosceptic, blunderingly over the qualified  majority voting issue, rhetorically during the European election  campaign and now confidently against the Franco-German candidate.    Nor is he necessarily wrong, in personal terms. His party is  a jungle and the anti-Brussels nationalists have proved to be  the most ruthless beasts therein. The Europhiles have slithered  about in the undergrowth, wringing their paws and muttering dark  warnings in the twilight. But they have not learnt from the  carnivorous right: to influence their leader, they must snarl.  First law of the jungle: intimidation works.    Now backbenchers who have spent the past two years snarling  at Mr Major are dripping with insincere but honeyed compliments.  Having endured attacks from people like Lords Tebbit and  Parkinson, the man in No 10 must now endure their affection.  Well, he has earned it. What next? Tea in the Downing Street  rose garden with Lord Rees-Mogg?    I can see no going back for him now. The Tory right is  already setting new hurdles, listing other candidates he must  block, turning its attention to the need for a regular British  veto on policy as well as personality. And the Eurosceptics'  perception that they are now in effective control of the Prime  Minister matches exactly the view of him from Paris and Bonn.  His protestations of Euro-enthusiasm will be heard in leaden  silence and, urged on by his new admirers, he will slip,  willingly enough, further down the slope.    Which leads to where? On the optimistic Tory reading, it  leads to a happy Europe of strong nation states co-operating one  with another. But events of the past few days remind us how  powerful are the national rivalries and how potent the mutual  suspicions -- even now, even within the European project. It  has taken years of leadership and vision to erode those  suspicions, just a little. The trouble with the vetoing of Mr  Dehaene is that it was part of a pattern. I wish I could be  sure that Mr Major is as aware of how much there is for Europe  to lose from an era of nationalism as he is of how much he  personally can gain as a hero of the Tory right.</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Steel chief outlines crisis plan: Rapid decision on rescue package sought from EC ministers GERMANY'S steel industry, which prides itself as being the most independent and efficient in the EC, is calling for tough new curbs on state subsidies in other member states, but also for more money from Brussels to ease the pain of mass redundancies. It wants a 'market solution' to the crisis in the industry, but one protected against unfair competition from eastern Europe by volume restrictions on cheap imports. Minimum prices would not be effective, it says. It also wants a rapid decision by industry ministers this week on the outline of a rescue package, in order to underpin higher prices in the market. Precise details of capacity cuts would be worked out by the industry itself by September, and then two years would be needed to put them into effect. Details of the German industry's preconditions for a Brussels rescue package were spelt out by Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the German steel industry federation, in a weekend interview. He warned that the European steel sector as a whole would have to shed more than 100,000 jobs, of which 35,000-40,000 would be in Germany. He agreed with the European Commission that cuts in capacity were needed of between 25m-30m tonnes. Mr Vondran suggested that efficient producers should in effect buy out market share from inefficient producers, forcing inefficient plants out of production. Subsidies should only be paid in proportion to their reduction in capacity, and Italy and Spain must be targeted as the least efficient, most heavily subsidised producers. He set out six 'criteria' for an agreement, presented last week to Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, who will attend the ministerial council in Brussels on Thursday at which the package will be presented. 'We must find a solution which is as close as possible to a market solution,' he said. 'It means the most efficient producers must remain, and the least efficient must close.' The mistake of EC steel policies since the last steel crisis of 1980 was to allow borderline producers to remain in operation. Mr Vondran singled out Ilva, the Italian steel producer, as 'a totally over-indebted enterprise which is adding new losses month by month. Nobody knows what its debt position is, but we believe it is somewhere between DM11bn and DM14bn (Pounds 4.6bn-Pounds 5.9bn). There is no suggestion of bankruptcy: they simply go on producing.' The steel federation's six-point plan would require: A transparent legal framework for production and delivery quotas, decided by the industry within guidelines set by Brussels. 'There must be no cartels fixed up behind closed doors,' Mr Vondran said. Protection against cheap imports from eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, focused on the most sensitive areas - long products rather than flat products - and limited by quantity, not price. The federation proposes a limit set at 1991 import levels, plus 20 per cent. 'Minimum prices don't work. You simply get payments made secretly into Swiss bank accounts,' he said. Clear restriction on subsidies, as set out in Article 4c of the European Coal and Steel Community treaty, with exceptions limited to those enterprises cutting their capacity enough to have a real effect on the market. More generous social payments to ease the redundancies, estimated at more than 100,000 direct job losses in the entire EC industry, and not 50,000 as calculated by the European Commission. The Brussels offer of Ecu450m (Pounds 371.7m) between 1993 and 1995 is based on the lower job loss figure. Adequate time to carry out the structural changes, with two to three years estimated from agreement on capacity cuts in September. Political agreement on the key points in the package on February 25, with the remaining details worked out at official level by the end of March.</p>

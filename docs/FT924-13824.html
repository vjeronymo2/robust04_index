			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / International Company News: Mitsubishi, Daimler stress co-operation MITSUBISHI of Japan and Daimler-Benz, the German industrial group, yesterday reconfirmed their growing co-operation, after talks at the weekend in Japan between their executives. Mr Takeshi Eguchi, vice-president of Mitsubishi Corp, the trading company that is the nucleus of the group, said the mutual understanding between the two groups had been strengthened. Mr Eguchi added that of the several projects being studied, an important agreement between the two companies may be concluded by the end of this year. The weekend meeting is the fourth since the highly publicised decision in 1990 between Daimler-Benz and four companies in the Mitsubishi group to seek a broad strategic alliance. However, in contrast to the initial excitement over the tie-up, Mitsubishi underplayed the importance of the alliance. So far, the groups have failed to come up with any significant deals. Mitsubishi Motors and Mercedes-Benz are discussing deal under which Mitsubishi will supply the German vehicle group with diesel engines for light trucks. An earlier agreement under which Mitsubishi dealers in Japan sell Mercedes-Benz cars, has run into difficulties as the German company wants to develop an independent dealer network.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- Saudi Arabia on Monday [23  May] urged Japan to make efforts to break a deadlock in a joint  project to refine Saudi crude oil in this country, a Japanese  Trade Ministry official said.    Saudi Arabia made the request when its Petroleum and Mineral  Resources Minister Hisham Muhyi-al-Din Nazir met with Japanese  International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata in Tokyo,  the official told a press conference.    The joint project calls for building or acquiring three  refineries in Japan to refine 450,000 barrels of Saudi Crude oil  per day for sale in the Japanese market. The project has been  on hold since last November, however, due to a policy rift  between Nippon Oil Co. and Japan Energy Corp., both major  Japanese partners in the scheme.    During the half-hour meeting with Hata, Nazir voiced hope  that Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)  will play a role of "catalyzer" in resuming the project,  according to the MITI official.    If crude oil exporters like Saudi Arabia can ensure "secured  markets" for their crude supplies, it would benefit Japan as  well as the exporters by helping prevent rapid fluctuations in  crude prices, Nazir said.    Saudi Arabia is prepared to continue talks on the scheme,  Nazir was quoted as saying.    Hata replied the stalled project is basically a matter for  the private sector but his ministry will do its utmost by  upgrading related business conditions for an early resumption of  the scheme, the MITI official said.    The Japanese trade minister asked Saudi Arabia to make a  decision on extending oil-exploring concessions currently given  to Japan's Arabian Oil Co. beyond the scheduled expiration in  2000, although Nazir did not make a specific commitment, the  MITI official said.    Arabian Oil has been operating in Saudi Arabia for 30 years  as a core oil supplier for Japan, Hata noted.    On a Japanese request for Saudi Arabia to ensure a stable  crude oil supply to Japan, Nazir said, "that is no problem."    "Saudi will continue to be a constant crude supplier for  Japan," Nazir said.    Nazir arrived in Tokyo Saturday for a seven-day visit to  Japan.    On Tuesday, he is scheduled to meet with Japanese Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata and Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa.    During his meeting with the prime minister, Nazir will hand  over to him a personal message from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia,  which is believed to contain the Saudi Arabian request on the  joint refinery project.</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Clinton in firing line over future of nuclear testing: A moratorium expiry OPPONENTS of nuclear testing are preparing for a last-minute battle to win over President Bill Clinton as he nears a decision on whether to resume test explosions when a nine-month moratorium expires on July 1. Senior US officials, backed by the UK government, have made a preliminary recommendation for a resumption of testing but President Clinton is under strong pressure from leading members of Congress - both Republicans and Democrats - to extend the moratorium. Under the terms of a law passed by Congress last year, against the opposition of then President George Bush, the US may make up to 15 underground tests to improve the safety and reliability of nuclear weapons over the next three years. Nuclear tests would be completely banned thereafter, unless another country conducts its own tests. The administration has abandoned any thought of challenging the full ban from 1996 onwards, but the decision on whether to resume testing over the next three years appears to be more finely balanced. While the US Department of Energy's nuclear weapons laboratories enthusiastically favour a resumption of tests - and the arms control and disarmament agency, an autonomous agency within the US government, argues keenly against - the Pentagon and the State Department are less forthright. The disagreements have already delayed any possible tests until much later this year, because the legislation requires the president to give Congress 90 days' notice of his plans. On the sidelines of the debate are the UK, which uses the US test site in Nevada and is therefore in effect bound by Mr Clinton's decision, and France, which started what has become almost a general moratorium by the nuclear powers but is eager to resume tests at Mururoa, in the South Pacific, to complete the modernisation of its nuclear arsenal. Russia, which has not exploded a nuclear bomb since October 1990, is also watching; it would like to continue the moratorium but says it will align itself on the policy adopted by the other nuclear powers - although it no longer has access to the test site in Kazakhstan. China has not signed the moratorium; it detonated a nuclear bomb estimated at one megaton last May, and is reported to be preparing another 150-kiloton test. The Senate coalition against the resumption of testing is particularly muscular, being led by Senator George Mitchell, the Democratic majority leader, Senator James Exon, a senior Democrat from Nebraska, and Senator Mark Hatfield, top Republican on the crucial spending committee. Test opponents have been encouraged by some of Mr Clinton's remarks to them in recent weeks, and are pressing for a full meeting to discuss the issue. Those who advocate more tests say more work is needed on missile safety, particularly for the Trident II D-5 submarine-launched missile, which a commission headed by Professor Sidney Drell of Stanford University said posed a threat because its plutonium warhead core is surrounded by vulnerable high-explosive and propellant. Test opponents say that to stop now could save perhaps Dollars 30m to Dollars 60m per test, and help Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who can ill-afford the cost, to fend off the demands of his own military-industrial establishment to resume testing. What is most important, they argue, is that a resumption of nuclear testing by the big powers would undercut efforts to win support for renewal of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is to expire in 1995, and could only encourage countries such as North Korea and Iran to move ahead in their attempts to acquire nuclear weapons technology. 'If we are testing when the NPT review conference meets, even if we are negotiating a comprehensive test ban, there would be a perception of cynicism by the superpowers,' says Mr Jack Mendelsohn of the Arms Control Association, a Washington-based disarmament think tank. If Mr Clinton does decide to go ahead with further tests, arms control advocates are urging, as a fallback position, that testing should at least be halted before the NPT review in 1995.</p>

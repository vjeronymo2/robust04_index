The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change consists of two enhancements to DTC's Repo Tracking System (``RTS''). The first enhancement enables a participant of DTC to instruct DTC to eliminate that participant's obligation to DTC for a specific payment date on a CUSIP and to eliminate the corresponding entitlement of the participant's counterparty on that payment date. The second enhancement replaces the single ``catchall'' Repo position for each participant with a series of Repo position memo accounts, one for each counterparty of that participant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, DTC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. DTC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this proposed rule change is to provide a repo buyer an instruction to inform DTC to inhibit the buyer's debit for a specific income payment on a CUSIP and to inhibit the corresponding income payment to the counterparty. DTC's current RTS procedures include a Repo Deliver Order instruction (``DO'' with Reason Code 81), a Repo Reclaim instruction (also Reason Code 81), and a Repo Adjustment instruction. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  The first two instructions effect book-entry transfer of securities and also instruct DTC to adjust certain accounts, called ``Repo positions,'' of participants. The third instruction, which can be issued only by a participant that is forfeiting the right to receive future distributions, instructs DTC to adjust Repo positions without effecting book-entry transfers of securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a detailed description of the Repo Deliver Order instruction, Repo Reclaim instruction, and Repo Adjustment instruction, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28579, 55 FR 45896 [File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;90&hyph;10] (order approving rule changes relating to procedures and processing repurchase transactions). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DTC's existing procedures provide for the participant obligated for future distributions ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the repo buyer) to instruct DTC to negate that obligation. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  DTC will eliminate the participant's obligation on future distributions and the counterparty's ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the repo seller) entitlement to the future distributions upon receipt of a letter of instruction in a prescribed form from the obligated participant. The proposed rule change provides that DTC will eliminate the participant's obligation on a specific distribution and the counterparty's corresponding entitlement to the specific distribution upon receipt of a letter of instruction in a prescribed form from the obligated participant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a description of DTC's procedures, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 3135 (November 30, 1992) 57 FR 57519 [File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;92&hyph;18] (order approving rule changes relating to DTC's enhancement to its Repo Tracking System). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DTC will accept the instructions from two days before the distribution payment date until 11:30 a.m. (Eastern) on the distribution payment date. DTC will require the instructing participant to notify the counterparty participant, and the non-participant counterparty where applicable, of the instructions to DTC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After DTC receives an instruction, on distribution payment date it will process a cash adjustment offsetting the RTS entry through the cash adjustment (``CADJ'') function on participants terminal system (``PTS''). The repo seller will receive an unsolicited message describing the offsetting adjustment over the PTS network. This information also will be accessible through the CADJ inquiry capability. The repo buyer's daily settlement statement on payment date will show a debit automatically effected by RTS and a credit of equal amount effected by CADJ, and the repo seller's daily settlement statement on payment date will show an RTS credit offset by a CADJ debit. The CADJ adjustment will be final and will not be reversed if the repo seller fails to settle with DTC that day. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> DTC's Rule 9, including the amendments made to Rule 9 by SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;90&hyph;10, authorizes this procedure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When DTC receives instructions to eliminate the obligated participant's obligation with respect to a specific distribution, DTC will implement the instructing participant's instructions without making any determination about the parties' legal obligations to each other. The parties to the repo transaction will then be responsible for settling that particular distribution payment outside of RTS. DTC will not be responsible for processing any further entries on the payment. The repo buyer's instructions will apply only to that particular distribution, and subsequent distributions will be tracked in RTS as usual. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, RTS has a single catchall repo position in which all of a participant's obligations and entitlements are aggregated. The proposed rule change will establish a separate repo position memo account for each participant with each of its counterparties. The purpose of the proposed rule change is to give participants easier access to information about their RTS obligation and entitlements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

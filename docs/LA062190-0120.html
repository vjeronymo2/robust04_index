			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> LONGTIME HOOVER COACH KOHLMEIER SET TO RETIRE  </P> <P> Dorence "Dee" Kohlmeier, golf coach and athletic director at Hoover High, will  retire Friday after 36 years with the school.  </P> <P> Kohlmeier, 70, taught for five years in Indiana before coming to Hoover in  1953. He coached basketball for five years -- guiding his team to the  semifinals of the Southern Section large-school division tournament in 1957 --  before assuming the role of athletic director.  </P> <P> Kohlmeier, who has taught physiology, life science, health and safety, and  physical education, started the Hoover golf program in 1959. He coached the  team for 10 years, took a five-year break, and returned for the past 16  seasons, guiding the Tornadoes to the last two Pacific League championships.  </P> <P> "I figured after 41 years, that was enough," Kohlmeier said. "I started  thinking about it at the beginning of the year.  </P> <P> "In the middle of the year, I started having trouble with my shoulder. Little  things told me, 'Hey, it's time to start letting some younger people take it  over.' "  </P> <P> Dennis Henderson will replace Kohlmeier as golf coach. Randy Tiffany will  become the boys' athletic director and Judy Thomsen will be the girls' athletic  director.  </P> <P> Kohlmeier said he has many fond memories.  </P> <P> "To watch the (Southern Section) teams, the Joe Hillmans, the team that made it  to the Final Four in 1957 -- seeing those kids come through and seeing them  later is always a joy," Kohlmeier said. "Those are the memories you really  appreciate. Just watching kids grow up."  </P> <P> A golf tournament honoring Kohlmeier will be held June 28 at the Verdugo Hills  Golf Course.  </P> <P> New coach: Jim Delzell will become interim coach of the Hoover baseball  program, replacing Bob Cooper, who is taking a one-year sabbatical after 15  seasons.  </P> <P> Delzell, 31, coached the Hoover junior varsity last season.  </P> <P> "I'm getting a shot, so we'll see what happens," said Delzell, who inherits a  team that was 6-9 in the Pacific League. "We've got our top two pitchers back  and a lot of good kids from our sophomore team."  </P> <P> Signed, sealed, delivered: Former Crescenta Valley baseball player Mike  Muhlethaler has signed a contract with the Oakland Athletics and is playing for  the organization's Medford, Ore., affiliate in the Northwest League, a Class-A  short-season league.  </P> <P> Muhlethaler, who plays infield and outfield, was selected by Oakland in the  34th round of the amateur draft. This season, he struggled with various  injuries and batted .317 with seven home runs and 30 runs batted in 39 games.  </P> <P> Fast finish: Tom Kendall of La Canada finished fourth last Saturday in the  Motor City 100 SCCA Trans-Am race at the Valvoline Detroit Grand Prix.  </P> <P> Kendall, driving a Chevrolet Beretta, started on the pole after setting a  course record Friday on the 2.5-mile temporary street circuit, qualifying at  77.603 m.p.h. He topped the time of 1 minute 57.029 seconds, set in 1989 by  series champion Dorsey Schroeder, by 1.055 seconds.  </P> <P> Raising a racquet: Bruce Man-Son-Hing of Glendale will compete in the finals of  the Southern California Public Parks tennis tournament. Man-Son-Hing advanced  last weekend by defeating Donny Issak of Los Angeles, 6-3, 6-0, in the  semifinals.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News Commentary by Harihar Swarup] </F>   [Text] A major achievement of Mr. Strobe Talbott's visit to  New Delhi was clearing the misunderstanding between India and  America. The misunderstanding could be attributed to lopsided  perception of India's policies in Washington. President Bill  Clinton had deputed Mr. Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of  state in the U.S. Administration, to visit New Delhi and remove  the misunderstanding. Mr. Talbott stated in New Delhi: My  government attaches considerable significance to my visit.  President Clinton and Secretary of State Christopher had asked  me to come to India in order to consult Prime Minister Rao and  other officials of the Indian Government on confidence [words  indistinct] in which we can put together new impetus and new  scope to U.S.-India relations.    It became clear at the end of Mr. Talbott's two-day visit  that there was no American tilt toward any country and India and  the United States was poised to turn a new leaf in bilateral  relations. The sharp reaction evoked in India on Assistant  Secretary of State Ms. Robin Raphel's controversial statement on  Kashmir was more than clarified when Mr. Talbott categorically  stated that it was for India and Pakistan to resolve the problem  themselves in accordance with the Simla Agreement. India's  concern on delivery of more F-16 aircraft was conveyed to Mr.  Talbott in clear terms. The supply will be also against the goal  of U.S. Government's declared policy to help in reducing tension  in South Asia and discourage arms races between India and  Pakistan. Mr. Talbott acknowledged at the conclusion of his  visit that the greatest threat to India's security was from  Pakistan's nuclear program. Then, when the United States is  trying to make one-time exception to the Pressler Amendment on  the ground that is further U.S. nonproliferation goals in South  Asia. [sentence as heard]    Pakistan has developed nuclear weapon capability  clandestinely. This is in clear violation of bilateral  understanding with Washington. Earlier, the U.S. had given 40  F-16 aircraft to Pakistan as a reward for their assurance that  they would not go nuclear. Now, it seems the U.S. would like to  reward Islamabad with another 38 planes for having gone nuclear.  Until recently, the U.S. was stating categorically that even if  the Pressler Amendment was deleted, Pressler standards will  continue to apply. This position was rather given up suddenly  and now one-time lifting of the Pressler Amendment is being  advocated. This will leave Pakistan's nuclear arsenal developed  secretly intact. No longer can a case be made that these  aircraft are required by Pakistan to combat communism, or the  Soviet Union, or the threat to Pakistan's security from Soviet  invasion of Afghanistan. The sole target of U.S. supplied  F-16's today can be in India. Mr. Talbott, said to be close to  President Clinton, was also told that as part of the dialogue  opened at India's initiative, Pakistan was urged to undertake  various confidence-building measures both in conventional and  nuclear fields. Both the countries have an agreement not to  attack each other's nuclear installations. India has now  offered Pakistan an agreement not to bomb each other's  population centers and economic targets as well as an agreement  not to use nuclear capabilities against each other. Pakistan is  still reluctant to pursue seriously this dialogue. This  attitude will undoubtedly get a boost by any U.S. decision to  strengthen Pakistan's military capability against India.    Mr. Talbott appreciated India's economic reforms. The U.S.  has now become the largest single investor in India. President  Bill Clinton is also under pressure from powerful business lobby  to ensure that the big Indian market is not jeopardized because  of the political considerations. This is one reason for U.S.  keenness to improve relations with India. The main irritant in  Indo-U.S. relations is the issue of supply of additional F-16  planes to Pakistan. The prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao,  has said that acquisition of F-16 fighter aircraft by Pakistan  would disturb the security environment and escalate tension  which would lead to an arms race in the region. It appears  almost certain that the prime minister will visit U.S. some time  next month in response to Bill Clinton's personal invitation to  him. The only hitch could be supply of F-16 planes to Pakistan.</p>

			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Letter: Part time solution for women Sir, I fear Valerie Amos (Letters, January 21) has too negative a view of part-time employment in the UK. While child care undoubtedly is a crucial factor influencing the decision of women to resume work part-time, there is evidence that demand for part-time work exceeds supply. Even with good child care facilities, many women find it difficult to combine work demands with family commitments. Part-time work offers a solution to this dilemma. Both the IRS report, Recruiting and Retaining Women, and Susan McRae's study for the Policy Studies Institute, Maternity Rights in Britain, point to a demand by working mothers for more flexible working arrangements, particularly part-time and job-share opportunities. Some large retail companies are now offering part-time work at managerial level to meet the demand of their female employees returning to work after maternity leave. To imply that part-time is invariably low-paid and an alternative to a career will do nothing to increase part-time opportunities for those women, particularly in managerial and professional jobs, for whom it offers the only means of continuing their careers.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, May 18 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher arrived here tonight on a brief visit to  Egypt.    Upon his arrival, he told reporters that he had held good  and  constructive talks with Syrian and Israeli officials.    He said that during the talks he discussed with them several  proposals for making headway on the Syrian-Israeli track of the  Middle East peace negotiations.    He voiced optimism despite some difficult points which have  to be discussed further between the two parties. He explained  that the two sides have divergent views as well as convergent  ones, saying, "we will continue talks for making progress on all  tracks for a settlement."    Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa of Egypt, who was on hand to  welcome his U.S. counterpart, said that Egyptian President Husni  Mubarak will later tonight meet Christopher on the outcome of  his shuttle between Syria and Israel.    The U.S. official has been touring the Middle East region in  the past two days, bringing into sharper focus the need to  bridge the difference of the viewpoints between Syria and Israel  in a bid to get the peace drive off the ground again, and making  new offers to both countries.    During Christopher's last trip to the region for peace  between Syria and Israel, Israel offered Syria a withdrawal plan  to be completed within eight years without committing to a full  withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights.    However, Syria has insisted on a full Israeli withdrawal to  be completed within a period of three years.    Israel has been criticizing Syria for not clearly expounding  the concept of peace it demands.</p>

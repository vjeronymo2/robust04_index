			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Head of the interim Anti-Corruption Commission of  the Belarusian Parliament Aleksandr Lukashenko has accused Prime  Minister Vyacheslav Kebich of helping himself to government  funds to finance his own campaign for the presidency.    In an interview with INTERFAX in Minsk, Lukashenko said his  commission had evidence that the prime minister was trying to  "syphon off part of government resources to commercial banks."    The official also maintains that Kebich started his  unofficial election campaign six weeks ago by suspending local  subsidies and agreeing after private meetings to provide them  with regional administrators in exchange for a promise to back  his candidacy.    Lukashenko also said that the Prime Minister had already set  up his own election office on the basis of existing government  structures.</p>

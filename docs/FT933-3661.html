			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Peps-type tax allowances urged for gilts investors PRIVATE INVESTORS in gilt-edged stocks and corporate bonds should receive similar tax allowances to investors in equities, a Budget submission by the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds urges. The association proposes the establishment of 'personal gilt plans' involving a Pounds 3,000 personal equity plan-type allowance for gilts and corporate bonds. Tax relief for investment in gilts and corporate bonds would assist the government in funding the public sector borrowing requirement and would encourage investors in Britain to build up a well-balanced investment portfolio, the association says. It estimates that the unit trust industry could sell up to Pounds 1bn of gilts and bonds through personal gilt plans. In the past tax year nearly Pounds 2bn was invested in unit trust Peps. It recommends that the PGP tax treatment should be extended to corporate bonds, as it would help ensure that finance was available for British industry over the next few years of a recovery. The association's Budget submission also says that gilt funds should be removed altogether from the net covering capital gains tax. It points out that investors in gilt unit trusts pay capital gains tax on disposal of units, unlike those who invest directly in gilts. The association also makes a case for the removal of stamp duty where it impedes the development of the unit trust market. It says this would improve the efficiency of the industry by reducing costs to the investor without reducing tax revenue. The association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds represents 120 unit trust management companies.</p>

The Tokyo Workshop on Cooperation for the Conservation of  Biological Diversity in Asia brought together about 70 people,  representing the World Bank, the United Nations Environment  Program, the governments of Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia and the  Philippines, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).    In a closing statement to the gathering, the workshop  president, Taishichiro Sato of the Japan Wildlife Research  Center, said the participants had decided to promote the  development of knowledge and specialized technology for the  preservation of biodiversity in Asia.    Sato said they also expressed a desire to encourage more  local bodies to participate in biodiversity conservation and to  encourage more efficient data collection and sharing so that  development decisions can be made without compromising the  region's biodiversity.    The gathering was organized by the Environment Agency of  Japan and the Japan Wildlife Research Center.    Colin Rees, head of the Land, Water and Natural Habitats  Department within the World Bank, said the technology to ensure  biodiversity is maintained is still inadequate.    Rees called on Japan to foster more people able to preserve  biodiversity in its other agencies and ministries and not just  within the Environment Agency.    Representatives from the Foreign Ministry, Japan  International Cooperation Agency and the Japan branch of the  World-Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) also attended the meeting.</p>

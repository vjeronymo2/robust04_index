			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets: Sterling and dollar strength to be tested The return of foreign exchange trading to normal this week after the Christmas and new year market closures will put the new-found strength of the dollar and sterling to the test, write Peter Norman and Alan Pike. Sterling ended last year close to its year's high when measured on the Bank of England's trade weighted index and is expected to be well supported so long as economic recovery is sustained. The dollar last week came close to its 1993 high against the D-Mark and was pushing against the Y112 barrier. Many dealers expect that the US currency will continue to move upwards as liquidity in the market returns to normal and investors take account of recent favourable economic indicators and growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will have to tighten monetary policy. By comparison, poor growth prospects for Germany and Japan have undermined the D-Mark and yen. The dollar's strength poses a dilemma for the German authorities. Although hopes were high in December that the Bundesbank might decide at its first council meeting of the year on Thursday to lower its 5.75 per cent discount rate, the D-Mark's recent weakness could encourage a more cautious approach. Last Friday, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, reaffirmed the importance of a stable D-Mark and said the central bank would resist pressure for 'generous' cuts in Germany's official interest rates. He underlined that Germany would have trouble attracting foreign capital to finance its deficits if the stability of the D-Mark were jeopardised. Yesterday, with the London markets shut, trading elsewhere in Europe was quiet with low volumes. The D-Mark firmed slightly, and Mr Tietmeyer revived speculation of a German interest rate cut with comments in Sunday's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. The Bundesbank president expressed the expectation that German inflation could fall below 3 per cent this year and commented: 'Our policy also includes the possibility of further interest rate cuts in the event that the expansion of money supply weakens.' In France, the decision by banks to lower base rates from tomorrow fueled speculation that official rate cuts may follow soon.</p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> In the late '60s Jim Evans was a successful graphic artist designing posters  and album covers in the psychedelic style popular then. As a boy, the younger  Richard Duardo hung out with gangs on the streets of East Los Angeles; today he  is a master printer and computer artist whose prints are in museum collections.  </P> <P> The two artists share an interest in the abstraction, vivid coloration and  high-contrast images of print, TV and graphic art. Their shared fascination for  stardom has produced a collaborative series of prints featuring the famous and  the fair, such as Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, Humphrey Bogart and Madonna.  </P> <P> On view are canvas works that look as if they've been silk-screened with famous  visages. The artists toy with and selectively alter popular images frozen in  our brain by repetition -- Madonna in profile, showing off the sinuous line of  her neck, or the famous movie still of Raquel Welch barely clothed in  Hollywood's ridiculous version of cavewoman attire. The artists revitalize  media shots with hand detail, poster art hues and bright silk-screened  squiggles, but the works are the too-obvious progeny of Warhol's famous people.  </P> <P> Most works remind us that, try as we may to ease our own anxiety by  immortalizing our stars, they'll all wither just like the rest of us. "The  Monster" (from the vintage movie "Frankenstein") and his consort, "The Bride,"  work side by side as effective social comment and parody. Repeated views of the  bare-chested weight lifter Lisa Lyon flexing her biceps as she unzips her  Calvin Kleins simply emphasize that stars and their biographers tend to confuse  narcissism with legitimate sensuality.

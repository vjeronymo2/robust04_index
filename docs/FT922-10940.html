			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Government Bonds: German rally leads European markets higher EUROPEAN government bond markets overcame fresh political uncertainty to closer higher yesterday, with a rally in German bonds leading other markets higher. German government bonds fell in the morning session following the surprise resignation of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the foreign minister. The June bund futures contract on Liffe, the London exchange, fell to 87.05 in early trading, having opened at 87.13. But the contract rose to 87.46 in late afternoon trading. Volume was an active 65,000 contracts. Traders said the price movement was exaggerated as investors moved to cover short positions taken on last week when the market fell heavily. Yesterday, the State of Baden Wuertemberg released preliminary cost of living data for the month to mid-April which showed a 0.3 per cent rise in prices on the month. At this level, inflation is running at a year-on-year rate of 4.3 per cent, from 4.8 per cent in March. Data from other states is expected this week, with preliminary data for the whole of western Germany expected by the end of the week. Analysts are anticipating an annual rate of 4.6 per cent. Mr Otmar Issing, Bundesbank board member, said that inflation was likely to decline sharply below 4 per cent by late summer. Lower inflation may allow the monetary authorities to cut interest rates and Mr Issing's statement improved sentiment. THE ITALIAN government bond market followed a similar pattern, opening lower following the resignation of Mr Francesco Cossiga, the president, on Saturday, but closing higher on the day assisted by the strength of other European markets. The benchmark 10-year fixed rate government bond closed at 98.16 from 98.095 on Friday. The June 10-year bond futures contract on Liffe closed at 98.39, up from an opening level of 98.13. The market was weaker in the morning session as the market reacted to the resignation of Mr Cossiga, which leaves Italy without a president or prime minister following inconclusive parliamentary elections earlier this month. However, traders said that the resignation could speed the process of political reform in Italy, with positive implications for bond prices in the longer term. UK GOVERNMENT bonds rallied strongly yesterday, with the strength of the pound on the foreign exchange markets and the buoyancy of German bond prices leading gilts higher. The benchmark 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011 was up  1/2 a point on the day, closing at 99 27/32 for a yield of 9.01 per cent. The June gilt futures contract on Liffe opened at 98.09 but climbed to 98.29 by late afternoon. Volume was around the average, at 23,000 contracts. Analysts said dealing in longer-dated gilts was dominated by investors and market-makers adjusting positions before Wednesday's auction of Pounds 2.5bn 8 3/4 per cent gilts maturing 2017. The very long-dated stock is likely to appeal primarily to domestic UK investors, since overseas institutions are not active buyers of bonds of more than 10-years' maturity. Hence the auction will be a crucial test of UK institutions' appetite for gilts. US government securities fell in quiet trading yesterday as the market awaited the announcement of the Treasury's quarterly refunding programme and a variety of economic data, all of which are due out later this week. In late trading the benchmark 30-year bond was down  5/8 at 100 1/16 , yielding 8.112 per cent. The two-year note was also lower, down  3/16 at 99 29/32 , yielding 5.408 per cent. Trading throughout the day was subdued, with dealers and investors reluctant to get involved before they heard details of the refunding. Analysts expect the Treasury to announce its intention to sell about Dollars 36bn of three-year, 10-year and 30-year securities. Just as important is the release of various economic figures scheduled for later this week. The first data will be today's announcement of first quarter gross domestic product and March new home sales. JAPANESE government bonds traded lower overnight in Tokyo with the market overshadowed by fears about oversupply of fixed-interest paper and concern for the broader health of the financial system. The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond issue No 129 closed on a yield of 5.665 per cent, from 5.625 per cent on Friday. Traders said that dealing was dominated by professional intermediaries, with few investors participating before public holidays which begin later this week. Trading volume on the benchmark bond was a thin Y366bn, compared with Y600-Y700bn on more active days. Interest centred on the communique issued by ministers from the G7 countries. The statement said that this year's yen weakness had not helped to right global trade imbalances. However, while international governments may favour a stronger yen, there is no sign of central bank intervention to support the currency.</p>

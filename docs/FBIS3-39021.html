			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Pascal Virot: "Paris -- New Consensus Over Armed </F> Intervention"]    [Text] After months of dithering, an agreement seems to be  emerging. With the exception of the French Communist Party  (PCF) and the National Front (FN), all parties now favor a  military intervention.    To the question "to fire or to withdraw?" asked on 6 January  1994 by French Ambassador [to Sri Lanka] Christian Lambert,  French political circles are today almost unanimous in  answering: "to fire." In other words, to put an end to the  Bosnian slaughter through a military intervention consisting of  air raids. This change of mind took sometimes a long time to  materialize both on the right and on the left. Just as was the  case for the Gulf War. Today, however, a consensus is in the  works between the main political forces.    Laurent Fabius had been the first one to call for armed  intervention against the Serbs. "Bombing Serbian military  targets is perfectly feasible," the then First Secretary of the  Socialist Party stated in 1992. Such a declaration, at a time  when France was fully committed to a humanitarian policy, had  met with outright rejection.    The humanitarian option, a policy which Jacques Chirac had  likened at the time to a "poor stopgap," was long the French  government's alpha and omega. Former Humanitarian Action  Minister Bernard Kouchner, who personified this policy, has now  largely changed his stance. While he used to profess his  powerlessness ("how do you prevent people from fighting when  they want to fight?", he asked after a trip to former  Yugoslavia), Bernard Kouchner is now asking: "What are we  waiting for?" And when Foreign Minister Alain Juppe suggests  that the Serbs should be issued an ultimatum, Bernard Kouchner  says that he can only "approve, provided this ultimatum is more  than just the latest one in a continuing series."    The Socialist Party's position has been clearly defined by  its leader, Michel Rocard, who said on Tuesday that the siege of  Sarajevo must be "urgently" lifted and that "a real cease-fire  must be imposed, by force if need be." Earlier this year,  Michel Rocard and Bernard Kouchner had signed a joint appeal for  an "imposed cease-fire." Today, Michel Rocard can only  reiterate his support to French diplomacy's current approach,  hoping that he will "be impressed by the results of Alain  Juppe's determination."    Jean-Pierre Chevenement has also changed his mind. While at  the beginning of the year he demanded that diplomats seek a  "political settlement" to the conflict, it now seems that the  president of the Citizens' Movement does not oppose an  intervention any more. "Today, we must intervene and say why,"  he said. He added that what is needed is "setting a political  goal and then using all available means, not only air power."    Leading majority persons have also changed tack. RPR [Rally  for the Republic] President and Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac  quickly let it be known that he favored a military intervention,  but warned that more delays were likely to make it more and more  problematic, or even "impossible." More recently, he took a  tougher stand: "We must withdraw and then hit them," he said  last month. At any rate, the French plan, which includes  issuing an ultimatum to the belligerents, has been well received  by the RPR, which views it as "the only possible solution" to  the conflict.    Pierre Lellouche -- Jacques Chirac's diplomatic advisor --  even advocated a broader stand from France, while acknowledging  that it would be a "risky procedure." Otherwise, he said,  France ought to "purely and simply get out" of Bosnia -- that  is, to withdraw its blue helmets. Interior Minister Charles  Pasqua concurred yesterday on France Inter [radio network]:  "The time has come for everyone to face up to their  responsibilities. Either NATO finally decides to intervene, or  I do not see what we are staying in Bosnia for. The only thing  left for us to do is to go." As for [former president of the  republic] Valery Giscard d'Estaing, he called for "an immediate  air strike against the batteries of artillery which fired on  Sarajevo's marketplace."    It was probably Cher representative Jean-Francois Deniau who  best defined the potential impact of both the conflict and the  French position. He had been the first to call for armed  intervention to counter Serb progress at the very beginning of  the war, and he was also able to explain that such an  intervention would become more problematic the longer it was  postponed. Indeed, in his opinion, the option between "to fire  or to withdraw" is nonexistent: To withdraw would mean to evade  our responsibilities, while a military option would require  changing the UN mandate. In all cases, Jean-Francois Deniau  implies that it is too late, unless "we go back to square one."  His priority would be for Europe to focus "on a few clear  objectives, even limited ones, with real means."    Last, as was the case during the Gulf War, only the  Communist  Party and the National Front remained opposed to intervention in  Bosnia. PCF National Secretary Robert Hue flatly rejected the  notion of a military solution to the conflict, which, according  to him, could only lead to a "military escalation." "What we  need to prepare is peace, not battle plans," he stated,  demanding that a real embargo on weapons be restored. The  Communists have been calling for a demonstration to take place  today in order to "put an end to the war." As for [NF leader]  Jean-Marie Le Pen, he said he opposed any presence of French  soldiers in the former Yugoslavia, where, he said, the  government had got involved "out of vainglory."</p>

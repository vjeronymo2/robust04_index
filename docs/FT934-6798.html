			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Lonrho restates profits to meet new rules Lonrho, the trading conglomerate, has revised upwards its 1992 pre-tax profits by Pounds 34m to Pounds 114m because of changes in UK accountancy rules. The group said its results to September 30, to be announced in January, would encompass the changes and it was restating its 1992 figures on the same basis. The changes involve the new FRS3 reporting standard and the Urgent Issues Task Force report on accounting for operations in hyper-inflationary economies. Under FRS3, companies must distinguish between continuing and discontinued operations. The restated figures show that the group's operating profit of Pounds 159m in 1992 comprised a profit of Pounds 116m from continuing operations and Pounds 43m from discontinued operations. The pre-tax profit from continuing operations was Pounds 39m and Pounds 75m from discontinued operations. The net profit from discontinued operations, after tax and minority interests, was Pounds 60m, while continuing operations made a net loss of of Pounds 18m. Lonrho's disposals during 1992 included Kuhne and Nagel, the German freight forwarder; George Outram, the Glasgow-based newspaper group; and Scottish and Universal Newspapers. Companies are no longer permitted to release surpluses on the revaluation of assets to profits. As a result, the net extraordinary gain of Pounds 78m from disposals is reduced to Pounds 41m, but is taken above the line, boosting pre-tax profits. Under UITF9, which deals with profits in hyper-inflationary economies, Lonrho's operations in those countries have been adjusted to reflect current price levels in the country concerned. The effect of this change is to reduce 1992 pre-tax profit by Pounds 8m and profit after tax and minority interests by Pounds 5m. In addition, Lonrho has adopted a more prudent policy of using the closing year-end exchange rates for all areas, rather than weighted average exchange rates. Pre-tax profits are reduced by Pounds 10m and profit after tax and minority interests by Pounds 7m. Lonrho also changed its treatment of platinum group metal stocks. This increases 1992's pre-tax profits by Pounds 11m, and profit after tax and minority interests by Pounds 8m, but there would be no material effect on 1993 profits. Lex, Page 20</p>

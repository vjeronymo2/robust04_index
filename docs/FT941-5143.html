			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Risks give rich uncle pause for thought: The biggest test of British Airways' international strategy Has USAir become the Achilles' heel of British Airways? The answer will depend on the success or failure of the latest restructuring plan proposed by the sixth largest US carrier. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman and architect of the UK airline's globalisation strategy, yesterday insisted that BA would not withdraw from the initial Dollars 400m (Pounds 265m) investment it made last year to acquire and maintain a 24.6 per cent stake in USAir. But in the same breath he conceded that he was not prepared to invest any additional money in the US partner until it had secured approval for its recovery strategy. 'It is not right for us to commit our shareholders' funds until the outcome of the discussions between USAir, its unions and employees become clear.' Of all the investments in other airlines made by BA during the last 18 months - at a cost of around Pounds 630m - the equity stake in USAir has been by far the most ambitious. The rationale was to give BA access to the world's largest aviation market. The partnership, fiercely opposed by big US carriers such as American Airlines and Delta, has given BA the opportunity to pick up and deliver passengers in the heart of the US market through a ticket code-sharing agreement with USAir. BA also expects that the partnership will eventually provide important cost savings. But the partnership has always been seen by City of London analysts as a calculated gamble, hinging on USAir's ability to put together a recovery strategy while BA helps to keep it afloat. BA is partly insulated from USAir's losses because its 24.6 per cent stake consists of preference shares yielding 7 per cent. However, Mr Chris Avery, aviation analyst at Paribas Capital Markets, says BA's investment in USAir 'is possibly the greatest area of risk for investors in BA over the next few years'. Other analysts warn that there is still a risk that USAir will be forced to seek protection from creditors, under the US Chapter 11 bankruptcy rules, unless it can secure the backing of unions and employees for sweeping restructuring. Should this happen, BA could find itself in the same boat as other European carriers, such as KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Scandinavian Airlines System which have been forced to make heavy write-offs on their investments in financially troubled US airlines. To complicate matters, BA's investment in USAir has also become embroiled in a long running transatlantic aviation dispute which threatens to reach a climax in the next few days. American Airlines and Delta have pressed the US government to revoke the existing bilateral aviation agreement between the US and the UK and withdraw BA's ticket code-sharing rights with USAir on March 17, unless Britain grants US carriers more open access to London's Heathrow Airport. Should the US carry out its threat to withdraw BA's code-sharing rights, the UK government is likely to retaliate by cutting the number of US airline services to Heathrow. 'Not to renew our code-sharing would constitute a violation of the UK-US treaty agreement,' Sir Colin said. Code-sharing was one of the main reasons for the investment in USAir. Although some analysts have suggested that an all-out UK-US aviation war could provide BA with an elegant opportunity to disentangle itself from USAir, Sir Colin said a withdrawal was 'not on the cards'. Nor, he added, had BA underestimated the challenges at USAir. 'What has happened is the emergence during the last three to four months of widespread, very low price competition in the US - particularly in the east, mid-Atlantic and north-east, which have traditionally been USAir's strongholds.' USAir has been hit harder than its bigger US rivals by increasing competition from low-cost airlines - such as Southwest and CALite, Continental's low-cost subsidiary - because of its reliance on the domestic market. But Sir Colin said he remained confident that USAir would resolve its restructuring challenge to face the new competitive forces. Both he and Mr Robert Ayling, BA's managing director, also said they were satisfied with the progress the UK airline was making with its other international equity partnerships with Qantas of Australia, TAT of France and Deutsche BA. 'TAT is becoming a bit of a success story,' said Mr Ayling. The French carrier was successfully restructuring itself, reducing costs by about 30 per cent. Deutsche BA was also showing encouraging passenger load factors of more than 60 per cent on its busiest routes. Both European airline partnerships were part of BA's strategy to invest in the new European single aviation market which, according to Mr Ayling, 'will be our domestic market of the future'. Sir Colin confirmed BA was still searching for a partner in the North Pacific region to complete its global jigsaw. But 'at present we are concentrating on the partnerships we have done in the last 18 months'. The immediate priority was for USAir to get its house finally in order. The message yesterday from BA, the world's most profitable airline, was loud and clear. Although Sir Colin said relations between the two airlines remained 'very good', USAir's rich British uncle has placed on ice any plans to invest a further Dollars 450m in the troubled carrier.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BRITISH AIRWAYS: GLOBAL EXPANSION GATHERS PACE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Mar 1992:  Deutsche BA, set up by BA and German banks, buys small              German airline.  -Sept 92:   BA buys 49.9% of TAT, French regional carrier based at              Paris Orly, from where TAT has started international              operations in BA colours.

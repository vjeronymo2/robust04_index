			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Management: Curbing the office pest European companies can no longer ignore the problem of sexual harassment. Governments, trade unions, employers' bodies, industrial tribunals, the press, equal opportunities groups and countless victims have made sure of that. The latest initiative comes from the European Commission, which has just published a booklet* explaining how to construct a policy aimed at stamping out sexual harassment. It is based on the Commission's code of practice, published two years ago. The code consists of a two-pronged - it includes measures to prevent harassment from occurring in the first place and measures to find ways of tackling it once it has happened. It urges companies to: Issue a statement spelling out what counts as harassment, making it clear that such behaviour is unacceptable and describing a procedure through which employees can complain. Make sure that employees know about the policy. Place responsibility on managers to make sure harassment does not occur in their areas. Provide training for managers and for staff processing complaints. Set up formal and informal channels for dealing with complaints. Designate someone to give advice and assistance. Make sure cases are investigated quickly and by a committee set up for the purpose. Mete out suitable disciplinary measures to guilty parties. Slowly, companies are beginning to realise something needs to be done. The telephone lines have been increasingly busy at the UK's Equal Opportunities Commission, which runs a service advising employers on how to combat harassment. In 1990, an average of one employer a week used the service. By last year, the EOC was receiving about two inquiries a day and the numbers are rising. A similar picture emerges from recent research by Industrial Relations Services, the pay and conditions research group. It found that a third of British employers had a policy to deal with sexual harassment and a further third were considering introducing one. However, the mere existence of a policy does not mean it is having any impact. Indeed, it seems many companies have policies which fall short of the EC's guidelines. A recent survey by the Industrial Society shows that more than a fifth of UK employees do not know if their organisation has a sexual harassment policy or not. The EC booklet says companies without a policy are open to litigation from employees who have been the victims of harassment. Agnes Hubert, head of the European Commission's equal opportunities unit, says a policy may also save companies money. 'Organisations should think seriously about the cumulative cost of replacing staff affected, paying sick leave to employees who miss work because of stress, and the implications of reduced productivity - all expensive drains on morale and efficiency', she says. The priority attached to the issue varies in different countries. The report is peppered with best practice examples from the Netherlands, where many organisations have gone beyond the guidelines by instituting training and setting up external complaints commissions. *How to Combat Sexual Harassment at Work, available from Commission of the European Communities, 8 Storey's Gate, London, SW1P 3AT.

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / 70 groups propose to promote their own schools Seventy groups have put forward proposals to promote their own grant-maintained schools, the Department for Education said yesterday. Mr Robin Squire, schools minister, said the 70 included 'parents, religious-interest groups, those promoting specialisms such as technology, music or dance, and those with business and industry links'. The 70 prospective promoters, which would be required by law to provide 15 per cent of the capital building costs of any new school, are now discussing detailed proposals with the Funding Agency for Schools, the quango that controls funding for grant-maintained schools. Any new school would need the approval of the education secretary, Mrs Gillian Shephard, before work on it could begin.</p>

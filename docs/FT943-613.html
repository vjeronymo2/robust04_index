			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: Metall shares tumble further Metallgesellschaft's shares tumbled to another low yesterday as analysts raised estimates of this year's losses in the face of confusion about the troubled German company's prospects. Mr Kajo Neukirchen, the chief executive brought in to stem the losses and put the engineering, trading and chemical company on a recovery path, denied rumours that banks no longer supported its recovery plan. He repeated that an operating profit of at least DM100m (Dollars 64m) was expected next year and said the recovery programme would be pursued. The continued drop in the shares brought the closing price to DM118.50 - at one stage, they slid to DM101 - down DM14.70 on the day. This was a decline of 11 per cent - the same as Monday. At the start of this month they stood above DM200. One source of downward pressure was an estimate by Deutsche Bank Research putting the loss per share this year at about DM210, implying a total loss of DM3bn, a rise of more than DM80 on its previous estimate. DB Research referred to the negative statements emanating from the company in recent weeks. For next year, it expects a loss of only DM8 a share. Metallgesellschaft said recently that risk provisions of DM1bn set aside to cover losses on controversial oil contracts would have to be increased. The company approached collapse early this year before being rescued by its creditor banks, chiefly Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank. Investors have been unsettled by speculation that the company may reduce its share capital and then make a rights issue. Further restructuring, especially on the non-ferrous smelting side, is expected by some analysts. Reports of possible legal action and investigations into the company in the US are a further source of uncertainty.</p>

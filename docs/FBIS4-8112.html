			<p>BFN     [Text] Joint Croatian and Serb Krajina commissions on  withdrawal held talks today again at a UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] checkpoint near Sarvas in UNPROFOR's sector in eastern  Slavonia. Reporter Verica Madjar has more on the results of the  talks:    [Begin recording] [Madjar] It has been agreed that the  Croatian army will control the village of Brijest, which is  south of Osijek, and the Faculty of Agriculture in order to have  uninterrupted work and life. In return, certain concessions  have been made to the Serb side concerning a part of Nova Tenja  and Ostrvo. According to Major General Djuro Decak, the  commander of the Osijek operational area, the Croatian and Serb  sides were to start withdrawing their units as early as this  morning and to complete the withdrawal by 0900 [0700 GMT] on  Sunday 10 April. He stressed that many issues remain unresolved.    [Decak] There are two disputed elements: Vinkovci and  Mirkovci. The Croatian side explicitly refuses to withdraw even  a single millimeter because Vinkovci is the most urban center on  this line of separation. At the same time, the Serbs demand  that we withdraw 300 to 500 meters. I refused to do that.    UNPROFOR General Vandick tried to find a compromise. He will  come here to examine the situation. The stance of the Croatian  side--my stance--is beyond discussion. The Croatian army will  not withdraw one millimeter from the line of separation.    I also demanded that a local cemetery in the Nustar area,  which is about 300 meters out of the line of separation, be  included in Croatian area. That is the other disputed element  because from the military point of view the cemetery is a  strategic location, and the other side is afraid of it.    [Madjar] Because they failed to reach an agreement, the two  sides agreed to hold next round of talks on Tuesday 12 April.  [end recording]</p>

			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / International Company News: Nestle and BSN in joint bid for Czech food group NESTLE, the Swiss-based food maker, and BSN, the French biscuit manufacturer, are to forge an unusual joint venture in order to gain control of Cokoladovny, Czechoslovakia's largest food producer. The two food companies, otherwise fierce rivals in the European foods business, will pay 2.6bn Czech crowns (Dollars 95.5m) to acquire together 43 per cent of Cokoladovny. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), making its largest investment in Czechoslovakia so far, will acquire a further 15 per cent of Cokoladovny for 900m Czech crowns. The deal values the Czech company at an estimated Dollars 222.2m. Nestle and BSN have agreed to form a partnership after the Czech company insisted that both chocolate and biscuit manufacturing expertise were needed to upgrade and expand its production. Other food manufacturers, such as Phillip Morris and Jacobs Suchard, did not alone fill these requirements, said officials in the Czech government. The two food companies will invest a further Dollars 114.8m in the Czech company over the next four years. Of this amount, Dollars 81.4m will go toward increasing Nestles and BSN's equity participation, which should reach 53 per cent in 1993 and 57 per cent in 1996. The joint venture is conditional upon a favourable ruling by the European Commission to ensure that the monopolistic impact of the joint venture re-exporting its products to EC member-countries is negligible. According to Mr Alex Tyrteos, a senior banker at EBRD, Nestle and BSN will produce very few of their brand products in Czechoslovakia, however. 'The incremental impact of products coming back into the EC will only reach 2 to 3 per cent of these items' total production in western Europe,' he said. Instead, Nestle and BSN will focus on upgrading existing local chocolate and biscuit products in order to maintain the current domestic market share, which is imminently threatened by imports due to lower tariffs. Exports to central European, rather than western European countries, are planned for a later stage. Nestle and BSN will add their names to a spate of other western companies such Mercedes and Air France which earlier this week unveiled plans to invest in Czechoslovakia. Nestle said yesterday that its investment in Cokoladovny was part of a pragmatic approach to developing markets in eastern Europe. For the moment, apart from rapid development in eastern Germany, the group was interested only in investing in Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, countries where it seemed possible to operate on a commercial basis. Early last year, it bought a 97 per cent stake in Interscokolade, the second largest chocolate producer in Hungary, and it had other projects under study in all three countries. Nestle said it was possible that in five or six years the joint venture might break up, with BSN taking the biscuit business and Nestle the confectionery side.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Frankfurt's move gives ERM breathing space THE decision by the Bundesbank to cut key lending rates defused tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism as investors anticipated lower interest rates throughout continental Europe. The news sparked rises in the French franc and Danish krone against the D-Mark. Shortly afterwards Switzerland and Belgium also cut key rates. The French franc rose two centimes to FFr3.5120 to the D-Mark from FFr3.5320 at the close of European dealing on Wednesday. Many economists believe the French government will take advantage of its currency's strength and cut rates over the next few days. In spite of its rate cut yesterday, Belgium was considered by many investors to be suffering problems that need far more than a small easing in borrowing conditions. An initial lift for the Belgian franc from the German rate cut was offset by news that some unions had pulled out of negotiations on the country's social pact on wages and unemployment. It fell back to just below BFr21.80. But, later in the day, the Belgian National Bank cut its key interest rate to 9.4 per cent from 9.65 per cent and its discount rate by half a point to 6 per cent. The currency recovered to close at BFr21.67 to the D-Mark, up from BFr21.82 previously. Mr Neil MacKinnon, currency analyst with Citibank was sceptical of the effect the cut would have on both the French and Belgian currencies. 'The best you can say about the Bundesbank cut is that it provides a breathing space but the scale of reductions needed in Belgium and France are much greater than a German reduction allows.' Denmark, languishing at the bottom of the European Monetary System and maintaining high rates while inflation is only about 1 per cent, was expected to cut its official 14-day rate to 8 per cent from 8.5 per cent. The Danish Krone rose to DKr4.0255 to the D-Mark from DKr4.0592. Meanwhile, the Swiss National Bank cut its discount rate to 4.25 per cent from 4.50 per cent. The main beneficiary in currency markets was the US dollar which will offer a relatively stronger return as the difference between US and German short-term rates narrows. Short-term speculators sold D-Marks to buy the dollar, pushing it up by nearly two pfennigs to DM1.6635, against DM1.6450 previously. The pound surged two pfennigs to DM2.4725, from DM2.45 previously.</p>

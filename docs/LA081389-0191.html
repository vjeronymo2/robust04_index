			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFING: EVENTS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK  </P> <P> A pair of commercial developments proposed for Cook's Corner in the foothills  east of Mission Viejo will be the subject of a staff presentation and public  hearing Tuesday before the county Planning Commission. The two projects,  totaling more than 105,000 square feet of commercial and office space, include  a series of retail shops, a gas station and a mini-mart. One of the projects is  targeted for the current site of the famed Cook's Corner tavern, but developers  say the roadhouse would be incorporated in the project.  </P></p>

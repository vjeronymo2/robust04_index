			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Management: You're not only there for the beer - Hints on how to behave at receptions Have you ever been an unwilling participant at a reception where you know no-one? Is everyone else engaged in animated conversation with what looks like a clutch of old school chums? Do you end up standing in a corner eating and drinking too much before creeping out with the determination never to attend such an event again? Despite the recession, it is likely that your diary contains a fair sprinkling of receptions over the next few months. In addition there may well be professional dinners, reunions and trade shows. Careful preparation and a more positive attitude to these events can reduce or even eliminate the misery and can even turn them into a rewarding experience, according to How to Work a Cocktail Party, an advice note to staff from the Canadian affiliate of accountants Touche Ross. The guide recommends that you: Do your homework. Who will be attending the event? Who is the sponsor? Are there likely to be specific people there you want to meet? If so, make a note of their names, positions, recent mentions in the press. Do not set out with a negative attitude or with the view that you are only going for the food, the drink, or 'to put in an appearance'. Set personal and professional goals for the event: to make, say, two new contacts or to meet a particular individual. Prepare your small talk and make a mental note of topical professional issues which may come up in discussion. Make sure that your partner, if you are taking someone, is also informed about the event, the people and likely tone. Arrive at the starting time. This means you will be in one of the happy, chattering groups from the outset instead of trying to break in with the other late-comers. Walk into the room with confidence. Do not hang about in the doorway. Look for people you know or want to know to get started but do not just stick with people you know. The aim, after all, is to get to know new people who may be fun knowing personally or worth knowing professionally. Always give a firm handshake. Avoid jellyfish, knuckle-breakers, finger squeezes and kissing. Do not burden yourself with plates, drinks or papers which prevent you from keeping a hand free for shaking hands. Place your name tag where it can be easily read. Use other people's name tags to start conversations. Prepare a brief self-introduction to outline how you fit in with the group and provide others with enough information to start a conversation. It can be hard to think up an opening line but it is better to say something than wait for the best line. When introduced to others repeat their name; it will help you to remember it. To enter an on-going conversation it is best to approach groups of three or more people since there is a greater chance that one individual will be willing to make an opening for a newcomer. If the situation is uncomfortable, excuse yourself and move on. Spend no more than eight to 10 minutes with any one person. To achieve a smooth exit say that you are going to get something to eat or drink or that there is someone else you need to talk to. After the event review how the evening went. Were the techniques you used successful? Did you notice any other examples of effective (or of ineffective) behaviour? How many contacts did you make? Social conditioning makes it difficult for many people to feel comfortable at receptions. They feel uneasy talking to strangers, fear rejection and would prefer to be 'properly introduced.' But preparation and a positive approach can make a big difference to what you get out of it, however.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: Decision by EC reprieves Klockner-Werke KLOCKNER-WERKE, the German steel and engineering group, yesterday won a reprieve from outright bankruptcy when the European Commission decided not to demand immediate full repayment of its DM175m (Dollars 111.4m) loan to the group. But the company must still satisfy the commission that planned capacity cuts and restructuring will not distort overall EC plans to support the European steel industry. Klockner said yesterday the way was now open for its debt relief scheme to go through. It said all main creditors had endorsed its debt rescheduling deal under which DM1.4bn of the groups's DM2.7bn net debt would be written off. 'The last hurdle is removed,' a spokesman added. But a senior commission official said: 'That is wrong. Today we said 'Yes, but' and we are waiting for the answer to our 'but'.' In Duisburg, the local court yesterday gave a green light to the company's plan by formally opening the 'composition' procedure. The procedure, a legal step which falls short of bankruptcy proceedings, allows Klockner to write off over 50 per cent of its debt once all creditors have accepted it. Creditors are due to meet on June 7 to review the plan, the company said. Klockner's largest creditors are Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank and Westdeutsche Landesbank, the state bank for North-Rhine Westphalia. Brussels, which does not want to encourage debt write-offs at other ailing European steel manufacturers, is seeking rapid clarification of the cuts involved in Klockner's restructuring. Klockner itself believes the commission will be satisfied with its plans to reduce crude steel production by 20 per cent this year with a blast furnace in Bremen set for closure. Further cuts are also planned for the lossmaking Edelstahl, Klockner's special steels division. The company is to be sold for a symbolic DM2 to Mr Jurgen Grossmann, chairman of the subsidiary until February 15. Druker, a Frankfurt-based consultancy company, will acquire 25 per cent of the shares.</p>

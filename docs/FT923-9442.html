			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Cut in Italian discount rate lifts continent AN unexpected cut in the Italian discount rate late on Monday lifted bourses yesterday but volume was generally low, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT took heart from better-than-expected half-year results from Dresdner Bank and turned broadly positive. Although Italy's discount rate cut encouraged some buying, the market remained nervous ahead of tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting. The FAZ index was up 5.77 at 637.61 at midsession while the DAX index advanced 16.8 to 1,611.51, having seen an intraday high of 1,617. Turnover rose to DM4.1bn from DM3.8bn. The 15 per cent rise in Dresdner's first-half earnings provided an early fillip to the market and lifted other bank stocks. Its shares closed up DM7 at DM332 while Commerzbank improved DM4.20 to DM239.90 and Deutsche Bank, which reports its figures today, advanced DM4.90 to DM630. Forecasts of higher full-year earnings helped Schering gain ground although it came off its intraday high of DM724 to close up DM1 at DM713. Other chemicals groups were firmer, BASF up DM3.50 at DM225.50 and Bayer up DM2 at DM267.80. MILAN rallied for the second consecutive day following the half-point cut in the discount rate late on Monday. But traders said most of the activity was professional short-covering with little institutional demand. The Comit index rose 7.71 or 1.9 per cent to 424.35 in turnover estimated at more than Monday's L68.4bn. The session was again hampered by technical problems in the screen trading system and the 35 shares listed on the telematico had to be traded on the floor by open outcry. Banks were boosted by the lower interest rates, with San Paolo rising L50 to L10,450 and Mediobanca gaining L365 to L12,850. PARIS came off the day's highs as the CAC-40 index closed just 3.19 higher at 1,787.63, down from 1,802.63, in low turnover of FFr1.2bn. Peugeot dropped FFr8 to FFr677 on news that its new car sales fell 8.7 per cent in July from the same period in 1991. Euro Disney rebounded FFr2.95 or 3.5 per cent to FFr86.75 but some analysts feared that it would be difficult for the stock to recover further because of the adverse sentiment towards it. Another gainer was Synthelabo, the pharmaceuticals company, which rose FFr33 or 3.3 per cent to FFr1,035 following news of a sales increase of 9.7 per cent to FFr3.17bn in the first half. ZURICH was stronger with the SMI index up 10.5 at 1,805.4. Banks and insurers remained positive with Union Bank bearers adding SFr4 to SFr705 while Zurich Insurance bearers gained SFr15 to SFr1,945. Lindt &amp; Spruengli, the chocolate manufacturer, came under pressure after Mr Rudolph Spruengli, the company chairman, announced that he had secretly married a woman who is connected to a US religious sect. Its bearers tumbled SFr1,075 or 8.9 per cent to SFr11,000. AMSTERDAM was satisfied with the 11 per cent rise in Akzo's first-half results. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.8 to 117.4. Akzo also forecast improved full-year earnings and its shares gained Fl 3.40 to Fl 149.90. Fellow chemical group DSM put on 10 cents to Fl 103.20. A number of 'hold' recommendations have recently been issued on DSM in spite of its pleasing half-year figures released last week as many analysts believe that Akzo is better placed to benefit from an upturn in the global economy. Philips put on 40 cents to Fl 24.90 ahead of tomorrow's results while Elsevier lost Fl 2 to Fl106.20. BRUSSELS eased with the Bel-20 index down 1.5 to 1,136.28. Petrofina recovered BFr25 to BFr10,975 with 20,760 shares traded. Solvay was BFr75 stronger at BFr12,550 while Electrabel put on BFr50 to BFr4,555. VIENNA rebounded but trading was light as the 18-share ATX index climbed 3.69 to 770.6. STOCKHOLM advanced in thin trading as the Affarsvarlden General Index rose 4.9 864.3 in turnover of SKr274m after SKr182m.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - AUG 4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Hourly changes   Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close  1080.15  1080.33  1079.06  1077.54  1076.16  1075.70  1076.65  1076.44  ----------------------------------------------------------------------         Day's High  1080.72            Day's Low  1075.42  ----------------------------------------------------------------------       Aug 3       Jul 31       Jul 30       Jul 29       Jul 28      1069.17     1067.77      1068.92      1077.69      1058.38  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

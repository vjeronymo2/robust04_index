			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Apr 06, BNS -- A successful development of  economic relations between Lithuania and Russia is obstructed by  political problems, the Lithuanian ambassador to Russia told the  Vilnius-based Lietuvos rytas newspaper.    Romualdas Kozyrovicius said the main stumbling block in the  development of economic relations is Russia's failure to ratify  an agreement according to which the two countries would  reciprocally grant the most favored nation trade status to each  other. The agreement was signed in Vilnius last November.    The ambassador said a major political problem is that Russia  links the ratification with the signing of a package of  agreements concerning the Kaliningrad region.    Kozyrovicius emphasized that Lithuania still pays double  export taxes to Russia which automatically leads to higher  retail prices for Lithuanian goods. "This damages the interests  of both states," the Lithuanian diplomat said.    Commenting on Russia's plans to ratify the treaty after a  package of "Kaliningrad agreements" is signed with Lithuania,  Kozyrovicius said the fact "causes worry" because no such  conditions were made when Lithuanian and Russian premiers signed  the treaty in Vilnius. "How can we speak about other agreements  with Russia when it changes the terms so rudely."    The ambassador said a bilateral agreement on transit is  under  preparation, but Russia also wants to sign an agreement on  military transit. In Kozyrovicius' view, there is no need to  sign a military transit agreement because respective agreements  would then have to be signed with Belarus, Latvia and even  Poland.    The ambassador said the best solution for Lithuania would be  to adopt a law on transit and to sign an agreement on  settlements and payments. But Russia insists on a bilateral  military transit treaty, he said.    In Kozyrovicius' words, Lithuania is concerned about the  increasing concentration of military force in the Kaliningrad  region. But the ambassador emphasized that the region  rightfully belongs to Russia and Lithuania has no territorial  claims.    Kozyrovicius said "observing how servicemen move to  Kaliningrad from the Baltics, Germany and Russia," Lithuania  will continue efforts to demilitarize this Russian enclave.</p>

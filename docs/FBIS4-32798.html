			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 28 May (PL) -- The National Directorate of  the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR), the  largest people's organization in Cuba, today called on the  population to support the measures adopted to cleanse the  national economy and increase surveillance against crime.    Sixto Batista Santana, national CDR coordinator, called on  CDR members to contribute to achieving an understanding for and  to support the measures, so as to overcome the economic  difficulties that have appeared following the collapse of the  socialist bloc and the worsening of Washington's blockade.    The main leader of the CDR, created 33 years ago, presided  over the second meeting of the CDR National Directorate in which  surveillance by CDR members in every block of the country was  analyzed as an important factor to prevent crime, according to a  wire item reported today by the National Information Agency.    At the meeting, it was agreed to recognize the work of  prominent CDR members in performing their tasks and the mission  of explaining to the population the new financial provisions,  the source indicated. The Council of State decreed an increase  in the price of some products, such as cigarettes, beer, rum,  and such services as electricity and urban transportation, as  well as general payment for water service.    During the semester from October 1993 to March of this year,  CDR members from all over the country contributed 243,068  voluntary blood donations, donated over 11 million crystal  containers, 8,000 tons of paper and carton, and 2,587 tons of  aluminum, in a contribution they make each year to public health  and the national economy.</p>

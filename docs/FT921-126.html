			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COCOA and COFFEE prices retreated further yesterday as last week's speculative selling pressure continued. 'It's still all mainly technical with perhaps some anticipation of further origin (producer) sales,' said one cocoa dealer as the May cocoa futures price slipped Pounds 18 to a fresh eight-month low of Pounds 628 a tonne. Traders estimate that over the past month about 40,000 tonnes of cocoa has been sold by the Ivory Coast, the biggest producer. May delivery coffee closed at Dollars 844 a tonne, down Dollars 15 on the day, but dealers said the fact that it had not tested support at Dollars 838-Dollars 840 a tonne was 'mildly supportive'. 'It should be one big long buy from now on. . . I just can't bring myself to sell at these levels,' one commented. Trading was likely to remain subdued ahead of the start of talks on a new coffee pact in London at the end of the week, traders suggested. At the London Metal Exchange three months delivery ZINC touched a fresh 15 1/2 -month peak of Dollars 1,284 a tonne before profit-taking and trade selling trimmed it back. At the end of kerb (after-hours) trading it was quoted at Dollars 1,268 a tonne, Dollars 7.50 below Friday's level. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Vice President 'Ali Salim al- Bid, </F> in Aden, by Ahmad Manjunah, in London "a short while ago"--  recorded]    [Text] [Al-Bid] My dear, the situation in Yemen, including  Aden, is sad. Aden, Sanaa, and all of Yemen have been dragged  onto a path different from that chosen by the Yemeni people on  20 February. We hope that we will find our way back to the  right path.    [Manjunah] Brother 'Ali, does this mean that you believe  that  you have arrived at a point of no return, or is there still room  for a political solution?    [Al-Bid] By God, my brother, Yemen has chosen its path and  will adhere to it. All the Yemenis will stand by the Pledge and  Accord document, by dialogue, and by peaceful solutions. We  will stand up against the gangs, the warmongers, and those who  lead the Yemenis on a ruinous path. May God grant us success.    [Manjunah] The state of emergency declared recently by Sanaa  -- does it apply also to southern areas, or is it confined to  northern areas?    [Al-Bid] We have not learned anything about this in the  southern provinces. The state of emergency was declared by 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih on 27 April. Currently, he is following a path  of partition. He is doing what he pleases and forgets or  ignores the interests of Yemen and the Yemenis.    [Manjunah] How true is the news that Aden's airport and  other  strategic areas have been seized by northern troops?    [Al-Bid] [Words indistinct] Everything that happened today  is  sad for all Yemenis, all Arabs, and all people. We have been  forced, like someone who is wrecking his own house,  unfortunately...    [Manjunah; interrupting] Now that the military situation has  reached this stage, how do you see the situation in Yemen in  general?    [Al-Bid] We should listen to reason, resort to dialogue,  abide by the interests of the Yemeni people and homeland, honor  the Pledge and Accord document, whose legitimacy is derived from  national consensus, and rid ourselves of diseases, arrogance,  and the military mentality. I say to the al-Ahmar clan: Yemen  is bigger than any clan and any individual. Yemen will remain  long after we are all gone.    [Manjunah] Brother al-Bid, thank you very much.    [Al-Bid] Thanks.</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Interest in buying houses drops INTEREST IN buying houses has fallen to its lowest level since March, a survey by Gallup says. Gallup's index measuring keenness to enter the housing market fell to 9.81 last month from 12.93 in June. The index is based on interviews with 2,000 people who are either potential first-time buyers or who already own a house. Although interest in moving house had picked up from last year, Gallup said 'full recovery (in the housing market) is still some way off'. Fear of being made unemployed together with the large numbers of people with mortgages greater than the value of their houses was holding back any significant increase in transactions.</p>

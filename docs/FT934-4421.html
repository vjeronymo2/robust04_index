			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Capital increase to cut group net debt at Adia Adia, the troubled temporary employment group, yesterday held out the prospect of breaking even next year after two years of losses. Mr John Bowmer, chief executive, said the group's net debt had come down from SFr1.5bn (Dollars 1bn) at the end of 1991 to SFr785m at September 30 1993 and would fall to SFr593m after a SFr200m capital increase approved at an EGM in Lausanne yesterday. The capital increase, the second in less than a year, was announced last month when Adia revealed losses of SFr112.2m for the first nine months of the year, compared with a loss of SFr219m for all of 1992. The capital increases consist of SFr100m in new shares to be issued to a consortium of banks which is converting its loans into equity and a SFr100m rights issue which is being underwritten by Mr Klaus Jacobs, the chairman. Following the increase, the group's equity would rise to SFr334m. If shareholders take up their rights, Mr Jacobs will have a 51.04 per cent stake in the group. If not, his stake will rise to 57.5 per cent. Adia said it expected most shareholders would take up their rights.</p>

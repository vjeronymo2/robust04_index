			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / India share sale raises Rs23bn India has raised Rs23bn (Pounds 483m) from its latest round of sales of shares in state-owned enterprises, securing much-needed funds for the government and extending its economic liberalisation programme, Stefan Wagstyl reports from New Delhi. Foreign institutional investors, permitted to bid for the first time, snapped up part of the offering, the fifth since launch of economic reforms in mid-1991. Stock in seven companies was on offer, including Mahangar Telephone Nigam, the domestic telecommunications carrier serving Delhi and Bombay, which accounted for nearly 60 per cent of the total sale. The total raised falls short of the original target of Rs35bn for disinvestment in 1993-94. Since 1991, the government has raised Rs73bn and hopes for another Rs40bn in this financial year. The government, which has sold shares in 31 out of 230 centrally owned enterprises, intends to retain control of most by maintaining a minimum holding of 51 per cent. Foreign institutions which successfully bid for stakes include funds managed by Morgan Stanley of the US, the investment management arms of Britain's BZW and of Hong Kong-based Jardine Fleming.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ji Fusheng [0370 1788 3932], Chief Engineer, </F> State Science and Technology Commission (SSTC), Department for  Basic Research and High Technology: ``Value the Building of an  Information Infrastructure'']    [Summary] [Editor's note] Chief Engineer Ji Fusheng was  one of the distinguished participants in the ``Information  Highway'' Symposium recently held by KEJI RIBAO. [End of  editor's note.]    I feel that planning for information highways has already  grasped several key factors in current social development. Up  to the year 2020, information technology will remain a hot topic  and will remain in a decisive position amid international  competition. Setting out from present national conditions,  authorities and technologists must focus on building an  infrastructure for information services. Building an  information infrastructure is an indispensable condition for the  people's economic modernization. This new infrastructure is not  limited to telephone service, however; modern conditions require  that a gradually increasing percentage of all telecommunications  services be devoted to data and image transmission. Therefore,  in planning for and constructing our national information  infrastrucutre, we must start out by meeting the demands of  integrated services [i.e., those provided in integrated services  digital networks (ISDNs)]. Our domestic campaign is fully  capable of incorporating the latest worldwide S&amp;T  achievements.  In the area of technical progress, China is also fully capable  of leaping over several historical stages of development  experienced by advanced nations in their development course. At  the same time, we must be practical and realistic, and must  chart out our path according to scientific research into market  demand. The State has already taken some steps in strategic  development of an information infrastructure, such as 863  Program support for research on high-speed parallel computing  and high-speed communications, but the strength of this R&amp;D  effort is still insufficient. The State should firm up its  outline for constructing an information infrastructure, utilize  existing resources, and make appropriate additions to its  financial support for this infrastructure.</p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Gummer reopens Tory split Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, yesterday reopened the divisions over Europe in Mr John Major's cabinet by taking a markedly different approach from the prime minister to the future of the European Union. As Labour sought to highlight what it called the Tory party's 'great divide' over Europe, Mr Gummer hinted at discontent in the cabinet about Mr Major's recent commitment to a 'multi-speed' EU. With the European elections only two days away, the prime minister has elaborated on a 'new vision' for Europe, in which member states can decide 'in their own way and at their own speed' how much power they give to Brussels. But Mr Gummer - one of the most pro-European ministers - yesterday warned that it would be 'quite unacceptable' if the development of more flexible decision making allowed Britain to take a more cautious line on its place in Europe. 'What is absolutely clear is that Britain is not going to be at a slower speed than the rest of Europe,' he said at the Tories' daily Euro-election news conference. 'We are at the heart of Europe and we have no intention of being at a slower speed than the others.' Mr Gummer also appeared to disagree with the prime minister on why flexible decision making needed to be introduced in the first place. Last week Mr Major claimed that the 'multi-speed, multi-track' idea should be an integral part of the EU's development into the next century. But yesterday Mr Gummer cast that theme in more modest terms, claiming that it would merely relate to new applications for EU membership from the developing countries of eastern Europe. He said: 'A number of countries who want to join cannot just join on the basis of total access. What the prime minister is suggesting is that you have got to look at ways in which we enable people to join at a different level.' Labour claimed that the prime minister was trying to manage irreconcilable division between pro and anti-Europeans in his party. Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, said: 'So deeply split is the Conservative party now on Europe that its leader is obliged himself to face both ways on just about every important issue.' He said that the prime minister had become 'the modern embodiment of Janus: a split personality chairing a split cabinet, leading a split party'. Mr Cunningham singled out Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, who so far has played no part in the campaign, saying that sending him to France had failed to keep the 'rift' in Tory ranks out of the headlines 'let alone to heal it'. For the Liberal Democrats, Sir Russell Johnston, Europe spokesman, said the Tory campaign had been 'wholly negative' and had sought to maximise differences. Mr John Major's rhetoric had not 'openly mirrored' the condemnation of foreigners expressed by Euro-sceptic cabinet ministers such as Mr Michael Portillo and Mr Lilley, Sir Russell said. But 'the meaning has been the same and they have never been disowned'. Sir Russell was supported by Lord Thomson of Monifieth, a former EU commissioner, who said it was a 'heartbreaking tragedy' that the Tories had turned their back on playing a key role in the EU 'for reasons of purely domestic politics'.</p>

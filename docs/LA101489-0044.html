			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE FBI AND ITS COMPLAINT ABOUT N.W.A'S RAP LYRICS  </P> <P> "Compton Rappers Versus the Letter of the Law," by Steve Hochman (Oct. 5), is a  disturbing article.  </P> <P> Contrary to what Rep. Don Edwards, the ACLU and the recording industry seem to  believe, the advocacy of violence is not protected by the U.S. Constitution.  The FBI was correct to express its concern on behalf of law enforcement to  Priority Records over the lyrics in N.W.A's "Straight Outta Compton."  </P> <P> It appears that some people think money can be made by inciting the ignorant to  rise up against authority. This can result only in chaos.  </P> <P> I wonder how Rep. Edwards would react if N.W.A expressed outrage against the  Congress? I think he might be singing a different song.  </P> <P> CHRISTOPHER D. PASCAL, Rowland Heights  </P></p>

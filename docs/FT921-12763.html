			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Plea to ministers for tin clean-up funds THE NATIONAL Rivers Authority, the environmental watchdog for water, is to ask the government to pay for clearance of pollution caused by the flooding of the disused Wheal Jane tin mine in Cornwall. The cost of clearing the pollution caused by heavy metals in local rivers and the Fal estuary at Falmouth might amount to more than Pounds 1m. So far the authority has spent Pounds 100,000. The authority expressed its intention to Mr Tony Baldry, the junior environment minister, who visited the mine yesterday to see the clean-up operations. Mr Baldry said that any request for further funds from the NRA would be considered 'carefully and constructively'. There were claims that the pollution from millions of gallons of rust-coloured water is beginning to affect shellfish in the estuary, and fears that other marine life might be affected. Mr Baldry denied allegations that the government was to blame for the halting of pumping operations in the mine by refusing further loan advances to Carnon Consolidated, the owner. 'The decision to stop pumping which foreshadowed this large discharge was taken by the company without consulting the NRA,' he said. 'A discharge on such a large scale was unforeseen and could not have been planned for.' Mr Elliot Morley, the Labour party's fisheries spokesman, visited the area yesterday and said local fishermen were very worried. High levels of cadmium and other metals had been found in the estuary. On the first day of the flooding 10m to 15m gallons of water came from the mine but that had now been reduced to under 2m daily. Bulldozers began preliminary work on the M3 extension at Twyford Down near Winchester yesterday in spite of a plea from Mr Ripa di Meana, EC environment commissioner, that it should not start until the dispute over the scheme's impact on the environment was cleared up. It is one of seven big construction projects that the EC commissioner said should be halted because proper environmental impact assessments required by community law had not been carried out. He has warned that the matter might end in the European Court. Friends of the Earth said that the sending in of bulldozers was a 'wilful disregard of the due process of law' on the part of the government. However, yesterday's operations were not on the site of special scientific interest that is at the heart of the controversy.</p>

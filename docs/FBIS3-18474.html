			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Foreign Minister Alois Mock to Parliament in </F> Vienna -- live]    [Text] Ladies and Gentlemen, on 29 June 1989, the Austrian  Parliament asked the Federal Government by an overwhelming  majority of 175 to only 7 votes to initiate negotiations on  Austrian accession to the European Community. On 4 July 1989, a  unanimous resolution to this effect was adopted in the Bundesrat.    In fulfillment of this clear parliamentary assignment, on 17  July 1989, I presented Austria's application for membership in  Brussels. The actual membership negotiations with the Community,  which meanwhile has developed further into the European Union  [EU], started on 1 February 1993.    Today, I can inform Parliament that, after marathon talks of  more than three days and more than 70 hours of actual  negotiations and talks, these negotiations were successfully  concluded some 12 hours ago at the political level.    I have been told today that Parliament will stick to its  agenda, and I should present my report today, which I regard as  an obligation. This is why I only made a short appearance at  the news conference and retired to prepare my address to this  Parliament. [applause]    Ladies and Gentlemen, even though the legal experts will  still have to do much work on all the details, one thing is now  certain: The way for Austrian membership in the European Union  has been paved.    When I think back to the difficult, and even tough,  negotiations, there is one fact that clearly comes back to mind,  and that is the strong determination for cooperation that  encouraged all the Austrians involved in this process of  negotiations in one way or another. During the long marathon of  talks over the past few days, and also during the preceding  weeks, once again I was able to realize that, regardless of  party affiliations and our individual positions, we Austrians  are really able to stick together when it is necessary for our  country. [applause]    The positive conclusion of the negotiations was essentially  facilitated by the political preparatory work, which was done  particularly over the past year and a half in the capitals of  the EU -- by the Federal Government, and certainly also by  members of Parliament. In this connection, I would also like to  mention the intensive contacts our federal president has had  with the heads of state and governments, and the parliaments and  media of the EU member states. I would like to seize this  opportunity to express my cordial thanks to the federal  president for his efforts. [applause]    In addition, I would like to thank the chancellor, the vice  chancellor, and all my colleagues in the government, especially  those who accompanied me to Brussels, and the representatives of  the provinces, of industry and labor, and public servants for  the very fine cooperation over the past few weeks and months.  [applause]    The regular talks that have also been going on here for many  years with the representatives of the opposition were, of  course, also part of our foreign policy orientation, regardless  of the differing views of the objectives pursued by the  government and members of the opposition.    I have felt very clearly we are all aware of this being a  central national issue. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is probably  the most important issue our country has faced since 1955. I am  confident the issue of EU membership will be treated with the  same attitude in this house. Following today's debate I will  provide you with detailed documentation within the next few  days. The results achieved in the negotiations mean Austria now  has the opportunity to take part in the peace work  [Friedensarbeit] of European integration. And I would like to  stress, Ladies and Gentlemen, without ignoring the idealism that  was there in the past as well, that this is specific peace work  and not just a nice vision, as always we have had in Europe and  in other parts of the world. In specific terms, the outcome  means Austria now has the opportunity to be part of the  community of stability and security in Europe and we have a seat  and vote in the European organizations creating the future of  Europe. I am all the more pleased about this because I am  convinced our entry can take place in conditions that take  account of the specific situation in our country. I am well  aware, Ladies and Gentlemen, that in a democracy negotiations --  be they national or international -- always will involve  compromises that require those responsible to set priorities and  to weigh important points against each other. Regardless of  the documentation mentioned earlier, I would like to make a few  points: During the first few months of negotiations we made  sure that Austria will remain a country where nuclear power  stations can neither be built nor operated. We have made sure  that Austria can keep its higher environmental standards after  joining the EU. We have made sure that Austria can fully  participate in the common foreign and security policy; the  Austrian law on neutrality will remain valid after joining. I  would like to remind you that Burgenland was declared a Target-1  area in EU regional policy, which means it will fall into the  group receiving the highest subsidies.    Perhaps I should point out one example in particular:  Austria will be given four votes in the Council of Ministers of  the EU. In comparison, Germany with its 80 million inhabitants  has only 10 votes. This means we will have 40 percent of the  votes of the EU member with the greatest population. We will  use these votes in the interest of our country and in the  interest of Europe. Ladies and Gentlemen, during the last round  of negotiations we could show -- and this resulted in reports  that we were being too tough -- we tried to make our positions  clear. This time we were discussing mainly the issues of  holiday homes, agriculture, and transalpine transit. As for  holiday homes Austria can maintain the existing regulations to  restrict the holiday homes market up to the year 2000, that is  five years after entry. This fully meets all the provincial  regulations in this respect. After the year 2000, using  measures in the fields of regional planning, development, and  environmental protection, we will be able to ensure that the  requirements of the local population for housing at adequate  prices are met first and that Austria's landscape is protected  from being spoilt by uncontrolled development. These  possibilities will be recognized and laid down in the final act  to the membership agreement.    Regarding the issue of agriculture, we joined forces to  achieve solutions in favor of our farmers. On the understanding  that it is of vital importance for all of us that our farmers  continue to supply us with healthy food in the future,  contribute to the preservation of our environment, and can  participate in the cultivation of our farming sector, I think we  managed to achieve a result in the negotiations that does  justice to our specific interests and will secure the future of  Austrian farmers. [applause]    What I regard as a particular success in the talks is the  result that was achieved by my colleagues in the entire area of  structural promotion, ranging from compensation payments for  mountain farmers to subsidies related to environmental  conditions. The adaptation to the lower level of agricultural  prices in the Community will be facilitated for Austrian farmers  through full compensation in the form of direct payments for a  period of four years. Contrary to initial demands that came  from within the EU's ranks, these payments will not have to be  funded exclusively by us but, to a considerable degree, will be  funded from the EU budget. During this transition period,  Austrian farmers will receive a total of 7 billion schillings  from EU funds alone. Another 6 billion schillings in EU funds  will flow to Austria as part of permanent subsidies in the area  of regional and structural policy.    After particularly difficult negotiations we also achieved  agreement that the ecological substance of our transit agreement  be preserved even after Austria's EU accession. That way, the  transit regime that was concluded at the time, in particular the  ecological regulations and the objective of a 60-percent  reduction of pollutants, can fundamentally be maintained until  the year 2004 -- for the entire federal territory.    Ladies and Gentlemen, since this question is quite rightly  very often brought up, I would like to make the following point:  A change of the current regime as of 2001 is possible only  under two conditions, namely if a new common model is developed  that guarantees the same protection or if a study that is made  in cooperation with the European Environmental Agency  establishes that the 60-percent reduction of pollutants has  already been permanently secured. My colleagues from the  government who were in Brussels with me will explain any further  details of the agreements that we reached.    At this point I would like to emphasize that I think, all in  all, we have managed to achieve a satisfying result, which we  will present for a referendum with a clear conscience. I would  like to tell this house and my fellow Austrian citizens that,  with this negotiated result, we now have a basis that will allow  us to embark on the path to the common Europe with  self-assuredness. The negotiations of the past few days have  proved Austria is able to present its positions in Brussels with  clarity and determination. The warnings that were also voiced by  some, namely that Austria's inflexible position might lead to  strains in certain bilateral relations and ultimately uncouple  our country from the current enlargement process, have not had  an impact on our policy in the negotiations, a policy that the  substance of the agreements had precedence over other  deliberations.    I think our efforts have been worthwhile. Austria has  protected its essential interests in the integration process  and, at the same time, it now has the real perspective to  participate in the shaping of the future of Europe as an equal  partner -- a Europe of peace, security, prosperity, increasing  environmental awareness, and growing social justice.    We have much reason to be happy about the invitation  extended  to us by our 12 new partners. Let us accept this invitation.  It offers a great opportunity for our republic and for our  nation.

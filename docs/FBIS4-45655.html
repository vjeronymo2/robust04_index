			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Janni Andreassen: "Forest Owners Want To Burn </F> Wastepaper"]    [Text] Energy: The Danish Forest Federation wants to burn  old paper, which is accused of increasing CO[.sub]2[/]  pollution and destroying the economic potential of forests.    Wood producers and the recycling industry are in strong  disagreement over whether it should be permitted to burn  wastepaper for energy purposes.    The Danish Forest Federation has come right out and said it:  Burn the paper instead of increasing demand for recycled paper.  There is quite enough of it on the market, a fact that is  reflected in the price, which, roughly speaking, is next to  nothing. A growing recycling industry is destructive of forests,  which cannot dispose of new wood. And at the same time only  recycled paper, through its production process, helps increase  CO[.sub]2[/] emissions.    The paper industry in Denmark is also involved in the  debate.  Not surprisingly, it holds the opposite point of view.    In a letter to the minister for industry, the environment,  and energy and the [Folketing standing] Committee on the  Environment, Stora Papyrus Dalum, Inc., Skjern Papirfabrik,  Inc., and Grenaa Papir, Inc. state that burning wastepaper would  destroy the supply of wastepaper to the Danish paper industry.    The Liberal, Conservative, and Progressive Parties have  proposed to the Folketing that the ban that has existed since  1986, under which paper collected by cities and towns must not  be used as an energy source, be lifted. That is to say, that it  must not be burned.    The proposal has just had its first reading in the Folketing  and has not been sent to the Committee on the Environment, and  the Danish Forest Federation has asked to appear before it.  <H5>  Recycling Paper Increases CO </H5>[.sub]2[/] Emissions    The Environment Administration has prepared a note on the  issue that shows the advantages and disadvantages of burning  paper. Among other things, it looks at when there is increased  recycling the consumption of fossil fuels and thus  CO[.sub]2[/] emissions increases.    "This squares with both common sense and foreign analyses.  On  the other hand, it does not square well with Danish  environmental policy to prohibit an energy source that could cut  down on the repercussions of the greenhouse effect by using  fossil fuels," said Martin Einfeldt, who works in the  information department at the Danish Forest Federation.    He pointed out that in its note the Environment  Administration makes the proposal to rescue scrap paper's  CO[.sub]2[/] record: namely by using the wood, which the  forests are saving, for energy purposes.    "They came up with that idea out of the blue. At the moment  Europe's forests are experiencing a growth rate that is 50  percent greater than the cutting rate, so the tree surplus is  growing by 200 million cubic meters per year," Einfeldt said.    The paper industry has told the Environment Committee that  it  is not able to use new wood as a raw material either  technologically, economically, or on the market. The industry is  set up to use wastepaper and cannot help the forest industry out  of the crisis it is in owing to a shortage of sales  opportunities.  <H5>  Analysis Not Good </H5>   "In its note on recycling, the Environmental Administration  is hinting indirectly against burning and depositing that the  analysis cannot be used as a basis for making a decision in the  Folketing. The Danish Forest Federation is entirely in agreement  with this point of view," Einfeldt said.    Environment Minister Svend Auken has so far rejected the  need  to change the current law pertaining to burning in the waste  sector.</p>

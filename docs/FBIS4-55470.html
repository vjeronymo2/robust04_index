			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Economy Minister Peter Magvasi by </F> Jozef Hubel in Warsaw on 7 May: "We Are Going in the Right  Direction"]    [Text] The Third East-West Conference, attended by  ministers of economy, industry, and trade of the G-7 and E-10  countries, ended in Warsaw on 7 May. The aim of the conference  was to map out the basic elements of economic partnership  between the two groups of countries, with a view to contributing  to their permanent economic growth. Our collaborator Jozef  Hubel, Slovak Television correspondent in Warsaw, asked Minister  of Economy Peter Magvasi a few questions on this occasion:    [Hubel] What conclusions can be drawn from the conference  for Slovakia?    [Magvasi] The main conclusion is that Slovakia is going in  the right direction and that ours is among the most rapidly  transforming economies within the framework of the postcommunist  countries. We could therefore become very interesting as a link  between the East and the West.    [Hubel] We will evidently not make do without foreign  investment.    [Magvasi] Direct foreign investment in the reforming  countries should reach the sum of $200 billion by the year 2000,  and the private sector should generate 70 percent of their gross  national product. The first prerequisite of influx of  investment resources is the political stability of each country.  Everything else is a question of the quality,  conscientiousness, and systemic approach of people, people in  both the state administration and the entrepreneurial sphere. A  good atmosphere for that is being created in our country.    [Hubel] But we are unlikely to catch up with the  economically advanced countries by means of foreign capital  alone. More than that is needed.    [Magvasi] An outstretched arm is too little. We must  ourselves look for ways of catching up with the advanced world.  Countries relying more on their own resources have progressed  further than those relying on help from the outside. If the  appropriate environment is not established, outside help is only  a single, unrepeated action and has no permanent effect.    [Hubel] You have had several bilateral meetings while in  Warsaw. How would you characterize the present Polish-Slovak  economic relations?    [Magvasi] They can on no account be assessed positively.  The two countries have a far bigger potential than is indicated  by the bilateral trade turnover. This is the consequence of a  certain process, which we no longer have to analyze, however.  Now we have to focus on opening better corridors for mutual  trade. A contribution to this should be made by the signing of  several bilateral agreements during Prime Minister Pawlak's  visit to Bratislava, which is now under preparation. Until  then, we should sort out some problems, including, for example,  the settlement of the Polish debt toward Slovakia. In view of  its industrial potential, Poland could be a far more significant  partner for Slovakia than some other countries with which we  have rich trade relations today.</p>

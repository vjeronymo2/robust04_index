			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Case against minimum wage Sir, Mr John Monks (Letters, November 15) refers to a recent Engineering Employers' Federation, survey which found almost 40 per cent of respondents in favour of a statutory national minimum wage. The full survey reveals a rather different view. More than half of the respondents opposed a statutory minimum wage. Forty eight per cent of the same sample thought that a minimum wage would increase unemployment, while only 8 per cent thought it would cut unemployment. While the EEF wants a prosperous economy with high levels of pay this can only be achieved through productivity and innovation, not by statutory imposition of employment conditions. The EEF, therefore, cannot be party to a consensus in favour of a statutorily-imposed national minimum wage.

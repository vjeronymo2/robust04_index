			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT: YOU'LL HAVE TO ALTER NAME TO KEEP UP WITH JONESES;  </P> <P> LITIGATION: ORANGE COUNTY BAND SIGNS AWAY MONIKER TO BOSTON-BASED GROUP FOR A  'CONSIDERABLE' CASH SETTLEMENT.  </P> <P> In the real world, tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of Joneses can coexist  peacefully. In the rock 'n' roll world, there is room for only one.  </P> <P> For most of the 1980s, as far as anyone can tell, rock's version of the Joneses  was a raunchy guitar band hailing from Orange County.  </P> <P> But not any more. The Joneses, Anaheim branch, have been muscled aside by some  newer, upstart Joneses from Boston who have the extra clout of a major-label  recording deal.  </P> <P> After some testy legal negotiations, the Western Joneses last month signed away  their name to the Eastern Joneses in exchange for a cash settlement that  neither side would disclose. The band from Boston, which is about to release  its debut album for Atlantic Records, will continue to be the just plain  Joneses. The Anaheim group, led by founder and singer Jeff Drake, is henceforth  to be known as the Hollywood Joneses.  </P> <P> "I'm not supposed to say (how much the settlement was), but it was  considerable," Drake said Wednesday. "More money than I've seen in my life,  that's for sure. I bought a '68 Mustang, completely restored. I'm a big Mustang  fan."  </P> <P> Drake said the chain of events that led to him losing a name but gaining a car  began last fall, when he received a phone call from a lawyer in New York  representing the Joneses from Boston.  </P> <P> "He was really insulting. He said, 'Nobody's ever heard of your band, why don't  you hang it up?' At first they offered me $50, or maybe it was $500. I said,  'You've gotta be kidding.' "  </P> <P> The Boston Joneses had one big advantage in the name wrangling: They had  registered "Joneses" as a trademark with the U.S. Department of Commerce --  something their West Coast counterparts had never done.  </P> <P> The Boston band knew of no other Joneses when it registered the name, said John  M. Waxman, the group's lawyer. "We don't deny that (the Western group) used it  first, but as a matter of fact, we didn't know anything about them until I read  an advertisement in Option magazine" that had been placed by Trigon Records,  the small Los Angeles label that is releasing a new mini-album by Drake's  Joneses.  </P> <P> Drake said his Joneses would have had some strong ammunition of their own if  the name-haggling had gone to court. The Joneses had released a 1986 album,  "Keeping Up With the Joneses," on Dr. Dream Records, as well as an early '80s  EP, "Criminals." They had gone on two national tours, and had been written up  in such national music publications as Creem magazine and College Music  Journal, which once put the Joneses on its cover. The band also has received  coverage in The Times. Drake said his Joneses could have used that evidence to  support a legal claim to the name.  </P> <P> "We could have done things to really, really mess them up, but it would have  put a crimp in our style" to get involved in a lawsuit over the name, he said.  "So I decided to take the money and run." Drake said he would have preferred  renaming his band the Downtown Joneses, but the Bostonians vetoed that in  negotiations and insisted that Drake use another name he had proposed, the  Hollywood Joneses.  </P> <P> The Hollywood Joneses' new mini-album has just been released (with an off-color  title that can't be printed in full in this newspaper). First-pressing copies  bearing the old Joneses name have been stickered over with tags saying "Now the  Hollywood Joneses," Drake said. "On the next pressing they're going to change  the art work" to reflect the new name. Besides Drake, who sings and plays  guitar, the other Hollywood Joneses are drummer Mike Sessa, formerly of Ann De  Jarnett's band, bassist Mike Occhiato and guitarist Jeff Moses. Drake said the  band's first priority now is to find a manager and set up shows.  </P> <P> As for the just-plain Joneses from Boston, they are profiled in the current  issue of Musician magazine, and their debut album, "Hard," is due out shortly.  </P> <P> WHAT'S IN A NAME, PART II: Another local band playing the name game is the Wild  Cards. Maria Corvalan, co-manager of the veteran Orange County roots-rock band,  says she was taken aback to find that a band called the Wild Cards had been  booked last month to play at Peppers in Garden Grove. Those Wild Cards were a  Top-40 club band, unlike Corvalan's Wild Cards, original rock contenders who  have gained exposure through national touring, a beer company endorsement and a  1988 album, "Cool Never Cold," on Chameleon Records.  </P> <P> John McEntee, booking agent for the Top-40 Wild Cards, said the group is going  to switch rather than fight. "I think they just changed their name to Suzie and  the Knockouts," he said. As for the roots-rock Wild Cards, they recently went  through their second change of bass players in two years, with Dave Carpenter  replacing Albert Farias.  </P> <P> A HIT OUT OF THE BOX?: Record producer Jon St. James is getting excited about  the prospects of Anything Box, the techno-pop band that relocated from New  Jersey to Orange County last summer to work with St. James at his Formula One  studio in La Habra. The group's first single for Epic Records, "Living in  Oblivion," surfaced on the Billboard pop chart this week at No. 95.  </P> <P> "I haven't had a buzz like this since 'Two of Hearts,' " St. James said. That  Stacey Q song, produced by St. James, hit No. 3 on the Billboard chart in 1986.  </P> <P> Anything Box is hurrying to finish its debut album, tentatively titled "Peace."  Singer Claude S. said that the sudden upswing in the band's fortunes is  "scary," but also "really exciting. I'm getting calls from friends back East  who are telling us they're hearing it on the radio." Dania Morales and Paul  Rijnders are the trio's other members.  </P> <P> BANDSTAND ROCKS AGAIN: Orange County's biggest club venue for rock 'n' roll is  now the Bandstand in Anaheim, at least on Wednesday nights. The 1,000-capacity  club, at 1721 S. Manchester Ave., has started a series of weekly concerts  produced by promoter Joe Schultz of Positive Attractions.  </P> <P> Schultz said he will interweave shows by local hard rock bands with concerts by  nationally known headliners, including the Stray Cats, who play Feb. 28, and  Junkyard, on March 7. Next Wednesday, local acts Jimmy Richardson, Chyna and  Wisdom will appear. On most other nights, the Bandstand features local country  bands. Information: (714) 956-1410.  </P></p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Letter: British Rail - self-delusion in industrial relations Sir, So Sir Bob Reid has his revenge. No more check-off ('Rail strike looms as talks break up after eight minutes', April 15). The unions can collect their own dues. We have come a long way from the pre-Second World War days when it was the unions who organised the training for footplate men who wanted promotion, when unions helped work out fair duty rosters and promotion systems which accorded with workers' sense of fairness by taking account of seniority - 'service' - as well as of merit. And when people rather enjoyed travelling by rail. There were two ways to go from there; the German/Japanese way of formalising this kind of 'microcorporatist' union involvement, sometimes thereby sacrificing potential short-term profits in the interests of (i) the flexibility needed for long-term change, and (ii) the concern for quality (eg, caring about service to the 'customers' and whether trains run on time), which comes from high worker morale and a spirit of co-operation. The alternative is the US way based on two principles: (i) efficiency is to be defined in terms of the effect on profit and loss in the short term; (ii) the only effective work incentives are short-term, in cash and based on individual not group performance. Rigorous application of these requires total managerial control; the only good union is a dead union. British and American managers have seized on the transitional slow-down in German and Japanese growth to proclaim the bankruptcy of those countries' recipes. Self-delusion can always find evidence to sustain itself. Luckily, some leading private sector companies - eg, ICI - are wiser. But BR is still ours, subject to political decision. Parliament is about to intervene to push it further down the US road. One-nation Tories, where are you?

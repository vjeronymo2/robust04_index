			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban May 1 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]  leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi on Sunday [1 May] missed church and  was advised to stay at home because of a bout of influenza,  KwaZulu government spokesman Mr T C Memela said. Mr Buthelezi  travelled through rural areas of Zululand on Friday in cold  weather which probably led to his poor health at the weekend, Mr  Memela said. He said it was difficult to predict whether the  IFP leader would be at work on Monday, but he would probably  have time to rest because of the delayed election results from  KwaZulu/Natal.</p>

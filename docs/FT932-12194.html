			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: Keswick set for Trafalgar chair TRAFALGAR HOUSE is to hold a special board meeting next Tuesday which is expected to ratify a number of changes, including the appointment of Mr Simon Keswick as chairman. The directors of the UK construction, engineering and property group decided to delay a vote on the appointments until the day before the announcement of its interim results on Wednesday. Mr Keswick, who is to take over the helm from Mr Alan Clements, is also chairman of Hongkong Land. The Jardine Matheson-controlled property company has a 25.1 per cent stake. Mr Clements is expected to stay on as a non-executive director, replacing Sir Eric Parker as deputy chairman. Sir Eric, the former chief executive, had agreed to retire in June when he will be 60. Trafalgar has also lined up a finance director to replace Mr John Ansdell. There has been a question mark over Mr Ansdell since the Financial Review Panel forced the group to take the 1991 property write-downs through the profit and loss account and not through reserves. Mr Allan Gormly, Trafalgar's chief executive, with the help of the recently appointed independent non-executive director Sir Archibald Forster, former chief executive of Esso UK, has been seeking non-executives to beef up the board. Mr Tony Ryan, chairman and founder of GPA, the aircraft leasing group which is trying to restructure its debts, is expected to resign as a non-executive director. It is believed that Mr Keswick will decide to replace Kleinwort Benson with Robert Fleming as the group's principal merchant bank adviser. The changes are likely to be seen as Hongkong tightening its grip. Two of its directors, Mr Rodney Leach and Sir Charles Powell, have already been appointed non-executive directors of Trafalgar. However, a financier close to the group said that Mr Gormly was fully behind the proposed changes.</p>

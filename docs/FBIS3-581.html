Elias] </F>   [Text] Mmabatho March 10 SAPA -- A stayaway in  Bophuthatswana on Thursday [10 March] turned Mafikeng and a  giant shopping centre in Mmabatho into virtual ghost towns.  Central Mafikeng was quiet with few people on the pavements and  most stores closed.    Mmabatho's shopping complex Mega City had a few people  strolling in the malls but all the shops were shut. Nearby  government offices also appeared to be deserted with little sign  of activity.    The Universiy of Bophuhatswana [Unibo], where students and  police clashed on Wednesday, was also almost deserted with a few  students continuing to man the gates that were barricaded on  Wednesday. The barricades across the street at the entrance to  Unibo had been removed, and only a garbage skip, a number of  road signs and other debris remaining.    Youths had erected barricades at the entrance of Soweting  township between Mafikeng and Mmabatho and were not allowing  anyone into the area where, on Wednesday night, running battles  between youths and police were reported on Wednesday night. A  spotter plane circled the area on Thursday.</p>

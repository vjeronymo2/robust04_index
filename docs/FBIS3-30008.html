Takahiro  Yokomichi and labor leader Akira Yamagishi on Thursday [24  February] reached a broad agreement to aim at establishing a new  liberal party in the future, officials said. In an hour-long  meeting over lunch in Tokyo, Yokomichi and Yamagishi basically  agreed on efforts to unite the Social Democratic Party [SDP],  the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] and Sakigake (Harbinger)  into a democratic liberal party.    Yokomichi is widely regarded as one of the candidates to  head  the new party expected to be established some time before the  next general election. Yokomichi is also considered a  next-generation leader of the SDP, the largest among the seven  parties forming the coalition government of Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa.    Yamagishi, as head of the 8 million-strong Rengo labor  organization, reportedly played a key role in helping establish  the coalition last year.    The coalition's two propelling groups, Shinseito (Japan  Renewal Party) and the Buddhist-backed Komeito [Clean Government  Party], have called for establishing a two-party system under  the political reform legislation which introduces single-seat  constituencies for House of Representatives general elections.    But the SDP, DSP and Sakigake, opposing the two-party  system,  have favored a "moderate multiparty system."    Hosokawa, head of the Japan New Party (JNP), at first voiced  support for the multiparty system. But earlier this month he  instructed top aides to consider uniting the seven coalition  parties into one against the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in  the next general election.    Meanwhile, earlier on Thursday, coalition sources said  Yokomichi is set to return to the national stage as a leading  member of the planned new party.    The governor of Hokkaido in northern Japan met with Satsuki  Eda, head of the United Social Democratic Party (USDP) and a  cabinet minister, on Wednesday night to discuss forming a new  party that would involve a merger with the SDP, they said.    Yokomichi agreed in the meeting with Eda, director general  of  the Science and Technology Agency, to start preparations to form  the new party with the SDP as its core, they said.    Yokomichi, a former SDP member of the House of  Representatives, told Eda he is willing to run for a Diet seat  in the next general election. He has already received a  positive response to the idea of a new party from SDP Chairman  Tomiichi Murayama and its secretary general, Wataru Kubo, the  sources said.    Yokomichi met with Kubo and Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi  Takemura, leader of Sakigake (Harbinger), on February 12 and  agreed to form a united parliamentary group among the SDP, DSP  and Sakigake, they said. Yokomichi has been elected to the Diet  four times since 1969 and elected as Hokkaido governor three  times since 1983.    Yamagishi, speaking at a news conference at the Japan  National Press Club, said Japan's political parties will be  molded into three forces. Yamagishi, president of the Japanese  Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), said the three will be the  LDP, a new conservative party, and a new liberal party.    It is unlikely the seven coalition parties will merge into  one due to different views on constitutional interpretation and  Japan's international contributions, he said.    "The three polar groups will emerge in a transitional period  to pave the way for the establishment of a two-party system," he  said, adding this was the ideal goal for the future.    After returning to Sapporo, the prefectural capital of  Hokkaido, Yokomichi told reporters, "There were no such talks  about (setting up) Yokomichi New Party." But he did not deny  that there has been an idea to form a new party with himself as  an axis.    "People within and outside the SDP are thinking of forming  the new party. It's not a matter for my comment," Yokomichi  said.</p>

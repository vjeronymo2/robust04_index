			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Influx of Services Seen"] </F>   [Text] Access to the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (Gatt) is likely to make China a net importer of services,  a senior economist warns. "A consequent influx of foreign  higher-quality and lower-cost services will pose a threat to  China's international balance of payments," said Chu Xiangyin, a  professor at the University of Foreign Trade and Economics.    China signed a general agreement on trade in services as  part  of the final act of the Uruguay Round of Gatt talks in Morocco  last month.    While admitting that China will benefit somewhat from the  agreement, Chu says the challenges are demanding.    The core of the agreement on trade in services is  transparency in trade regimes, unconditional  most-favoured-nation (MFN) treatment, greater market access and  equal treatment for domestic and foreign businesses operating in  China.    All in all, China, like other signatories, will have to open  its markets wider to foreigners when the agreement takes effect  early next year.    Chu outlined three major threats to China's service  industry:    -- First, the inflow of foreigners will squeeze domestic  sectors still in their infancy. Although he did not elaborate,  it's apparent that banking is one of these sectors.    -- Second, sectors such as aviation and telecommunications  are related to State sovereignty and security, and lack the  guidance of a complete legal system.    "When there's not a complete law to regulate the operation  of  foreign transnationals, the potential threat (to State safety)  cannot be ruled out," Chu said.    -- Third, China's trade in services is still on a low level,  despite fast development over the past decade.    The service trade in China has yet to regain the form of its  heyday in the 1950s, let alone catch up with developed countries  or even some developing nations.    Chu pointed out that services accounted for a smaller  portion  of China's gross domestic product, than the average level among  developing countries for 1984, which the World Bank put at 37  per cent.    Peter Sutherland, Gatt's Director-General, said in a recent  speech in Beijing that poor availability of services, including  finance and transportation services (especially in inland  areas), is among the challenges still to be faced by China's  reforms.    But Chu also pointed to some positive factors for China's  service trade when the country gains access to Gatt.    On the one hand, he said, developed countries are seeking  opportunities to provide technical assistance to developing  countries such as China. On the other hand, foreign competition  will force domestic suppliers to improve their quality.    Moreover, while opening up its own market, China will gain  easier access to foreign markets.    He suggests that the government find ways to bolster the  country's service exports.    Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi has said China will  strive to seek a balance of payments in its service trade.    Chu also suggests that China make public regulations for its  service trade, except those that might threaten State security.    "Now, it's time for us to develop our service trade in full  swing," Chu said, adding that China should absorb what it can  from all over the world.    "But," he cautioned, "foreign services which may lead to  environmental pollution or the leakage of State secrets should  not be encouraged."</p>

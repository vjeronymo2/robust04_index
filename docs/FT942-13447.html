			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Devonport job cuts add to Tory election fears in south-west More than 500 jobs are to be lost at the Devonport naval dockyard in Plymouth over the next few months because the yard will have insufficient work after completing an overhaul of the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious. The redundancies will increase Conservative anxieties about Liberal Democrat advances in the south-west, and add to Tory backbench worries about the outcome of a review of defence costs begun last year by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary. Early indications of the review's conclusions are expected in the annual defence white paper, due to be published tomorrow. Ministers are expected to delay final decisions until after the European elections on June 9, but it is thought that more than 20,000 jobs could be at risk. Devonport Management (DML), which operates the Plymouth dockyard, has told staff job losses are likely, and a formal announcement is expected in the next month. The job losses would be likely to involve up to 400 fixed-term contract workers, as well as several hundred support staff and permanent dockyard workers. Devonport's difficulties arise because of a shortage of work on Royal Navy surface ships. When work on the Illustrious finishes this week, Devonport's only substantial surface ship work will be refitting one Royal Navy frigate and converting two frigates being sold to Pakistan. DML has told staff that it regarded winning the Navy refits of the destroyer HMS Birmingham and the frigate HMS Cornwall as a priority. But it said the tenders were unlikely to be awarded for a year, leaving it little option but to cut costs. The news comes in spite of Devonport's success last year in winning the battle to refit the Navy's entire nuclear submarine fleet. The other naval dockyard, at Rosyth, Fife, which has traditionally overhauled the Polaris fleet, lost the competition and was instead given surface fleet work. Both yards are moving towards full privatisation, having been operated under management contracts by private sector companies since 1987. The yards are expected to be sold off by 1996. The timing of the Devonport redundancies will complicate the Conservative campaign for the European elections and the local government poll on May 5. Tory support in the south-west has slumped to 27.5 per cent from 47.6 per cent at the last general election, according to a Gallup poll in today's Daily Telegraph. Support for the Liberal Democrats is put at 35.7 per cent and at 34.2 per cent for Labour. Plymouth city council is Labour-controlled but the Euro-constituency of Cornwall and Plymouth is held by the Tories. The Liberal Democrats were in second place in the last European poll, nine percentage points behind, so the seat is regarded as a Conservative marginal. Election reports, Page 9</p>

			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CREW PHOTOGRAPHS LIGHTNING STORMS;  </P> <P> ATLANTIS ASTRONAUTS REPLACE FAULTY COMPUTER  </P> <P> On their final full day in orbit, the five Atlantis astronauts encountered  their first problem when one of the orbiter's four general-purpose computers  "froze" and had to be replaced with a spare. Earlier Sunday, however, they  finally got a chance to photograph some lightning before preparing for their  landing at 12:43 p.m. today at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.  </P> <P> The computer that failed did not control any flight-critical processes but  directed the attitude of antennas and played a role in the on-board science  experiments. Within 30 minutes after the failure was discovered, those  functions were shifted over to the other three computers, and mission  specialist Mark C. Lee began replacing it.  </P> <P> The process, which involved removing a row of lockers on the shuttle mid-deck  to gain access to the computers, took about 3 1/2 hours. Another 1 1/2 hours  were required to check the computer out after it was installed. An on-board  computer has never been replaced in previous shuttle missions, but the  astronauts have practiced it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Poses No Threat  </P> <P> The failure of the computer posed no threat to the astronauts, or to the  shuttle. Commander David M. Walker and pilot Ronald J. Grabe can land using  only one computer. But it was replaced because NASA officials prefer to have  all four computers functioning during re-entry.  </P> <P> Despite the slow pace of their orbital experiments before the computer failure,  Walker said in a morning news conference that the crew had "really not relaxed.  We've worked very hard." Lee noted, however, that the workload was "not  overwhelming for a five-man crew."  </P> <P> The Magellan spacecraft, launched from Atlantis Thursday night, continued on  its near-perfect voyage to Venus Sunday, while mission specialist Mary L.  Cleave photographed some of the places visited by the 16th-Century Portuguese  navigator Ferdinand Magellan during his trip around the world.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Got Some Good Pictures'  </P> <P> To laughter from the rest of the crew, Cleave said, "We got some good pictures  of the Philippines," where Magellan died before the voyage was completed.  </P> <P> When asked about the success of the mission, Walker replied that "I'd give it a  10 on my personal scale. . . . You couldn't ask for a better flying machine  than this one."  </P> <P> Cleave, who has been studying the growth of crystals for the electronics  industry in the near-weightlessness of microgravity, also noted that, "We're  hoping to bring back some great indium crystals."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Check On-Board Systems  </P> <P> Walker and Grabe spent part of the day making certain that all on-board systems  needed for today's landing were in good working order.  </P> <P> But the highlight of the day came when the astronauts finally got the chance to  photograph some lightning storms with the payload bay camera, as well as with a  Sony camcorder that the crew has been testing. Atlantis had not passed over any  large storms on the preceding two days.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Sympathetic' Lightning  </P> <P> Sunday some expected storms over Australia did not materialize, but crew  members observed lightning over Africa. Mission specialist Norman E. Thagard  noted that he had observed some "sympathetic" lightning that began in the top  of one cloud and triggered flashes in a succession of nearby clouds.  </P> <P> The astronauts are collecting data that will eventually be used in the design  of lightning detection satellites that will be used to increase the accuracy of  storm forecasts.  </P> <P> Researchers want to learn about lightning "to be able to give data out for . .  . hazard identification, storm tracking," said meteorologist Mark Christian of  the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.  </P> <P> "We could tell where a storm is in its evolution, if it's intensifying, whether  it's starting to die, what direction it's tracking to," Christian said. "It  certainly should have impact in improved weather forecasts."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Would Aid Industry  </P> <P> Lightning forecasts would be very useful to the airline industry and groups  working outdoors, including construction crews, oil derrick workers and  operators of large cranes.  </P> <P> With the Atlantis flight winding down, NASA officials are beginning to look  ahead to future missions. The next shuttle mission will be the first  post-Challenger flight of Columbia, tentatively scheduled for the beginning of  August. It will carry a classified Department of Defense payload.  </P> <P> On Aug. 24, Voyager 2, launched in 1977, will fly by Neptune, sending back the  first pictures of that planet. In the early parts of its 12-year trip, Voyager  2 has already returned pictures of Venus, Jupiter and Saturn.  </P> <P> On Oct. 12, Atlantis will return to space carrying the Galileo probe, which  will reach Jupiter in 1995.  </P> <P> In November, Columbia will carry a communications satellite into orbit, while  the piece de resistance comes in November, when Discovery will launch the  Hubble Space Telescope, an event originally scheduled for early 1986.  </P> <P> "This is intended to be the year of the planets," said Lennard Fisk, NASA's  associate administrator for space sciences.  </P></p>

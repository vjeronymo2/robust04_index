			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> COUNCIL MAY SEEK ANTI-DRUG GRANT  </P> <P> The Oxnard City Council today will consider applying for a $220,000 grant from  the U.S. Department of Justice to establish a two-person "street level" drug  enforcement team.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, the city would be asked to contribute $107,200 to the total  project cost of $354,180.  </P> <P> The remaining $26,980 would come from asset forfeitures confiscated in police  drug raids.  </P> <P> The U.S. Department of Justice's Narcotics Control Discretionary Grant Program  provides such grants for a one-year period to help local agencies prosecute  drug offenders.  </P> <P> Although local matching funds are not required, a demonstration of commitment  from local agencies -- in the form of monetary contributions -- may be a  determining factor for federal officials deciding who will get the grants,  according to a city report.  </P> <P> The two-person drug enforcement team, which would include a demand reduction  officer and a case management clerk, would work specifically on reducing the  demand for drugs.  </P> <P> The demand reduction officer would collect and distribute information from  other narcotic enforcement teams and work with business owners to develop drug  policies in the workplace.  </P> <P> The case management clerk would work with the demand reduction officer to  establish and maintain a tracking and filing system for repeat offenders.

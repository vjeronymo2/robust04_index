			<p>BFN     [Text] Here is what Radovan Karadzic, president of the  Serbian republic, said about the end of the war and the lifting  of sanctions. Responding to our correspondent Dragan Colovic's  question as to what the end of the war and a successful  conclusion to the peace negotiations would depend on, Dr.  Karadzic said:    [Begin recording] [Karadzic] I believe that now -- as in the  past -- everything will depend on the international community.  It is clear that Yugoslavia has been destroyed not so much  because of the hostilities within it, but because of certain  needs outside of it, primarily Germany's and, lately, the United  States' need to destroy Yugoslavia and create tensions in this  area. We know for a fact that the foreign factor has been  putting off a political solution because an end to the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina did not suit it. Various interests are  involved, from the military- industrial interests of the United  States and the NATO forces, to Germany's and France's need to  create European forces, and the U.S. need to destabilize Europe  and thus postpone its unification.    If the United States has now really taken a firm stand  regarding assistance in solving the crisis, the war will end.  You have seen that both the Croats and Muslims respond with a  high degree of submission to U.S. demands. If, however,  something changes and the United States finds that it still  needs the crisis in this area, the war will go on until the main  international factors -- primarily the United States -- no  longer want it.    [Colovic] How would you comment on the latest statement by  Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev that we are closer to the  lifting of sanctions thanks to the moves of the Serbian side,  primarily the Bosnian Serbs, who -- as he said -- are a  constituent nation and equal party.    [Karadzic] I think that during the entire course of the  conference [on the Former Yugoslavia], from the beginning of the  war to the present, the Serbian side has been the most  cooperative side at every level -- humanitarian, political, and  military. We proclaimed endless unilateral cease-fires; we  simply released numerous prisoners; we accepted many political  solutions that might well have affected our vital interests.  After all, we accepted the calming of Sarajevo, the  pacification of Sarajevo; we accepted observers' missions and  separating forces throughout Bosnia- Herzegovina; to put it  succinctly, Kozyrev is finally right. The Serbian side has  invested immense efforts into ending the war and lifting the  sanctions. I hope that all this has finally reached the  consciousness of the main forces and I hope that they will be  able to present the accomplishments of the Serbian side in  former Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Serbian republic that is, as  justification for the relaxation or lifting of the sanctions,  perhaps even prior to the commencement of new negotiations. We  requested that new negotiations not be initiated before we  achieve an equal position, which presupposes either the  suspension or lifting of the sanctions.    [Colovic] However, the suspension and lifting of sanctions  presupposes the positive attitude of all those who insisted on  them the most, namely the United States. What are your  impressions after the talks with Charles Redman?    [Karadzic] I believe that we have indicated to the U.S.  envoy what our base goal is and what we must achieve at any  price. We have also opened the possibility -- after the  recognition on which we insist -- perhaps linking up with others  through various connections. We suppose that we could allow  ourselves some kind of link with the Croatian-Muslim Federation  under the condition that we be recognized in the meantime and  that we have links with Yugoslavia, although we believe that our  priority is unification with Serbia, and we shall insist on this  priority. If we are forced to temporarily give up on our main  goal, we are ready to be flexible and accept certain  intermediate solutions. [end recording]</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: UK proposes a relaunch to save treaty BRITAIN yesterday proposed to its EC partners at a meeting of foreign ministers a hard-sell campaign to recapture public support for the Maastricht treaty. The initiative was proposed in a letter from Mr John Major, the prime minister and current EC president, to EC leaders last week. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign minister, said the aim was to allay widespread public anxiety about the community. The campaign would call for more openness in the Community's managing of its affairs, minimum interference in individual states and promotion of the community's benefits to EC citizens. Despite general agreement on the importance of subsidiarity - whereby the community will not intervene in matters which can be better handled by member states - yesterday's meeting was divided about its application. Smaller states expressed misgivings about German efforts to curtail, in the name of subsidiarity, the sole right of the European Commission to draft legislation. Under the German proposal - supported in principle by Britain - the Commission would have to send legislative proposals in advance to national capitals for 'screening'. While this would not amount to a national veto, smaller states feared this could be the ultimate Anglo-German aim. Ireland voiced concern that the German proposal would 'upset the institutional balance of the EC', while Spain led a vigorous defence of the Commission - the traditional protector of the smaller states. Mr Bruce Millan, the British commissioner responsible for regional policy, said he was not surprised that member states were having difficulty in pinning down the issue of subsidiarity. 'I don't think it's a thing about which you can produce a nice neat formula  -you've got to demonstrate it in practice,' he said last night. 'If you approach it (subsidiarity) on the basis that what you are doing is important and you want the rest of the community to fall into line, then you will not respect the principle: that applies both to individual commissioners and to some of the member states,' the commissioner added. Mr Millan said he thought there was a growing groundswell of discontent in Brussels about the British presidency. 'I don't think there's any doubt that a lot of commissioners and a lot of member states have been unhappy about the reluctance of the presidency to move things forward, especially over Maastricht', Mr Millan said. In his letter, Mr Major pledged to complete parliamentary ratification of Maastricht 'before or immediately after Christmas' and he adopted a markedly positive tone toward Europe after his government's public ambivalence in the wake of the sterling crisis. He called for a political declaration at the EC summit on October 16 to remove popular misunderstandings about Maastricht. A senior EC official said: 'Britain has returned to the mainstream.' Mr Major has retreated from earlier demands for reform of the exchange rate mechanism. In his letter, however, he said it would not be 'credible' to avoid all debate on the recent monetary crisis.</p>

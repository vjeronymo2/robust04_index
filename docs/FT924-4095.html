			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / France and Germany agree on enlargement timetable GERMANY and France agreed last night that negotiations on enlarging the European Community should start at the beginning of next year and be concluded by the end of it. The clear commitment to a rapid start in the negotiations emerged from discussions in Bonn yesterday between President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl at their regular Franco-German summit. However, a senior French official warned that the negotiations could still be held up by failure to reach a compromise on the future financing of the Community, including an increase in funds for the southern member states. Mr Dieter Vogel, the German spokesman, said that the two leaders were agreed on pressing ahead with the enlargement talks as rapidly as possible. This has been a top German and British priority. Mr Jean Musitelli, the French spokesman, said the two had also discussed the current state of the Gatt trade liberalisation talks, and agreed they should not be a significant issue at the EC summit in Edinburgh summit next week. 'The problem of Gatt should not weigh down the negotiations in Edinburgh. It is not the central problem.' He said it was clear that the most complicated problem problem was now the future financing of the Community, although this was not a problem between Germany and France. The budget problem particularly concerns the southern countries of the Community led by Spain, which insist that a substantial increase in funds must be made available before there can be any start to enlargement negotiations. German officials said earlier that there had been very close and extensive co-operation between London and Bonn and London and Paris on the proposals for Edinburgh. Mr Vogel said: 'The chancellor and the president agreed that an acceptable compromise for the future financing of the EC must be found. On this question the European Council at Edinburgh must come to an acceptable solution.'</p>

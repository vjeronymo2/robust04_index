			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Germany cancels ceremony for V-2: Bonn bows to pressure on commemoration of Hitler's ballistic missile GERMANY yesterday bowed to foreign and domestic pressure by cancelling this weekend's ceremony commemorating the first wartime launch of the V-2 ballistic missile. The decision by the German aerospace industry federation came shortly after Mr Erich Riedl, parliamentary state secretary in the Bonn economics ministry, withdrew his official support for the event. The climbdown followed several days of criticism in Britain and in Germany about the planned ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of the rocket's first launching on Peenemunde on the Baltic coast. The industry federation said: 'The planned scientific-technical celebration to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the birth of space travel on October 3 will not take place.' The V-2, one of the 'wonder weapons' with which Hitler hoped to win the Second World War, was the forerunner of modern space rockets and long-range military missiles. Earlier yesterday, Mr Riedl was criticised by Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, for his decision to hold the keynote speech at the site of the Peenemunde base. Critics in Britain - the target, along with Belgium, of most V-2 firings in 1944-45 - charged that the ceremony would unnecessarily resurrect war memories. Publicity given to the commemoration has added to Anglo-German ill-feeling, already stirred by the bitterness over Britain's ignominious exit from the exchange rate mechanism a fortnight ago. Britain's tabloid and broadsheet press has given the story of the planned V-2 ceremony great prominence during the last few days. The event also drew fire from several Bonn cabinet ministers and opposition politicians. A spokeswoman for a museum in Nordhausen, east Germany, commemorating concentration camp prisoners who died helping to assemble the weapons, yesterday condemned the ceremony. The spokeswoman said that the proposed event had shown a 'lack of piety towards thousands of victims.' Before they were forced to retreat from their association with the event, the German aerospace sector and Mr Riedl himself tried to portray the October 3 ceremony purely as a celebration of technical achievement. The most famous of the Peenemunde workers was the base's second-in-command Wernher von Braun. He went on to become the chief rocket designer for the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) after it was formed in 1958. Between September 1944 and March 1945, 1,115 V-2 rockets hit Britain, of which 518 fell on London, causing 9,000 casualties. Antwerp, the rocket's other main target, received 1,341 rockets and suffered 30,000 casualties.</p>

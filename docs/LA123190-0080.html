			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTNOTES: HEY, JANE JETSON, GET A JOB!  </P> <P> Ever notice how Jane Jetson, Hanna-Barbera's well-coiffed cartoon woman of the  future, spends her time?  </P> <P> Working Woman magazine has noticed: "In 1990, when over 60% of all mothers in  the real world are in the labor force, Jane occupies her time like a  stereotypical '50s housewife -- shopping, primping and nagging her husband."  </P> <P> In consigning Jane Jetson to its Hall of Shame for cartoon females, the January  issue of Working Mother argues that reinforcing such stereotypes hurts girls  and boys alike. Too often, the magazine notes, the characters who populate  these Saturday morning staples are legions of active, individualized males and  an occasional generic female.  </P> <P> Other cartoon women who came in for criticism included Wilma Flintstone and  Betty Rubble of "The Flintstones" ("archetypal passive wives"); TV reporter  April O'Neill of "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" ("How does a competent career  woman keep getting into so much trouble"), and Janine of "Slimer! and the Real  Ghostbusters" ("a whiny, gum-cracking secretary who is always trying to shirk  her responsibilities and never participates directly in the exorcising work of  the firm.")  </P> <P> On the positive side, Working Woman praises superheroine She-Ra, who was "so  brave and tough, even the boys admired her!"  </P> <P> As for Jane Jetson, the article points out that she was created more than 25  years ago and that writers at Hanna-Barbera have tried to update her character  without sacrificing its "continuity." Their solution, in "Jetsons: The Movie,"  released last year, was to have her do volunteer work for the environment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Too Close for Comfort  </P> <P> John Keating is beginning to tire of the coincidences.  </P> <P> It was bad enough when people confused him with Charles H. Keating Jr., the  nation's most notorious former thrift owner, and thought that the bank he  heads, Encino-based Lincoln National Bank, was somehow related to Charles  Keating's scandal-plagued Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. The unwanted attention  forced the bank to shed its name earlier this year in favor of California  United Bank.  </P> <P> Now John Keating has discovered yet another coincidence. A recent arrest photo  he spotted of Charles Keating showed the former thrift executive holding up a  sign with his name and date of birth on it. Turns out the two men even share  the same birthday, Dec. 4.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suuueeee! Come and Get It!  </P> <P> The junk food that people eat on the job is enough to give the American Heart  Assn. indigestion. To help head off high blood pressure and heart disease, the  association's Greater Los Angeles Affiliate has produced a pamphlet, "Heart at  Work Guide to a Healthy Office." The guide suggests breadsticks, rice cakes or  unsalted pretzels as an alternative to high-fat chips and crackers, fruit juice  or flavored mineral water instead of sugary soft drinks and dried fruits rather  than cookies or candy.  </P> <P> The pamphlet is available free from Presto Food Products Inc. of City of  Industry.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Damian Retamozo] </F>   [Text] According to different sources, the government goal  to strengthen the National Intelligence Service (SIN) has  caused, paradoxically, the weakening, almost the dismantling, of  the country's best-qualified intelligence organization, the  Special Intelligence Group (Gein) of Dincote [Counterterrorism  Directorate].    Gein was created in mid-1989 at the initiative of Major  Benedicto Jimenez Blaco, a brilliant Dincote officer whose  obsession was to capture Abimael Guzman.    His dedication, almost romantic, to the struggle against  terrorism was known among his colleagues. Jimenez convinced  chiefs and those under him that the only way to capture the  Shining Path founder, the author of the so-called "Gonzalo  thoughts," was through the systematic use of intelligence  information.    With the support of former Dincote Director General Fernando  Reyes Roca, Benedicto Jimenez began the training of about 15  selected policemen. But it was still an improvised and not very  coherent group. Later, the new Dincote director, General John  Caro, gave the organization a real push until he made it into an  efficient intelligence organization.    Gein increased its specialized personnel to 53, and without  any doubt the best thing it did then was to locate the refuge of  Abimael Guzman on 31 January 1991. It was a house located on  Bellavista de Chacarilla Street. Police found the famous video  showing Guzman dancing to "Zorba the Greek" there, a large  amount of internal documents on the Shining Path and its main  members, and cassettes with the voice of Abimael Guzman. This  work was decisive for Guzman's capture in September 1992.    Gein reached its peak with Ketin Vidal, who took over as  Dincote chief in December 1991. The number of its special agents  went to 83. Dincote personnel talked with humor about "Benedicto  thoughts" in contrast to the Shining Path's "Gonzalo thoughts."    At the same time, Dincote operational units, the Deltas and  Divicotes, received major logistical support with  high-technology electronic equipment. Examples: small wireless  telephones that are very easy to install anywhere, highly  sensitive electronic "ears" capable of hearing and recording  conversations from 60 to 80 meters away or through walls to hear  a conversation, and photographic cameras and film equipment to  capture images in the dark.    Abimael Guzman's capture gave major popularity to Dincote  and  especially to its chief, Ketin Vidal. According to some  analysts, this situation made some prominent government members  jealous, who decided to transfer Vidal to an administrative  position in the National Police.    Later the SIN swallowed the best-qualified group in Gein.  Benedicto Jimenez and about 20 of his men joined the SIN on  orders from the authorities. Jimenez is now an instructor in  this national intelligence organization.    In this regard, a top police officer whose identity we  obviously must keep confidential said: "What happens is that  the SIN is now the organization that wants to score the points.  The SIN, which for years was not able to form a qualified  countersubversion team, now wants to improve its image, and to  do that it brought the best Dincote scorers into its ranks. The  idea is that from now on the success will be by SIN and not  Dincote.    According to the National Defense System, Dincote is  regarded as merely an operations unit. It is not in charge of  any intelligence work, but was forced to do so in view of the  fact that they needed precise intelligence information on the  Shining Path. The SIN, which was supposed to provide this  information, was unable to do so. Gein made up for this  deficiency.    The government now has ordered strengthening and giving more  importance to the SIN, headed by Division General Julio Salazar  Monroe, although many believe that the "de facto" SIN chief is  retired Captain Vladimiro Montesinos Torres.    The SIN is the main organization that collects the work  produced by its subunits: The Army Intelligence Service (SIE),  the Navy Intelligence Directorate (Dina), and the Air Force  Intelligence Directorate (Difap).    According to the established scheme, the SIN chief has the  status of a minister of state. He presides over a small cabinet  that submits a daily report containing strategic information at  a nationwide level on the military, non-military, and sectorial  areas to the president of the Republic's office. This report  includes updated socio-economic, political, and psycho-social  information.    The intelligences services subject to the Interior Ministry  (among them is the Dincote intelligence group) fall under the  Interior Ministry Intelligence General Directorate [Direccion  General de Inteligencia del Ministerio del Interior] (Digimint).    Will the strengthening of SIN harm the country?    We asked former Dincote chief Gen. John Caro, who now has  become an analyst of the terrorism phenomenon, this question.    "It might affect Dincote but not the country. Let us wait  and see. I hope that with well-trained personnel and the  modernization of its technology, SIN will do a good job. We  know that the Shining Path remains in Ene Valley, Huallaga, and  other areas of the country. In the struggle against terrorism,  precise intelligence information will always be welcome wherever  it comes from. Now we probably will have a real national  intelligence service that will be better than that provided by  Dincote in metropolitan Lima."    After consulting various sources, it can be said that  Dincote  will not be broken up or dissolved as some extremist versions  have stated.    Dincote has experienced a moderate reduction of personnel  but  at a level that does not affect its operational capacity.  Moreover, its logistical equipment has not been transferred to  other units as some have stated.    The recent arrest in Chiclayo of an important MRTA [Tupac  Amaru Revolutionary Movement] cell, including an Italian  terrorist who belongs to the terrorist group, was the result of  intelligence work by Bredet [Special Brigade of Detectives  Specialized in Terrorism]-Dincote, headed by Colonel Juan  Gonzales Sandoval.    However, aside from this operation, the number of  significant  arrests has dropped. Dincote's actions seem to have shrunk.    Gen. John Caro tries to explain: "The catch tends to drop  when many fish in the same pond have been fished. We already  have arrested between 80 and 85 percent of the leadership.  There are some 15 to 20 percent that remain to be arrested.  This does not mean that Dincote has lowered its guard. But it  is a fact that it will more difficult to arrest them now because  they are alert. The cost of each arrest, logically, will  increase because a lot more fuel, a lot more personnel are  necessary..."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 12 Apr (EFE) -- The Dominican Army  dismissed General Aurelio del Rosario Polanco on 12 April and  appointed Tommy Fernandez Alarcon to monitor communities on the  Dominican border to prevent the trafficking of fuel to Haiti.    The replacement took place after del Rosario objected to the  presence of international observers in Dominican territory.    Army Chief Major Gen. Ivan Hernandez Oleaga ordered the  dismissal. The Army has been monitoring the border area since  11 April.    Del Rosario assumed responsibility of commanding the  military  garrisons 15 days ago as the Dominican measures to strengthen  the UN-imposed embargo against the Haitian military coupists  toughened.    Hernandez is in charge of an operation to restrict the  trafficking of fuel to Haiti at the Dominican border.    The presence of Haitians in Dominican communities has  decreased since the military officer's arrival at the border,  because they fear arrest by Dominican military agents.    As fewer Haitians cross the border, Dominicans stand in long  lines to buy fuel which later will be illegally traded with  Haitians.    The Armed Forces reported this week more than 10,000  Dominican agents are guarding the border to prevent the  trafficking of fuel.    The surveillance of the Dominican-Haitian border increased  three weeks ago after the meetings Dominican President Joaquin  Balaguer held with U.S. officials.    In addition, the Dominican Government is trying to silence  an  international campaign accusing it of violating the embargo on  the neighboring country.</p>

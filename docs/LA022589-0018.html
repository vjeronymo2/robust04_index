			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PADRES SHOULD PLAY AL OPPONENTS, TOO  </P> <P> Clearly a unique team sport and acknowledged as America's pastime, I find major  league baseball lacking an obvious dimension -- regular-season inter-league  play.  </P> <P> Baseball's "weaker sisters" (NBA, NFL, NHL) all seem to understand its appeal,  but I've yet to see baseball address the issue, or for that matter, find the  media discussing the topic. In lieu of the same old schedule, the Padres could  add a home-and-home series with each American League team. Wow! Could you  imagine all those American League teams in town? The 162-game season would  still be honored but simply adjusted to accommodate its new personality.  </P> <P> Clearly, the fans would love it, and consequently the owners would benefit from  the increased attendance.  </P> <P> TONY BRADA  </P> <P> Carlsbad  </P></p>

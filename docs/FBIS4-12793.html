			<p>BFN     [Text] Marj'uyun, Lebanon, April 13 (AFP)--Four militiamen  were wounded on Wednesday [13 April] in a bomb attack on a  patrol in south Lebanon, a spokesman for Israel's proxy South  Lebanon Army (SLA) said.    Two of the SLA militiamen were in a serious condition and  were flown by helicopter to Israel, the spokesman said.    The roadside bomb exploded as the patrol was driving along  just outside Marj'uyun, the headquarters of the Israeli army and  SLA militia in south Lebanon.    It was the first such attack in four years in that area of  Israel's self-declared "security zone", a security source said.    The SLA militia has been the target of repeated bomb and  artillery attacks in recent months, claimed by anti-Israeli  guerrillas, namely the Iranian-backed Hizballah.    In March, 12 SLA militiamen were killed and 25 others  wounded  in these attacks, the heaviest toll for several years.</p>

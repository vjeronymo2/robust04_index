			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / BBC ahead of programme efficiency reforms MR PETER BROOKE, national heritage secretary, yesterday told MPs that the BBC was ahead of the programme of efficiency reforms recommended by accountants Price Waterhouse in 1990, Roland Rudd writes. The success had been reported by accountants Touche Ross, invited by the government to study the BBC's progress. Mr Brooke said: 'The very powerful incentive the BBC has for these improvements in efficiency is the ability to re-invest in programmes.' It would be premature to publish the Touche Ross report before an announcement on the level of the licence fee, he said.</p>

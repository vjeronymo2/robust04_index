			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Smith New Court warns on new accounting measures NEW ACCOUNTING standards will force investors and brokers to construct new measures to analyse corporate performance, a circular from Smith New Court, the securities house, warned yesterday. Earnings per share figures will become far more volatile and force analysts to adjust company data to analyse on-going company profits, which will make their research reports less easy to compare. Smith New Court's examination of the impact of the proposals being discussed by the Accounting Standards Board is the latest in a series of documents from analysts dealing with the issues raised. The house says proposals to abolish all but a few extraordinary items will cause profit figures to fluctuate, making earnings per share and dividend cover less important measures. Cash flow measurement will grow in importance, but it argues that the new cash flow statement, which recently became compulsory, is proving difficult to interpret. It also suggests that plans to re-introduce current cost accounting on the balance sheet deserve only low priority in an economy experiencing relatively low inflation. The proposed statement on reserve movements could divert attention from other financial statements and cause confusion, the circular says.</p>

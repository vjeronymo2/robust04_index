			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3-A BOYS  </P> <P> In another 3-A game:  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks Notre Dame 76, Rancho Alamitos 71 -- Sherman Oaks Notre Dame High  is going to the 3-A basketball semifinals for the first time.  </P> <P> "At this point in time, we didn't think they were going to give up," Coach Mick  Cady said.  </P> <P> "They had won 20 games . . . but we're still not satisfied."  </P> <P> Notre Dame (15-10) took a 27-17 first-quarter lead and was in control for much  of the game. But with 2:32 left, Rancho Alamitos completed a 10-3 run and  trimmed the Vaqueros' lead to 63-59.  </P> <P> Rancho Alamitos forward Tony Cortez, the game's leading scorer with 23 points,  fouled out less than a minute later, and that ended the Rancho Alamitos threat.  </P> <P> "(Notre Dame was) a good team," said Rancho Alamitos Coach Eric Hamamoto, whose  team finished with a 21-4 record. "They're taller, quicker and faster. But like  I told my kids, I'd take our group over their group any time.  </P> <P> "These guys are winners -- they're champions," he said. "We had kids that  started the game on the bench out there (in the fourth quarter) and it was  their guts. They never gave up." HEATHER SMALLEY  </P></p>

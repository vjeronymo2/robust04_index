			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Denmark (3): A statistical portrait - Lifestyle Life begins in an institution for the average Dane, because both parents are out to work. This is one of the most marked changes in the way the Danes live over the past 20 years, according to the 1992 edition of Living Conditions in Denmark, a statistical picture of the way they live now by the Central Bureau of Statistics and National Social Research Institute. The housewife has almost disappeared, comprising only 4 per cent of the female population by occupation today compared with 43 per cent in 1974. The labour force participation rate for women aged 16-66 is 76 per cent as against 37 per cent in 1950. In the age group 25-44 among married women, 91 per cent work, only slightly fewer than the 95 per cent of men in that age group who work. Among families with small children (aged six or less), both parents work full time in 42 per cent of the families, and in another 36 per cent one parent will have a part-time job while the other works full time. Only one in five children is cared for full-time by a parent. Some 48 per cent of all children aged two or less spend the day in a day-care institution, a figure which rises to 67 per cent for the three-to-six age-group (the normal school starting age is seven). In 1973, only 10 per cent of the youngest age-group were looked after in day-care institutions and only 32 per cent of the three-to-six age-group. Children can count themselves quite lucky to get into this world. In 1990 there was one legal abortion for every three live births: 20,600 abortions for 63,500 births. Most parents of small children are married, but about 27 per cent of children up to the age of two years live with parents who cohabit without a marriage certificate and 12 per cent live with only one parent. About one fifth of all cohabiting couples live together without a marriage certificate. Divorce is frequent, and the incidence is rising. About 28 per cent of marriages made in 1970 ended in divorce 15 years later, doubling the rate compared with those married in 1950. The rate will be even higher for those married in 1980, among whom the divorce rate was 14 per cent after five years. The fact that men do more of the chores about the house is evidently not helping much. Half the men say they do 25-50 per cent of the household chores; in 1976 only a quarter of the men claimed to do as much around the house. Most families (85 per cent) with children live in single-family houses, although only about 54 per cent of all households live in owner-occupied dwellings. They have plenty of space: more than 60 per cent live in dwellings with more than one room per person and only 10 per cent in dwellings with more than one occupant per room. Much has happened in education over the past 30 years. In 1991, 28 per cent of the 20-29 age group had passed the basic university matriculation exam ('student exam' - equivalent to A-levels in England) compared with only 5 per cent in 1962. Some 44 per cent obtained the exam-based school-leaving certificate at 16 compared with only 17 per cent in 1962. About 15 per cent of this age-group receive no further training after leaving school, down from 31 per cent in 1980. Some 63 per cent of the men and 52 per cent of the women obtain post-school education or vocational training. Among men, 58 per cent work 37-38 hours a week (the standard working week), while 26 per cent work more. About 45 per cent of women work the standard week and 10 per cent work more. Sickness absenteeism is low; 3.9 per cent among hourly paid men and 5.7 per cent among hourly paid women, falling to 1.6 per cent for men and 2.8 per cent for women in salaried positions. Use of data processing equipment at work is frequent but not yet ubiquitous. Among employees in senior or intermediate positions, half spend half their time using data equipment while just over a third never use it. A third of lower level salaried personnel and about 14 per cent of hourly paid skilled workers use data equipment. Some 76 per cent or more of those who are skilled workers or have salaried jobs say that work enables them to learn something new and to become more qualified, while about 47 per cent of unskilled workers had this view. Income distribution, as measured by calculated life-time earnings, seems to be relatively even, although the distribution of wealth remains heavily unbalanced. The richest one tenth of the population owned 63 per cent of assessed net assets in 1986 compared with 84 per cent in 1939. The poorest tenth owned 1 per cent of the wealth. Total lifetime income by occupation has become more even over the past 20 years. A law or economics graduate in 1970 could look forward to lifetime earnings which were double the earnings of a skilled worker, but today he or she can only expect to earn 130 per cent more. A teacher in the ordinary schools (children aged seven to 16) will earn about 110 per cent of a skilled worker's lifetime income. Some people remain poor, however. About 4 per cent of the population had an income of less than DKr1,000 a week in 1986 and another 5 per cent had an income of less than DKr1,500 a week. About 91 per cent of households have a colour television, 95 per cent a telephone, 88 per cent a refrigerator-freezer, 67 per cent a washing machine, 27 per cent a dishwasher, 58 per cent a car and 14 per cent a personal computer.</p>

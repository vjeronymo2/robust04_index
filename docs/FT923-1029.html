			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Spy chief charged Germany yesterday charged communist spymaster Mr Markus Wolf with spying and treason for running at least 12 agents against Bonn during the cold war, including one who brought down former Chancellor Willy Brandt, Reuter reports. Germany's constitutional court has yet to rule whether Bonn can try Mr Wolf, who headed East Germany's spy network from 1953 to 1986, since he acted within the laws of a sovereign state.</p>

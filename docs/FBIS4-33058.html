			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 31 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today, an official  source reported that some of the more than 100 people who are  occupying the Belgian ambassador's residence in the Cuban  capital refuse to leave the house despite the [words indistinct].    The source told NOTIMEX that "there is a group that remains  inflexible" in its position to request political asylum in  Belgium. This is the first indication there are opposing  opinions among the Cubans who are occupying Ambassador Paul  Vermeirsch's house.    The source added that the exact number of members of the  "inflexible" group remains unknown as of tonight, four days  after the violent takeover of the residence. He also added that  most of the people who occupied the house have maintained a  "peaceful attitude." The source pointed out that, despite this  situation, the Cuban and Belgian Governments continued to meet  during the ordeal and affirmed their determination to resolve  this situation by negotiation.    On 30 May, an exchange of talking points between the Foreign  Relations Ministries of the two countries followed a number of  meetings, during which Havana and Brussels concluded the  occupation was "illegal." The two governments rejected the  forceful occupation of the residence as a formula to negotiate  the departure of Cubans and agreed that the members of the  invading group should follow legal procedures.    It was learned in official Cuban circles on Tuesday [31 May]  that the number of occupants is 22, including "about 30 women  and 20 children." [figures as received] This figure contrasts  with that of other sources, both local and official, which  coincides with the number released by Belgian authorities of 114  persons in all: 56 men, 34 women, and 24 minors. One man, who  according to several sources left the building on his own accord  Sunday night without being challenged by the police that guard  the residence, must be subtracted from the total.    On Monday afternoon, and in front of Vermeirsch's residence,  a Cuban Government official read through a loudspeaker an  official communique urging the occupants to vacate the building  and follow the legal procedures to leave the country.    The statement, of which the press had no copies, confirmed  that the Cuban authorities will not take reprisals against those  who started the incident, a government source reported. An  official of the Foreign Ministry's International Press Center  (CPI) said officials of the Central Committee of the Communist  Party of Cuba confirmed the government position yesterday.    The source also disclosed that Ambassador Vermeirsch  notified  Cuban authorities that he had begun efforts to get the Red Cross  to provide food, personal hygiene supplies, and other  humanitarian aid for the house's occupants.    Cuba reiterated its willingness to take the necessary steps  for this aid to be delivered to the residence and for the  occupants to do the legal paperwork needed to leave the country,  the source added.    The CPI official, who transmitted the government reports and  information from the police unit in charge of protecting the  residence to reporters, said the occupants are sleeping inside  the house, on the terrace, and in the garden.</p>

Recently, our reporter visited the Xinzhonghua plant. Three  large rockets --the "Long March 4, 2-J and 3 (Class I and II)  carrier rockets, each measuring 30-40 meters in length, were  seen lying alongside in the workshop of the general assembly  plant which can be reached directly by train . These three  rockets were assembled a year ago with great efforts by several  thousand rocket experts and technical workers of the aerospace  center in Shanghai, and they will be sent to a satellite launch  center to shoulder heavy responsibilities.    The Xinzhonghua Machinery Plant is an aerospace base for  assembling large-sized rockets in Shanghai. It has successively  launched 16 man-made satellites on 12 occasions for the country.  These included China's first meteorological satellite, first  communications satellites, and first foreign satellite (China  undertakes satellite launching task for foreign countries), and  the first successful attempt to launch three satellites with one  rocket. The 12 launches were all successfully executed, thus  writing a glorious chapter in the history of China's space  technology.    The Xinzhonghua Machinery Plant also pursues the policy of  "making both military and civilian products" by manufacturing  rockets as well as freezers. So far it has sold more than 1  million freezer units for the space industry. Last year, the  plant's total output value was approximately 300,000 million  yuan, with annual profits exceeding 20 million yuan.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--As a Turkish delegation headed by Foreign  Ministry Under Secretary Ozdem Sanberk lobbied in New York to  convince Turkey's allies regarding the flushing of oil from a  Turco-Iraqi pipeline, a high-level technocrat said Ankara was  ready to foot the bill for repairing the damage to the pipeline  on the Iraqi side.    Hayrettin Uzun, who heads Turkey's state pipeline company  Botas, said Monday [6 June] that Ankara had assured Baghdad that  it would repair the damage that was caused on the Iraqi side of  the 986-kilometer (616-mile) trans-Turkey pipeline, Baghdad's  main oil export artery.    The pipeline, which has become the focal point of Turkish  diplomacy, holds an estimated 12 million barrels of crude oil.  Turkey says it has already paid for 3.8 million barrels and  would keep the rest for its own use.    The United Nations, however, says that it would incur a loss  of $80 million if it adopted Turkey's plan.    This sum was to go into a UN fund set up to compensate  victims of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.    Uzun denied any claim that Turkey had "proposed" to pay 30  percent of the flushed oil revenues to the UN Sanctions  Committee, as alleged by a Middle East Economic Survey  newsletter.    While Turkish officials voiced understanding that the three  to four million barrels owned by Iraq and any subsequent  flushings "would be fully liable to the mandatory 30 percent  contribution to the compensation fund plus other sums to offset  UN costs in Iraq," they have maintained that this is a question  that should be addressed to Iraq, not to Turkey.    Turkey closed down the oil pipeline in 1990, a few days  after  Iraq invaded Kuwait. But Turkish officials now argue that the  oil should be flushed--up to three times--to prevent  deterioration of the pipeline.    "The deterioration would not have happened if we had flushed  it when we closed down the pipeline," complained Uzun. He said  that the spoiled oil should be removed "as soon as possible" to  prevent corrosion, claiming it would be ideal if a political  decision could be made by the end of June. "If the UN leaves it  until September, it may be delayed another year. Technically,  we could start the flushing right away. We have been told that  there has been no major damage to the pipeline on the Iraqi  side, but if there has been, we have told them (the Iraqis) that  we would carry out the repairs ourselves," he said.    Uzun hinted that Iraq, which lacks sufficient government  funds and has lost its sovereignty in the Karkuk area, could not  be expected to take the necessary steps to repair the pipeline,  which lies in the northern portion of the country.    "I do not even want to think about the consequences of a  further delay in efforts to save the $2.2 billion pipeline,"  Uzun said, noting that the pipeline was covered by an insurance  policy that did not include damage caused by deterioration.  Turkey's losses over the closed pipeline are calculated to be  $1.5 billion.    "If Turkey would have had this money, it could have been  used  to initiate major projects," he added.  <H5>  Uzun: No UNSC Decision Necessary </H5>   While Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Ozdem Sanberk lobbied  in New York for a resolution on technical immunity--i.e. that  the flushing is a technical necessity rather than a breach of  the UN embargo--Uzun said that a UN Security Council resolution  may not be necessary.    "The flushing is a technical matter. It has nothing to do  with the embargo. I personally believe that a statement by the  UN secretary general might be enough," he said.    But he firmly denied that Turkey would act independently or  contrary to any UN decision. "If we had intended to do that, we  would not have waited for four rounds of talks," he said. Uzun  also brushed aside any allegations that the flushing of the  pipeline was linked to a third issue--a reference to the often  cited linkage between an extension of the mandate for the Poised  Hammer forces and the flushing of the pipeline.    "The pipeline is one of the most important issues in Turkish  foreign policy. It should be dealt with consistently, not on  and off," he said.    The Botas chief said that Turkey would either store the  flushed oil or use it for its own domestic consumption.    "It certainly will not be offered on the international  markets," he said.    But he added that the storing of the oil could be  problematic  in terms of Turkey's limited tank capacity, particularly after  the first flushing process.</p>

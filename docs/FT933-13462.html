			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / A fierce brand of consumer warfare: Procter &amp; Gamble is slashing costs as the battle for market share intensifies You need walk only a few hundred yards from Procter &amp; Gamble's imposing twin-domed Cincinnati headquarters to appreciate the market forces which have prompted the consumer products giant to announce its biggest round of job cuts and factory closures. In a Walgreens discount drug store in the centre of the Ohio city, a 12-ounce bottle of P&amp;G's bright pink Pepto-Bismol medicine, which treats stomach upsets, sells for Dollars 5.29. But on the shelf next to it, in remarkably similar packaging, is a bottle of Walgreens' own-label Soothe at the enticing price of Dollars 3.99. Lug your shopping basket a few shelves along and you will find a similar pattern repeated with P&amp;G's Tide laundry detergent and its Pampers nappies. Competition from retailers' own private-label goods and cut-price branded merchandise is causing much discomfort in the US to large household and personal products manufacturers - P&amp;G, Colgate-Palmolive and Anglo-Dutch Unilever - at a time when they are locked among themselves in a fierce battle for market share, both in North America and around the world. This intensifying competition prompted P&amp;G to announce last week that it will cut 13,000 jobs, or 12 per cent of its worldwide labour force, over the next three to four years and close about 30 factories, about 20 per cent of the total. There will be a Dollars 1.5bn charge to earnings in the year which ended in June. The aim is to drive down its costs by Dollars 500m by 1995-96 and give it the financial flexibility to combat its rivals with price cuts, such as the aggressive 15 per cent drop in US liquid laundry detergent prices it also announced last week. About half the job cuts will come from the closure of factories - some acquired during a takeover wave in the 1980s - which P&amp;G says have been made redundant by changing markets and more efficient production methods. The remainder will stem from a sweeping seven-month review of P&amp;G's work processes and organisational structure, carried out with the help of management consultants Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton. This is designed to sharply cut overhead costs as a percentage of net sales. The company is cutting out layers of management, increasing the number of staff for which each executive is responsible and simplifying many practices, such as equipment buying and customer billing. P&amp;G is not alone in its efficiency drive. Arch-rival Unilever has been consolidating its manufacturing operations in recent years, while the much smaller Colgate-Palmolive took steps two years ago to close nearly one third of its factories and shed 8 per cent of its workforce. However, the sheer scale of restructuring at P&amp;G indicates that the battle for supermarket shelf space will intensify over the next few years, particularly in the US but also in western Europe. 'I think they are saying that pricing is going to be the key component of marketing,' says Ms Bonita Austin, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, who forecasts a squeeze on smaller manufacturers and further consolidation of the industry. But the restructuring raises fresh questions about consumers' brand loyalty and the size of the price premium big manufacturers such as P&amp;G can command nowadays over cut-price rivals. Investors have been nervous about this since Philip Morris was forced to cut sharply the price of America's best-selling Marlboro cigarette earlier this year because of competition from unbranded rivals. Still, at least P&amp;G is pushing deeper into the fray from a position of strength. Over the next few weeks it will announce record 1992-93 profits (before the Dollars 1.5bn charge) of more than Dollars 2bn, up more than 10 per cent on last year, and its balance sheet is strong. The cuts, therefore, are not those of a flailing US giant, such as IBM, which has lost touch with the market-place, but rather a pre-emptive strike to prevent an erosion of its hold on consumers. The company, long-known for its toughness, product innovation and a somewhat secretive, in-bred culture, became even more aggressive in the 1980s, when mature US markets for its core laundry and household products pushed it into a two-pronged strategy: rapid global expansion and a push into new sectors offering faster growth, such as beauty care and over-the-counter medicines. This, coupled with buoyant global economies, produced extremely strong earnings growth in the late 1980s. But since 1990, the pace has slowed to an unspectacular annual average rise of just 9 per cent. Its international business, which now accounts for more than 50 per cent of revenues, is still growing strongly, with volume sales up 10 per cent in 1992-93. But profit margins internationally are lower than in the US, which P&amp;G has been relying on to fund the global push. Yet the US market has been weak, with P&amp;G's sales volume up just 1 per cent over the past year, due to recession. This has intensified competition and the temporary dislocation caused by a radical change in the group's marketing strategy to a system called 'value pricing'. Under the old system, P&amp;G ran trade promotions to boost sales, offering big but periodic discounts to retailers and wholesalers. This was inefficient, since it encouraged the buyers to stockpile discounted goods and forced P&amp;G to keep extra manufacturing capacity to handle big swings in demand. The new system, introduced on 70 per cent of P&amp;G's US products over the past two years, cuts trade promotions and uses the savings to ensure lower prices throughout the year. The change has angered some retailers, who relied on the promotions for a good part of their profits, rather than passing them on to consumers; as a result P&amp;G's market share initially suffered. However, the company insists that both its volumes and market share have begun recovering during the past six to nine months and that its 'value pricing' brands are performing significantly better than those on the old system. P&amp;G claims to have blunted the threat from private-label and cheap branded goods, which it reckons controlled 21 per cent of US markets in which it competes in the first half of this year, up just 1 per cent from a year ago. Mr Edwin Artzt, P&amp;G's chairman since 1990, argues that the recent concern over consumers' brand loyalty is exaggerated. Private-label goods, he says, have been around for a long time and will tend to gain share in a recession, when consumers are more price conscious, and lose it during a recovery. However, no one really knows whether this is so in the 1990s, or whether there has been a fundamental shift of attitude among cost-conscious western consumers in favour of own-label. Still, it is hard to argue with his second proposition: that the challenge for branded consumer products companies is to ensure that the premium they charge accurately reflects consumers' perceptions of the superior quality of their goods. Marlboro's price, which was nearly double that of cheap generic brands before the recent cuts, had got out of line with the market. P&amp;G, Mr Artzt says, does not intend to do the same. Consumer perceptions depend not only on price but also advertising, which, P&amp;G says, it plans to increase (on top of a 5 per cent worldwide rise last year), and on product innovation. Here the company's recent record has been mixed. Its strength is demonstrated by the way it has turned an obscure shampoo called Pantene into the world's top-selling brand in just three years. However, it has recently lagged Kimberly-Clark in new products in P&amp;G's most important single revenue generating segment, disposable nappies. The impact of all this on P&amp;G's profits will depend on just how much of the Dollars 500m cost-savings it has to throw into the price war. Mr Artzt, while careful to avoid predictions, says that 'we fully expect our growth rate to increase'. Some Wall Street analysts are inclined to accept that. However, there are sceptics such as Mr Gabriel Lowy of Oppenheimer &amp; Co, who says P&amp;G's earnings growth will remain at about 9 per cent, which he estimates is its annual average over the past 45 years. In other words, respectable, but hardly exciting. But whoever is proved right, the only clear winner in this war is likely to be the consumer.</p>

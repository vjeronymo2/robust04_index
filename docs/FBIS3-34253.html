			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dr. Fayiz al-Tarawinah, Jordan's ambassador in  Washington and chief delegate to the bilateral peace talks,  returned to Amman this evening for further consultations with  the government.    Dr. al-Tarawinah spoke to Salim 'Ali Dhiyab, our political  affairs correspondent:    [Begin recording] [Dhiyab] How would you assess this latest  round of talks in Washington?    [Al-Tarawinah] I am not sure I can call it that. It was not  so much the usual round of talks as one of consultations. It  was a novel approach proposed by the sponsors as a way of  injecting some flexibility. It may have also been meant to test  intentions and pave the way for another round. It concluded  Thursday [3 Febeuary] culminating two weeks of contacts between  delegation heads. Beginning 15 February, We will hold further  contacts using the same method of one-on-one sessions between  chief delegates. The next round may last two or three weeks.  The sponsors are happy with the way in which these latest  consultations were conducted. All the delegations agreed to  resume consultations on 15 February.    [Dhiyab] In this latest round, the news media was kept at  bay, and it was limited to the chief delegates. What is the  idea behind this?    [Al-Tarawinah] The news media is usually not let in on  consultations. As I said, we are talking about a test of  intentions. Each track has its own peculiarities. The Syrians  and Lebanese are addressing the principles of negotiations. We  and the Israelis have a joint agenda. We have not yet begun  discussing the items on this agenda. The latest round was an  opportunity for the chief delegates to discuss these items and  points. The Palestinians were also there to talk about issues  other than those being addressed at the ongoing negotiations in  Taba, Cairo, Davos, Paris, and other places. Their contacts are  being conducted with reference to a different agenda. As for  us, we have insisted that the agenda be respected. However, in  the absence of experts, we did not get down to details. We are  waiting for the next round of consultations to see how to  proceed in the future. We hope to be able to hold full sessions  so that the process may begin in earnest. [end recording]</p>

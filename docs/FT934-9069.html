			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Electric sector in a new light: A retailing probe revealed big losses IF IT achieved nothing else, yesterday's report from Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, highlighted the huge size of the electricity companies' losses on their high-street retailing operations - a total of Pounds 105m over the last three years. But what effect will it have on the intensely competitive electrical and electronic goods market? Neither the electricity regulator nor the Office of Fair Trading - which also looked into Dixons' allegations - found any evidence to support its claim that the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales had engaged in unfair cross-subsidisation of their retail businesses, or in anti-competitive practices. Dixons had charged that regional electricity companies helped their electrical goods retailers in a variety of ways, for example, by bearing part of their advertising and marketing costs, providing cheap accommodation, providing capital at no charge, and joint billing services. This help enabled them to increase market share by 2 percentage points to about 13 per cent, Dixons said. Prof Littlechild points out that the losses the companies are making in this business are at the expense of the shareholder, not the electricity consumer, who is protected by the official price tariff. 'Whether it is commercially sensible to incur such losses is a matter for shareholders,' he says. Most of Prof Littlechild's recommendations for clearer and more consistent accounting treatment of retail-ing operations have already been adopted by several companies. There is little more that he can do. These are non-core businesses which lie outside his direct control. But if yesterday's reports do not raise wider issues, they could have an impact by turning the spotlight on the companies' difficulties in the high street. This might hasten the retreat many are already beating from the retailing market. For example, Prof Littlechild's report looks beyond the profit-and-loss account to comment that the companies' returns on capital employed have been, on average, negative and in all cases low by the standards proposed by Dixons. Only one company, Norweb, could be described as on a strongly expansionary course in retailing. London Electricity and Swalec in south Wales have pulled out of the business, while others have decided to join forces. For example, Eastern, Southern and Midlands have formed E&amp;S Retail. A small number are still operating on their own, for example Seeboard, which has opted for building superstores. Mr John Weight, the director responsible for retailing, stressed yesterday, however, that expansion was 'measured and controlled'.</p>

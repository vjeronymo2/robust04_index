			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Risk outweighs price for Tokyo investors: What is behind the gloom on Japan's falling stock market? THE GLOOM in the Japanese financial markets deepened yesterday when equities fell sharply and the Nikkei index of leading stocks dropped through the psychologically important 21,000 level for the first time since October 1990. The Nikkei closed down 407.55 at 20,913.82, or 1.9 per cent, after having been down 636 at one stage. The Nikkei is now perilously close to the bottom of the range in which it has been trading since the collapse of the bull market in early 1990. At these levels, some leading Japanese banks, which count a portion of their unrealised stock gains as capital, will be unable to meet the capital adequacy standards set by the Bank for International Settlements. Even though the standards do not come into effect until after March 1993, the sight of well-known banks falling below the BIS grade could further undermine stock market confidence. With trading volumes low, prices are swinging about widely, often in response to computer-driven, futures-linked trading. So it would be wrong to read too much into a single day's business, especially as prices closed well off their lows. Nevertheless, there is no disguising the gloom. As one foreign fund manager in Tokyo said: 'People think shares are cheap but they don't want to take the risk of buying.' Some investors are convinced the end of the bear market must be in sight, now that it has lasted two years. They point out that even though the Japanese economy is slowing, it is growing faster than other industrialised economies. Sooner or later this growth must bring a recovery in share prices, they argue. But many others see scope for a further decline. Even those who consider the Japanese economy will eventually inspire the stock market are not expecting a rapid revival. 'People have given up hope,' said one Japanese salesman. Certainly, there has been some depressing economic news recently. Yesterday Tokyo Shoko Research, a leading credit research agency, announced that the debts of companies which went bankrupt in 1991 totalled a record Y8,149bn (Pounds 35.6bn) - four times more than for 1990. Property and stock market investors accounted for most of the largest failures. Also, according to a housing industry report, flat sales fell 44 per cent in 1991 to their lowest level since 1977. The economic outlook is not all bad. Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of Japan, insisted in a speech yesterday that although the economy was slowing faster than before, it was still firm. Recent economic figures reflected the fact that companies were adjusting their inventory levels and their rates of capital investment, he said. The power of the Japanese economy is reflected in, among other things, the yen's recent strength. The Japanese currency soared yesterday against the US dollar, with the dollar closing in Tokyo down Y4.15 at Y123.10, following a sharp rise in New York in Friday in response to intervention by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and The Bank of Japan which bought yen in large amounts. However, most investors in the Japanese stock market now have more urgent matters on their minds than the long-term competitiveness of the Japanese economy. They are more concerned about the short-term outlook for the buying and selling of shares. There is little dispute that equities are now inexpensive in terms of their value as measured by the ratio of prices to earnings. The first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange now trades at around 40 times earnings for the year to the end of March 1991. This is down to the levels of the early 1980s - before the bull market of the second half of the decade sent P/E ratios spiralling. However, many Japanese companies are expected to sell stock in the weeks before the end of their financial year in March. Some of these groups have been nursing losses since 1989 and have decided they no longer wish to pay interest and other carrying charges. Also, many non-financial companies have money invested in special funds called tokkin, which have come under increased regulatory control from the ministry of finance. Some tokkin investors prefer to sell than to conform to the ministry's new rules. Meanwhile, among financial institutions, banks have little money to spare to invest in shares: under pressure from BIS rules, they are husbanding their funds for lending to industry. Smaller financial institutions are often in a particularly weak position. Some banks have to sell equity holdings to cover losses suffered on bad debts. Some small life companies are in desperate need of raising funds to cover payments to policy holders. Japanese individuals have money to spare. But the severity of the bear market has sapped their appetite for stock at the same time as scandals last year involving securities companies have made many people wary of stock market investment. People are also scared by the sharp swings in prices of some stocks induced by futures trading. Investment trusts are being liquidated - their total assets fell last year by Y4,520bn to Y41,473bn. Foreign investors have figured prominently among the buyers in the last year. But with just 5 per cent of the market in their hands, foreign fund managers cannot lead a sustained rally on their own. Mr Peter Morgan, chief economist at the Tokyo branch of BZW, the broker owned by Barclays Bank, says there is 'fair value in the market and it will eventually be recognised'. But he adds: 'Unfortunately there are still plenty of sellers.'</p>

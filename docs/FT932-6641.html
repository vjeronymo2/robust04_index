When the offer closed on Tuesday, the intermediaries offer was 11.06 times subscribed. That means Pounds 128m of cash was chasing Pounds 11.6m of shares, one of the highest levels of oversubscription in recent intermediaries offers. On May 18 Cazenove placed 18.2m shares with institutions, representing 65 per cent of the issue. The total issue was therefore 4.3 times subscribed.</p>

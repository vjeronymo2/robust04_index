They studied and probed into the major plans for accelerating  the economic development of the region.    Wu Yongshi, president of the municipal science and  technology  association, chaired the forum.    Gao Dezhan extended greetings to the delegates before the  forum started. He said: The symposium held by the science and  technology associations of various provinces and municipalities  and Tianjin is a very good opportunity for us to learn from  others. As Tianjin's work still lags behind others in various  aspects, we should modestly listen to the opinions of the  experts and scholars from various localities.    At the forum, experts, scholars, and leading comrades from  other provinces and municipalities aired their views freely and,  from the perspective of integration of theory with practice,  offered many constructive theses on the economic advantages and  development prospects of the coastal region of the Bohai Sea;  ways of using geographical advantages to strengthen economic  cooperation and achieve common development; development of  scientific and technological advantages to create new growing  points of the economy; and ways of cooperation to open up a new  situation. The forum proceeded in a vivid, lively, and warm  atmosphere. [passage omitted]    Gao Dezhan listened attentively to the opinions of the  experts and opinions. He said: The opinions of the experts and  scholars have greatly inspired me and helped me broaden my  thoughts. I feel very thankful to the experts and scholars for  their concern about the development of the coastal region of the  Bohai Sea and the development of Tianjin. He said: The  municipal party committee and government attached great  importance to the symposium on the scientific, technological,  and economic development of the coastal region of the Bohai Sea.  Accelerating the economic development of this region is a  correct policy made at the 14th party congress after a  scientific analysis of the overall trend of China's reform,  opening up, and economic development. We shoulder heavy  responsibility to turn the region into one of the regions to by  and large achieve modernization ahead of others. Therefore, we  should cooperate to achieve common development. We sincerely  hope that other provinces and municipalities will look for more  areas where they share common interests in addition to  accelerating their own development. These areas will be the  starting points from which the development of the coastal region  of the Bohai Sea will be accelerated. Cooperation will enhance  strength and yield efficiency. Through cooperation, we should  supplement each other with our respective advantages and pursue  common development. Tianjin has three ideas for the economic  development of the coastal region of the Bohai Sea. First, we  should learn from the opening up and development of Shanghai's  Pudong new area to accelerate the opening up and development of  the new coastal areas of Tianjin. Second, Beijing, Tianjin, and  Hebei should cooperate to build a "Beijing-Tianjin large  economic ring." Third, we should expand service to facilitate  the development of the coastal region of the Bohai Sea. To  accelerate development, Tianjin should provide good service in  all fields, promote cooperation through the service, achieve  development through cooperation, learn from other provinces and  municipalities in the process of service and cooperation, and  win others' support and assistance in the process of service and  cooperation.

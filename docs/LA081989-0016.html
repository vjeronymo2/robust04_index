			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PURCHASING RAILROAD RIGHTS OF WAY FOR TRANSIT  </P> <P> I am old enough to remember riding the Red Cars from San Bernardino, and  perhaps (by a trolley connection) even from Redlands, to Los Angeles. With  their 1920's technology, they went as fast as 60 mph, if my memory is correct,  and certainly that ride outclassed the experience of driving between those  cities under present conditions. Since then, we have mindlessly allowed  automobiles to become the curse of the planet. We should seize the opportunity  to buy those ancient rights of way, and thus reduce that vast damage.  </P> <P> FRANCES WEISMILLER  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

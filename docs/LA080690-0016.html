			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SOLOMON: HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE  </P> <P> Question: I recall being told that a person's blood pressure should add up to  100 plus his age. The reason given me for this was that as a person grows  older, he needs a higher blood pressure in order for his blood to get to all  parts of his body.  </P> <P> Therefore, a 60-year-old man, for example, should have a blood pressure of 160.  Do you go along with this reasoning?  </P> <P> Answer: High blood pressure is not normal, regardless of the patient's age. If  a patient of mine had a systolic pressure of 160, I would consider ways to  reduce it, whether by pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic means.  </P> <P> Q: Does having a sore throat mean that you have a cold?  </P> <P> A: A viral illness, such as a cold or the flu, is a common cause of a sore  throat. However, Dr. Paul Cook, an expert on throat problems, says that several  conditions can account for it, including allergies, irritation due to smoking  or other environmental pollutants, and even excessive yelling.  </P></p>

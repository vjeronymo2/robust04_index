			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Industry defends use of orimulsion THE orimulsion industry yesterday hit back at suggestions that it was a 'dirty fuel', after last week's statement by the pollution inspector-ate that tougher environ-mental controls may be needed. Mr Manuel de Oliveira, the chief executive of BP Bitor, the BP-Venezuelan joint venture which is seeking to import orimulsion into the UK to be burnt by power stations, said: 'It is a fact that all present and proposed uses of orimulsion comply in every respect with current health, safety and environmental legislation.' He emphasised that orimulsion, a bitumen-based fuel, has a better environmental performance than coal. Last week, the Inspectorate of Pollution agreed to a delay in an application by National Power to burn orimulsion at power stations in Pembroke and Padiham, Lancs, saying it would require more environmental safeguards than were being proposed. 'We shall do whatever we can to assist that process,' Mr de Oliveira said. He warned that there could be no justi-fication for discriminatory action against one energy resource.</p>

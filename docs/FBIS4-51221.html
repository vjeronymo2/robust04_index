			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Duanmu Laidi (4551 2606 0171 1229)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 25 May (XINHUA) -- A national meeting to  present awards for outstanding works that publicized propaganda  directed at Taiwan was held in Beijing today.    Wang Zhaoguo, director of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs  Office, attended and spoke at the meeting. He said: The work  on publicizing propaganda directed at Taiwan is very important  in the great cause of reunifying the motherland. Major changes  have occurred on Taiwan island and in cross-strait relations in  recent years. Taiwan-related tasks are facing a new situation  and new issues, which in turn pose new and higher requirements  for the work that publicizes propaganda directed at Taiwan.    Wang Zhaoguo said: At present, the mainland has been making  very good progress in its reform and opening up. Its economy  has been developing very rapidly. Taiwan compatriots are very  interested in the situation. We should, in accordance with  Taiwan compatriots' requirements, publicize the information in  various formats to enable them to understand the mainland's  situation better so as to increase the mainland's rallying and  centripetal force.    Wang Zhaoguo added: To properly handle the work on  publicizing propaganda directed at Taiwan, we need to have a  contingent of personnel who are politically and professionally  competent with an upright work style. Leaders of Taiwan affairs  offices and news and propaganda departments at various levels  should pay attention to establishing the contingent. Comrades  engaging in tasks on publicizing propaganda directed at Taiwan  should earnestly and properly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theories on "peaceful reunification and one country and two  systems"; properly study the party's various general and special  policies toward Taiwan, and strive to improve their own  ideological and professional standards.    The competition awarded first, second, and third prizes to  80  Taiwan-related propaganda essays, to 30 Taiwan-related  propaganda books, and to 23 Taiwan-related propaganda video  programs. The meeting also commended 46 outstanding comrades  who have been industrious and who have cherished their work on  publicizing propaganda directed at Taiwan.    Leaders of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office and  other relevant departments also attended today's  award-presentation meeting.</p>

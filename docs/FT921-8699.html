			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Blast kills five in Algerian clashes FIVE people were killed in an explosion yesterday in the centre of Algiers after a gunfight with police, the Algerian news agency APS reported. The explosion occurred in the Casbah, ancient heart of the city, during a day of sporadic gunfire and skirmishes between riot police and Islamic militants. Three security force members were also wounded in the incident. There was no immediate explanation for the blast. An expected mass protest by fundamentalists against the state of emergency imposed last week did not materialise, after imams at Friday prayers had urged people to avoid confrontation. Conflict in and around the Casbah, a densely populated warren of old colonial style buildings and narrow passageways, followed a gun attack on a police guard post nearby. The area is a stronghold of the now underground Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) which had urged its supporters to 'mobilise' against the state of emergency. Yesterday's threatened confrontation was billed as the first 'test of strength' between the FIS and the authorities since the the state of emergency was declared. Algeria's military rulers took few chances. Guardsmen, supported by police, in riot gear and heavily armed, blocked approaches to city squares where the FIS had planned to hold its rally. Algerians were told repeatedly in radio broadcasts that demonstrations would not be tolerated. Many residents of Algiers stayed at home to avoid trouble. There were few, if any, episodes of stone throwing or the burning of tyres that were a feature of last Friday's clashes that helped prompt the imposition of emergency rule. Western observers believe yesterday's 'stand-off' will continue for the time being. Hundreds of FIS activists, including most of the leadership, have been arrested since the military, in mid-January, aborted a second round of voting in parliamentary elections that were certain to confirm a sweeping victory for the FIS.</p>

Rizo said the  watchword is to optimize. He insisted on the need to emphasize  tasks such as self-sufficiency [in food], health, education,  services, obtaining currency, sugar production, and others.    Rizo spoke before over 1,200 political and government  leaders  from Camaguey municipality and, in his speech, alluded to the  impact on Cuba's socioeconomic development of the  intensification of the Yankee blockade and the collapse of the  socialist bloc. He called on those present to collaborate in a  determined way to convert the current work phase into a concrete  reality.</p>

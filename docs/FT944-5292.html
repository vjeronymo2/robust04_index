			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Tory right urges rebels to back PM in VAT vote: Lilley hopes suspended MPs will soon regain party whip Tory rebels suspended from the parliamentary party for defying Mr John Major over Europe were yesterday promised powerful rightwing backing if they support the government in a crucial vote on value added tax. In a clear hint of the strength of rightwing support for rapprochement with the rebels, Mr Peter Lilley, the Eurosceptic social security secretary, said he hoped they would 'get themselves back on board as soon as possible'. He told BBC television Mr Major had no option but to withdraw the whip after the rebels abstained on a vote of confidence. But he said they could 'work themselves back into the party'. However, some of the rebels appear determined to remain outside the parliamentary party until the government bows to their demands for a referendum on further integration with the European Union. Ministers remain confident that a Labour procedural motion reopening the issue of VAT on domestic fuel will be defeated tomorrow in spite of a threatened rebellion by up to a dozen Tory backbenchers. But government whips say that the outcome may depend on the loyalty of four of the eight backbenchers from whom the whip was withdrawn. The four are Mr Tony Marlow, Mr Michael Carttiss, Mr Nicholas Winterton and Mr Richard Shepherd. Sir Richard Body, who resigned the whip voluntarily, is also a potential VAT rebel. All nine MPs who lost the party whip last week have been warned by the government whips' office that their prospects of being readmitted to the parliamentary party would be damaged by a further rebellion. However, Mr Major is coming under pressure from senior Conservatives to rehabilitate the rebels quickly to rebuild the government's majority, which was wiped out by the decision to withdraw the party whip. Some of the rebels appeared reluctant to respond to overtures from the government. Mr Marlow said: 'When and whether we have the whip back, one thing that is certain is that we are not going to take it back in ones and twos. We are all going to take it back together or not at all.' Others said their decision to rejoin the parliamentary party might depend on the government's willingness to bow to pressure for a referendum on further integration with Europe. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, told BBC television that the case for a referendum was unproven. However, Mr Lilley added to the impression that the government is moving towards conceding such a vote. 'The case against a referendum is least strong on a constitutional issue where there are divisions within parties and there is no clear divide between parties.'</p>

			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASTRONAUT, 49, DIES IN CRASH OF VINTAGE AIRCRAFT  </P> <P> Astronaut S. David Griggs, who flew on the space shuttle in 1985 and was in  training to pilot a mission in November, died Saturday when the vintage plane  he was flying slammed into a field, authorities said.  </P> <P> Jeff Carr, a NASA spokesman at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, said that  Griggs was flying a World War II North American T-6, "a vintage trainer  airplane," and that he apparently was performing aerobatics at the time of the  accident.  </P> <P> "I was told he was out here practicing this morning and was going to go to an  air show at Clarksville, Ark.," said Peter Kerwin, an investigator for the  Federal Aviation Administration who was on the scene.  </P> <P> An astronaut since August, 1979, Griggs, 49, had been undergoing training as  pilot for shuttle flight No. 33, aboard the Discovery, NASA said.  </P> <P> "Based on what we do know in our experience with shuttle crew training, we  don't see anything that would signal that we could not continue to move toward  that November launch date," Carr said.  </P> <P> The veteran pilot had more than 9,000 hours of flying time, officials said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Occurred Near Memphis  </P> <P> Lamar Coleman, a dispatcher for the Crittenden County Sheriff's Department,  said that the crash occurred south of Earle, about 20 miles west of Memphis,  Tenn.  </P> <P> Coleman said Griggs, of Portland, Ore., was flying for McNeely Charter Service,  a private air service based in Earle.  </P> <P> Carr said a replacement for Griggs would have to be named within the next week  or so, adding that it should not be a problem to draw from the pool of  available astronauts.  </P> <P> "We're five months out from flight," Carr said. "Training doesn't really begin  until about this time." Three other flights, in July, September and October,  are scheduled before the November launching.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No NASA Restrictions  </P> <P> When asked whether NASA placed any restrictions on what astronauts could do in  their own time, including risky activities, Carr replied:  </P> <P> "You can't lock these guys in their houses. These guys have thousands of hours  of flying experience. They take a greater risk driving down the Gulf Freeway in  Houston than by flying. There are no restrictions on piloting."  </P> <P> Griggs flew as a mission specialist on a shuttle mission in April, 1985, that  included Sen. Jake Garn (R-Utah).  </P> <P> He was appointed chief of the Shuttle Training Aircraft Operations Office in  January, 1976. His responsibility included operational use of the shuttle  trainer.  </P></p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of the Electricity Industry (7): New image for state monolith - France, EdF THE FRENCH state-owned power utility, Electricite de France is striving to break away from its past as a relic of central industrial control. The group's independent-minded managers are acutely conscious that EdF stands out in a world where governments are tending to withdraw from public utilities. They want to change that image, to help EdF advance in the export markets it sorely needs. After the privatisation and break-up of Britain's electricity industry, EdF is left as the only electricity monopoly in Europe responsible for all of its system, from power generation through to the distribution to customers. It is this strong central organisation, under the continued control of the Industry Ministry, which has allowed EdF to pursue a consistent pro-nuclear investment policy since France's decision to build its own nuclear energy source in the wake of the 1973 oil price crisis. This has left France today more dependent on nuclear power than any country in the world. EdF draws more than 80 per cent of its electricity from its 57 reactors, providing the cheapest electrical power of any European Community country apart from Denmark, a significant advantage for French industry. Yet the French nuclear power programme has been criticised as over-ambitious, having produced a surplus of seven to eight reactors, according to one official report. It attracts sporadic criticism from France's vocal but surprisingly disorganised environmental lobby, although not enough to cast serious doubt on France's nuclear consensus. For these and purely technical reasons, EdF does not plan to increase its proportional dependence on this source of energy, say officials. While the state has reduced its influence on EdF's decisions, as it has across France's nationalised industries, the utility's top managers are beginning to see government control - especially on pricing - as a hindrance to their bid to strengthen EdF as the EC's biggest energy exporter. EdF's cross-border energy sales rose 8 per cent last year to 46.5bn kWh or 12 per cent of the total and the group wishes to raise exports to near 20 per cent of the total by the end of the decade. At the same time, the group aims to play a significant part in the replacement of ageing reactors in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. Over the past two years, EdF has delivered a computerised reactor safety monitoring system to the Soviet Union and opened negotiations for joint ventures to build reactors in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. It also looks set to emerge in the next few months as the main foreign company to be allocated a stake in eastern Germany's electricity supply industry. The export drive is partly designed to help mop up EdF's nuclear surplus, but also to help run down the FFr226.1bn (Pounds 22.3bn) debt load that EdF has built up as a result of the nuclear programme, and to earn the cash needed to update some of the older reactors. Already, the French utility's international ambitions have caused anxiety in politically influential German coal-producing regions, worried about the threat of cheap imported nuclear electricity accelerating job losses in the mines. And in Britain, EdF's attempts to sell excess power at advantageous rates to industrial customers in France have attracted competitors' suspicion. Mr Jean Bergougnoux, EdF's managing director, points out that it is hard to persuade EC competition authorities that he is not dumping electricity when his government runs a pricing policy that squeezes EdF's profits. 'A company like EdF must have balanced accounts if it is to be perceived as a fair competitor,' he says. In theory, EdF's contract with the Paris government obliges it to hold price rises at 1.5 percentage points below the rate of inflation. Yet in practice, the government has, until recently, tended to hold rates lower than that, with the result that EdF has made losses for six out of the past 11 years. The powerful Finance Ministry argues that cheap power helps curb inflation and so supports the value of the franc, an idea which provokes the derision of Mr Pierre Delaporte, EdF's sometimes outspoken chairman. 'If we were convinced that the delay in allowing us to raise our tariffs was necessary to keep the franc safe on the international foreign exchange markets, we would gladly sacrifice on the altar of the fatherland, but we do not believe it for a moment,' he said recently. However, in February, EdF received the go-ahead to increase prices by 2.2 per cent, as against the 2.8 per cent general inflation rate forecast for 1991 - a rise greeted as 'moderate' by Mr Delaporte. Certainly, EdF is gradually beginning to look more like a commercially fair competitor than a state monolith. It is now 10 years since it last received a subsidy from the government. EdF even managed to produce a profit in 1990, partly thanks to an increase in exports and also reflecting the first fruits of a plan to cut costs by FFr1bn. Mr Bergougnoux believes that it is only a matter of time before the rigours of EC competition law force the government to give him a freer hand on prices. As he pointed out in a recent interview: 'European competition will in the end have its effect. Brussels will remind the government that the electricity market will conform to competition rules.'</p>

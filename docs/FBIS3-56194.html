			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Jan 13, BNS -- After the Estonian  legislators ruled Wednesday [12 January] that phone-tapping and  letter checks are unconstitutional, all concrete cases when  these measures were taken must be brought to light, Deputy  Speaker of the parliament Edgar Savisaar told BNS at a press  conference today.    Savisaar said that Asso Kommer, the former chief of the  Laanemaa Voluntary Infantry Company who is kept in detention,  also has the right to turn to the court, since the State Court  authorized the Defense Police to tap his phone during the  so-called Pullapaa crisis last summer.    The State Court's Constitutionality Board ruled Wednesday to  declare null and void the government decrees and the articles of  the law on amending the police law, which regulated the  procedure of applying special surveillance methods including  phone tapping and letter checks.    Centrist MP Andra Veidemann, a member of a commission  looking  into the activity of the Defense Police, told BNS at the press  conference that "the commission was familiarized with the  mechanism of phone-tapping and given information on the number  of times special surveillance methods were applied over the last  six months."    Veidemann stated that the commission was not given the  concrete materials on which the Defense Police based its  applications to the State Court.    She also said that the parliamentary Legality Commission is  drafting a surveillance law under which all Estonian citizens  have the right to inquire once a year of the Defense Police and  the Criminal Police whether their phones have been tapped and  why. The draft law gives the police the right not to reply to  such inquiries, she said.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Samsung Electronics posts fivefold rise Samsung Electronics, South Korea's largest electronics company, reported a more than fivefold rise in net earnings for the first half of 1994 due to a surge in exports of semi-conductors. Profits increased to Won285bn (Dollars 354m) from Won56bn a year earlier, while sales increased by 35 per cent to Won5,099bn. Samsung Electronics, which is the flagship of the Samsung group, is the world's biggest producer of memory semiconductor chips. Semiconductor profit margins have risen due to increased demand by the global computer industry. The earnings increase also reflects a sharp reduction in depreciation following an accounting policy change. The half-year results already exceed Samsung Electronic's 1993 profits of Won154bn and analysts estimate that earnings for 1994 will be at least Won350bn. It is also expected this year to become the first Korean company to surpass the milestone of Won10,000bn in sales. Samsung Electronics' other main businesses include consumer electronics, computers and telecommunications, but analysts believe they are barely profitable. Korea Mobile Telecom, the monopoly cellular telephone service, reported net profits up 68 per cent to Won69bn for the first half of 1994. KMT is one of the country's most profitable companies. Sales increased by 89 per cent to Won333bn due to high growth in cellular subscribers. The number of subscribers has increased by 90 per cent annually since 1988, when the service was introduced. Growth is expected to continue at the current rate because Korea still has a low diffusion rate of 2 per cent for cellular telephones, while falling prices for handsets are attracting new customers.</p>

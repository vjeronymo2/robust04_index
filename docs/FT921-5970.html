			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Tories are 'borrowing to bribe' says Labour MR NEIL KINNOCK, Labour leader, last night sought to sharpen the choice facing voters by contrasting Tory plans for 'borrowing to bribe' with Labour's commitment to 'borrowing to build'. His upbeat speech to the Welsh Labour conference in Swansea came as a poll showed the two main parties neck and neck, appearing to confirm the shift towards Labour in the past week or so. The same survey for Gallup in today's Daily Telegraph, showed a continuing rise in support for the Liberal Democrats. The week has been dominated by growing expectations that Mr John Major will use a tax-cutting Budget as the launchpad for an April election. That is still the expectation, in spite of the poll which shows Conservative support down two points at 37 per cent, half a point behind Labour on 37.5 per cent. Last week's Gallup survey gave the Tories a two-point lead. The Liberal Democrats will be buoyed by the one-point rise in their standing which, at 20 per cent, is their best showing for several months. 'While the other two parties remain stuck in their slug-it-out battle, we are beginning to reap the sustained benefits of a positive campaign based on issues not insults,' Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, said. Mr Kinnock told his audience that while Labour would invest for recovery the Tories would try to save their skins with tax cuts. Budget income tax reductions would be temporary, he warned, and would have to be paid back through higher VAT and charges in health and education. Mr Chris Patten, Tory party chairman, said Mr Kinnock's speech had failed to answer the key economic questions. 'The advent of a Kinnock government would be greeted with the popping of champagne corks in the headquarters of every overseas company which competes with British firms in world markets,' he said.

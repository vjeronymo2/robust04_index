			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE VEGETARIAN: NUTS ENLIVEN UNUSUAL CRANBERRY SAUCE  </P> <P> Once again I've stocked up on cranberries, compelled less by cravings than by  the spirit of the season, which seems to make them compulsory.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, cranberries aren't quite as versatile as other seasonal foods  such as pumpkin and sweet potatoes. For one thing, the tart pellets demand  large infusions of sugar. For another, if not simmered with care, they'll turn  bitter despite the sweetening.  </P> <P> I've yet to sample a cranberry sauce that's made me lament the berry's short  season, but this fruit and nut relish, adapted from Carole Schneider's "Fresh:  A Greenmarket Cookbook" (Panache Press/Random House), comes close.  </P> <P> FRUIT AND NUT RELISH  </P> <P> 1 cup water  </P> <P> 1 cup sugar or 3/4 cup honey  </P> <P> 1 (12-ounce) package cranberries  </P> <P> 1 cup frozen unsweetened raspberries or 1/2 pint fresh raspberries  </P> <P> 3 large navel oranges, peeled and sliced into bite-size segments  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> 1/3 cup firm plain yogurt or sour cream, optional  </P> <P> 1/2 cup whole shelled walnuts or pecans  </P> <P> Heat water and sugar in medium saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves and  mixture is smooth and well blended. Rinse cranberries in colander, discarding  any that are bruised or blemished.  </P> <P> Add cranberries to sweetened water and bring to boil. Cook, uncovered, just  until berries pop and juice thickens, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat  immediately.  </P> <P> Add orange segments and raspberries to cranberry mixture and mix well. Let  cool. Stir in yogurt, chill at least 3 hours before serving. Add walnuts just  before serving. Makes about 4 cups.  </P></p>

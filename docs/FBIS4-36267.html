			<p>BFN     [Text] The cabinet met yesterday and affirmed Lebanon's  right to confront every aggression committed by the Israeli  occupation forces.    After hearing Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri's report on the  recent Israeli attacks and the measures taken by the government  and legitimate authorities to confront these attacks, the  cabinet said that the aim of the Israeli aggressions is to split  the internal ranks and harm the homeland's unity.    The cabinet, which met under al-Hariri at the government  house, appraised the national solidarity shown against these  attacks. It heard a report from Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz  on the Foreign Ministry's contacts with the major powers and the  Security Council members to hold a session and adopt a  resolution condemning Israel.    Information Minister Michel Samahah stressed after the  session that Lebanon is calling on the United Nations to apply  international law. He said:    [Begin Samahah recording] The Lebanese Government's stand is  very clear. According to international law, the victim and the  aggressor cannot be put on the same level. Hence, we call on  the United Nations, as the cabinet clearly said in its statement  today, to apply its legitimacy, international law, and the UN  Security Council resolutions to deter Israel from committing its  aggressions, and to condemn its occupation of Lebanese  territories in the south and western al-Biqa' and its repeated  attacks -- as we saw recently, such as the piracies and  kidnappings and the attacks on the territories lands and  especially on Lebanese citizens in Lebanon's heartland. [end  recording]    On Israel's theft of Lebanese waters, Minister Samahah said:  It is no secret that Israel has coveted Lebanese waters since  its establishment. Lebanon's Foreign Ministry has raised this  issue in all the arguments over this question. The foreign  minister sent a message to the UN secretary general earlier this  week asking him to send an experts committee to inspect the  al-Litani River waters in the south.    Asked whether Prime Minister al-Hariri briefed the cabinet  on  his meeting with U.S. Ambassador Mark Hambley, Minister Samahah  said: The meeting was held as part of the Lebanese efforts and  contacts held by the president, the prime minister, the foreign  minister, and the Foreign Ministry departments to hold a  Security Council session and to adopt a stand that condemns  Israel's repeated attacks on Lebanon, especially the latest one.  We have nothing to add with regard to the U.S. stand or to that  of others.</p>

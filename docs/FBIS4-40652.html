			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian Information Agency reports that Zaure  Kadyrova, Kazakhstan's minister for the social protection of the  population, has handed in her resignation. She said the reason  for this step was that the government did not involve her in  tackling many of the painful and urgent problems, and that  proposals submitted by her ministry remained unheeded.</p>

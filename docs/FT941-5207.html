			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Technology: Bookmakers have a flutter - The betting industry is trying out computers British bookies are having a flutter with new technology in an attempt to win customers. Although the 9,800 off-course betting shops in the UK handle a substantial part of the gambling industry's Pounds 8.5bn turnover, they have been slow to become computerised. Bookmakers are not gamblers themselves and their customers are conservative. Interactive touch-screen bet vending machines are being tested in two shops run by the small Hampshire chain of Betpoint and in two of Ladbroke Racing's 2,000 shops - in Dudley, West Midlands and Newcastle. Ladbroke's financial director Paul Usher says that if they prove popular he could spend Pounds 10m 'quite easily and quite quickly' to install them throughout the country. The Betpoint customer terminal is a touch-sensitive video screen, on-line to a network of computers at the company's headquarters. The screen shows all the sports for which betting is available; the user touches a sport option to list all the relevant events. By choosing and touching, customers can get down to a list of runners in a specific race. They can even read form detail about horses, riders and trainers in race meetings. Next, they choose the type of bet and the stake. Coins or notes go into a slot and the machine prints out a betting slip. A human cashier pays out to winners. Betpoint managing director Chris Latter was a systems designer and formerly head of computer services for commodity broker Philip Brothers. He believes his customer touch-screens will cut staff and other costs. Combined with a behind-the-counter computerised settling system, which ensures accurate payout and helps the managers to assess their liabilities in real time, the Betpoint package costs Pounds 150 a week. The average betting shop in the UK turns over about Pounds 7,000 a week. Usher does not see automation as a route to cutting staff: 'We are primarily interested in improving customer service.' Ladbroke is testing a modified version of the Betpoint system in two shops. It also has a second, similar system, Form Challenge, that allows the customer to enter his own knowledge of racing into the touch-screen terminal and see a race simulation before placing a bet. Form Challenge has been developed by UK software company ISP and uses form data from CNS of Hull. It is partly aimed at attracting younger punters, who are more familiar with video screens. Bill Hagarth, IT director at William Hill, which has 1,700 shops, is cautious about luring younger customers. 'The existing bet capture and settling operation is extremely efficient,' he says. 'And we must not alienate any of our customers.' The most computerised betting organisation in the world is Britain's Tote, the body responsible for managing on-course pooled betting at race meetings. It must pay out winnings immediately, based on the total of all stakes received right up to the race start. All of its 160 off-course shops, 64 on-course shops and its 160-strong operator telephone betting service are networked to a Stratus mainframe in Wigan. It has installed optical mark readers in 1,000 betting shops. Punters mark a pre-printed multiple choice card, which the cashier feeds into the reader. Within a second the data are in Wigan. The Tote's IT manager Bob Cubitt says the organisation has dabbled with bet vending machines but again there is caution about upsetting loyal customers: 'We all want to make betting exciting and fun. The technology is there but the customer interface must be right.' Will the punters even need to go into a betting shop? Already Betpoint sells software for Pounds 20 that turns any PC with a modem running Windows into an on-line betting terminal. Macintosh and Dos versions come out this summer, as well as a hand-held console that does the same thing as a domestic television set. Technology could make betting so easy that betting shops disappear.</p>

The ship Cordillera was transporting a 180-metric ton cargo  bound for Punta Arenas, according to maritime sources. The  sources added that the ship sailed to the Malvinas after  receiving a call for services on its way to Chile from Brazil.    The Cordillera belongs to the shipping company Asmares  Naviera Chilena.    At the Falklands, called Malvinas by Argentina, it loaded 48  container-type prefabricated houses, three containers, one  truck, one backhoe, and a reservoir. The sources also noted  that the ship sailed through the British islands only by chance.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In an evaluation of back door latches in minivans (docket No. 94&hyph;70&hyph;N01), the agency conducted repeat tests of 8 latches from different minivans in accordance with the testing procedures of Standard No. 206. Those 8 latches represented vehicle sales of about 1 million vehicles in 1993. One of the tested latches failed the proposed Load Test Two requirement and another failed the proposed Load Test One requirement. All the others exceeded those load requirements, some passing by a margin of 125 percent in the Load Test Two direction and 90 percent in the Load Test One direction. The 6 complying latches represent about 50 percent (0.5 million) of the 1993 minivan sales. It is reasonable to conclude, therefore, that approximately half of the minivan fleet already meets or exceeds the requirements proposed in this notice. NHTSA has not tested the back door latch mechanisms of hatchbacks, station wagons and utility vehicles. Given the data obtained from the minivan tests, however, and considering that most of the 1.6 million sport utility vehicles have back door latch systems that are similar to those on minivans, the agency believes that about 50 percent (0.8 million) of sport utility vehicles would also meet the requirements proposed in this notice. Although many additional vehicles may also comply, the agency has conservatively assumed that all of the vehicles other than half the minivan and half the sport utility vehicle fleets may require some modification to meet the proposed requirements. That leaves the total number of affected vehicles at approximately 4.0 million. Although those vehicles could require some upgrading of their current back door locks and door retention components, these proposed amendments are expected to require not more than 1 or 2 minor to moderate changes in either latching, hinge, or locking mechanisms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In evaluating the costs of the 8 minivan latches tested, the agency compared the production costs of a failing latch and a passing latch, which were $3.87 and $2.81 respectively. Thus, the cost of the superior latch was about $1.00 less than that of the failing latch. The agency also examined the retail costs of the 8 latches tested, which ranged from $22.03 to $81.74. The costs of the 2 failing latches were $23.52 and $63.19. The tests demonstrated, therefore, that a latch that meets the requirements of Standard No. 206 need not be more expensive than one that does not. Other factors, such as design features and materials used, could significantly affect the costs of latches. Given the assumption that no more than 4.0 million vehicles may require upgrades because of the proposed requirements of this notice, and that the cost of an upgrade is not necessarily higher than the cost of current designs, NHTSA has concluded that the cost of extending the current requirements of Standard No. 206 to back doors would be minimal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed compliance tests for back door locks and door retention components typically would be conducted with similar but at times slightly modified test equipment of the type that is currently used to evaluate side door locks and retention components. Thus, no significant test equipment costs should be incurred by manufacturers. Compliance testing costs should also be similar to that for side doors, about $110.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, about 147 deaths and 740 injuries occur each year that involve occupant ejection through back doors. The amendments proposed in this notice should provide some benefits in reducing these deaths and injuries since over 80 percent of these ejection accidents involve hinge or latch damage and these components would be upgraded. However, at this time, the agency is not able to quantify these benefits or costs with sufficient precision to determine the cost effectiveness of this proposed rulemaking action. In this notice, the agency is seeking data and comments that should allow more precise estimates to be made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. E.O. 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice has not been reviewed under EO 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' The agency has considered the impact of this rulemaking action and has concluded that it is not ``significant'' under the DOT's Regulatory Policies and Procedures. Since the amendments in this notice are primarily an extension of the present passenger vehicle side door latch, hinge, and lock requirements to include the back doors of passenger motor vehicles with a GVWR of 4,536 kg (10,000 lb) or less, the agency believes that any necessary minor to moderate hardware changes can be readily incorporated into back door designs within the leadtime provided, with very little or no economic impact. Given the lack of significant industry impact and minor economic significance of this rulemaking, a Preliminary Regulator Evaluation is not considered necessary and has not been prepared.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA has considered the impacts of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify that the proposed amendments would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, the agency has not prepared a preliminary regulatory flexibility analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency believes that few, if any, motor vehicle manufacturers qualify as small businesses. Therefore, small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental units would be affected by this rulemaking only to the extent that they may pay very slightly more for the vehicles that they purchase with the qualifying back door latches and hinges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. National Environmental Policy Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking action for purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act and has determined that implementation of this action would have no significant impact on the quality of the human environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

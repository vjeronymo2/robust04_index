			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Arts: Fourth World at Ronnie Scott's THE discombobulating sounds of Brazil are in residency at Ronnie Scott's club in the shape of husband and wife team Airto Moreira and Flora Purim. It seems a curious choice for the long silly season slot, being far from mainstream and quite unconventional in line-up. As usual, Airto dances behind a flea market stall of hanging percussion, darting from Amazonian shakers to conventional bass drum and cymbal. Flora, fronting the ensemble, warbles in a seductively flat, Latin way. The group is unusual in that it uses no bass but a powerfully strummed and thrumming electric guitar (Jose Neto) and the various saxophones, flute and keyboards of talented multi-instrumentalist Gary Meek. Daughter Diana Moreira helps out on shakers in the background. The sultry sound which results, however, turns out to be wholly appropriate for steaming August nights. Moreira and Purim, based in Los Angeles since the late Sixties, are an interesting couple. Both just 50, they came to notice with Miles Davis and later Chick Corea. One of the first Latin 'percussionists', to work in a modern jazz context, Moreira along with Nana Vasconcelos, has defined a role for up-front, exotic and often complicated rhythm. On opening night, the younger Meek and Neto worked hardest at songs which were a mix of new originals and re-workings from Moreira and Purim's time with pianist Chick Corea. As Purim delivered a light Latin vocalise and her partner worked up a froth of rhythm, Meek blasted off from behind the keyboard with swinging soprano or abrasive alto. Neto, meanwhile, tested the tensile strength of strings against cuticles with a series of vigorous Latin riffs. Moreira can do as much with a tambourine as others might with a synthesiser. At Ronnie Scott's Club, 47 Frith Street, London W1, (071) 439 0747, to August 29</p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNICATIONS GAP  </P> <P> "We interrupt this program . . ."  </P> <P> Everyone has heard the tests of the emergency broadcast system on the radio  from time to time. But when it was needed most, during the Oct. 17 earthquake  in Northern California, there was not much interrupting by the emergency  network and precious little information given out to disaster victims when the  system did function.  </P> <P> Finally, two hours after the quake struck, a message from San Francisco Mayor  Art Agnos appealing for calm was broadcast. But some stations did not even  bother to tune in to the system, much less carry its information. Others said  they were getting better information from their own reporters. A major problem  seems to have been that officials had trouble gathering up-to-date information  and transmitting it via the official network, according to a review of quake  communications problems by Joel Kugelmass, a telecommunications management  analyst, in the Sacramento Bee.  </P> <P> As it turned out, the failure of EBS was not a major problem because local  radio and television stations were able to broadcast information relatively  quickly. That might not have been had the quake been stronger, or lasted a few  seconds longer.  </P> <P> Much of the early information, on an official areawide level, came from Dan  Rather interviews on CBS News with Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, who was acting  governor because Gov. George Deukmejian was in Europe at the time. McCarthy's  reports were cautious and calming, but relatively incomplete during the evening  because of difficulty in getting information from such isolated areas as  Watsonville and Santa Cruz, and even San Jose. Early Wednesday, McCarthy began  telephoning a variety of news media outlets to distribute as much authentic  information as was available.  </P> <P> As good as the broadcast news reports may have been, the problem for listeners  and viewerswas that they had no central broadcast point from which to receive  the latest, most comprehensive information from official sources. The Emergency  Broadcast System is supposed to be that central point.  </P> <P> Some local emergency communications systems seemed to work well, but they are  meant for public agencies to talk to each other. The telephone system remained  in operation and, although it was immediately overwhelmed with calls, emergency  messages were given priority and got through after some delay. The major  breakdown was in getting official information directly from the officials to  the people. "We talked to the whole world," one Oakland official said, while  another office was in constant communication with one talk radio station. But  an earthquake victim should not have to keep scanning the dial to get critical  information.  </P> <P> The emergency system is a volunteer operation supervised by the Federal  Communications Commission. The FCC presumably will evaluate the quake-night  performance and possibly make improvements. But the state of California should  not wait for that to happen. California officials must make it a priority to  have as foolproof as possible a system of emergency communications with the  public in future disasters, especially earthquakes. This must include equipment  that can go into operation quickly, by satellite transmission if necessary. It  also must have public officials available who have ready access to local,  regional, state and federal sources of information and can get it on the air  without delay.  </P> <P> As noted by Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin (D-Union City), "It's time to stop  thinking of communications as an expense and start thinking of it as an  investment in the health and safety of Californians."  </P> <P> Californians may be left in the dark during the first terrifying hours of an  earthquake disaster. But they should not be left ignorant of what is going on  as well.  </P></p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Motoring: A looker with loads of style All cars - well, almost all cars - are so good nowadays that it is perfectly sensible to choose them on their looks, size and price. There is no point worrying too much over the purely technical features: most drivers neither understand nor want to know about them. That being so, I predict a bright future for the Vauxhall Tigra coupe (an Opel on mainland Europe). This little 2+2 is so pretty that it cannot fail to turn heads. The Tigra is related closely to the Corsa hatchback and was seen first as a styling concept at last year's London Motor Show. The public responded so enthusiastically that, months (rather than years) later, it was rolling off the assembly line. The Tigra goes on sale in the UK in mid-November priced at Pounds 10,995 for the 1.4-litre and Pounds 12,995 for the better-equipped 1.6. But there is little to tell them apart; even the engine size is not indicated, to please the insurance companies and keep premiums down. The main external difference is that only the 1.6 has a standard sun-roof, larger-diameter alloy wheels with wider tyres, and body coloured bumpers. For the extra Pounds 2,000, buyers also get anti-lock brakes, twin air-bags (rather than just one for the driver), electrically-adjusted door mirrors, fog lamps, and a leather-covered steering wheel. Power steering is standard on both models. Already, the Tigra has proved a smash hit with women, and Vauxhall expects a majority of buyers to be female (as they are for the Tigra's only competitor, the Honda Civic coupe, which costs Pounds 10,900 with manual gears and Pounds 11,670 as an automatic). But when my wife and I stopped our Tigra in a dusty square near Barcelona a few weeks ago it was the men who gathered round. They admired its lines, asked how fast it went, and preened with pride when I told them it was made in Spain. So I disagree with those who take one look at the Tigra and half-dismiss it as a 'woman's car'. I see it as having a similar appeal to the old British Motor Corporation's frog-eyed Sprite, although it is light years ahead of that dreadfully crude and uncomfortable two-seater of a generation ago. Both Tigra models are entertaining to drive. Their engines combine ample pulling power at low speeds with a willingness to spin quickly, and the five-speed gearbox has a sweet shift. There is no automatic option yet but that is on the way. Which to buy? I would go for the 1.4. It rides better than the squatter-tyred 1.6; yet, on winding hill roads, it handled just as nimbly and securely. Outputs of the 1.4 and 1.6 engines are not all that far apart (90 compared with 106 horsepower), performance differences are fairly trivial, and either model should reward a sensible driver with at least 40mpg (7.06 l/100km). The small boot's capacity is doubled by folding the back seats (which Vauxhall admits are really for under-12s) and head room is restricted. Parents of young children may have trouble strapping them into the back of a Tigra. (I find fixing our grandchildren's safety seats difficult enough, even into good-sized, four-door cars.) I cannot see many Tigras being bought as sole transport for households with small children. But it must appeal strongly to men and women in their 20s - and, I suspect, to empty-nesters more than twice their age. Vauxhall's forecast of 4,000 British sales this year could be over-modest.</p>

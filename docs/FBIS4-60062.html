			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yasir Mutawalli: "Meeting Harvest Operations </F> Deadlines Is Basis for Assessing Performance of Campaign  Workers"]    [Text] The Ministry of Agriculture has announced new  guidelines which the Higher Committee has approved for the wheat  and barley harvest campaign this season to guarantee the  fulfillment of the tasks of this national campaign at the fixed  deadlines.    Announcing this to AL-THAWRAH, a source in the Ministry  explained that the new guidelines oblige owners of harvesters to  operate 18 hours daily. The guidelines also call on the central  committees in the governorates to ensure the appropriate number  of harvester drivers in order to maintain the continuity of work  during the set daily hours, and to also provide the necessary  repair and maintenance work.    The source explained that daily payments for campaign  workers  will stop on the set deadline and that any further delay in the  harvest will be without pay. The performance of campaign  workers will be assessed on the basis of meeting the deadlines.    The guidelines also oblige those concerned to ensure the  necessary means for transporting crops, such as vehicles, and to  avoid using harvesters for loading purposes since this will  waste time and affect the efficiency of the harvester.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (26): Lights are going out all over India - Electricity DAY after day, India's city-dwellers are reminded of the country's desperate need for power. In the summer months, when temperatures can soar as high as 45 degrees celsius, air-conditioners shudder to a halt, rooms are plunged into darkness, and those industries which cannot afford to run their own generators grind to a standstill for yet another power cut. Not even the Prime Minister or the usually-pampered VIPs escaped the power cuts in New Delhi this summer. Much to the embarrassment of the authorities, Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao's home was without electricity for several hours. Other residents of Delhi were deprived of power for much longer and more frequently: they showed their displeasure more visibly by beating up employees of the Delhi Electricity Supply Undertaking (DESU). Acute power shortages afflict much of urban India in the summer months. The power sector simply cannot meet the combined demands of India's industrial, agricultural and residential consumers as investment in the power sector has failed to keep pace with the country's economic development. India has installed capacity of 72,000 megawatts (MW) and the government expects to add a further 31,000MW in its 1992-97 economic plan. But even then, it estimates that by the end of 1997 shortfalls in energy will range from 9 to 21 per cent. As the government cannot afford to meet all of the country's power requirements itself, it decided in 1991 to encourage private sector participation in new power generation and distribution projects, wooing investors with an array of financial incentives. These include a five-year tax holiday on profits and lower duties for the import of power equipment. Even so, the private sector has been quite slow to sign up. The individual state governments have offered power projects amounting to more than 33,000MW in capacity to private sector companies. But, while the private investors are clearly interested in some of the proposals, they still have a number of concerns. At present, 46 coal, gas and hydro-electricity projects are being discussed, with a total capacity of 25,120MW and involving an investment of about Rs760bn (about Dollars 25bn). Among the foreign participants who have either signed agreements, or who are close to doing so, are Cogentrix and Enron Power of the US, and Siemens of Germany. Power officials have been busy with roadshows around Asia, the Middle East, the UK and the US in the hope of drumming up more overseas interest in power projects. Foreign investors have been pushing the government for additional work. The decision to turn to the private sector, however, ignores the simple fact that India has plenty of scope to improve its existing power generation and distribution system. 'Instead of investing money in new projects they should improve the efficiency of the existing plants,' says Mr Shekhar Singh, an environment expert at the Indian Institute of Public Administration, who says that 'huge' savings are possible. Some effort is being made to do this by renovating and modernising power plants and distribution systems. However, one senior official in the Ministry of Power expressed disappointment at the lack of private sector interest in such renovation projects, even though, he claims, 'investors would be putting in less money than for new projects plus they would see a higher return: there's less risk involved and less money up-front'. But as one foreign company which specialises in this area says: 'it makes considerable sense to increase the effectiveness of installed equipment; but while renovating plants will increase supply, it won't fill the gap.' Energy experts point out that India needs to do more to improve the efficiency of the distribution network provided by the SEBs. More than a fifth of transmission and distribution losses in India are due to stealing and inefficiency - a poor record by international standards. 'Electricity has been handled as a social commodity meant to be doled out in exchange for votes - it's either subsidised or free', says Mr SV Joshi, director of the power generation and distribution systems division at Siemens, India. In some states, including Tamil Nadu, farmers receive free electricity because the cost of collecting exceeds the amount due. While in a big city such as Calcutta, the private-sector Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation collects 92 per cent of its revenues within 15 days of them falling due, in the rural areas revenue collection is far more difficult to conduct. 'Twenty years ago, agriculture only consumed about 18 per cent of the power supply: today it accounts for 42 per cent of consumption,' says Mr N. Ramji, joint secretary at the Ministry of Power's Investment Promotion Cell. Most of that is used in irrigation schemes, in areas such as the Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Many slum-dwellers simply steal electricity by hooking up to overhead cables. Many of the SEBs, which are responsible for generation and distribution, have a reputation for being poorly managed, overmanned, and corrupt. The Economic Times, an Indian newspaper, recently reported that the SEB in the state of Bihar was so overstaffed with 42,000 employees that 80 per cent of its budget was spent on staff salaries. Bihar may be one of the worst examples, but officials admit privately that many of the SEBs need to improve their performance. The problem is that traditionally the public sector has been reluctant to rationalise through job-cuts, a sensitive issue. The final way in which India might improve its energy use is through conservation and the use of more energy-efficient equipment, in the home, the factory, and the field. Solar powered irrigation pumps have only recently been introduced in Rajasthan, and environmentalists are keen to see wider use of solar energy. DESU has billboard announcements and advertisements imploring people not to consume too much electricity, though the request to turn off air-conditioning in summer probably falls on deaf ears. Environmentalists argue that what is needed is a pricing system which discourages the use of electricity at peak times, and which reflects the actual cost of the electricity supply. 'Electricity is far too cheap, there are no incentives to save it' complains Mr Singh.</p>

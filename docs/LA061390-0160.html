			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> AN ANNUAL FAREWELL FOR KEILLOR  </P> <P> In what has become an annual field trip to Lake Wobegon, Garrison Keillor  extends an open invitation to radio listeners to "A Prairie Home Companion: The  4th Annual Farewell Performance."  </P> <P> Produced by Minnesota Public Radio in conjunction with KSUI-FM in Iowa City,  the show will be broadcast live Saturday from the University of Iowa on  American Public Radio.  </P> <P> This "4th Annual Farewell" stems from a tradition started on June 13, 1987,  when Keillor gave his final live performance from the World Theater in St.  Paul, Minn. Audience response prompted Keillor to return for a "Second  Farewell" at New York's Radio City Music Hall in June, 1988, and then a third  in Los Angeles in June, 1989.  </P> <P> Joining Keillor are Jean Redpath, a Scottish folk singer; mandolinist and  fiddler Peter Ostroushko; and singer Greg Brown.  </P></p>

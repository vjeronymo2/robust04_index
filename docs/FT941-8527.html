			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / French output continues slow climb French manufacturing industry arrested its decline at the end of last year but the economy faces a slow recovery after recession, according to manufacturing output and industrial production statistics announced yesterday by Insee, the national statistics office. Manufacturing output rose by 0.5 per cent in December, its second consecutive monthly increase, as a result of stronger demand for steel, construction materials and a stabilisation in consumer goods output. A sharp fall in energy output, however, which resulted from a mild December, prompted a fall of 0.7 per in industrial production during the month. The French Economy Ministry described the manufacturing output figures as encouraging. It said that the figures, which follow a number of other positive indicators, including increased production of intermediate goods and capital equipment, provided 'evidence of consolidation in economic activity.' Private sector economists were more cautious. 'There was a stabilisation in activity at the end of last year and there is some improvement in business sentiment. But there is no indication yet of a significant recovery,' said one economist at a French merchant bank. The hesitant French recovery could be bolstered, however, by a reduction in interest rates following the 0.5 percentage point cut in Germany's discount rate on Thursday. The move opens the way for the first cut in borrowing costs by the Bank of France since it gained independence last month. Many analysts expect, however, that the French central bank will wait for a reduction in the German repo rate before bringing its intervention rate, the floor for money market rates, below its current level of 6.2 per cent. 'The strategy of the French monetary authorities seems to be to maintain a slight positive differential on money market rates with respect to Germany,' said Mr Christopher Potts, economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris. As a result, it is the German repo rate which provides a stronger guide for French interest rate policy.</p>

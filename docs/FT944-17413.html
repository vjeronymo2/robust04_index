			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Toyota considers expansion at Derby Toyota, the Japanese car-maker, is considering the assembly of additional derivatives of the Carina E family car range at its Burnaston plant near Derby, Kevin Done writes. The company is expected to announce later this year that it will assemble diesel versions of the Carina range using engines imported from Japan. It is also considering the expansion of the UK-built range of saloon and hatchback cars with the addition of an estate car. Toyota is expected to add a second car range to its UK production operations in the second half of the 1990s, increasing capacity to 200,000 cars a year. Output is expected to be nearly 90,000 cars this year and to rise to about 100,000 next year. Toyota expects to sell about 110,000 Carina E cars in all versions in Europe this year, of which about 80 per cent will be built in the UK. The Japanese carmaker is facing difficult conditions in the west European car market this year with its sales falling by 4.1 per cent in the first eight months in an overall market that increased by 6 per cent.</p>

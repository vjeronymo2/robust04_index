			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Heseltine order on drugs deal AAH HOLDINGS, the UK pharmaceuticals wholesaler, is to be asked to divest part of its acquisition of the UK business of Medicopharma NV, the Dutch pharmaceuticals wholesaler, on the ground that competition has been stifled. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday instructed Sir Gordon Borrie, director-general of fair trading, to seek appropriate divestment undertakings from AAH after a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report that concluded that the merger was likely to operate against the public interest. The commission found that the acquisition made by AAH in November last year led to a reduction in competition in the Grampian and Highland regions of Scotland that was significantly greater than would have occurred if Medicopharma's UK subsidiaries had been placed in receivership. The commission did not consider that competition would be significantly affected at national level or in areas served by the other two depots of Medicopharma UK acquired by AAH  - at Weedon, Northamptonshire, and Romford, Essex  - or in the supply to hospitals, where AAH is by far the largest wholesaler. The commission recommended that AAH should be required to divest a business approximating as closely as possible to the business carried on by Medicopharma UK from its Aberdeen depot immediately before the acquisition. AAH and UniChem are the two largest UK wholesalers of pharmaceutical products, accounting for slightly more than 60 per cent of sales in 1990. AAH had 30 per cent of the market, valued at Pounds 2.84bn. Medicopharma UK was the third-largest wholesaler in 1990, accounting for 8 per cent of the market. AAH accounted for more than 70 per cent of sales of ethical drugs to hospitals by wholesalers in 1990 and about 33 per cent of total sales to hospitals, including direct sales. Medicopharma UK accounted for about 3 per cent of sales of ethicals to hospitals in 1990. Medicopharma entered the UK wholesale market in 1990 through the acquisition of two existing wholesalers, Butler, and the wholesale business of Macarthy. AAH said yesterday it was disappointed that the acquisition had been referred to the MMC but welcomed the commission's finding that there was no material effect on competition at a national level or in most of the UK. Mr Andrew Wallis, finance director, said the inquiry had delayed the integration of the Romford and Weedon warehouses into AAH's distribution network, but that could now proceed. AAH foresaw no difficulty in complying with the commission's recommendation in respect of the Aberdeen warehouse, Mr Wallis added. Mr Heseltine is making an order under the 1973 Fair Trading Act as a protective measure to guard against AAH's taking any action intended to frustrate the divestment.</p>

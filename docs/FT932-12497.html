			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Observer: Standing the heat Busy man, Lord Owen, what with sorting out battling Serbs, Bosnians, Croatians, et al, in the former Yugoslavia. But not too busy to ignore more personal business closer to home. He has joined the board of a small magazine publisher, New Crane Publishing; his wife, Debbie Owen, is also on the board. New Crane Publishing has been set up by Michael Wynn-Jones, husband of one of the UK's most famous TV cooks, Delia Smith. It is quite a cosy set-up; Smith's literary agent, coincidentally, is Debbie Owen. Wynn-Jones, whose last venture was Lloyd's Log, the now-folded bimonthly magazine, has managed to persuade the hard-nosed bosses of J Sainsbury, the UK retailer, that their customers should have their own monthly glossy magazine. Imaginatively titled Sainsbury's The Magazine, its first issue appears today. Among the journalists, photographers and cooks on the board, Lord Owen, for whom Wynn-Jones has big plans, himself 'wanted to come on the board', and will contribute his skills 'as a negotiator' and to provide 'some stability'.</p>

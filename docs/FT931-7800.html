			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Canada to act on Nafta THE Canadian government has given notice it plans to table draft legislation in parliament as early as tomorrow implementing the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. The agreement, which was signed by the US, Mexico and Canada last year, is due to be implemented on January 1 1994. Passage of the bill through parliament is likely to take several months, and should be strenuously resisted by both opposition parties. Government officials said yesterday, however, that they expected the bill to be passed in time to meet the implementation date. US, Canadian and Mexican officials are due to start talks next month on parallel agreements covering environmental and labour issues.</p>

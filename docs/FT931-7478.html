			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / US court prevents Costain coal-mining sale A MISSOURI court yesterday granted a permanent injunction preventing Costain, the UK construction group, from selling its Australian coal-mining business for Dollars 245m (Pounds 172.5m) to Altus Finance, a subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais, the French bank. Peabody, the US-based coal subsidiary of Britain's Hanson group, had asked the court to block the deal on the grounds that Costain had originally agreed to sell it the business for Dollars 200m. Both Altus and Peabody would also have assumed ADollars 120m (Pounds 57.6m) of debt. The ruling by Judge Stephen Limbaugh in the US district court in St Louis revealed that Bouygues, the large French construction group, had considered making a bid for the whole of Costain last October. Credit Lyonnais, which had been advising Bouygues, subsequently made an offer itself through Altus for Costain's Australian coal mining and property interests. Peabody argued that it had previously been given exclusive negotiating rights. Peabody said that the court's decision justified its belief that Costain had entered a binding agreement. Mr Irl Engelhardt, Peabody's chief executive, said: 'We intend to contact Costain in an attempt to reach an understanding, whereby we will be able to proceed with the purchase of their Australian coal operations.' Costain said it would need to study the judgment before making a full statement later today. It needs to sell its Australian subsidiary to reduce its large borrowings. In December it negotiated a three-year loan facility with its bankers. The deal was based upon the group receiving proceeds from the sale to Altus. It was not clear last night whether all or part of this deal will need to be renegotiated. Shareholders which previously approved the sale to Altus will now have to approve a sale to Peabody if a deal is to be done with the Hanson subsidiary. One consolation may be that the deal negotiated with Peabody in the autumn is now worth more in pounds because of sterling's devaluation. The sterling cost of Costain's borrowings will also have risen. Costain's borrowings of Pounds 344m last autumn, including Pounds 52m of loans due on the Spitalfields commercial property joint venture in London, compared with shareholders funds of Pounds 276m at the beginning of last year. Peabody operates open cast and deep coal mines in the US, and is the second largest private coal producer in the world. It has been identified by Hanson as one of the core businesses it wishes to expand.</p>

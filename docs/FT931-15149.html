			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / GPA seeks extension of waivers on borrowing GPA, the aircraft leasing group, is to ask its banks to extend temporary waivers to a potential breach of borrowing covenants because of a delay in its debt rescheduling agreement. After a meeting yesterday of its key lenders, several banks involved in the restructuring talks said there was unlikely to be an agreement on debt rescheduling and a permanent change in covenants until February at the earliest. The group had hoped that its bankers would be able to agree to defer up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) of debt repayments by mid-January. However, a GPA spokesman said its original plan did not envisage its refinancing strategy being completed until the end of the first quarter of 1993. The banks are expected to agree to the extension of the temporary waivers, although some have expressed concern that the negotiations are taking longer than expected. GPA, which has total debts of Dollars 5bn, including bank borrowings of more than Dollars 3bn, needs a two-thirds majority of the banks - measured by loans - for the borrowing changes. Negotiations between GPA and the aircraft manufacturers are continuing. The company has reached agreement to reduce its firm orders by more than Dollars 6bn, although the resulting penalties may adversely affect its results in 1993 and later years. It no longer expects to conclude talks this week. Talks with aircraft manufacturers and bankers are conditional upon reaching an agreement with shareholders to raise new equity.</p>

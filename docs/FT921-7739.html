			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / International Company News: Biochem to unveil Aids drug tests BIOCHEM PHARMA, Glaxo Holdings' main Canadian research partner, expects to disclose results of clinical testing of the new 3TC anti-Aids drug at an Amsterdam conference in July, Dr Francesco Bellini, president, said. The 3TC trials are being carried out in North America and Europe. Biochem hopes to get North American approval late in 1993. It has three main competitors: Bristol-Myers Squibb of the US, Hoffman-La Roche of Switzerland and Boehringer-Ingelheim of Germany. All aim at commercial production in 1994-1945, depending on the length of the international approval process. The 3TC compound may control the Aids virus and prolong the lives of infected people with fewer side effects than existing drugs. Biochem shareholders yesterday approved a name change from IAF Biochem. Dr Bellini said Biochem was becoming an integrated pharmaceutical group in therapeutics, diagnostics, and vaccines. It has 300 staff, including 55 scientists, and spends several million dollars a year on research. It is completing a CDollars 40m production and research centre in Montreal. It retains a 40 per cent interest in North American Vaccine (Nava), a US firm researching new bacterial vaccines. Biochem, listed in Canada and NASDAQ, now has a market capitalisation of CDollars 1.2bn (USDollars 1bn). On an operating basis it has yet to show a profit. In the first nine months of fiscal 1992, however, it posted an overall profit of CDollars 14m, or 41 cents a share, including a CDollars 17m special gain on a Nava stock issue. Revenues were Dollars 20.2m. Dr Bellini said the full year ended January 31 would show profit between CDollars 13 and CDollars 14m when the figures were announced next month. Though Biochem has about CDollars 40m in cash, it would raise more equity when markets are favourable.</p>

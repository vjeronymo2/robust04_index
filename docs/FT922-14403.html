			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Quarto at Pounds 4.1m in year of consolidation Quarto Group reported pre-tax profits slightly higher at Pounds 4.09m, against Pounds 4.06m, for 1991. Mr Laurence Orbach, chairman, said it had been a year of consolidation in difficult economic conditions. Turnover for this US-registered publishing, marketing support and production services group fell from Pounds 39m to Pounds 35m reflecting the closure of the magazine division in 1990. Mr Orbach said the move had led to improved operating margins. Earnings per share came out at 18p (17.9p) from which the board is proposing to increase the final dividend to 3.6375p for a total of 5.25p (4.875p).</p>

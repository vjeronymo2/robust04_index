			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Arts: Something stirs in the southern woods - William Packer welcomes a new sculpture park on the Sussex Downs he idea of the Sculpture Park is not exactly new. Sculpture, after all, has been an art of the out-of-doors since art began, and the principle that contemporary work in particular may be shown to advantage in a sylvan or rural setting is a modern commonplace. To think of the progress from the old London County Council's pioneering shows in Battersea Park to the present Sculpture Trails through Grizedale Forest and the Forest of Dean, and to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park at Wakefield, is to make the point. But that is not to say we have too much of a good thing. The Yorkshire Sculpture Park may now be one of the most popular cultural attractions in the entire north of England, but there is nothing yet of similar scope and permanence in the south. Whether or not the Hat Hill Sculpture Foundation at Goodwood will now supply the deficiency, we shall see. One swallow may not make a summer, and one short inaugural season hardly achieves a policy, but the initial commitment is nonetheless impressive, with Pounds 1m already raised and more to come from public and private sources. Wilfred and Jeannette Cass have been patrons and collectors of contemporary art for many years. Needing more space, they bought Hat Hill Copse four years ago, a modern house standing in some 20 acres of woodland on the southern slopes of the Sussex Downs, close to Goodwood House. Their foundation sprang from that move. It was set up in 1991 as a registered charity. Now it has a newly-built education centre and gallery, a state-of-the-art electronic archive, a resident curator. Rides and walks have been cut through the forest, clearings cleared, sculptures begged, borrowed or commissioned. It is a brave undertaking indeed and, for the moment, beyond criticism. The stated aims are unexceptionable - 'to promote the understanding, enjoyment and development of contemporary sculpture; to support artists and designers; to act as a catalyst and focus for siting sculpture in the open air.' We may boggle a bit at the thought of the focused catalyst, or perhaps it is a catalytic focus. A question or two are begged - does contemporary sculpture really need such specially promoted understanding and enjoyment: such focused siting? But it all boils down to Good Works, and good luck to them. It looks very new, the paths still rather bright and unweathered, the turf new-laid, the tracks and rides still a little stark. Nature will recruit herself soon enough and, in a second season, all will seem long established. But, in the copse's wilder parts, are not some of the set sites for sculpture now just a little too well-cleared and fixed? We hear of these grounds having been specially landscaped to the purpose, yet it is always hard to get these things right first time. Just as in moving into a new house, might it not have been wiser to leave the pattern of use to declare itself by degrees over a year or two, as different shows and new works reveal fresh aspects of the woods themselves? Certainly, for the moment, the better sitings are either those in the older, more open and formal parts of the garden - such as Nigel Hall's 'Soglio' - a huge wedge and circle of rusted steel, or those more secret and discreet within the woods. In this latter respect, William Turnbull's totemic 'Spade Venus', Peter Randall-Page's carved limestone lumps, Andy Goldsworthy's 'Herd of Arches' that prances through the wood beside the path, and David Nash's tall and black 'Charred Column', are all shown to particular advantage. It is a profound irritation, by the way, that while a map, and not the most accurate, is provided, the works themselves are neither numbered nor labelled, which can confuse and frustrate even the most experienced of visitors. We are promised, in coming seasons, a programme of temporary exhibitions and a changing display of particular works, as loans are replaced and sales made. This first show consists of some 40 works by some 30 sculptors. There is no theme to it, nor is it a survey in any real sense: rather it is simply a slice cut from the larger cake, and none the worse for that. It offers work across the full range of current activity, from the figurative to the abstract, from carving and modelling to construction and assemblage, from the symbolic and totemic to the minimal and the conceptual. Stephen Cox, Phillip King, Paul Neagu, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Grenville Davey, Anthony Caro, Michael Sandle, Bill Woodrow and Tony Cragg are among the established sculptors represented. Less familiar artists, too, are given their chance, while many distinguished names are conspicuously absent. So be it, for the roll-call for once is not the point. The immediate purpose of 'Sculpture at Goodwood' is to demonstrate an opportunity and propose possibilities for the future. Mr and Mrs Cass are certainly to be congratulated on their initiative, and their Hat Hill Sculpture Foundation offered a real if cautious welcome.

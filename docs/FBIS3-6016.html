			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 14 KYODO -- U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher ended three days of difficult talks with  China's leadership Monday [14 March], taking with him several  promises of cooperation in human rights.    "I came to China to try to ensure that the Chinese side  understands the importance of human rights to the United States  in connection with the most favored nation (MFN) treatment,"  Christopher told reporters after a final meeting with Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen.    The high-level talks have been marked by China's point-blank  refusal to accept any linkage between human rights and trade.  It regards calls for progress in human rights as interference  in its internal affairs.    The May 1993 executive order on China trade issued by U.S.  President Bill Clinton has linked the renewal of MFN in June  with "overall significant progress" on seven issues concerning  human rights. Billions of dollars in trade is at stake.    During his trip, Christopher received a dressing down from  both President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng on China's  inflexibility over human rights issues. They made clear that  China is ready to go on without MFN.    Despite the difficult meetings, Christopher characterized  his  final talk with Qian as better than before and listed five areas  where China has promised to cooperate.    The two sides signed a statement of cooperation specifying a  method to form "concrete assurances" that China is complying to  a 1992 agreement concerning prison labor and which was specified  in the executive order.    The Chinese side also agreed "to work to resolve the few  remaining outstanding emigration matters," Christopher said.    Implementation of the prison labor agreement and the  emigration problems represent the "two measurable conditions" in  Clinton's executive order.    The remaining five are considered "nonmeasurable" and call  for significant progress in areas including the release and  accounting for political prisoners, humane prison treatment and  protection of Tibetan religious and cultural traditions.    Christopher said the Chinese side handed over a "detailed  accounting" on 235 political prisoners and is preparing  information on 106 Tibetan prisoners.    China would also review interference in the broadcast signal  of the Voice of America and will soon continue talks with the  International Red Cross on prison visits while confirming its  support of the UN Universal Declaration on Human Rights, he said.    Christopher said he urged Chinese authorities to free  political prisoners as well as begin dialogue with the Dalai  Lama, Tibet's exiled religious leader.    In a contrast characterizing the tone of the meetings,  China's foreign minister chose several different areas of  agreement as the main emphasis of the visit.    Qian said the two sides agreed to continue high-level  meetings with Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation  Wu Yi. He said Song Jian, minister of the State Science and  Technology Commission, will visit the U.S. in April.    The U.S. agreed to continue its support for China's entry to  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Qian said the two  countries would hold bilateral meetings on defense conversion  this spring.    Qian also mentioned the statement on prison labor and said  China had agreed to help the U.S. try and locate several  soldiers believed to have gone missing in action during the  Vietnam War.    "I wouldn't describe it as a breakthrough," Christopher  said.  "It was a business-like and productive meeting, we began to  narrow the differences."    Christopher also met with the U.S. business community in  Beijing Sunday morning, with businessmen overwhelmingly calling  for the renewal of unconditional MFN.    Tens of billions of dollars of bilateral trade are at stake  if renewal is not granted.    The visit began in a tense atmosphere as Chinese police  rounded up several of China's best-known dissidents in an  apparent attempt at prevent activists from contacting the  secretary.    Christopher was to fly to Vladisvostock Monday to meet  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev.</p>

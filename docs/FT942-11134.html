			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of Madeira (2): Asia and Brazil targeted - Dominick Coyle on progress at the industrial free trade zone According to Mr Alberto Joao Jardim, president of the regional government, Madeira has a current unemployment rate of around 4 per cent. But definitions are important. It may well be that only four in every 100 of the island's estimated total workforce of more than 118,000 have no job, but that does not cover people in training for jobs which may not be there, and certainly does not include the considerable underemployment in the declining agricultural sector. Getting on for one-fifth of Madeira's labour force is engaged in agriculture, most of them working minuscule plots for mere subsistence. The traditional sugar industry is finished and banana growers are meeting tough competition from lower-priced producers elsewhere. Madeira's traditional cottage industries of embroidery, tapestry and wickerwork are just that, painstakingly-made and beautiful products of family cottages or very small units with a predominant female workforce. These underemployed, highly skilled workers, and many more equally skilled but with no work, need jobs as the island's economy is transformed away from agriculture and towards industry and the services sector, most noticeably, of course, tourism. An important role in this transformation, according to the regional government, will be played by the Madeira Development Company and, in particular, its Industrial Free Trade Zone. The magnet to attract companies to Madeira is a generous package of fiscal concessions, start-up grants and worker training subsidies all wrapped round the island's full membership of the European Union through the motherland, Portugal. Mr Jose Antonio Camara, who represents the regional government's 25 per cent stake in the Madeira development company, points to the island's full membership in, and consequent access to, the European Union as one of the zone's major attractions to non-EU companies seeking to manufacture for the European market, but he is by no means a one-ticket salesman. The zone's other attractions, he emphasises, include the benefit of access to all double taxation treaties ratified by Portugal, total exemption from any form of taxation until the year 2011, potential benefits from various EU structural funds to help with financing projects and with the training of workers, a stable political system and an excellent year-round climate and, not unimportantly, low operational costs. There are, he agrees, some drawbacks, not least transportation costs, since Madeira is an island out in the Atlantic almost 1,000km from the Portuguese coast. There are twice-weekly cargo sailings between Lisbon and Madeira, and less frequent services between the island and London, Rotterdam, Bremen, Antwerp, and also to New York, but container charges are high; the aim of Mr Camara and his team is to trim costs at the new port now being completed to service the freeport zone directly. The industrial complex itself is located on a 130-hectare site at Canical on the eastern end of Madeira, some 8km from the international airport. It is securely fenced off and is being developed in stages. Each site or unit has direct access to all basic infrastructure, including energy supply, telecommunications, water and sewerage, and the supporting port facilities include a terminal for discharging liquids and cereals by suction, together with berthing facilities for both general cargo and containers. The initial development phase of the zone is now complete with 29 operating entities, while a further 12 companies are awaiting completion of their registration and licence procedures. Manufacturing and warehousing activities under way include clothing, computers, watch-making, paper products, tobacco, household appliances, optics, canning, jewellery and petroleum products. One of the first companies to take up residence in the zone is a garments manufacturer. Sheenotto Industries is a Macau-Hong Kong joint venture, most of whose output is pre-sold to the US. Its resident director, Mr Rui Alberto Santos, himself a Madeiran, speaks glowingly of the skills and adaptability of local workers, many of whom came from the island's craft industries. Sheenotto recruits are put through an intensive eight-month training programme, the cost of which is grant-aided up to 50 per cent. On the completion of their training, workers do not have to pay any social security contributions until they are 22 years of age, although they are covered for benefits. Local labour laws, which apply equally in the industrial zone, permit short-term labour contracts of six months' duration, renewable at the employer's option up to a limit of three years - after which workers are either made permanent, or are dismissed. Mr Santos, whose company employs over 150 people, is impressed with the zone's facilities and with the enterprise and support of the development company, but like Mr Camara, he points to heavy shipping costs and says these will have to be reduced if the promotion of the zone is not to be undermined. His company currently exports through Funchal. Promotion for the industrial zone is being narrowly targeted, not least because of a limited budget, and the focus is very much on south-east Asia and on countries with which Portugal has traditional ties, including Brazil and South Africa, where the development company maintains offices or representative agents. Brazilian companies form a good slice of the initial tenants of the zone. All tax concessions applicable within the legal framework of the International Business Centre, the umbrella organisation covering the industrial zone, the offshore financial centre and the international services division, also apply to the new International Shipping Register (MAR). Specifically, the crews of MAR-registered vessels get their wages tax-exempt and are not subject to Portuguese social security deductions. What is less specific are the prerequisites on crew nationality. The enabling legislation appears to be clear-cut: 'The captain and 50 per cent of the crew of each registered ship should be citizens of any of the member-states of the European Union,' itself a major concession by the labour unions which initially insisted on half of all crews being Portuguese nationals. This dispute has held up the operational launch of MAR, but an uneasy compromise has been reached with the unions and Brussels. This gives MAR's Technical Commission flexibility in agreeing crew composition and nationality with vessel owners 'under special circumstances'. However, owners of registered yachts have no restrictions on crews, but they do benefit from all the fiscal and other concessions on offer, including the absence of any exchange controls. Overall, not a bad deal, and a great deal better than Portugal's traditional shipping register.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Rosebys floated with Pounds 21.3m tag ROSEBYS, the curtain and linen stores group owned by Cattle's (Holdings), yesterday became the first retailer to seek a public listing for more than two years. Shares in the company will begin trading on Monday following a placing by County NatWest of 10.2m new and existing shares with institutions at 115p. The placing price gives Rosebys a market capitalisation of Pounds 21.3m. Cattle's, the financial services group, will retain about 45 per cent of Rosebys' enlarged share capital. Mr Michael Rosenblatt, vice chairman, said margins had improved 20 per cent since 1988, partly due to sourcing from overseas. With wage and rental costs coming down, further savings were hoped for this year. Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 1.46m to Pounds 2.17m last year, while turnover rose slightly to Pounds 42.8m (Pounds 40.9m). The placing price puts the shares on a p/e of 12.9 from earnings per share of 8.9p last year. This compares to a multiple of 19 for QS Holdings, a much bigger company and the last specialist retailer to come to market. Cattle's will receive total net funds of about Pounds 7.5m from the placing and from repayment of outstanding inter company loans. Cattle's is proposing a special dividend of 0.5p, payable with the final dividend for last year. Rosebys will use Pounds 1.7m from the proceeds to finance the completion of a new distribution centre. A further Pounds 1.7m will be used to repay part of its overdraft.</p>

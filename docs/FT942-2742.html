			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: Solid gain at Enso-Gutzeit Enso-Gutzeit, the Finnish pulp and paper group, saw profits after financial items reach FM365m (Dollars 66.4m) in the first four months, a sharp rise from last time's FM86m. The group benefited from higher pulp and sawn-goods prices, as well as foreign exchange gains and lower financial costs. The upturn would have been stronger, but for a 7 per cent appreciation in the value of the markka and higher depreciation costs. Markka prices for fine paper, newsprint and coated magazine paper were also lower than a year ago. The group remains optimistic about prospects because of strengthening prices for most pulp and paper products and rising capacity utilis-ation. Mr Jukka Harmala, chief executive, said 1994 figures should show a 'clear improvement' on last year's FM385m profit, 'provided there are no unexpected turns in external factors'. The figures are further evidence of a broad recovery in the Nordic pulp and paper sector. Sales rose 19 per cent, to FM5.5bn from FM4.6bn, mainly because of last year's purchase of forestry and board operations from Tampella. However, operating profits rose only 5.6 per cent, to FM701m from FM664m, due to the stronger markka, falling prices, and higher depreciation. Lower interest rates and the healthier markka reduced financial costs to FM374m from FM508m. There was also a foreign currency gain of FM38m, after a FM70m loss last year. Meanwhile, Enso said it had tightened its grip on Berghuizer Papierfabriek, its struggling Dutch paper subsidiary, following a public offering for the outstanding shares in the company. Enso's stake has risen to 77.1 per cent from 57.8 per cent. The offer will be extended. Berghuizer specialises in high-quality copying and writing papers, in a highly-competitive market. Last year, it suffered a Fl 14.8m loss on sales of Fl 194.8m. Its performance is not expected to improve this year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Dispatch" by reporter Tseng Hui-yen (2582 1979 3601): </F> "CHING HSIANG Editor Chen Dongdong's Whereabouts Is Unknown, His  Three Colleagues Are Also Subject to Harassment"]    [Text] New York, 18 May (LIEN HO PAO)--Bei Ling, a founder  of the CHING HSIANG magazine who now lives in Boston, the United  States, disclosed that Chen Dongdong, the magazine's poem editor  on the mainland, was summoned to the Shanghai Public Security  Bureau for interrogation last week, and his whereabouts were  unknown up to 18 May. Meanwhile, three other editors of the  magazine on the mainland had been harassed by the authorities to  a varying extent; and the residence of Bei Ling's parents in  Beijing was searched by public security personnel. Bei Ling has  already written to the U.S. PEN and the International PEN to  raise the case and draw their concern to the issue of personal  freedom of mainland Chinese writers.    Bei Ling said: Except for Meng Lang, a well-known vanguard  poet, who has gone south to avoid trouble early this year, all  the other four CHING HSIANG editors in Shanghai, namely, Chen  Dongdong, Chen Zishan, Zhu Dake, and Sun Ganlu, have been  frequently summoned by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for  "interrogation" since early April. They were mainly questioned  about the participation of any "reactionary elements" abroad in  the editorial work of CHING HSIANG, any financial contributions  by such people to the magazine, and Bei Ling's activities during  his tour of the mainland from late last year to early this year.  The police also asked Bei Ling's younger brother, who is  working in Shanghai, to give an detailed account of Bei Ling's  social contacts in Shanghai.</p>

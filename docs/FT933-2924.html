			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Mirror Group More good news from Mirror Group Newspapers must surely have convinced the administrator to press ahead with the sale of his 54.8 per cent stake. The rosy aura surrounding MGN after its half-year results produced another jump in the shares despite the market's fraying nerves. MGN's trading margin has increased by more than 3 percentage points to 24.2 per cent. Advertising revenue has climbed 6.4 per cent. The pension fund drain is proving less than feared. Even The Sun's price assault has failed to dull the shine. All this should provide an attractive backdrop for an institutional placing. However, unanswered concerns remain about MGN's longer-term prospects. If extended, the 7p price differential between The Sun and Daily Mirror must surely tell over time. Any imposition of VAT on newspapers will further exacerbate the strain. As it was, MGN's cover-price revenue fell fractionally to Pounds 150m in the half-year. Impressive though they are, recent improvements may not alter a trend which has seen Daily Mirror circulation fall 40 per cent in the past 30 years. Once the recovery momentum exhausts itself, investors will look to yield to underpin the shares. But gearing of 85 per cent will permit no more than a modest dividend next year.</p>

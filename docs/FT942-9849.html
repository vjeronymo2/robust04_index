			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: GrandMet's long vision Grand Metropolitan's interim results contain a couple of disappointments for which even several tots of its new cinnamon schnapps laced with flakes of real gold cannot compensate. Economic recovery in the US has not filtered through to the drinks industry. GrandMet has failed to enjoy the uplift that would offset the Pounds 40m cost of destocking there. Admittedly, its North American food business is doing better, but recession has pushed European food into a Pounds 3m loss on first-half turnover down around 10 per cent - despite the effort that has gone into Haagen-Dazs ice cream. Since the market does not attach much quality to the extra earnings that Grand Metropolitan now promises from a lower tax rate, it is no surprise that the shares fell nearly 6 per cent on yesterday's figures. Consider the longer term perspective, though, and a different picture emerges. GrandMet has not only reduced its debt due to the sale of Chef &amp; Brewer; it is also generating more cash, partly as a result of sharply lower provisions spending. Gearing would still be 270 per cent if intangibles were stripped out of its balance sheet, but interest cover is a comfortable 8.9 times. Trading improvements at both Pearle spectacles and Inntrepreneur pubs mean these businesses could be shed within a couple of years. That could yield another Pounds 750m or so in cash. This receipt would enhance earnings even if it were simply put on deposit. GrandMet ought easily to find a way of investing the money to secure additional growth. At some point, it will have to decide whether there is sense in trying to acquire critical mass in European food. But US food and the emerging drinks markets in the developing world offer opportunities that GrandMet will increasingly be able to afford. As that sinks in, its shares may start to look cheap.</p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Mobile side supports BT British Telecommunications reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 781m in the three months to June 30, a 3.2 per cent increase on last time's Pounds 757m. Before redundancy charges profits advanced 2.1 per cent. Turnover increased 1.4 per cent to Pounds 3.38bn (Pounds 3.34bn). However, the company had to rely largely on a sharp increase in income from mobile services and Cellnet, its cellular joint venture with Securicor, to offset a 2.6 per cent fall in turnover in its core national and international traffic. Allowing for discontinued activities turnover was up by 2.5 per cent. Although BT faced increased competition in the opening quarter from Mercury and cable operators building local networks, it blamed the fall in traffic income on large price reductions made under an agreement with Oftel, the telecoms regulator, which obliges it to reduce call charges by 7.5 per cent a year after allowing for inflation. BT estimated that net price reductions cost it Pounds 120m in the quarter. It will have to make further price cuts in the autumn. Sir Iain Vallance, chairman, warned that the next round of price cuts and additional redundancy costs 'will be moderating influences on our full-year results'. Part of the impact of the price cuts was offset by a 7 per cent increase in inland traffic since last year and a 5 per cent rise in international traffic. It pointed to the sharp increase in inland traffic, which compared with a 2 per cent increase between the same quarters in 1992 and 1993, as evidence of the success of its current campaign to encourage greater phone usage. Exchange line rental income grew by 4.2 per cent to Pounds 620m, reflecting continuing line growth and an increase in line rental prices. A 12 per cent increase in revenue from other sales and services to Pounds 791m was mainly due to increased activity at Cellnet and BT's mobile division. The number of Cellnet cellular connections rose by 128,000 to 1.15m. BT's redundancy programme reduced the number employed by 1,700 to 154,300. Redundancy costs were Pounds 54m. Total redundancy costs for the current year are projected at Pounds 750m. Eliminating redundancy charges, staff costs were 3.5 per cent lower. Mr Laurence Heyworth, telecoms analyst at Robert Fleming, said BT's underlying position was robust, with line growth of 100,000 a month, aggregating the cellular and fixed-line sectors. Earnings per share rose by 2.5 per cent to 8.1p (7.9p).</p>

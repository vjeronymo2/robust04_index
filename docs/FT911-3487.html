			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Tarmac Tarmac's share price ebbs and flows these days with hopes for the great recovery. It is therefore not surprising that the market took fright yesterday at the board's unexpectedly gloomy observations for the current year, even if a 6 per cent fall to 229p looked a needlessly savage reaction. However the numbers are added up, it is hard to see this year's dividend not being fully covered; and when the tide finally turns Tarmac is bound to be a major beneficiary. The big worry at the moment is the performance of Tarmac America, which is making a pitiful 4 per cent return on Dollars 1bn of capital employed. The division managed just Pounds 5m of operating profits in the second half. The deterioration in Florida and Virginia should have come as little surprise, but one wonders whether the company should grasp the opportunity to shrink the size of its US operation. Taking Pounds 100m of working capital out of UK housing, by contrast, looks a little odd at such a low point in the cycle, though the company insists it is not retreating from the business. The trouble could be reaching the desired volume of 11,000 homes this year without again resorting to discounts. Investors who have chased the shares of the housebuilding contractors this year will no doubt take note.</p>

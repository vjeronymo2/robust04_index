			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / World Trade News: EC seeks to defuse procurement row SIR Leon Brittan, the European Community commissioner for external economic affairs, yesterday intervened to defuse the growing EC-US dispute over government procurement and telecommunications. Sir Leon announced that the EC was ready to sponsor jointly with the US an independent study to establish 'objective criteria' for the parallel opening of the US and EC procurement markets. The decision to publicise the EC offer was viewed in Brussels as offering Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, a face-saving compromise so that he can withdraw his threat to bar EC companies from certain federal contracts, starting next Monday. EC officials said the offer to sponsor an independent report on restrictions to competition created by Buy American and Buy European legislation would have been tabled during talks scheduled this week. But Mr Kantor's unexpected decision to call off the negotiations thwarted the EC initiative. Sir Leon repeated yesterday his earlier proposal to waive Article 29 of the EC utilities directive which offers a 3 per cent price preference to European companies, on condition that the US makes reciprocal moves to open the US market in transport, power generation and telecommunications. The US is understood to be pressing for a suspension of this article. A US trade official in Washington said the offer of the study was 'very vague at this point' so Sir Leon has been asked to put the proposal on paper. However, it is unlikely that the study - even if it is agreed - will stop the imposition of sanctions on schedule. 'There are all sorts of studies already,' the official said. But the 'discrimination' against US suppliers has persisted. But the British commissioner also warned, that if the US goes ahead with its threat, the EC would view such actions as 'unilateral' and 'unacceptable' and would follow up with appropriate responses. The EC offer came two days before talks Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, is due to hold with President Bill Clinton in Washington. Tomorrow's meeting offers a chance to defuse the escalation in EC-US trade tensions on steel subsidies, the stalled Gatt Uruguay Round and the procurement dispute as well as to cement a working relationship between the two leaders. EC officials pointed out that if Mr Kantor proceeds with his threat to bar certain European companies from federal contracts it would be interpreted as a slap in the face to Mr Delors.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By AZERTAC correspondent Djamilya Kuliyeva for TASS] </F>   [Text] Baku April 5 TASS -- Participants in the press  conference called today in the Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan  (ASA) described the forthcoming restarting of the Metsamor  nuclear power plant as an ill-considered step which will  threaten hundreds of thousands of people with radioactive  contamination.    ASA President Eldar Salayev and Chairman of the Republic's  State Environmental Committee Arif Mansurov, who signed a  petition to this effect to the U.N.O., all international  organizations, ecologists of contiguous states and foreign  embassies in Azerbaijan, said that a request to protect the  region from the danger of radioactivity is also contained in  resolutions adopted at more than 30 meetings held in Azerbaijan.  Participants in the meetings also regard this step as a method  of exerting political pressure on Azerbaijan.    According to Eldar Salayev, Armenia's location in a  seismologically dangerous zone and the lack of conditions for  burying radioactive waste within its territory will be conducive  to accidents at the plant, which has been constructed according  to an out-of-date design. Contamination of such unique  reservoires as the Caspian Sea by waters of rivers flowing  through Armenia can also prove fatal for human beings, he said.    The ASA president recalled that representatives of Turkey  and  Georgia had also expressed their negative views at a meeting of  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) held last year,  when the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development  was openly prepared to finance the repair of the nuclear power  plant. At that time scientists of Armenia, who also spoke of  the impossibility of restarting the nuclear power plant, had put  forward similar arguments after the earthquake in Spitak in  1988, he said.</p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Survey of Design in Europe (5): Avant garde Dutch twist to a Danish tail - Re-thinking a corporate identity When the officials of Danish Post started to trawl around for a graphic designer to devise a new corporate identity to pave the way towards privatisation, one of their first stops was at Studio Dumbar in The Hague. The Danes had admired the bold and, in some of its wilder manifestations, avant garde corporate identity that the PTT - the Dutch post office and telecommunications authority - had adopted in 1989. So much so, indeed, that they asked their Dutch colleagues at the PTT to advise on the creation of Danish Post's own new identity. The Dutch urged the Danes to seek the help of Studio Dumbar, the Dutch designers behind their own instant design classic. The Danes hedged their bet. To ensure that Studio Dumbar's unpredictable ideas were translated into something that would make sense to the Danish public, the designers were teamed with Kontrapunkt, a Copenhagen-based consultancy which has worked with Danish Post for 15 years. 'Kontrapunkt is very good on solid, classic design,' says Gert Dumbar, the charismatic front man of Studio Dumbar. 'We're the opposite  - coming up with new ideas and shocking the client.' An important part of the clever new Danish Post identity is the way it has been designed to cope with a number of possible futures. 'We don't know today whether the Post will continue as a state company or as a privatised company,' says Aksal Lessmann, head of communications. (This will not be decided until after the next Danish election this autumn.) 'But we do know that we have to compete. We have to modernise and show the public that we are not so old-fashioned.' Post offices will sell a much wider range of services and the company will compete more aggressively abroad. The new identity was launched in March at six post offices - three of these in Copenhagen. Two more sites have been added since. The design preserves important elements of the original 1939 identity and its 1982 revision, the coach horn and the royal crown; but their colour has been changed from red to yellow and they have been set more forcefully in a red, round-ended box. The 'S' in Post is given a memorable - but also traditional - twist of the tail. Two new colours, green and blue, have been added to 'signal the new business activities which are coming,' says Kim Meyer Anderson, the Kontrapunkt team leader. For the first time, the Danish Post has an identity which banishes confusion with its private post competitors. The inherent flexibility of the logo - the basis for a full corporate identity now in development - allows for later subdivision of the company along the lines of the Dutch PTT. And in a country where the bright red postboxes are regarded by the public as 'almost holy,' the identity of Denmark itself is subtly strengthened.</p>

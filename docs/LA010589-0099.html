			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOVELIST GETS SIX MONTHS IN JAIL FOR STEALING BOOKS  </P> <P> Gustav (Gus) Hasford, a novelist and screenwriter who was nominated for an  Academy Award last year, was sentenced to six months in jail and five years of  probation Wednesday for stealing almost 800 books from nine libraries.  </P> <P> Hasford, co-writer of the screenplay for the movie, "Full Metal Jacket," was  taken into custody immediately and was led from the San Luis Obispo County  Superior courtroom in handcuffs.  </P> <P> He had been charged with grand theft but in December Hasford negotiated a plea  with the prosecutor to possession of stolen property. Hasford originally was  charged with stealing more than 1,000 books -- worth about $20,000 -- from 63  libraries. Among the books discovered were several rare 19th-Century volumes  from a library in London.  </P> <P> In addition to the jail time, Superior Court Judge Warren Conklin also fined  Hasford $1,100 and ordered him to pay shipping costs for the return of 748  books to the nine libraries throughout the country and to one individual.  </P> <P> Conklin agreed with the prosecutor's recommendation of a six-month jail term  for Hasford.  </P> <P> "If Hasford had stolen hundreds of wheelbarrows, he would get a stiff  sentence," Conklin said, "and he should get a stiff sentence for stealing the  books."  </P> <P> But Hasford's attorney, Orlan Donley, said the six-month sentence was unfair.  </P> <P> "Hasford has been an outstanding citizen all his life and this one crime was an  aberration," Donley said in a telephone interview afterward. "It's very unusual  for somebody like this to get so much jail time. I thought it was uncalled  for."  </P> <P> San Luis Obispo County Deputy Dist. Atty. Teresa Estrada-Mullaney, who  prosecuted the case, said Hasford's sentence would serve as a lesson that  stealing library books is a serious offense.  </P> <P> Hasford's library collection was discovered in March, 1988, when campus police  at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, looking for library books Hasford had checked out  at the campus and had not returned, searched his rented storage locker and  found about 10,000 books.  </P> <P> Hasford, who lives in San Clemente, won critical acclaim for his first novel,  "The Short-Timers," based on his experience as a combat correspondent with the  1st Marine Division in Vietnam during the Tet Offensive of 1968. Stanley  Kubrick purchased the rights to the book, and Hasford shares screenwriting  credit on "Full Metal Jacket" with Kubrick and Michael Herr. The writers were  nominated, but did not win, an Academy Award for the screenplay. Hasford  recently completed a sequel to "The Short-Timers" entitled "The Phantom  Blooper," that will be released in the spring.  </P> <P> During the first few court hearings, Hasford did not appear to be disturbed by  the charges and frequently joked with reporters. After one court hearing, he  claimed that he was innocent and added: "In the immortal words of Richard  Nixon: 'I am not a crook.' " After another court hearing he quipped to  reporters: "I've got a quote for you. I've seen Elvis. I've talked to Elvis.  Elvis is alive."  </P> <P> But Wednesday, after the sentencing, Hasford was in a grim mood, according to  his attorney.  </P> <P> "Gus was shocked," Donley said. "He's an easygoing guy, but the sentence shook  him up pretty bad."  </P></p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Pakistan's privatisation policy reaches a key stage: Although sell-off targets have not been met there is optimism in Islamabad PAKISTAN'S programme for privatising public sector industry has reached a key stage this month with the planned sale of 44 factories. The programme is looked upon as a test of the policies of Mr Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister, who has undertaken economic reforms including removal of regulation, privatisation and private sector incentives since he took office in November 1990. The reforms have won the backing of the International Monetary Fund. The initial target of selling over 115 factories by the end of 1991 was not met. But government officials and businessmen nevertheless see the sales arranged so far as an important boost to the programme. Mrs Salma Ahmed, a Karachi-based industrialist, says: 'The sale of 44 units is a good off-loading for the first year'. Of these, 24 deals have been finalised and the remainder are due to be completed during January. They include tractor and cement factories as well as bakeries and cooking oil plants. Buyers are mainly Pakistani industrial groups. Though the government expects foreign participation in some of the sales, none has so far been confirmed. The government expects to earn at least Rupees 10bn from the 24 confirmed deals. It aims to receive at least 90 per cent of an undisclosed reference price, and does not disclose individual sale prices. The public sector units being sold are generally inefficient with low productivity and profitability. Mr Saeed Qadir, chairman of the privatisation commission, expects profitability to improve when the factories are sold. By March, he expects the total of factories sold to rise to about 80. Mr Qadir says a government deal with labour unions was the biggest step towards success of the privatisation programme. Under the deal announced in October, the government agreed that new owners of factories would not be allowed to retrench any workers during the first 12 months after privatisation. It was also agreed that 10 per cent of shares would be offered to workers at a mutually agreed price. If workers were laid off, the deal provided for an unemployment allowance, easy credit facilities for self-employment initiatives, scholarships for children and grants for marriage of daughters. The government also agreed to compensation of one month's full salary and four months basic salary for each year of service. Mrs Ahmed, the Karachi industrialist, says that as a result of the agreement, labour unions are in a better position to understand the privatisation initiative. But one leading businessman cautions that 'the deal with labour unions has put off some investors. It is not clear how much liabilities on this front would go to the new owners. For factories which are already running losses, such a deal could be back-breaking'. Other business people are optimistic for the privatisation programme because of other reforms, including reduction of bureaucratic restrictions, permission for Pakistanis to keep foreign exchange accounts at local banks, and steps to improve infrastructure such as telephones. Officials claim that Pakistan's first important international investors' conference, held in November, attracted commitments to new projects totalling Dollars 600m. However, businessmen are sceptical that such a large amount will be invested in the near term. Aside from the attempt to sell off industries, the government's initiative to sell two of the largest public sector banks and two development finance institutions in November received fewer than expected offers. Senior officials including Mr Qadir conceded that the outcome was disappointing. Western economists in Islamabad remain cautiously optimistic. Says one: 'Even with these problems, the government seems to be persistent and wants to go along . . . If the programme doesn't go far enough, it would be hard not to give them credit for at least trying.'</p>

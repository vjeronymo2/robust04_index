			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Interest rates of 500% fail to revive drachma The Greek drachma, facing sustained pressure for the past week, slipped yesterday against the D-Mark despite another sharp rise in short-term interest rates. The drachma fell to DM152.5 from DM148.9 on Thursday, triggering speculation that a devaluation was imminent, before closing at DM150. The government's claim yesterday that it was 'satisfied' with the drachma's performance in the week since capital controls were lifted did nothing to restore confidence among bankers and economists. There is growing concern that Mr Andreas Papandreou, the ailing socialist prime minister, is not prepared to let the economy ministry push through new fiscal measures ahead of next month's European parliament elections. Mr Papandreou has made no statement on the currency crisis since he commented that drachma was in 'business as usual' during a parliamentary debate on Monday, the first day of upheaval on Greek financial markets. Moreover, Mr Yannos Papantoniou, the new economy minister, has failed to follow up on promises that the privatisation programme would be expanded to help close a revenue gap in this year's budget projected at Dr450-500bn. Mr Papantoniou's insistence that no new taxes would be introduced this year, appears increasingly unrealistic, given Greece's deepening economic predicament. Analysts said that if currency stability is to be restored, the government must accompany a faster depreciation of the drachma, expected next week, with a specific package of measures. To convince the markets that the socialists are serious about reducing the public sector deficits, these would have to include spending curbs and more rigorous measures to improve tax collection. The surge in short-term interest rates, which yesterday reached a record 500 per cent, has failed to protect the drachma following the freeing of short-term capital movement. The Bank of Greece was estimated to have spent more than Dollars 300m yesterday to support the drachma, bringing foreign exchange losses to over Dollars 700m for the week. One dealer said: 'If devaluation is to be avoided, depreciation must accelerate. These interest rates can't be kept up for more than a few days.' However, while smaller Greek companies faced a cash squeeze because of the explosion in interest rates, several banks said they were still lending to corporate customers at less than 40 per cent.</p>

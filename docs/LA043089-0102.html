			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOLATILE SOVIET SITUATION NEEDS NO 'HELP' FROM OUTSIDERS  </P> <P> Early in the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln wrote Horace Greeley that "my paramount  object . . . is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy  slavery."  </P> <P> Mikhail S. Gorbachev's position on the crisis in the Soviet Union's minority  republics is similar to Lincoln's in 1862. "Perestroika," he said, "is not  breaking up the national structure of the country. We are against that."  </P> <P> Lincoln failed to hold the Union together. Gorbachev's present policy will fail  to keep the Soviet Union together, too, unless he backs it up with brute force.  Here's why.  </P> <P> Millions of people in five non-Russian republics of the Soviet Union have been  in ferment for months. Georgians, and before them Latvians, Estonians,  Lithuanians and Armenians have all taken their complaints against Moscow out on  the streets. Troops have been called in twice, and there has been bloodshed,  most recently in Tbilisi. It has been easy for the Kremlin to paint all this as  the work of ethnic hotheads out to settle a score with Moscow or with other  national groups. A Kremlin spokesman, Gennady I. Gerasimov, said as much,  adding disdainfully "they have no program."  </P> <P> But what are they really after? The question is the more complex since these  are the Soviet Union's five richest republics. By comparison, Russians live  like paupers. And herein lies the problem. Knowing they can live better in the  non-Russian republics, Russians by the millions have flocked to them.  Naturally, the non-Russians object, especially when their native language  disappears from street signs and in schools through a process of Russification.  The "ethnic" component of their program is thus to preserve their language and  culture by reversing the influx of Russians.  </P> <P> Their other concerns are equally pointed. Members of several of the Soviet  nationalities believe that the Russians are draining them economically. All  want the benefit of trade with the Russian market but they also demand greater  control of their local economies so they will not be forced to sell goods to  Moscow at artificially low prices. To gain this control, they demand greater  home-rule. Independent political movements have sprung up in all five republics  to press for rule by elected representatives of the people.  </P> <P> Some of these political groups are socialist, others anti-socialist. Still  others are composed of factions from both sides. All, however, stand for  expanded civil rights, including freedom of speech, assembly, religion and the  press. All seek an independent judiciary. All are convinced, too, that only a  multiparty system can protect these rights in their land.  </P> <P> The tactics used by these embryonic parties go far beyond yelling in the  streets. Nearly all the candidates they backed in the recent national elections  won. Now they are organizing for regional and local elections, scheduled for  autumn. The parties issue position papers and newsletters. Most are organizing  down to what we call the precinct level. At the same time, they maintain close  ties not only with movements in other non-Russian republics but with  sympathizers among the independent Popular Front and Democratic Front  organizations in Russia proper. The Baltic states are even building ties abroad  -- Latvia with Sweden, Lithuania with Poland and Estonia with Finland and  Ireland.  </P> <P> What do these movements really want from Moscow? Some in each group want to  exercise the right to secede from the Soviet Union, as guaranteed in the Soviet  constitution. Most, however, would settle for less. After all, geography will  link their fate to their Russian neighbor whatever political arrangements may  exist between them. Given this, most stop short of advocating disunion, calling  instead for a loose federation in which all rights not explicitly assigned to  Moscow remain with the local republics.  </P> <P> Given the programs and tactics of the national movements, Gorbachev's brusque  effort to stonewall them is puzzling. Moscow has taken no steps to mollify or  co-opt the home-rule movements, let alone to introduce a true system of  federalism that would meet their demands. There are many successful models of  such a system, including more than a few schemes devised by Russians during the  century before Lenin took power. Gorbachev has ignored them. In the absence of  such measures, radicalization is proceeding apace, both in the Caucasus and the  Baltic regions. Increasingly, the minority republics are a tinderbox that could  be ignited by the smallest spark.  </P> <P> What position should the United States take on all this? Americans naturally  respond with sympathy to the image of democratic Davids taking potshots at the  Russian Goliath who thwarts their self-determination. But the dangers of  outsiders -- even well intentioned ones -- toying with so volatile a situation  are huge. No one can foresee whether events will lead to a crackdown from  Moscow or to the institution of new constitutional structures that protect  pluralism. One thing is for sure. An explosion would prove as disastrous for  further reform in the Soviet Union as a whole as the bloody rebellion of  Russia's Polish subjects in 1863 did for the "Great Reforms" being instituted  at that time by Czar Alexander II.  </P> <P> The United States has no interest in fanning chaos in the Soviet Union.  Instability there would slow or stop reforms that are changing totalitarian  rule. It would make the Soviet Union a less reliable partner in efforts to  resolve conflicts in the Third World. It would reduce Soviet interest in arms  control, and hence hurt our efforts to reduce the U.S. federal deficit.  </P> <P> Far better would be to maintain our present policy favoring measured,  controlled change in the Soviet Union. This means keeping up steady contact  with authorities in Moscow and, informally, with public movements in the  republics. It means exercising patience and a willingness to look beyond  short-term excesses that might be committed either by Gorbachev or by the  various national movements. Above all, it means suppressing our national  passion for "getting involved." In the end, we cannot resolve this grave  dispute among neighbors.  </P></p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Letter: Car costs all in the head Sir, The relative costs of road and rail transport have been discussed at length in letters recently. May I add my own observations? It costs me Pounds 32 in petrol, or about Pounds 44 in marginal costs, to drive to London and back (460 miles) in a BMW 525i. Yet when my younger child soon reaches the age of five, it will cost Pounds 390 if we travel first class by rail, ie in comfort commensurate with the car, or Pounds 590 if we were to take one of the children's grandparents with us. Costs arising from depreciation, insurance and road tax are barely relevant, unless the alternative consideration is to have no car at all, as they are incurred in any event. In any case, most people mentally write off the cost of car purchase on the day of purchase, and not against each mile travelled.

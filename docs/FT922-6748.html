			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Chinese party leader extols the virtues of capitalism JIANG ZEMIN, the Chinese Communist party leader, has staked his position firmly in the pro-reform camp with a glowing tribute to capitalism, Reuter reports from Beijing. In comments to graduates, carried on the front pages of all leading newspapers yesterday, Jiang said the main goal of China's economic reform was to learn from capitalist nations. Western diplomats said it was clear Jiang had thrown in his lot with senior leader Deng Xiaoping's reform drive. 'The main goal and contents of China's reform and opening policy is to learn all the good and advanced things from overseas, including from capitalist countries, to speed up economic development,' Jiang was quoted as saying. Learning from capitalist countries has been a theme of Deng's campaign to speed up the pace of market-oriented change. It has been fiercely resisted by ideologues who see it as a betrayal of socialist principles. Diplomats said Jiang, along with Prime Minister Li Peng, lacked an independent political base, and moved with prevailing winds. Consequently, their statements were a good indication of the balance of power in China. Sweden's Defence Research Establishment (FOA) said yesterday it had monitored what it believed was the most powerful Chinese nuclear test explosion since 1976, Reuter adds from Stockholm.</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Letter: Experience of crime Sir, I represent the electoral division of Kent County Council in which the Police Authority HQ is located. Immediately adjacent to it are two large estates, both of which suffer from serious deprivation and, not unconnected, petty crime. While home secretary Michael Howard was no doubt right when he told the Association of Chief Police Officers that farmers, head teachers and shopkeepers all knew something about crime ('Howard rejects criticism of police authority reform', July 9), I am certain crime and fear of crime are more likely to be part of the everyday experience of my constituents than of the groups he names. However, I doubt that his proposed reforms will lead to any of my constituents being asked to make the short walk up the road to join the Kent Police Authority to share their experiences with Mr Howard's political appointee friends. Len Bishop, Kent County Council, County Hall, Maidstone, Kent ME14 1XQ</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Prudential pensions offer - At a Glance Prudential, which provides one eighth of the UK's personal pensions, has added three new flexible features to all its pensions. It is now possible to take breaks from paying premiums of up to five years without incurring any extra charges. Savers can also have as many five-year breaks in contributions as they like, although this is not recommended. Conversions between old-style retirement annuity contracts, personal pensions and additional voluntary contributions, often necessary when moving jobs, can also now be made free of charge. Finally, the level of premiums paid can now be altered, with no extra charge. All the changes take effect retrospectively - they affect all Prudential pensions, retirement annuities and freestanding additional voluntary contributions already in force.</p>

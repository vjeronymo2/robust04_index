			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Hanson Industries agrees sale of Axelson for Pounds 56m Hanson Industries, the US arm of the Anglo-American conglomerate, yesterday confirmed that it had agreed to sell Axelson, which makes equipment for the oil industry. The buyer is Wheatley TXT, an oilfield services group, which will pay Pounds 56m, including Pounds 1.8m of long term debt. The sale is the first in a disposal programme of peripheral businesses on which Hanson has embarked, expected to raise about Pounds 500m for the group, which is looking to reduce debt. Axelson was acquired in 1984 when Hanson bought US Industries. In the year to end-September Axelson made an operating profit of Pounds 6m on sales of Pounds 40m. Axelson's net book value is Pounds 14m, and Pounds 6m of goodwill was written off when it was acquired, so there will be an exceptional gain on the sale of about Pounds 35m.</p>

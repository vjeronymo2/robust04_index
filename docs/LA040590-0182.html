			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FORD SETTLES SUIT OVER REAR RESTRAINTS  </P> <P> Ford Motor Co. is paying $6 million to settle a lawsuit that partially blamed  the auto giant's failure to offer rear shoulder harness restraints for the  traffic accident death of a child and crippling injuries to his surviving twin.  </P> <P> The settlement is the largest paid in a case involving the lack of rear  shoulder harnesses, San Diego attorney Craig McClellan said.  </P> <P> He negotiated the settlement on behalf of the twins' parents, Jim and Patricia  Miller, who also survived the Nov. 13, 1988, accident. Dozens of similar suits  filed throughout the nation are pending against Ford and other auto makers.  </P> <P> Under federal regulations, combination lap and shoulder safety harnesses in the  rear are mandatory for all passenger cars as of the 1990 model year. In 1992,  the requirement will be expanded to include mini vans. Ford admitted no  liability in the settlement.  </P></p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Body Shop expose fails to shock The long-awaited article that has helped trigger controversy over the image of Body Shop International, the cosmetics and toiletries group, was published yesterday to the bemusement of investors and ethical researchers. 'Shattered Image', an article in US-based Business Ethics magazine written by Mr Jon Entine, highlighted a series of alleged inconsistencies between Body Shop's marketing of its espoused ideals and its practices. Some commentators expressed doubts about the potency of its revelations, while Body Shop flatly rejected its contents. Mr Entine said there had been a 'wide gap' between promises and delivery to Body Shop's franchisees. He accused the company of having used off-the-shelf product formulae filled with non-renewable petrochemicals. He suggested there had been quality control problems, that only a tiny amount of its ingredients came through its 'trade not aid' programme and that its charitable contributions fell short of company statements. He reported claims that Body Shop invented stories about the exotic origins of some of its products. He said it had a history of legal threats against journalists seeking to publish details behind the 'gloss'. Body Shop yesterday called the article 'recycled rubbish' and hinted at possible legal action by saying it was reviewing its position and would defend its reputation. 'It is a mish-mash of defamatory and actionable falsehoods. It contains distortions, shoddy reporting and views of several unqualified or biased sources or so-called experts.' Business Ethics decided not to publish or circulate its edition in the UK following threatened legal action by Body Shop, but a number of analysts have obtained details. Mr Peter Webster, executive secretary of the Ethical Investment Research Service, said: 'It doesn't seem to add up to its claims. It doesn't sound like the end of an institution.' He said it did not contain many of the positive aspects of the company's activities, but said his organisation was planning to complete a full report by next week on Body Shop. Mr Rod Whitehead, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said: 'I felt that if (the article) came up with some fairly serious allegations, and these were given a fair amount of publicity in the popular press, that could affect sales quite badly. But my impression is that they have not come up with sufficiently new and serious allegations.'</p>

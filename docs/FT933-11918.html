			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Inco offsets slump in nickel LOSSES at Inco, the international nickel producer, were virtually unchanged in the second quarter. A further slump in nickel prices was offset by improved results from the company's alloys business, lower interest charges and favourable currency movements. The Toronto-based company suffered a loss of Dollars 2.2m, or 3 cents a share, in the latest period, compared with a Dollars 1.5m loss, also 3 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues slipped to Dollars 608m from Dollars 681m, due largely to a 12 per cent fall in primary metal sales. Interest charges edged down to Dollars 25.2m from Dollars 27.5m and tax payments were also slightly lower. Operating earnings of the primary metals division dropped to Dollars 31m from Dollars 46m. The price of nickel realised during the quarter fell by 16 per cent to Dollars 2.93 per pound, while copper, cobalt and rhodium prices were also lower. However, unit production costs for nickel were 9 per cent lower in the second quarter. Inco does not disclose precise cost levels. The company said the drop reflected reduced employment costs and the weaker Canadian dollar. The alloys and engineered products division, which is in the middle of a restructuring, turned a Dollars 5m loss last year into an operating profit of Dollars 4m. The improvement was ascribed to lower operating costs and higher alloy shipments. Finished nickel inventories rose to 71m lb on June 30 from 67m lb three months earlier. However, the company said stocks were likely to drop during the current quarter as a result of summer shutdowns at its Ontario and Manitoba operations. Third-quarter earnings will be boosted by Inco's recent sale of its 62 per cent stake in TVX Gold, a gold producer. The sale has brought an after-tax gain of about Dollars 125m, or Dollars 1.14 a share, which will be used to reduce debt and for 'general corporate purposes'. Long-term debt totalled Dollars 972m on June 30, down from Dollars 1.08bn a year earlier.</p>

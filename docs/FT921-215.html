			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / EBRD wins credibility with a hard-nosed approach: Initial scepticism about the bank's special role in eastern Europe has given way to quiet approval WHEN the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) was launched a year ago, there was one question which Mr Jacques Attali, its philosopher-president, was repeatedly asked: Was the bank needed? Many officials in the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the international banking establishment argued at the time that there were already enough institutions lending to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. 'If the EBRD is to be judged on the sole criteria of simply being another bank, then it is not needed,' a British banker said. But because the EBRD is the only international financial institution that has a specific mandate to establish the framework for a market economy in the former communist countries of eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, and within a democratic environment, the initial scepticism about the bank's role in the reconstruction of eastern Europe has slowly give way to a growing awareness that the bank has a special role to play. The first role is purely commercial. Mr Ronald Freeman, vice-president, and head of the merchant banking arm of the EBRD, says it is not in competition with other banks. 'Our job is to attract strong equity partners in order to conclude contracts in eastern Europe. Every loan must be secured at market rates. We will syndicate everything. That is how we will keep our feet on the ground,' he said. This hard-nosed approach to lending to eastern Europe has reassured its critics. Large General Motors, and GEC-Alsthom, have invested in eastern Europe, with co-financing from the EBRD. Capital committed by the EBRD, combined with commitments made by foreign investors and lenders, total Ecu2.1bn (Pounds 1.5bn) to the region. 'Large companies are approching us for co-financing because they are still uncertain about the political and economic climate in eastern Europe and the CIS,' said Mr Freeman. 'But we cannot adopt a wait-and-see approach to the region. We have to get on with it,' he added. Mr Freeman also believes the reduction in export credit guarantees by many western govenrments is making the EBRD an alternative for foreign investors who want to do business in eastern Europe but who want the added security the bank can bring to a deal. But at the same time, the governments of eastern Europe, which are all represented on the bank, realise that the bank is no 'soft touch'. 'We are not Santa Claus,' said Mr Attali. 'The republics in the CIS, and the east Europeans, are beginning to understand that we cannot make promises. They also understand that taking equity in a company is not the same as extending subsidies.' This tough approach is tempered by the development arm of the bank, which, unlike the merchant banking side, has a much longer-term philosophy. 'We concentrate on developing the infrastructure to the extent that the EBRD's environmental, transport and energy policy is aimed at integrating the countries of eastern Europe with western Europe. This is a very long and complicated process,' explained Mr Thierry Baudon, director of public infrastructure, energy, and environment in the development bank. It is this emphasis on integrating the two Europes which is increasingly shaping the EBRD's philosophy, and which follows Mr Attali's grand vision of an open, continental market embracing the former communist states. 'I am very cautious about having a doctrine for the bank,' explained Mr Attali. 'I realise more and more that even if prices are liberalised in all these countries, you keep coming up against one basic problem: all these countries lack a financial sector.' 'The bank underestimated the need for technical assistance in eastern Europe and the CIS,' he admitted. 'For instance, these countries need a central bank, a fiscal system, a civil service, a telecommunications network, a state to collect taxes. These institutions have to be created. 'We must help the countries of the CIS and eastern Europe establish these institutions within a democratic framework, otherwise there will be no environment in which the market economy can function.' Officials at the bank realise they cannot, and do not want to operate alone, especially when it comes to drawing up long-term policies on the environment, energy, telecommuncations, and transport in east Europe and the CIS. THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development yesterday launched its first annual report with a plea to European Community countries to open up their markets to eastern Europe, writes Judy Dempsey. Mr Jacques Attali, president of the EBRD, said without access to western markets, potential foreign investors will stay away from the region. But Mr Attali said it was also necessary to 'have a clearer view of what kind of investments can be done in order to get eastern Europe out of the (economic) mess. It is very important to put money into infrastructure investments.' One project under consideration by the EBRD is military conversion. He said the EBRD, which now includes all the countries of eastern Europe and the Baltic states, and which yesterday formally admitted all the republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States except Georgia, intends to commit about Ecu1bn (Pounds 710m) to the region in 1992, and about Ecu2bn in 1993.</p>

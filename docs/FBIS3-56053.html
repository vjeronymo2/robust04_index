These days, as a reward for  exemplary behavior with regard to nuclear arms, the U.S.  President will also visit Belarus. One can only guess why  Ukraine was not included on the list of states to be visited by  Clinton during his European tour. When and where Kravchuk and  Clinton will meet is still unclear (as is unclear whether they  will meet at all). There are many urgent issues demanding  immediate resolution, the fate of Ukrainian nuclear arms being  the most pressing one.    Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov, who led the  Ukrainian delegation at tripartite Ukrainian-Russian-U.S. talks,  returned from the United States on 10 January. He said that the  text of a tripartite agreement should have been drafted as a  result of intensive negotiations, stipulating a formula for  eliminating strategic missiles deployed on Ukrainian territory.  The same agreement should have resolved the issue of security  guarantees for Ukraine and of compensation for the nuclear arms  to be eliminated.    However, according to CNN, U.S. Vice President Albert Gore  stated in Washington on 10 January: "There is no such agreement.  For a long time we have been trying to reach this kind of  agreement with Russia and Ukraine. Right now, active work is  under way, but the agreement has not been drafted, and there is  no concrete plan for its signing."    The point is that a compromise has been achieved on some  issues of contention, while other, quite serious ones, remain  unresolved. There is no assurance that the text of the agreement  will be ready by 12 January as a result of quick diplomatic work.    In this case, the question arises regarding the expediency  of  Leonid Kravchuk's visit to Moscow. Massandra has demonstrated  that the Ukrainian president is not very good at playing it by  ear. Thus, it may not be the best solution to sign a vitally  important document not having coordinated all its aspects.  Neither is it advisable to fill in the gaps in the document  under pressure from the two other presidents. Even if the text  of the agreement drafted by experts is ready, is it really  necessary to sign it in Moscow? In world practice, such  documents are signed on neutral territories following bilateral  meetings of all signatories.    Thus, it is quite possible that if the final draft is not  ready Bill Clinton will still find a couple of hours to meet  Kravchuk in Kiev on 12 January. The more so that aside from  nuclear issues the two presidents have things to talk about.  Work on preparing the basic document for bilateral relations,  the Ukrainian-U.S. Charter,is nearing completion. There are  issues of economic cooperation, European and global security,  and developing the ideas of "Partnership for Peace" to discuss.    This variant does not rule out the possibility of resolving  still unresolved issues. In this case, the signing of the  tripartite agreement is possible both during President Clinton's  visit to Moscow and in a neutral state in the immediate future.  It may take a couple of hours to make the decision, and a  couple of minutes to change the schedule of President Clinton's  visit. However, taking into account the importance of possible  consequences, it would be very undesirable to have Ukraine sign  the agreement under pressure or under time constraints. This  would be too high a price that Ukraine would pay for the triumph  of Bill Clinton's CIS policies. After the fiasco of the latter's  foreign strategy in Somalia and former Yugoslavia, this triumph  might come in handy.</p>

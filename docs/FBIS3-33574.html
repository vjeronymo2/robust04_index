			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 24 Feb (EFE) -- Mines and Energy  Minister Guido Alberto Nule Amin announced today that Colombia  will sell 15,000-20,000 barrels of petroleum per day to Cuba.  The high-ranking official, who returned from Havana today, said  both governments are interested in beginning the transaction.  Nule Amin also indicated that the first shipments of Colombian  petroleum to the Caribbean island will be made some time between  June and July.    "We expect to finalize some details, such as payment and  timeframe formulas" very soon, Nule Amin said. The minister  explained that "these will be direct sales," making it known  that the transactions will not involve any type of compensation  or barter mechanisms. Guido Nule Amin emphasized that during  the negotiations it was made clear that Colombia is willing to  sell petroleum to Cuba, but under the same "conditions that  prevail on the international market."    The Colombian minister said Cuba currently consumes  50,000-60,000 barrels of petroleum and that, according to what  was agreed upon in Havana, Colombia will initially supply  one-third of Cuba's fuel supply. Colombia produces  approximately 420,000 barrels a day. It consumes half of that  amount and exports the rest.</p>

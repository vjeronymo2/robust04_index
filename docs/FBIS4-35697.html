			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] In its editorial under the headline "The  Responsibility for the Stalemate in the Peace Process," the  newspaper AL-BA'TH says: During his recent tour, U.S. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher must have noticed the difference  between Syria's way of dealing with the peace process and that  of Israel. Syria has accepted the bases of the peace process  and was concerned about dealing with this process in both words  and deeds. It has sincerely and faithfully cooperated with the  U.S. Administration to make this process succeed. However,  Israel's intransigence and the Rabin government's insistence on  refusing to announce its acceptance of the bases of the peace  process, particularly the full withdrawal from the occupied Arab  territories and the restoration of Golan in full, have brought  the talks to a halt and obstructed efforts to reactivate them or  push them forward.    In addition to this, the paper says it believes that the  ones  who have caused this stalemate in the peace process are the  Israeli rulers because they seek to exploit the peace process in  the interest of their schemes of bestowing legitimacy on the  occupation, just as what has taken place in the implementation  of the secret Oslo agreement, and to bring the peace process to  a halt.    The paper stresses that Syria has been committed and will  continue to be committed to the peace process. However, it  rejects diktats, conditions, and blackmail.    The paper says: No one should expect Syria to relinquish any  Arab rights or land, or to accept secret talks, because Syria,  as President Hafiz al-Asad has said, has fought with honor and  is negotiating with honor, and consequently, it will not do  anything it is ashamed of when it holds negotiations for the  sake of restoring its national soil and of achieving a just and  comprehensive peace.    Concluding its editorial, AL-BA'TH says: Syria will continue  to cooperate with any efforts to push the peace process forward  in accordance with the bases agreed upon in the peace initiative  and the resolutions of the international legitimacy.    Under the headline "The Real Progress," the newspaper  AL-THAWRAH says: We cannot talk about pushing the peace process  forward before Israel announces its commitment to the bases of  the peace process and its readiness to fully withdraw from the  Golan, southern Lebanon, and all the occupied Arab territories.  Undoubtedly, the United States is exerting immense efforts to  break what it calls the stalemate in the peace process.  However, breaking the real stalemate cannot take place without  having Israel give clear answers to the substantive questions  posed by the essence of the peace process, represented by full  withdrawal.    The paper notes: The Israeli rulers lack courage and do not  abide by the international resolutions. The Israeli rulers have  continued to ignore the requirements of a true peace in order to  evade full withdrawal and to peddle partial and incomplete  settlements that do not meet the conditions of a just and  comprehensive peace. Neither do they respond to the  requirements of implementing the international resolutions.  These settlements encourage the Arabs to sign the writs of  their capitulation similar to the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which  placed the Palestinian people under Israeli military siege and  put Palestinian economic and political decision under the  Israeli trusteeship. Thus, the region has continued to be a  hotbed of tension and turmoil.    AL-THAWRAH says: Syria will continue to resist Israel's  attempts even as it responds to every sincere effort to achieve  a just and comprehensive peace.    Concluding, the paper says: If Israel does not abide by the  bases of the peace process and the resolutions of international  legitimacy, efforts will continue to be lost in a waste land.    Under the headline "Rabin Stresses Israel's Rejection of  Peace," the newspaper TISHRIN says: Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin's statement that he is not ready to withdraw from  all Golan, or even to make a promise to withdraw, constitutes  decisive proof of Israel's rejection of peace and its efforts to  sabotage the U.S. initiative that was based on the  land-for-peace formula, the implementation of the relevant  resolutions of international legitimacy, and the achievement of  a just and comprehensive settlement on all fronts of the  conflict.    TISHRIN adds: Rabin's rejection proves anew Israel's  expansionist ambitions and aggressive schemes.    The paper notes that the UN Security Council resolutions  speak about a comprehensive peace, and not about a partial  withdrawal. The U.S. initiative does not include peace for part  of the land, but peace-for-land.    The paper says: Israel understands peace its own way, not in  accordance with the international rules. In other words, peace  to Israel is expansion, occupation, devouring the occupied  territories, and blackmailing the international community.  Therefore, Rabin's stand does not surprise Syria.    The paper emphasizes that Syria will not relinquish its land  or that of the Arabs. Neither will it compromise on its rights  and sovereignty or be dragged into suspect agreements. Syria  has openly called for achieving the peace of the brave, the  peace of right and justice which eliminates occupation and  aggression.    Concluding its article, TISHRIN holds Israel responsible for  sabotaging the entire peace process and for bringing the region  back to tension and turmoil.</p>

			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST PERSON: SLOW JOURNEY BACK FROM THE DARKNESS  </P> <P> I was on top of the world when it happened: An A-minus student. About to  graduate from Stanford. Editor of the school paper and looking forward to a  reporting job on a newspaper or magazine.  </P> <P> At least, that's what my family and friends tell me.  </P> <P> I have only a shadowy perception of the old me, an image built on the memories  of others. Often I wonder what I was really like and how much I changed in  those moments my brain was deprived of oxygen.  </P> <P> The date was March 29, 1984, three days after my 21st birthday. I'd flown to  Honolulu with close friends for a pre-graduation spree and birthday  celebration. My boyfriend and I had a drink at a beachside bar, then headed for  a hot, packed disco.  </P> <P> There, we elbowed our way to the bar and ordered another drink. We'd taken only  a sip or two, when "99 Luftballoons" came blaring over the 10-foot speakers and  my boyfriend led me through the crowd and onto the dance floor.  </P> <P> I don't remember what happened next, but I do know the following few moments  changed my life. Those nearby say I began dancing out of control, my arms  swinging wildly, my mind fixed on a beat apparently only I heard. Embarrassed,  my boyfriend reached out to grab me when I fell to the floor and began  convulsing.  </P> <P> After my boyfriend screamed for help, two quick-thinking employees began  administering CPR and someone called the paramedics. Arriving a few minutes  later, they pressed defibrillator paddles against my heart in a desperate  attempt to restart it. I was rushed to the nearest hospital in a comatose  state. But at least my heart was beating again.  </P> <P> What caused such sudden cardiac failure?  </P> <P> As drugs were not detected in my bloodstream, doctors began extensive tests,  hoping to pinpoint the cause. Today, they still don't know the answer and tell  me it was a weird fluke, one that should not happen again.  </P> <P> According to the American Heart Assn.'s most recent statistics, it is extremely  unlikely that a 21-year-old woman will experience what I did; only 0.7%, ages  29 to 44, suffered cardiac arrest in 1984.  </P> <P> Four days later, I emerged from a coma, a rare statistic. Once the respiration  tubes were removed from my throat, however, it became apparent that something  was seriously wrong.  </P> <P> "I'm going to leave now," I announced, repeating myself every five seconds or  so. Bewildered, confused and determined to leave the hospital, I had to be  strapped to the bed with oversized rubber band-like restraints. I recognized  few of my friends and even had trouble distinguishing my mom and dad.  </P> <P> I remained in intensive care for two weeks. During that time my parents, an  older brother and friends attempted to fill me in on the details of a life I  didn't remember. But their words were wasted because I remembered little from  minute to minute.  </P> <P> When my heart rhythm appeared stable, I was flown to a Los Angeles hospital.  There, I underwent seven more weeks of testing to determine the cause of the  incident and to evaluate my mental condition.  </P> <P> I was extraordinarily confused. Reading simple words or adding two and two was  more than I could do.  </P> <P> So every day I had therapy. I struggled to learn to add and subtract or read  about Dick and Jane. Even more difficult was learning to remember what I'd read  only two minutes before. The progress was very slow, because I had almost no  short-term memory. Today, my short-term memory is much improved but still  slightly diminished.  </P> <P> Perhaps it's for the best that I was confused about my situation. Had I  remembered my former self, I would undoubtedly have been far more frustrated by  my lack of progress, and far more embarrassed by my actions.  </P> <P> Even so, there were many times when I'd just sit on the floor in tears,  wondering when I would be myself again.  </P> <P> When I was released from the hospital in May of 1984, my heart was -- and still  is -- stabilized by medication. I spent the summer at my parents' house trying  to improve my reading and memory in preparation for my return to Stanford.  </P> <P> Back at school, I chose classes without in-class exams to avoid overtaxing my  ability to remember. Even so, school was a completely different experience for  me. Previously, I'd almost always earned A's and Bs. Now I was getting Cs and  Ds.  </P> <P> My already diminished attention span was made worse by the medication  prescribed to calm severe body spasms, another result of the lack of blood flow  to the brain. I fought through the classes and nights of spasms. And, aching  inside, I made excuses for my poor grades.  </P> <P> After finishing school in April of 1985, I began work as an intern in the Los  Angeles bureau of Newsweek. It was the first of a string of unsuccessful  reporting jobs. At each publication I had the same problem: Even though I  thought I was doing a good job, I wasn't.  </P> <P> I was told my stories were choppy, my reporting skills weak. After being fired  from a medium-sized newspaper in Southern California, I went to work for a  small business publication. But history repeated itself, and after a month I  quit, having come to the realization that I no longer possessed skills  essential to a reporter: organizing and analyzing information.  </P> <P> Today, I still remember very little about my stay in Hawaii. And I still wonder  how I appear to those who knew the old me. I really only know what I think of  myself now -- and that is something that's constantly changing.  </P> <P> I work as an editorial assistant at the Los Angeles Times, a fairly  straightforward job that allows me to assume increasing amounts of  responsibility and build confidence.  </P> <P> Though I know I should be happy simply to be working, I still feel frustrated  and embarrassed in some social situations or when I talk to my friends who are  now reporters. Because they know of my past ambitions, it's not always easy to  tell them I work as a clerk.  </P> <P> It's at times like that I have to remind myself that only 4 1/2 years ago I was  learning to read again.  </P></p>

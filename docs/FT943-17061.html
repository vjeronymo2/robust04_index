			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / OECD Economic Outlook: Japan's growth may be slowed by strong yen The strengthening of the yen could undermine economic growth in Japan by reducing the level of Japanese exports, the OECD outlook warns, writes Gillian Tett. Though the Japanese economy is expected to pick up this year, it is still the slowest growing of the 'big three' industrialised economies, lagging behind the US and Germany, the report adds. With the Japanese economy still very weak, the main factor in the projected turnround in the economy will be the fiscal package unveiled by the Japanese government in February, the OECD says. The combination of tax cuts and higher public spending is expected to boost consumption and residential investment, leading to higher growth later this year. But Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, OECD chief economist, yesterday warned that in the light of the yen's recent strengthening on the markets, 'recent financial market developments entail the risk of weaker growth of output in Japan'. A weaker dollar could also add to inflationary pressures in the US, Mr Shigehara added. However, he pointed out that in spite of the dollar's decline against the yen, it remained strong against most other currencies. And though growth in US GDP is forecast to slow to 3 per cent next year, from 4 per cent this year, this rate is still expected to reduce the unemployment rate 'below levels consistent with stable inflation', the report says. The strong US demand is expected to suck in more exports, leading to a deterioration in the US balance of trade. In European countries such as Germany, in contrast, rising exports are expected to be a key factor in economic growth - though the OECD also warns that German output growth will be slow in 1994, with domestic demand not expected to pick up until 1995.</p>

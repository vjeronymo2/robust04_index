			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / International Company News: VW builds a platform for growth  -A look at the German carmaker's rationalisation plans Volkswagen's radical plan to rationalise its new product development and engineering operations is important for the group's chances of achieving long-term profitability. The strategy calls for a reduction in the number of the group's basic car chassis platforms from the present 16 to four by the early years of the next decade. 'It will take seven, eight or nine years to complete,' says Professor Ulrich Seiffert, VW research and development director and chairman of the group product strategy committee. The present 'platform confusion' results from the historical development of the group, he says, although he admits that earlier managements of which he was part had been too weak in failing to rationalise the group's sprawling product range. 'In a world of shrinking engineering capacities but global operations, and with the the opening of previously closed markets, there is a need for a new strategy,' he says. While VW has introduced new technology and platforms for its mainstream models, such as the third generation VW Golf launched in the autumn of 1991, it has left earlier generation models in production at overseas plants. Mr Ferdinand Piech, the controversial chairman of the VW group management board, who is leading a ruthless corporate revolution at Europe's biggest carmaker, is adamant that this wild proliferation must be controlled. The group's future product development will be streamlined. Prof Seiffert, who was demoted from the VW group board in one of Mr Piech's early purges of top management last year only to be reinstated on the board last autumn, is the man appointed to lead the implementation of the new platform strategy. He is introducing a strategy in which there will be only one lead developer in the group for each of four basic platforms, but there will be several users of each platform, which will develop their own distinctive models under their own brandnames. 'Under the skin' models off one platform will be largely identical with many shared components, but the parts of the car visible to the customer - for example body styling or interior trim - will differ. 'There are a lot of parts that we can make identical for all cars from one platform, the ABS braking system, the airconditioner, water pumps, airbags or fuel injection nozzles. You can standardise. No one is interested if the airbag inflator comes from one company or another. The customer only wants it to work,' says Prof Seiffert. All of the four platforms will be designed and developed in Germany, two by the Volkswagen division and two by Audi. Derivatives may then be developed by any of the four brandname divisions. Volkswagen will develop the AO small car (Polo) and the lower-medium (Golf) A platforms, while Audi will develop the executive car B platform and the luxury car D platform. The AO small car platform will be the basis for the new generation Polo to be launched in the autumn, but it will also spawn the replacement for the Skoda Favorit, and the next generation Seat Ibiza. The A platform will be the basis for the next generation Golf but also for a small Audi, for the Seat Toledo replacement and a new product range for Skoda. Prof Seiffert defines a car platform to include the drive train from radiator and fan to the engine and engine mountings, fuel lines, gearbox and gear shift, steering column, fuel tank, brakes and cables, exhaust system, front and rear axles, foot controls and wheels. For each platform these will be common, he insists. The differentiation will come in body styling, the dashboard, the seats, the bumpers - 'everything above the floor pan and the drive train'. He claims that 55 per cent to 60 per cent of the whole development cost for a new car is in the platform. This is where he hopes the savings will come. The platform leader may have 10 per cent more costs, but all the platform users will be saved the entire platform development cost. The gains Prof Seiffert promises to reap for the Volkswagen group include: increased flexibility and transparency between plants producing derivatives of the same platform. Production could be switched more easily between plants. 'We will be able to compare plants; there will be no discussion any more of the contents of the cars.' Greater certainty in the start-up phase of new models with shared parts and systems. Lower purchasing costs for components because of much higher purchasing volumes and improved chances for global sourcing. The new Golf A platform with its derivatives could be produced in a volume of 1m-1.5m units a year.</p>

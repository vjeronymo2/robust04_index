			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rains promise bumper oilseeds crop THE SEPTEMBER rains had left enough moisture in the subsoil to allow India to produce up to 11m tonnes of oilseeds during the winter, according to government figures. With the summer harvest estimated to have reached 10.9m tonnes that means total production for the 1992-93 season is likely to be nearly 3m tonnes above target at a record 21.9m tonnes, compared with 19.5m tonnes last year. The summer crop estimate comprises 5.7m tonnes of groundnuts, and 2.9m of soyabeans, as well as 700,000 tonnes of sunflowerseed, 700,000 tonnes of castor seed and 200,000 tonnes of niger. The technology mission on oilseeds, set up by the federal government six years ago to reduce the country's dependence on vegeteable oil imports, has been making efforts to promote oilseeds cultivation on scientific lines and the country has succeeded in bringing more and more land under oilseeds by giving good returns to the farmers. But productivity of about 800 kg a hectare is among the lowest in the world. According to government officials, the main reason for the low productivity is the limited use of hybrid seeds.</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERHAPS KAHN SHOULD NOT BE TOO SURPRISED AT LASORDA'S REACTION  </P> <P> Roger Kahn ought to go after the guy who wrote the Al Campanis column under his  name in the March 14 paper.  </P> <P> The writer is obviously an imposter, because the real Roger Kahn, the one who  wrote "The Boys of Summer," the one with wit and whimsy, would never write such  self-serving nonsense.  </P> <P> If Kahn were really as defensive as this guy sounds, nobody would blame Tom  Lasorda for giving him the cold shoulder.  </P> <P> Why would a person seek to justify himself two years later? Was that his last  great claim to fame?  </P> <P> ROBERT GOYETTE  </P> <P> Rolling Hills  </P></p>

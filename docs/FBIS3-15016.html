			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     Georgia's First Vice Foreign Minister Mikhail Ukleba says  the UN Security Council must adopt a resolution on sending  peacekeepers to the region if the next round of peace talks with  Abkhazia due in New York on March 7 fails.    Speaking in Moscow on Tuesday, he said Georgian leader  Eduard  Shevardnadze, who would be visiting the U.S. at the time, might  address a Security Council meeting on March 9.    Georgia is supportive of the idea of Russian troops being  moved into the region and of giving them the status of  peacekeepers, Ukleba told Interfax. At the same time, he spoke  of UN fears that as a neighboring state, Russia may fail to stay  neutral.    Ukleba expressed regret over the failure of the previous  round in Geneva, blaming it on "the destructive position" taken  by Abkhazia.    He said the warring sides were expected to sign two  documents  - a statement on measures for a negotiated settlement to the  regional conflict and an agreement for the return of refugees  and displaced persons to Abkhazia.    However, Abkhazia did not sign the statement because of  being  opposed to a clause on Georgia's territorial integrity, Ukleba  said. And he added that the Abkhazians must opt out of the talks  if they do not recognize Georgia's integrity as indicated by UN  resolutions.    On the refugee issue, Ukleba said that as a pre-condition  for  signing an agreement, Abkhazia insisted on screening Georgian  refugees to see whether or not they fought against Abkhazia.    Tbilisi puts the number of Georgians fleeing from Abkhazia  at  more than 300,000.</p>

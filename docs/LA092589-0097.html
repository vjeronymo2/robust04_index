			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELDERS POSTS 5% DECLINE IN ANNUAL PROFIT  </P> <P> The giant Australian conglomerate Elders IXL reported a 5% fall in annual  profit despite an increased thirst for its Foster's Lager.  </P> <P> Grain trading mistakes and bad debts in its finance division eroded profits.  "We made a series of wrong judgments, but we're not likely to do that again,"  Elders Agribusiness managing director Michael Nugent said.  </P> <P> "It was a satisfactory result from a very frustrating year," Chairman John  Elliott said after the company announced a $503-million profit.  </P> <P> He blamed the British government's decision to block his takeover of Scottish  and Newcastle Breweries for Elders not beating last year's bumper  $527.35-million profit.  </P> <P> Elders' sales of $13.6 billion were 15% higher than the previous year and made  the company Australia's largest in revenue terms.  </P> <P> British anti-monopolies agencies in March stopped Elders' $2.5-billion bid for  the Edinburgh brewer, trapping Elliott with a 23.6% stake. The interest bill on  that holding cut $41.7 million from Elders' profit and Elliott said it had also  frustrated his plans to use Scottish and Newcastle as a springboard to Europe.  </P> <P> "We had a very clear European strategy of centering the brewing business in  Britain, but we have been prevented from doing that," Elliott said, adding that  Elders was looking elsewhere in Europe.  </P> <P> Despite the frustrations in Europe, Elders' key label Foster's increased  worldwide sales by 17%, Elliott said. Profit from beer rose 23% to $408  million.  </P></p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Economic activity weakening rapidly ECONOMIC ACTIVITY is weakening rapidly in much of western Europe with falling business and consumer confidence posing 'a clear downside risk to prospects in most European countries', the Bank of England reports, Peter Norman writes. In a review of economic developments among the UK's leading trading partners the Bank says in its latest quarterly bulletin that worsening conditions in western Europe and Japan have been largely offset by strengthening in the US in the past three months. The US recovery means that growth for the 'major six' economies - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Canada - slowed only moderately to an annualised 1 per cent in the third quarter of last year from a 2.2 per cent annual rate in the first half. The French, Italian and German economies contracted in the third quarter of last year and the recession in Germany seemed set to continue into this year, the Bank says. But it expects the six will still achieve 'moderate growth' in aggregate in 1993. It adds that production is running below potential in all six countries, with 'output gaps' ranging from 0.4 per cent in Italy to 6.5 per cent in Canada. The average output gap of about 2 per cent will dampen in-flationary pressures in the six as a group.</p>

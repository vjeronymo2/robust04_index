			<p>BFN     [Text] Palestinian leader Faysal al-Husayni has denied  reports that he is setting up a shadow government, but in an  interview with Neil Sandler, al-Husayni confirmed that a  coordinating body of Palestinian institutions was being  established in East Jerusalem.    [Begin recording] [Al-Husayni] What we are doing is to make  a sort of coordination between the Palestinian institutions.  So, we will have no duplication, we will work with minimum  resources that we have to create the maximum work that we could.    [Sandler] And that is specifically what? Who are the people  that will be involved in this shadow government that you are  setting up, and will they be residents of East Jerusalem?    [Al-Husayni] Another time: We are not talking about a shadow  government. We are talking about institutions which is in  Jerusalem, and we are talking about education and decisions we  are [words indistinct] education, culture, health, other  institutions who are from long, long ago, which is work for the  peace and for creating the peace process. So all these  institutions, who are helping the Palestinian people, are in  need of a sort, as I told you, of coordination.    [Sandler] Now, how do you think this will sit with what  Prime  Minister Rabin has said about the fact -- and other Israeli  ministers -- about Palestinian institutions that should be  located in Jericho and not in Jerusalem?    [Al-Husayni] I don't believe that we have any of these  institutions who are part of the Palestinian Authority in  Jericho and Gaza. What we have here is institutions who were  working all the time before the Oslo agreement and after the  Oslo agreement. It was here before the Cairo agreement, and it  will continue after the Cairo agreement. There is some  institutions which is related to the peace process, and it will  going on until we will end all our negotiations concerning the  whole issue, including Jerusalem. [end recording]</p>

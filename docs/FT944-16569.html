			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Car sales up 3.8% in September West European new car sales rose by an estimated 3.8 per cent in September to 868,200 from 836,200 a year ago, according to provisional figures from Acea, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, released yesterday. The pace of the recovery has slowed in the last three months chiefly because of the weakness of the German new car market, where sales are estimated to have fallen last month by 4 per cent year-on-year to 245,400. In the first nine months new car sales in west Europe have risen by 5 per cent year-on-year to 9.25m, a modest recovery following a decline of more than 15 per cent in 1993. Sales have risen strongly in France, Spain and Scandinavia, but have declined in both Germany and Italy. New car sales in September declined in seven of 17 markets across west Europe compared with falls in five markets in the first nine months. Most significantly, a change in the system for reporting new car sales in Italy has revealed that previous Italian data had exaggerated the size of the Italian market by around 200,000 cars a year. The previous use of figures for wholesale deliveries to dealers rather than domestic registration figures has distorted the size of the market by including the high volume of cars being re-exported from Italy to neighbouring countries. Car prices in Italy are among the lowest in Europe following the devaluation of the lira. The new reporting system means Fiat has now been relegated to sixth place in the west European market. At the end of the 1980s Fiat was challenging the Volkswagen group for leadership of the west European market, but the sharp decline in its fortunes along with the fall in the Italian market mean it now has the smallest market share of any of the big six carmakers.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS                           January-September 1994  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Volume    Volume      Share (%)     Share (%)                          (Units)  Change (%)  Jan-Sept' 94  Jan-Sept' 93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET           9,252,300     +5.0        100.0         100.0 MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen group       1,474,900     +2.7         15.9          16.3  -Volkswagen             953,600     +0.4         10.3          10.8  -Seat                   240,700    +17.4          2.6           2.3  -Audi                   235,100     -2.5          2.5           2.7  -Skoda*                  45,400    +10.6          0.5           0.5 General Motors***      1,196,000     +3.7         12.9          13.1  -Opel/Vauxhall        1,141,900     +3.2         12.3          12.6  -Saab**                  38,800    +27.7          0.4           0.3 PSA Peugeot Citroen    1,180,800    +11.0         12.8          12.1  -Peugeot                710,300     +9.7          7.7           7.3  -Citroen                470,500    +13.0          5.1           4.7 Ford group***          1,114,100     +7.2         12.0          11.8  -Ford                 1,104,300     +7.2         12.0          11.7  -Jaguar                   7,800    -10.4          0.1           0.1 Renault                1,000,700     +7.9         10.8          10.5 Fiat group****           979,400     +3.7         10.6          10.7  -Fiat                   768,100     +8.3          8.3           8.0  -Lancia                 123,500     -6.7          1.3           1.5  -Alfa Romeo              77,600    -15.9          0.8           1.0 BMW group                607,000     +6.9          6.6           6.4  -Rover                  305,900     +9.0          3.3           3.2  -BMW                    301,100     +4.8          3.3           3.3 Mercedes-Benz            335,500    +29.3          3.6           2.9 Nissan                   306,200     -3.3          3.3           3.6 Toyota                   244,200     -4.2          2.6           2.9 Volvo                    155,200    +20.0          1.7           1.5 Mazda                    141,000     -9.9          1.5           1.8 Honda                    133,900     +5.4          1.4           1.4 Mitsubishi                92,500    -18.0          1.0           1.3 Suzuki                    59,000    -22.3          0.6           0.9 Total Japanese         1,028,300     -7.2         11.1          12.6 MARKETS: Germany                2,462,400     -0.8         26.6          28.2 United Kingdom         1,588,300     +9.5         17.2          16.5 France                 1,434,200    +14.4         15.5          14.2 Italy                  1,271,400     -7.5         13.7          15.6 Spain                    682,800    +21.0          7.4           6.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *VW holds 31 per cent and management control of Skoda. ***Includes cars imported from US and sold in western Europe. **GM holds 50 per cent and management control of Saab Automobile. **** Fiat group includes Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Innocenti, Ferrari and Maserati.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: ACEA (European Automobile Manufacturers Association) estimates.

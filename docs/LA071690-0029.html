			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> COUNCIL STUDIES ROAD FEE WAIVERS  </P> <P> The Moorpark City Council is considering waiving road improvement fees for  churches and other tax-exempt organizations that want to expand their  facilities.  </P> <P> Under the current policy, commercial builders, including churches, must pay  between $1,560 and $3,553 per acre to improve roads and other public services  near their developments.  </P> <P> If the council approves the new policy at its July 25 meeting, it would be a  financial windfall for at least two Moorpark churches.  </P> <P> Grace Chapel Foursquare Church, which moved in January from Walnut Street to a  new $200,000 building on Los Angeles Avenue, could receive a $5,000 refund if  the policy is approved.  </P> <P> And Moorpark Presbyterian Church, which will build a 23,000-square-foot complex  under a plan approved by the council last week, would not have to pay about  $25,000 in road improvement fees.  </P> <P> Members of the church been planning for the past five years to build the  complex, which will contain offices, classrooms and a meeting hall, on a  seven-acre site at Peach Hill and Spring Road. Last week, the Rev. David  Benefiel said the fee waiver would be a blessing.  </P> <P> Organizations, including some nonprofit hospitals, would be eligible for the  fee waiver if they are exempt from paying taxes under federal laws.

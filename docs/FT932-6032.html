			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Serbs step up attacks in key Bosnian areas BOSNIAN Serbs appeared to be taking advantage of the international community's delay in implementing the Washington accord on Moslem 'safe areas' by stepping up attacks on key areas in the east of the country still under Moslem control. The industrial town of Gorazde, the last Moslem stronghold in eastern Bosnia, came under heavy attack. Bosnian radio said 11 people were killed and 34 injured in artillery attacks on Gorazde, where the population of 35,000 is thought to have doubled with the arrival of refugees from nearby areas. Gorazde is one of six UN-designated 'safe areas' for Moslems in Bosnia. But a UN convoy bringing humanitarian aid was unable to reach the town on Sunday. There was renewed fighting in the town of Brcko in northeast Bosnia as Serb forces resumed their efforts to broaden a corridor linking Serbia with Serb-held areas in eastern and western Bosnia. The Serbs have forced most Moslems to evacuate the town. Agencies reported that fighting that broke out in the southwest city of Mostar between Bosnian Croats and Moslem-led government forces on Sunday evening lasted into the night and small arms fire was still reported yesterday morning. A senior UN refugee official yesterday accused Bosnian Croat troops of launching an 'ethnic cleansing' campaign in Mostar and expelling scores of Moslems daily. Mr Peter Kessler, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said several elderly Moslems had been 'terrorised to death', suffering heart attacks after Croat militiamen invaded their homes and ordered them out. 'This is ethnic cleansing of up to 100 people a day and it has been picking up in the past few days,' he told Reuters. After heavy shelling on Sunday, in which 24 people were reported killed and more than 170 wounded, Sarajevo was quiet yesterday.</p>

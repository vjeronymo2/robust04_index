			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / International Company News: Thrifts industry returns to black THE US savings and loan industry reported Dollars 893.6m in profits in the fourth quarter of 1991 for an annual profit of Dollars 1.97bn, the industry's first profitable year since 1986, Reuter reports. The Office of Thrift Supervision director Mr Timothy Ryan called it a 'milestone' for the industry and said it showed thrift finances were stabilising. He said lower interest rates and gains from asset sales accounted for much of the improvement in fourth-quarter profits. The fourth-quarter earnings compared with a revised third-quarter profit of Dollars 188m and a Dollars 1.5bn loss in the fourth quarter a year ago.</p>

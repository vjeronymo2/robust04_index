			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Japanese PM assailed on yen Japan's two-week-old government was yesterday accused by the opposition of lacking the economic policies needed to stem the yen's inexorable rise. Komeito, the Clean Government party, a member of the previous government, accused Mr Tomiichi Murayama's three-party coalition of lacking the 'will and ability to pursue economic reforms'. The yen hit another new high of Y97.07 to the dollar in Tokyo, rekindling fears that its 16.7 per cent rise against the US currency since the beginning of January could choke Japan's nascent economic recovery. At the weekend Group of Seven summit in Naples, Tokyo failed to obtain even a discussion of co-ordinated intervention to support the dollar, Mr Masayoshi Takemura, finance minister, admitted yesterday. Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, stepped up the campaign for joint intervention by repeating alarm over the yen's renewed rise yesterday at a meeting of the Bank for International Settlements. According to a survey by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun economic daily, Japan's top 200 companies believe taxable profits will fall by 10.2 per cent this year, the fifth annual decline, if the dollar stabilises at Y95. Pre-tax profits will fall by 3.4 per cent this year if the dollar sticks at Y100, they told the survey. The government, a coalition led by the conservative Liberal Democratic party and Mr Murayama's left-wing Social Democratic party, also came under Komeito criticism yesterday for lacking a 'clear-cut policy' on North Korea and the change of leadership there. Komeito claimed that Mr Murayama's performance at the G7 summit raised doubts over Japan's international credibility. The exigencies of Japan's domestic politics have forced the government to delay by a week, until July 22, a visit by Mr Murayama to South Korea, to discuss bilateral relations and the nuclear threat. Officials said Mr Murayama needed time to prepare for his first opportunity to face his political foes in public when he delivers his first policy speech to parliament next Monday, followed by two days of questions.</p>

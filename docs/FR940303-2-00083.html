			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In basing the opinions set forth in this opinion on ``our [my] knowledge,'' the words ``our [my] knowledge'' signify that, in the course of our [my] representation of the Owner, no facts have come to our [my] attention that would give us [me] actual knowledge or actual notice that any such opinions or other matters are not accurate. Except as otherwise stated in this opinion, we [I] have undertaken no investigation or verification of such matters. Further, the words ``our [my] knowledge'' as used in this opinion are intended to be limited to the actual knowledge of the attorneys within our [my] firm who have been involved in representing the Owner in any capacity including, but not limited to, in connection with the Capital Advance. We [I] have no reason to believe that any of the documents on which we [I] have relied contain matters which, or the assumptions contained herein, are untrue, contrary to known facts, or unreasonable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In reaching the opinions set forth below, we [I] have assumed, and to our [my] knowledge there are no facts inconsistent with, the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Each of the parties to the Documents, other than the Owner (and any person executing any of the Documents on behalf of the Owner), has duly and validly executed and delivered each such instrument, document, and agreement to be executed in connection with the Capital Advance to which such party is a signatory, and such party's obligations set forth in the Documents are its legal, valid, and binding obligations, enforceable in accordance with this respective terms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Each person executing any of the Documents, other than the Owner (and any person executing any of the Documents on behalf of the Owner), whether individually or on behalf of an entity, is duly authorized to do so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Each natural person executing any of the Documents is legally competent to do so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) All signatures of parties other than the Owner (and any person executing any of the Documents on behalf of Owner) are genuine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) All Documents which were submitted to us [me] as originals are authentic; all Documents which were submitted to us [me] as certified or photostatic copies conform to the original document, and all public records reviewed are accurate and complete.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) All applicable Documents have been duly filed, indexed, and recorded among the appropriate official records, and all fees, charges, and taxes due and owing as of this date have been paid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) The parties to the Documents and their successors and assigns will: (i) Act in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner in the exercise of any rights or enforcement of any remedies under the Documents; (ii) not engage in any conduct in the exercise of such rights or enforcement of such remedies that would constitute other than fair and impartial dealing; and (iii) comply with all requirements of applicable procedural and substantive law in exercising any rights or enforcing any remedies under the Documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) The exercise of any rights or enforcement of any remedies under the Documents would not be unconscionable, result in a breach of the peace, or otherwise be contrary to public policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The Owner has title or other interest in each item of (i) real and (ii) tangible personal property (``Personalty'') comprising the Property in which a security interest is purported to be granted under the Documents [and, where Personalty is to be acquired after the date hereof, a security interest is created under the after-acquired property clause of the Security Agreement].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In rendering this opinion we [I] also have assumed that the Documents accurately reflect the complete understanding of the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated thereby and the rights and the obligations of the parties thereunder. We [I] also have assumed that the terms and the conditions of the Capital Advance as stated in the Documents have not been amended, modified or supplemented, directly or indirectly, by any other agreement or understanding of the parties or waiver of any of the material provisions of the Documents. After reasonable inquiry of the Owner, we [I] have no knowledge of any facts or information that would lead us [me] to believe that the assumptions in this paragraph not justified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In rendering this, we [I] also have assumed that: (i) all Personalty in which a security interest is created under the Documents (other than accounts or goods of a type normally used in more than one jurisdiction) is located at the Property and (ii) Owner's [Chief Executive Office] [only place of business] [residence] is located in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXXXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . After reasonable inquiry of the Owner, we [I] have no knowledge of any facts or information that would lead us [me] to believe that the assumptions in this paragraph are not justified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

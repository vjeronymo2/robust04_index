			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Samir Ghawshah, member of the PLO </F> Executive Committee and the Palestinian National Authority, in  Tunis, by Fawzi al-Jundi, in Cairo; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Al-Jundi] Dr. Ghawshah, the Palestinian Authority's  meeting yesterday no doubt focused on its new tasks. What are  these new tasks in light of the available resources?    [Ghawshah] During the meeting we discussed our working  program and the tasks we must undertake. The Palestinian  National Authority is taking over after 27 years of Israeli  occupation. We have major tasks and responsibilities. Our  discussions are serious and responsible because they deal with  all the political, economic, social, and cultural issues. It  was therefore necessary to hold an initial discussion of the  National Authority's tasks and program ahead.    [Al-Jundi] Dr. Ghawshah, doubtless the new Palestinian  authority faces many obstacles, notably the economic conditions  in Gaza and Jericho. What efforts is the PLO making in this  regard?    [Ghawshah] The main obstacle has to do with the Israeli  occupation, both with regard to eliminating its aftereffects in  the areas from which the Israelis have withdrawn and fully  implementing the Declaration of Principles. A major economic  problem we are facing now resulted from the Israeli occupation's  policy of annexing and merging the Palestinian economy with  Israel's, disrupting and ruining the economy and in some cases  leading to a total loss of the infrastructure necessary for  economic activity.    [Al-Jundi] Dr. Ghawshah, according to World Bank sources the  Palestinian autonomous areas will obtain $1 billion over the  next three years, part of an overall $2-billion package to be  distributed in three stages. How can these economic resources  best be utilized to encourage development in the Palestinian  autonomous areas?    [Ghawshah] I would like first to say that the Palestinians  have made all the administrative and organizational preparations  to build a sound economy in line with international  specifications and conditions. Despite the promises of aid, no  aid or loans have been received. We hope this will happen soon,  especially as our people inside the occupied territories are  suffering from the effects of occupation. Because of the  sieges, particularly the siege of Gaza, our people badly need to  begin economic development and reconstruction. This will ease  our people's economic difficulties. We hope the World Bank and  the donor countries' promises and commitments will be kept.    [Al-Jundi] Dr. Ghawshah, let us move a little from the  economic side of the Palestinian Authority to the security side  and the situation in Gaza and Jericho. The Israeli Foreign  Ministry issued a statement protesting Palestinian president  Yasir 'Arafat's abrogation of the law applied in Gaza and  Jericho since 1967 and his reinstating earlier laws. Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres said the Palestinians should be given the  opportunity to adjust in the self- rule areas. How do you see  things now?    [Ghawshah] I would like first to say something about  security. Our people, in what were the occupied areas, including  those opposed to the self-rule agreement, welcomed the  Palestinian police and security forces with open arms. Another  thing: It is the right of the Palestinian National Authority to  make decisions as it sees fit to consolidate its role and  provide our people with services.    The decision by brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] on  reinstating earlier laws is an interim measure pending the  passage of new laws by the Palestinian Authority. Naturally,  following the withdrawal of Israeli forces, the military orders  of these forces could not remain in effect in Gaza and Jericho.    If any issues merited objection, such issues should be  clarified by returning to the Declaration of Principles. The  Declaration of Principles specifies the Palestinian authority's  powers and notes its right to pass laws and legislation. If  Israel has any objection, it can raise it procedurally instead  of disputing the power of the Palestinian Authority to pass laws  and legislation.    [Al-Jundi] Thank you.    [Ghawshah] You're welcome.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Markets are not always right Sir, I imagine Stephen Butler (Letters, October 3) has little practical experience of financial markets, judging by his faith in them over central bankers. Even casual observation - as opposed to simple economic theory - leads to the conclusion that most market participants can be wrong for some of the time. Eventually they realise their mistake and the market corrects - often dramatically. Who I wonder, on average, is the most 'trustworthy' when predicting inflation? Large numbers of traders with little option but to follow the prevailing 'market view', or central bankers appointed by politicians but with reputations to develop? Difficult one, that.

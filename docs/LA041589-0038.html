			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REBELLION THWARTED, CHAD REPORTS  </P> <P> The government of Chad says it thwarted a rebellion against President Hissen  Habre, and neighboring Sudan said the three leaders of the attempted coup  escaped to Sudan.  </P> <P> Sudanese soldiers were disarming Chadian troops who had crossed the border, a  Sudanese official said.  </P> <P> Chad identified the plotters as Hassan Djamous, commander in chief of the armed  forces; Idriss Debi, his predecessor; and Interior Minister Ibrahim Mahamat  Itno.  </P> <P> The government, in a communique released by the Chadian Embassy in Paris, said  the coup leaders "entered into rebellion against the institutions of the  republic" on the night of April 1-2.  </P> <P> The communique said the armed forces were "ordered to destroy" the plotters and  "put an end to the rebellion by annihilation."  </P> <P> Asked about the fate of the ringleaders, the Chadian Embassy would say only  that the plot had been uncovered and its authors and accomplices rendered  harmless.  </P> <P> Diplomatic sources in N'Djamena, capital of the African nation, said that Itno  was arrested and that Djamous and Debi had disappeared.  </P> <P> Itno took a leading role in negotiations that led to the Habre government's  reconciliation with numerous political opponents who had been engaged in a long  civil war with the government.  </P> <P> Habre has ruled Chad since 1982, when he ousted a Libyan-backed government led  by Goukouni Oueddei.  </P></p>

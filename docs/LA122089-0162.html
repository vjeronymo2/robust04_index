			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> FELLOW ARTISTS HONOR MCCARTNEY  </P> <P> Fellow musicians gave Beatle Paul McCartney an award and a standing ovation for  his contribution to popular music.  </P> <P> McCartney said the recognition Tuesday by the Performing Rights Society, which  ensures composers receive payments for all public performances of their music,  was one of the most important he had ever received.  </P> <P> "These are all people who have written great lyrics, and to be honored by them  is something very special," said McCartney, a society member for more than 25  years.  </P> <P> McCartney paid tribute to his fellow Beatles -- Ringo Starr, George Harrison  and the late John Lennon -- and accepted a miniature gold copy of the Hofner  guitar he made famous.  </P> <P> McCartney, who has just finished the American leg of his first world tour in 13  years, said the tour is "going marvelously." He said he is particularly looking  forward to "the British fans, that part is nostalgic."  </P> <P> McCartney's first British concert is Jan. 2 in Birmingham.  </P></p>

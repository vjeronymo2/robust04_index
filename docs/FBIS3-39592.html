Aizpeolea report: "Fraga Asks Gonzalez for Overall </F> Pact To Complete Implementation of Autonomy"]    [Text] Madrid -- The autonomy battle is reaching fever  pitch again. While Catalonia and the Basque Country are in  favor of developing a bilateral relationship with the central  government, other communities are aiming at an overall agreement  in order to complete the implementation of autonomy. Galician  government Premier Manuel Fraga (People's Party) proposed the  latter option -- a national pact with the participation of all  the communities -- to Felipe Gonzalez at the Moncloa Palace  yesterday.    Fraga's stance is similar to that of Socialist Manuel  Chaves,  the Andalusia premier, who a week ago criticized the boost to  autonomy in some communities, referring to Catalonia and the  Basque Country, and proposed to Felipe Gonzalez that the  implementation of autonomy be completed in a balanced manner for  all regions. Gonzalez has shown himself receptive to these  proposals, according to what Fraga stated yesterday, following a  meeting lasting over an hour with the prime minister.    The similar proposals made by the Galician and Andalusian  premiers assume major political importance by being put forward  after the central government offered the Basque government a  package of 20 transfers [of areas of responsibility] and on the  eve of Generalitat [Catalan autonomous government] Premier Jordi  Pujol's meeting with Felipe Gonzalez in order to secure a  breakthrough in autonomy for Catalonia.    Both the Catalan Generalitat and the Basque government want  to maintain bilateral relations with the state, but the Galician  premier, in harmony with the stance upheld by Chaves a week ago,  showed his rejection of that course yesterday. "We do not  believe in a bilateral negotiation between the central  government and an autonomous government. My administration's  proposal never casts doubt on the idea that the formulas are  valid for all the autonomous communities. Now that there is an  agreement for the `slow track' autonomous communities, as  enshrined in the 1982 autonomy pacts, and agreement that another  pact must be reached for the municipalities, this is the time to  reach a major national agreement in order to complete the  implementation of autonomy," Fraga said yesterday.  <H5>  Single Administration </H5>   The Xunta [Galician autonomous government] premier also  confirmed that he will send his single administration proposal,  which will be contained in a white paper, to the prime minister  and to the premiers of the 17 autonomous communities.    Yesterday Fraga demanded from Gonzalez a package of  transfers  -- the Social Institute of the Navy, the material resources of  the administration of justice, vocational training, the National  Employment Institute, the ports of general interest, and the  libraries.    Gonzalez and Fraga examined the problems of the dairy sector  in his community. The head of government proposed to Fraga that  the 10 billion peseta fine for milk surpluses in Galicia during  the past farming year be renegotiated with the Agriculture  Ministry and the European Commission.    The understanding between Gonzalez and Fraga on an issue  that  concerns the government as much as the configuration of the  state was "tremendously important," according to the Xunta  premier. Fraga gave Gonzalez a helping hand by stating that he  finds no power vacuum, in clear contradiction with the  assertions by the previous day by Rodrigo Rato, his party's  parliamentary spokesman.</p>

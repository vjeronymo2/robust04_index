			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Next stage of Russian asset sales blocked Russian reformers will press President Boris Yeltsin to sign a decree giving a legal base to the second, crucial phase of privatisation - after the state duma, or lower house, refused to pass the government's privatisation bill by a large majority on Wednesday night. In the first phase, some 70 per cent of state enterprises were auctioned in exchange for vouchers. Yesterday, Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime minister for privatisation, made clear he would push ahead with a second stage under which the rest would be privatised for cash. 'The president must act,' he said. The government hopes that the industrial restructuring process, still in its infancy, will take off in the second round, pushed by Russian - and to a lesser extent foreign - investors seeking to make enterprises profitable and competitive. A long fight with parliament over such a key issue would be a severe setback for a government pointing with increasing confidence to signs of recovery. But the road still appears open for compromise, the more so since the bill was not thrown out but referred to a commission for further work. Mr Sergei Burkov, a centrist deputy who presented a report on the bill to the duma, said that the programme would sell off state assets at an artificially low price; that commercial banks had to be given greater rights to take part in the privatisation process; and that closed joint stock societies, formed in the early stages of privatisation to keep shares within a narrow circle, usually of directors, should not be forced to open up. Mr Chubais had earlier pressed for a decree to allow the privatisation process to start, but had been turned down by President Yeltsin, who insisted on the parliamentary route. A decree on this subject, where parliament has clearly shown the wish at least to amend the legislation, would raise the political temperature, which has so far been mild. A meeting of government and deputies today, called to discuss economic reform, will be told that tax collection for the first six months is running at only a little over 60 per cent of the estimated level and that inflation, down to 4 per cent in June, will surge to around 10-11 per cent in August because of the payment of delayed salaries.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tatsuo Hata, Osaka University Professor: "Right </F> Now Is a Good Opportunity To Introduce a System of Taxpayer ID  Numbers: It is Necessary in Order To Thoroughly Capture Income  Tax and Prevent Government Corruption"]    [Text] The  current debate on the tax system, in which an increase in  consumption tax is being called for, using "correction of the  direct-indirect ratio" as a slogan, is putting the cart before  the horse. Japan's tax rate for direct tax is still low. The  main point of tax system reform should be placed on increasing  the rate of income tax which is captured, which up till now was  merely a dream. What we need for that purpose is introduction of  a system of taxpayer ID numbers.  <H5>  Japan's Income Tax Rates Are Still Low </H5>   In the tax system debate that is currently going on, it is  taken as a premise that increasing the consumption tax is  obvious as a long-term reform of the tax system. What has been  used as grounds for this is the concept "correcting the  direct-indirect ratio." The direct-indirect ratio is low in  developing countries and highest in the most advanced countries,  such as Japan and the United States. This means they seek to  lower Japan's direct-indirect ratio to a level equal to that of  Europe, which is in the middle. Everyone thinks that if there is  no margin for raising income tax above what it is now, an  increase in the consumption tax may be unavoidable.    But what is helpful in judging whether the rate of income  tax  is too high is not the direct-indirect ratio; it is  international comparison of the income tax rate, itself. Let us  assume that Japan's rate of income tax is the highest from the  viewpoint of international comparison. Even in such a case, it  would not mean that the view that there is no margin for raising  the income tax rate higher than this would have great persuasive  force, but it would at least be necessary to listen attentively  to that view. Conversely, if Japan's income tax rate is low  compared with foreign countries, one could say that, from the  viewpoint of international comparison there is margin for  raising it, however high the direct-indirect ratio might be.    The graph [not reproduced] shows the ratio of personal  income  tax to GDP [gross domestic product] for the advanced countries  of the OECD. As is clear from the graph, Japan's tax rate is  strikingly low. It is second from the bottom after France.  Japan's tax rate is 7.6 percent; Denmark's is 26 percent.  Consequently, Japan's income tax rate is still very low, so  there is margin for raising it greatly in the future.    The doubt may arise that, although this is the case on  average, Japan's income tax rate for workers is high when their  income exceeds 10 million yen. But, in contrast to Japan's  effective tax rate of 14 percent on income of 10 million yen, it  is 23 percent in the United States, and in England it is about  27 percent. Actually, compared with the United States, Japan's  tax rate for incomes of 19 million yen and below is lower  (calculated at a rate of 107 yen to the dollar). Compared with  England, Japan's effective tax rate is lower on incomes up to  about 25 million yen. Japan's income tax rate is this low even  when compared with the United States and England, where  flattening out of income tax by Reagan and Thatcher was carried  out.    When debating whether Japan's income tax rate can be raised  above this, let us decide soon to stop fraudulently substituting  the direct-indirect ratio for the problem, and grasp the fact  that the income tax that we are paying is uncommonly low.  <H5>  Progressive Income Tax Is an "Insurance System" </H5>   The object of taxes is not just to pay for government  finances. The income-redistribution function is also important.  People are getting different incomes based on effort, talentm  and luck. Many people are making a living by their own efforts,  but their incomes differ greatly depending on talent and luck.    If we compare persons, now 50 years old, who are employed in  steel companies with those employed in banks, the salary of one  is probably about twice that of the other. About 30 years ago,  when they got their jobs, the dynamic persons who were the cream  of the cream joined the steel company. Nevertheless, now their  incomes amount to only one-half that of the bank employees,  whose only merit is steadiness. In this way, people's lifetime  incomes end up differing greatly because of the success or  failure of the industry in which they happened to obtain  employment. Even within the same industry, for instance even in  the case of newspaper companies, one hears that there are some  examples in which salaries differ by 100 percent depending on a  company's good or bad luck.    An important role performed by a progressive income tax is  that, in such a case, fortunate persons, who happened to obtain  employment in an industry or company that continues to expand,  share part of their good fortune with persons whose luck was bad.    Furthermore, of course, such persons as author Jiro Akagawa,  baseball's Hiromitsu Ochiai and Joji Tokoro strive hard, but  they are getting high incomes more because they happened to be  born overflowing with talent. It is also thanks to the  progressive income tax that persons who were born blessed with  talent pay part of their high incomes as tax, so that it is  possible to lower by that much the tax rate of us ordinary  people, who are working hard night and day but are not blessed  with talent.    We do not know what kind of talent and luck our children and  grandchildren will have at birth. We can consider that the  progressive income tax by which they are forced to pay high tax  when everything goes well and they are born with talent, and  they gain employment in a fortunate company and have reached the  point of being able to have an affluent life, is insurance for a  time when things did not go well.    There are all sorts of risks in living in a liberal society.  However astute one may be, there is a limit to judging the  future of one's own company or industry. One can consider a  progressive income tax to be an insurance system for that  purpose.  <H5>  Opponents of a System of Taxpayer ID Numbers </H5>   Japan's income tax rate is uncommonly low compared with all  countries. Why did the authorities decide, nevertheless, that,  unlike foreign countries, Japan alone must be satisfied with a  low income tax rate? Furthermore, what was the occasion which  decided the course of raising the rate on the consumption tax,  which does not have the function of income redistribution, and  lowering the income tax rate?    It was when the green card system collapsed. After that, the  Ministry of Finance quickly revised the orbit, the direction of  which, up till now, had been the taxing of assets, and shifted  its positon to a policy of seriously carrying out introduction  of a large indirect tax, which ultimately came to fruition as  the consumption tax. There is much which escapes taxation with  the income tax, and it has reached a situation in which  government throws up its hands in defeat, and because of the  failure of the green card system it was probably judged to be  politically impossible to correct this situation. It worked out  that if they could not correct the escape of taxes which should  be obtained, they would introduce a consumption tax which  everyone would pay without escape.    There are two types of escape from taxation. The first is  escape in asset income tax and asset tax. The system of taxpayer  ID numbers which is employed in such places as the United  States, Canada, Australia, and the countries of northern Europe  is indispensible for the purpose of preventing this escape. The  second, called 9-6-4, is the low rate of capture for the income  of farmers and the self-employed. But this, too, can be improved  greatly by an accurate grasp of assets. If assets increase it is  also clear that there existed income that was its source.  Moreover, if, as in the United States, transactions are done  mainly by check rather than by cash, a number is registered on  the checking account, so it becomes difficult to hide the income  itself.    Consequently, at the stage before introducing an income tax,  the authorities had to select one of these two options as a  measure against income escaping taxation. One of them was to  introduce a system of taxpayer ID numbers, grasp income  accurately, and change to a tax system centered on income tax.  The other was to choose "defeatism." In other words, it was to  give up on grasping income and switch to a tax system centered  on consumption tax, which does not have the function of  redistributing income.    But introduction of a system of taxpayer ID numbers means  exposing clearly to the eyes of tax authorities the financial  asset transactions of all persons. This was a troublesome matter  to conservative party politicians. Firstly, the holding of  financial assets by the politicians, themselves, would end up  becoming clear to the tax authorities. If that happened, it  would become very difficult to conceal it if they had  bribery-type income that they wanted to keep secret. Second, it  would become easy to discover the state of stock trading by  politicians using the government's inside information. Because  if there were a person who was always profiting abnormally by  stock to the extent that it could not be explained as a  coincidence when viewed in terms of mathematical statistics, one  would discover it by collecting information for each taxpayer ID  number, and the investigation of insider trading would begin  from there.    Third, if we ban making political contributions by cash, and  arrange it so that they are made only by check, it will become  impossible for contributors to invent expenditures which are  unaccounted for. A number is registered on the checking account,  so it means one cannot have an account in a false name.  Political contributions will end up being in full view of the  public.    This was something that ruling party politicians wanted to  avoid by all means. This is symbolized by the fact that the one  who urged destruction of the green card system was none other  than Shin Kanemaru. Michio Watanabe, who was minister of finance  when the consumption tax debate began, stated that "those who  advocate introducing a system of taxpayer ID numbers have  schoolgirlish tastes." The feeling of conservative party  politicians toward taxpayer numbers is also expressed well in  that statement.    In other words, the choice between a consumption tax and a  system of taxpayer ID numbers was also a matter of judging  whether or not one could eradicate politicians' corruption.  Under the political conditions at the time, the government and  the ruling party decided to preserve corruption as something  natural, so under Prime Minister Takeshita the consumption tax  was introduced.  <H5>  Why Is a Number System Necessary? </H5>   The real reason why the conservative government feared a  system of taxpayer ID numbers has now become clear to everyone's  eyes. Most of Japan's governors are afraid of being arrested for  bribery by general contractors, and the actual situation that  contributions through the covernors flowed from the provinces  and were collected by leading politicians of the central  government is also becoming clear. The decisively important  system for changing this structure of money-government  corruption is the introduction of taxpayer ID numbers. Unless we  introduce this system, it will be impossible to make  politicians' financial assets and transactions clear to the  public no matter what kind of election system reforms are  carried out.    Introduction of an ID number system would also protect  Japan's income tax-centered tax system. Introduction of an ID  number system would also improve the tax system in the following  points in addition to those listed up till now.    First, it would make it easier to levy a tax on profit from  transfer of stocks and bonds. In Japan, transfer profit obtained  from the purchase or sale of stocks and bonds is practically tax  exempt. A tax is levied on presumed profit from transfer, but  this is about the same as a transaction tax. How unfair it is  that the profit from transfer of stocks or bonds obtained by a  millionaire is not taxed, in spite of the fact that the interest  of persons with savings accounts are taxed, however small the  account. It is necessary to newly establish a tax on profit from  transfer of stocks and bonds, and to levy it at the same rate as  the tax on savings-account interest.    Second, introduction of taxpayer ID numbers is indispensible  in order to eliminate avoidance of inheritance tax. Inheritance  tax is the most important tax system for the purpose of  maintaining fairness of distribution. But in the present  situation, one does not know accurately who has how much stock,  so it is judged that there is considerable tax evasion in the  inheritance of stock. If a list is made of all financial assets  by means of a number, it will be possible to prevent this kind  of evasion of inheritance tax.    The third concerns taxing of pensions. When one considers  government financing of pensions, it is wasteful for wealthy  people to receive pensions exempt from taxes. Yet if one levies  a tax on pensions, a new injustice occurs. Because in the  present situation, in which the assets income of old people is  not accurately known, there appear many old people who, although  they really have a high asset income, escape being taxed, as  persons whose total income, including pension, is below the  tax-exempt point. An accurate knowledge of asset income by  taxpayer ID numbers would also be helpful from this point.    An ID number system is also necessary for redistribution in  the aspect of annual expenditure. For example, it has been  pointed out for a long time that scholarships from scholarship  societies go to the children of farmers and the self-employed,  who ride around in foreign cars, but that children of salaried  workers cannot get them. It is said that also among the  residents of Osaka's public housing designed for low-income  persons, there are few salaried workers and many persons who are  self-employed. These phenomena have arisen because it has become  impossible to judge who really has a low income, because 90  percent of salaried income is known, but only 60 percent of  self-employed income and 40 percent of agricultural income.    By being able to more accurately account for the entire  income of each individual, it will become clear who really has a  low income, so by this means the income-limit conditions for  such things as social security and scholarships will function  effectively, and sufficient redistribution of income will be  made to the necessary people.  <H5>  Keep Income Tax Reduction to a Minimum </H5>   The biggest criticism of taxpayer ID numbers is that they  violate privacy. There are two types of argument, the natures of  which are completely different. The first is a criticism that  conservative party politicians like to make: "It will be  troublesome if the tax authorities stick their hands in  taxpayers' wallets."    But an income tax system cannot be realized if taxpayers can  hide the content of their income from the tax authorities on the  grounds of privacy. Anyhow, the income of salaried employees is  already known completely. The kind of argument given above is no  different from saying "We would like you to protect preferential  tax treatment for wealthy persons, and refrain from  investigating whether politicians have violated the law."    The second criticism of violating privacy is that there is a  possibility that administrative authorities would use for a  political objective information about a taxpayer's asset income  which was obtained by introduction of the ID number system. This  criticism is valid.    Actually, unless there are clear preventive measures, there  is a very strong danger that administrative authorities would  use tax information for the purpose of entrapping critics and  persons who became political obstacles. Information related to  collection of taxes is, by nature, a sword that administrative  authorities, potentially, can misuse, regardless of whether  there is an ID number.    We, too, must adopt the misuse-prevention measures employed  by countries that use taxpayer ID numbers, such as the United  States, Sweden, Australia, and Canada.    The policy to lower the income tax rate and raise the  consumption tax rate in Japan, where the income tax rate is  strikingly low among advanced countries, is a phenomenon which  is inseparable from the fact that it was impossible to introduce  a system of taxpayer ID numbers because of government corruption.    Therefore, introduction of taxpayer ID numbers is also an  indispensible device for eliminating government corruption. It  will at the same time bring to fruition a tax system centered on  income tax and without a consumption tax.    Now, when the combination of introduction of taxpayer ID  numbers and a tax system centered on income tax is in sight,  income tax reduction as a measure for stimulating the economy  should be kept to a minimum. In particular, we should not lower  the highest tax rate. This is a trump card which we must save  carefully for now as payment for introduction of a system of ID  numbers.</p>

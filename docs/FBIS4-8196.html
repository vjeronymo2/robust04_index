			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Scepan Aleksic report from Cajnice] </F>   [Text] Finally, all the pieces of the mosaic of events on  the Gorazde battlefield linked to the U.S. bombing of civlian  targets and positions of the Herzegovina Corps have been put  together.    Yesterday, at approximately 1445, the attack was repeated in  the region of the Serbian village of Bare, which is 2 km from  Gorazde, the command of the Herzegovina Corps has confirmed.  However, it was not the tanks of the Srpska republic army that  were hit, as NATO representatives claim, but ambulance vehicles  of the Serbian forces. On that occasion two paramedics from  Gacko were killed, while two ambulance vehicles were competely  destroyed.    Two Serbian homes, whose residents had fled from the Muslim  onslaught nearly two years ago, were razed. The Americans fired  rockets of the biggest caliber and dropped bombs of enormous  weight. This conclusion is implied by the information that one  of the rockets penetrated three 20-centimeter thick concrete  plates. All this was most probably done in agreement with the  Muslim side, as thick black smoke was rising from the houses in  Gorazde directly prior to yesterday's bombing. In this way the  Muslims marked the zone which the Americans should not pound.    At the same time as the attack of the U.S. aircraft, an  infantry attack of the Muslim formations from Gorazde at the  Serbian positions started, supported substantially by recoilless  guns, mortars, antiaircraft guns, and rocket launchers. Where  the Muslims in Gorazde, which is a UN protected area, obtained  all these arms and ammunition from, only they and NATO  representatives know. However, they did not succeed in moving  the Serbian positions.    The details of the U.S. atttack in the region of Preljuca  the  day before yesterday are also known. That area is 15 km from  Gorazde and is situated on the territory of Foca Commune. A  logical question arises here: By bombing positions so distant,  how were the Americans trying to protect the UN military  observers in Gorazde. Preljuca has been Serbian territory since  time immemorial, and precisely in the village of Crnetici,  directly underneath it, the Muslims committed a terrible crime a  year ago, killing more than 20 civilians, among whom were two  preschool children. The American aircraft will most probably  finish off their job, so it seems.</p>

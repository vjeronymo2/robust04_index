			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / French tear down symbol of urban conflict and despair: The demolition in Lyons yesterday of a low-income tower block city that became a national embarrassment For a suburb known almost universally throughout France as a synonym for the worst in urban conflict and decay, Les Minguettes is remarkably hard to find. The area seems to be mysteriously off the edge of many of the maps of Lyons, just as it is a little beyond the end of the metro line, itself only extended far into the south-east of the city in recent years. Many in the region would probably like it to remain forgotten, given the associations of Minguettes with the riots in the 'hot summers' of 1981 and 1983 which gave it national notoriety and helped trigger a range of government inquiries and new urban policies. Yesterday was an exception, as thousands gathered to witness one of the most ambitious such acts ever undertaken: 10 of the 15-storey, low-income housing blocks in the suburb that became most tarnished with despair over the past 30 years were demolished by explosives in a matter of minutes. The so-called 'Towers of Democracy', distinguished by little more than the enormous purple numbers on their flanks, disappeared from the skyline. The recently-erected barriers will soon be removed and 86,000 tonnes of rubble trucked away. The destruction left many - including former inhabitants - with a sense of relief, and marked the end of an era of technocratic 1960s urban planning strategies. But others were left wondering whether it was all in fact far more symbolic than useful. Some 48 high-density towers still stand in Minguettes, remnants of one of the 'mushroom cities' constructed at great speed in the late 1960s and early 1970s to cope with extreme housing shortages. At their peak, the blocks accommodated 35,000 people. Mr Andre Gerin, the Communist mayor of Venissieux, the municipality in which Minguettes is based, remembers the excitement when they were first built. Formerly a worker in a lorry factory, he moved into one of the blocks in the late 1960s and recalls the delight of being for the first time in a flat that was modern and spacious, with central heating and a bathroom. Yesterday he said he felt mainly 'relief' at the destruction of the flats. The problem was partly poor quality construction and management, and partly the failure of attempts to create socially-mixed housing. Low-income housing policy started to favour lower-density construction. Over the following years, those who could afford to moved out: the young professionals, skilled workers, anyone with money. A residue of increasingly more marginalised groups remained. Struggling with economic recession, Minguettes became one of the most concentrated areas of deprivation in the country. Even official statistics, which substantially underestimate the problem, showed unemployment last year at 22 per cent. Nearly a quarter of the population are classified as immigrant, more than a third are aged under 19, and more than 22 per cent live in households of at least five people. Many families have fallen behind in paying their subsidised rents. Crime, drugs and educational failure are all widespread. The difference in lifestyles between the older French population and younger immigrants in the area has helped fuel racial conflict, while relations between the police and the local youth - particularly those of North African origin - have always been tense. Yet even the saga of the demolition of the 'Towers of Democracy' highlights the problems of French urban policy. It has taken nine years and a number of alternative plans for rehabilitation since the flats were emptied of residents in 1985 in preparation for demolition. Mr John Tuppen, a geographer at Lyons business school, says the delays were partly explained by political complications and persistent disagreements over the different policies of the various strands of government. It remains unclear whether the local community will be able to gain sufficient political and financial support for its plans for Minguettes: an extension of the metro, a new media centre and a technical institute. 'Most of the proposals to do with 'Democracy' have come to nothing,' says Mr Tuppen. Even the planned physical changes do little to affect the underlying social problems. 'Despite all the rhetoric, it is unrealistic to expect any major change while there is such high unemployment,' he says. Mr Gerin, the mayor, is optimistic about the future, pointing to a strong sense of local community. 'We need to proceed with humility and wisdom, realising that it takes time to build a town,' he says. But his solutions are ambitious: social integration, work and greater local power. Father Christian Delorme, in charge of relations with the Moslem community for the Diocese of Lyons, sees continued tensions between the second generation of North Africans and other members of French society, including the police. 'I am pessimistic. I see French suburbs becoming more like American ghettos. It would be difficult to create balanced communities there now.' While yesterday's demolition cost an estimated FFr14m (Dollars 2.65m) the municipality still faces an outstanding bill of FFr17m to complete payments to the state for the blocks' original construction. It will be a continual reminder that the problems of the past are far from over.</p>

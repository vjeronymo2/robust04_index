			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Test plan fails to make the grade: Britain's schools face a summer of discontent The ruling by the UK Appeal Court yesterday that union action against school tests in England and Wales is not illegal presents Mr John Patten, the education secretary, with an uncomfortable choice. He could persevere with the compulsory national curriculum tests which have aroused the intense opposition of teachers and led to the current threats of industrial action. That might throw the classrooms of England and Wales into chaos for the rest of this summer, as teachers boycott the tests, some heads and governors try to implement them and the hapless parents are left not knowing where their children stand. Or Mr Patten could concede that the tests - which he admits are flawed  - should be voluntary pending the review he has ordered into the national curriculum and its testing procedures. This would mean abandoning the testing programme for this year. While such a climbdown might appeal, ministers fear it would be seen as a defeat on the principle of a national curriculum and nationwide testing. If Mr Patten decides to press ahead with the tests, he can expect no help from the courts. The Appeal Court ruled that the boycott on work connected with the curriculum tests, already started by the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, is a legal trade dispute. By linking the boycott to workloads, the NASUWT, one of two TUC-affiliated teachers' unions, has therefore found a formula for legal industrial action against the tests. A similar formula has been adopted in ballots now being held by the National Union of Teachers, the UK's largest teaching union, and the moderate Association of Teachers and Lecturers, which is not TUC-affiliated. The NUT seems certain to vote for a boycott, while the ATL is likely to follow. Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the NUT, said: 'Teachers will be delighted at the court's decision. They know the impact this irrelevant government imposed system of testing and assessment has had on their workload.' In the face of action from all three unions, the tests could not start in most schools. Only members of the Professional Association of Teachers, which refuses to take any industrial action, would be left to implement them  -and the PAT has no members in many schools. A long hot summer in the classroom therefore seems unavoidable. Threats of other forms of legal force would probably only provoke teachers further. Mr Patten appears to have abandoned plans to make the boycotts illegal by changing legislation. Such a strategy would be difficult to implement and could provoke broader conflict with other unions. His tactic at present is to apply pressure to head teachers and school governors, who are under a statutory duty to implement the tests. However, this risks alienating two groups whose co-operation is essential if testing is to succeed. Mr John Sutton, general-secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, commented that heads do not need to be lectured by Mr Patten on their duty, while Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, believes the government's tactics 'smack of a macho approach'. Both organisations believe the tests are flawed and it is difficult to see how they could be forced to implement them. Pressure on school governors would also be an ineffective weapon. The National Association of Governors and Managers has believed for some time that the tests should be made voluntary, and reacted angrily to Mr Patten's suggestion that they should enforce them. Mr Walter Ulrich, NAGAM's information officer, predicted 'mass resignations' if governors were pressurised to implement the tests, pointing out that they are unpaid and have nothing to lose by resigning. Exerting such pressure would also undermine the government's drive to encourage more parents to be governors. Parents, alarmed that their children could be judged on the basis of flawed tests, also seem to be siding with teachers. In some parts of the country, such as London, teachers unions claim that parents are threatening to withdraw children from school on testing days. The National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations is calling for the tests to be abandoned. This leaves Mr Patten without an ally. The entire educational establishment, usually fractious and given to back-biting, is now in entrenched opposition to the tests. For the secretary of state, this is all uncomfortably reminiscent of what happened in Scotland, where the combined opposition to testing of teachers and parents forced the Scottish Office to make similar tests voluntary. Worse, Mr Patten may now have painted himself into such a tight corner that the Scottish solution of making the tests voluntary could no longer be presented as a compromise. The stakes have risen too high to prevent such a move being perceived as a humiliating climbdown. But if the introduction of the national curriculum, and the testing which accompanies it appears to have been mishandled, not all of the fault is Mr Patten's. The unwieldy form which the national curriculum has now taken on - a primary source of opposition among teachers and even supporters of the government's reforms - is partly the responsibility of Mr Kenneth Baker, the education secretary who introduced the national curriculum. The overloading of the national curriculum was exacerbated when one of Mr Baker's successors, Mr Kenneth Clarke, imposed league tables on schools, to be based on the test results. This meant that the tests were supposed to work as a yardstick for schools' performance, as well as providing a diagnostic tool for parents, and a broad indicator of national standards - a recipe for the unwieldy tests which resulted. But Mr Patten has further alienated teachers, not least by his apparent aloofness and refusal - until quite recently - to meet any unions. His stress on a moral, or value-laden approach to teaching has not helped. Teachers unions believe this is a distraction. Yesterday, he devoted the bulk of his speech at the Secondary Heads' Association to a talk on the duties of parents to ensure, among other things, that children did their homework on time. Other examples include his insistence that sex tuition should be given a 'moral dimension' and that children should be educated in 'standard English' and corrected when they speak ungrammatically. Mr Patten has made concessions, but they have proved too little too late to persuade teachers to vote against boycotts in the current round of ballots. Results of the tests for English, which have aroused the most ire, will not now be published on a school-by-school basis. He has also announced a subject-by-subject review of the entire national curriculum by Sir Ron Dearing, former post office chairman and an impartial figure, rather than one of the right-wing educationalists who pioneered the reforms. Mr Patten was also relying on the law to bail him out by forcing the teachers' unions to abandon their boycotts, and defuse the issue while the reviews continued. This hope was not unreasonable, since the tests are laid out as a statutory duty. Indeed, three moderate unions were advised by a leading, left-leaning barrister that a test boycott would not survive a legal challenge. That hope has proved false, leaving Mr Patten to face his unpalatable choice. What seems certain, is that this summer's tests will either be reduced to a shambles, or they will not happen at all.</p>

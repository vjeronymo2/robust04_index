			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Charles L. Atkinson, Chief, Division of Older Worker Programs, Office of Special Targeted Programs Telephone: (202) 219&hyph;4778 (this is not a toll-free number). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I. Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> As authorized by title V of the Older Americans Act (OAA or Act), as amended (42 U.S.C. 3056,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), the Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) fosters and promotes useful part-time opportunities in community service activities for persons with low incomes who are fifty-five years old or older. The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) of the Department of Labor (DOL or Department) administers the program by means of grant agreements with eligible organizations such as governmental entities and certain public and private non-profit agencies and organizations. Pursuant to the Act, the Department in 1973 established SCSEP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SCSEP regulations were last revised in 1976: 29 CFR part 89, 41 FR 9006 (March 2, 1976). The SCSEP legislation has been amended by the following laws since the last revision of the regulation: Public Law 95&hyph;478, section 105 (October 18, 1978); Public Law 97&hyph;115, section 12 (December 29, 1981); Pub. L. 98&hyph;459, sections 501&hyph;05 (October 9, 1984); Public Law 100&hyph;175, sections 161&hyph;66 (December 7, 1987); and Public Law 102&hyph;375, sections 502&hyph;11 (September 30, 1992) and Public Law 103&hyph;171 (December 2, 1993). On July 19, 1985, the Department published a notice of proposed rulemaking governing the SCSEP in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (50 FR 29606) for the purpose of soliciting public comment. The proposed rule would have implemented only the amendments established by Pub. L. 98&hyph;459 (October 9, 1984). The comments made in response to the July 19, 1985,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  proposed rule have been considered in drafting this proposed rule. Also implemented are the 1987 and 1992 amendments contained in Public Law 100&hyph;175 (December 7, 1987), and Pub. L. 102&hyph;375 (September 30, 1992). The Department has made other minor changes to accommodate revisions in other federal regulations which impact upon the operations of SCSEP. For that reason, the Department is providing an opportunity for public comment on the entire regulation. Since 1985, pursuant to grant agreements, recipients and subrecipients have used the July 19, 1985, proposed rule to administer and operate their projects. During that period, no substantive problems with the July 19, 1985, proposed rule have been identified. Therefore, major changes have not been made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This document proposes to revise the proposed SCSEP regulation to conform to the OAA and to make technical changes based on the Department's experience in administering the SCSEP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. The Older Americans Act Amendments of 1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;375 (September 30, 1992). Summary of Proposed Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are provisions contained in Pub. L. 102&hyph;375 (1992 Act) which impact on SCSEP. The category and provisions are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=7 f=2 -->  <!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;Financial <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Equitable Distribution of Resources. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 504(b)(2) of the 1992 Act added section 506(c)(3) to the OAA to expand the criteria for equitable apportionment of OAA project monies to include the ``relative distribution'' within each State of those eligible individuals with the greatest economic need, the greatest social need, and those who are minorities. Currently, each State considers the proportion of eligible individuals residing within each county. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=7 f=2 -->  <!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;Eligibility/Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Poor Employment Prospects. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 502(a) of the OAA, as amended by section 501(1) of the 1992 Act, reaffirms statutorily that the SCSEP program is to serve unemployed low-income eligible individuals, 55 or older, who have ``poor employment prospects''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

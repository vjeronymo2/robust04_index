			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: CSO figures on UK consultants' overseas earnings too gloomy Sir, I was disappointed to read the article in which the Central Statistical Office reports a fall in 1993 in the overseas earnings by consultants ('Overseas earnings by consultants fall', October 15). The CSO report paints a somewhat gloomy picture of consultancy which, from our viewpoint, is far from true. More than 80 per cent of member firms reported that their overall work load overseas in 1993 was higher than or the same as in 1992, and 97 per cent expect their work load to be higher or the same in 1994. British consultancy internationally is a success story and is highly regarded by international funding agencies. With a multiplier effect for project work of 10-25 this is good news for British business as a whole. From our annual statistical survey of member firms, which are the leading consultancy firms working internationally, we believe the gross overseas earnings of British consultants in 1993 were higher than reported, particularly for consulting engineers where the figure is Pounds 684m compared with the CSO figure of Pounds 397m, including process engineers. Our returns also show a different regional emphasis, with Asia and Pacific the biggest market with 41 per cent of gross earnings. The European Union came third with 16 per cent.

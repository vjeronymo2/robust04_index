			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CREDIT EASY BUT COSTLY IN INNER CITY;  </P> <P> BUYERS TEND TO LOOK AT MONTHLY PAYMENTS, NOT HIGH RATES  </P> <P> Signs inside Cestra Furniture in South Central Los Angeles promise shoppers  "90-day financing; no interest," but customers who take longer to settle their  accounts could end up paying one of the highest finance rates in California --  a whopping 27% on items costing $1,000 or more.  </P> <P> Inner city retailers, such as Cestra Furniture -- a small, nondescript store  near 55th and Broadway -- say they must charge high rates to offer credit to  people who, for the most part, do not have bank accounts or carry credit cards.  They say the higher rates help cover losses that inevitably result from  granting credit to consumers whom most lenders don't consider credit worthy.  </P> <P> Surprisingly, the stiff terms don't deter many customers. Shoppers and store  owners agree that for those buying items on time in the inner city, the size of  the monthly payment, the selection of merchandise and special conveniences --  such as Spanish-speaking sales clerks -- are more important than the amount of  the finance charge.  </P> <P> "People will buy if they can get easy credit," Cestra owner Thomas Chavez said  of his customers, most of whom, he says, are black or Latino and come from as  far away as Downey, Inglewood and Carson.  </P> <P> Yet, while credit may be more freely available at some stores, interest rates  have jumped dramatically from the 18% level California set before it lifted  credit interest rate ceilings Jan. 1, consumers groups say.  </P> <P> While interest rates at 12 major retailers -- including J. C. Penney, J. W.  Robinson's, May Co. and Nordstrom -- rose just under 2 points to 19.8%, rates  at some inner city stores jumped to as much as 27%, according to a study  released last week by the California Public Interest Research Group.  </P> <P> The California Retailers Assn. -- which lobbied for removing credit interest  rate ceilings -- had predicted that "consumers could be expected to benefit  from a free (credit) market." And in its own forthcoming study of 39 California  retailers, the association reports that two-thirds of the retailers offered  annual credit rates of 19.8% or less and that no rate higher than 24% was  documented.  </P> <P> But Henry Holmes, a consumer activist at CalPIRG, said a member of the group  posing as a buyer was offered 27% by a finance company that Cestra sends credit  applications to.  </P> <P> Chavez of Cestra said he uses ITT Financial Services Co. of Los Angeles but  added that he has nothing to do with the rates they set. "They take the  application (from the customer) and send me a check for the balance due."  </P> <P> Inquiries to ITT were referred to the regional manager, who did not return  several phone calls.  </P> <P> Jose Saravia, a 39-year-old maintenance man, is largely unconcerned with  interest rates.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Monopolistic Pricing'  </P> <P> He can't recall what rates he's been charged over the past six years, even  though he has bought a stove, television, dining room table and a cabinet on  time at Dearden's at 7th and Main. He said he patronizes Dearden's because he  was unable to easily obtain credit at other stores he visited.  </P> <P> "Everybody (else) wanted a big deposit" on credit purchases, Saravia said.  </P> <P> CalPIRG, however, contended in its report that the higher credit rates stemmed  from "monopolistic pricing" of firms taking advantage of consumers with limited  transportation to shop elsewhere.  </P> <P> Although many customers who patronize inner city merchants are poor, with  spotty employment records and little or no other access to credit, many  disputed CalPIRG's presumption, saying they they often do have access to  transportation and try to shop around.  </P> <P> Greg Jones, a gas station attendant who lives on 54th Street near Cestra  Furniture, said neither he nor anyone he knows of has ever patronized Cestra  Furniture in the three years the store has been open. Jones said he has been in  the store to look but added that the furniture, which ranges from $50 for a  chair to $3,250 for a sofa set, is too expensive.  </P> <P> "I was looking for a sofa one time but I can get a better deal at one of those  Korean (-owned) furniture stores . . . on Crenshaw or at the swap meet," Jones  said.  </P> <P> Yet consumers who are looking for "deals" may find it difficult to make fair  interest rate and price comparisons.  </P> <P> "The issue facing retailers is, do you make your money charging what the market  will bear or do you cover the expense of granting credit by charging interest  rates that reflect the risk of granting credit?" said Don Hoffman, general  manager of Central Furniture, TV, Appliances.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not a Lot of Cash Business  </P> <P> Central chose to increase its interest rates somewhat. The store raised credit  interest to a uniform 19.2% from a two-tiered level of 12% for outstanding  balances above $1,000 and 18% for those below. "For the most part our consumer  is a credit consumer. They shop here out of a basic need to buy merchandise on  time; we don't have a lot of cash business," Hoffman noted.  </P> <P> Valentino Lopez, a 24-year-old Los Angeles carwash attendant, is typical.  </P> <P> Over the years, he's purchased a TV, a stove and several other items on credit  at Central and remained a loyal customer despite the increase in credit  interest. Last Saturday he bought a $350 "boom box" portable stereo and agreed  to pay monthly installments of at least $40 with the outstanding balance  financed at an interest rate of 19.57%.  </P> <P> Lopez said his main consideration in making his purchase was to keep his  monthly payment below $100. "Credit is hard to get" at other places, he  explained in Spanish. And salesmen at most large furniture retailers in the  area don't speak Spanish.  </P> <P> Oscar Alfaro, a 33-year-old shipping clerk at Coast Magnetics, said he tried to  obtain credit at a Los Angeles Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. store but could not  qualify.  </P> <P> "I shop around but I always come here because of easy credit," Alfaro  explained.  </P> <P> Despite the convenience of Spanish-speaking sales clerks and easy credit, some  merchants say there remains a psychological barrier of 20% credit interest that  even unsophisticated consumers are still unwilling to breach.  </P> <P> "Personally I don't want to see our interest rates go to 20 or above," said one  Los Angeles merchant, who declined to be identified. "So when that (sales)  contract prints out, I want that number to be 19.99%, 19.98%. I think there is  a point at which that figure will become apparent to our consumer if they shop  at another store. So I would like to see another store go over the 20% mark  first."  </P></p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Fashion: Let's join the pyjama game this summer - Wear your night clothes in the street and no one will turn a hair There is a classic nightmare in which you imagine you are walking in the street dressed only in undies or nightwear. You are covered in confusion but no one else is turning a hair. This summer, however, you will not be embarrassed and the dream will be for real, as the pyjama game is being played in some of the world's most fashionable spots. Pyjamas are the acceptable face of this year's generally not very wearable fashion. At the catwalk shows, the barrage of shutter-clicking when minuscule minis or schoolgirl slip-dresses appeared was counterpointed by the approving sighs of the fashion press as loose shirts and trousers appeared. You can guess what made the headlines, but pyjamas have sneaked into the shops as the season's commercial success. Managers in middle-market companies which have not produced any are now kicking themselves. A loose shirt and drawstring trousers can be worn by virtually anyone but, choose carefully if you want them to flatter. Try them on and look critically (particularly at your rear view) before you buy. In coarser fabrics they can be easier on the waist than on the eye. A crinkly polyester version of drawstring trousers has, for years, been the basic fodder of outsize and even maternity departments. This is, quite sensibly, because they are blissfully comfortable whatever your circumference. But if you would prefer not to look as if you were an habituee of either place, you should choose a very soft fabric, such as silk, fine cotton jersey or delicate linen that will gently wrap and drape itself round your form rather than camouflage it or make your hips look enormous. Pre-washed or crushed fabrics have the softest touch of all. Because drawstring trousers are not new, designers have had to freshen them up in order to make them look like this year's hot number and not last year's cold potage. The abiding image that lingers in the mind (even from designers as commercial as Ralph Lauren) is of trousers drooping below navel-level and worn with a cropped top scarely bigger than a bra. This is only to be recommended if there is not even a finger's pinch of spare tyre anywhere, which in practice means on very few people. The point of drawstring trousers is that they free you from the rigours of high fashion and allow you to relax. They are therefore not suitable office wear unless you work in a particularly relaxed environment. But they are wonderful for holidays, weekends and entertaining at home. In St Tropez, always the cradle of Mediterranean trends, pyjamas were already de rigueur by May, worn over swimsuits, protecting skin from the midday sun. The smooth line of a swimsuit, or fine knit or jersey body is the most flattering partner to pyjamas, with the shirt or jacket worn open to show off the drawstring knot. Donna Karan matches fine-knit body-vests to narrow-shouldered, fluted, silk pyjamas for a monochrome, simple yet dressy look that would suit a summer party. An alternative is a soft waistcoat or slip top to match the trousers, with the shirt contrasted or in a print. If you are young and fit and your tum can take it, go for the crop top - the loose shirt will give some camouflage. Accessories take an equally relaxed approach. The rediscovery that some high heels look good with some trousers does not apply to pyjamas. Espadrilles, natural-looking lightweight sandals - even thongs if you are tall - or, at most, small-heeled mules look better. Jewellery and even sunglasses need the same light, minimal look. Plain, fine-rimmed tortoiseshells from Giorgio Armani, a period-looking mix of tortoiseshell and burnished metal from Calvin Klein or 1970s-style fine metal rims with softly coloured lenses from Romeo Gigli are effective and comfortable to wear. An advantage of the pyjama suit is that it is concealing enough to be acceptable wear for women travellers even in sensitive areas. Our pictures were taken amid the little pastel-washed houses and verandahs of the picturesque Malay quarter in Cape Town, South Africa, a strongly Moslem area where young girls wear headscarves and men are more likely to sport pyjama suits. Yet even the veiled mothers, watching over their children playing cricket in the quiet streets, smiled and approved as our model posed. Not for them, of course, and the bare midriffs not, perhaps, for anyone. But the shirts and trousers for their teenage daughters? Yes, perhaps one day.

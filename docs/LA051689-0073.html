			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SUITS AGAINST DEPUTIES IN DEATH CASE PARED TO 1 CLAIM  </P> <P> A ruling by a federal judge Monday left intact only a small part of two  $10-million lawsuits accusing three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies of  killing a woman who was found slain after an evening of drinking with the  deputies at a Van Nuys bar.  </P> <P> The suits, filed by the woman's father, Edward Postma, and her mother, Mary  Postma, accuse the deputies of causing the wrongful death of Catherine Michelle  Braley, 26, and of violating her civil rights.  </P> <P> But in the father's suit Monday and the mother's suit last week, U.S. District  Judge Mariana Pfaelzer dismissed the civil rights claims by ruling that the  deputies were not acting in their authority as law enforcement officers when,  while off duty, they met Braley the night of Jan. 14, 1988. The next morning,  Braley's body was found beaten and strangled in a nearby parking lot.  </P> <P> Los Angeles police investigating the unsolved case have said that no deputy is  a suspect and that the three deputies, Robert Mallon, Robert Waters and Mike  Turner, have denied involvement in Braley's death.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dismissed Claim  </P> <P> Pfaelzer last week dismissed Mary Postma's wrongful death claim on the basis  that it should be dealt with by a state court, not a federal court.  </P> <P> But on Monday, the judge would not dismiss Edward Postma's wrongful death suit  on procedural grounds because Postma lives in Iowa and is suing residents of  another state, causing federal court to have jurisdiction. The judge's rulings  made no statement about whether the suits' allegations have factual merit.  </P> <P> On the night before she was found dead, Braley had been drinking in a bar  called The Hunter and had left at the same time as the deputies. In court  depositions, Waters and Turner said they went their separate ways after leaving  the bar.  </P> <P> Mallon said in a deposition that he and Braley left in his unmarked county car  and drove to a nearby area where they had consensual sex in the car.  </P> <P> Braley, he said, then left the car and walked away. She was found dead the next  day about a block away.  </P></p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Defence giants bicker - Bids / Bernard Gray looks at the battle for VSEL The tug-of-love struggle between GEC and BAe turned a little petulant this week as the latter attacked the former's record in shipbuilding. Leaked BAe briefing papers showed that GEC's Yarrow yard on Clydeside ranked only 25th in the world league for exporting warships. Many view the fight for VSEL as a proxy for the main battle for dominance in UK defence between BAe and GEC. This week, though, it emerged the bidders had agreed, in a confidential transaction 15 months, ago not to make any aggressive move against one another until July 1995. The Office of Fair Trading, meanwhile, announced it was extending the deadline for its recommendations on referring the BAe bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to December 7. That will be the next big highlight in the battle. If both bids are referred, the process will be stalled for six months. If GEC is referred and BAe is not, BAe's all-share offer would probably win. If neither is referred, the issue will be fought out in the stock market during December. BAe's offer of 2.747 of its shares for each VSEL share is worth Pounds 12.66 a VSEL share at present. GEC's offer is for Pounds 14 in cash. If neither bid is referred, analysts expect BAe to increase its offer, and GEC might follow. GEC's shares finished the week down 4 1/2 p at 283p; BAe was up 4p at 461p and VSEL was up 5p at 1373p. There is one other wrinkle which could affect the end-game. About 150 shareholders attended a VSEL extraordinary general meeting on Wednesday to change the company's articles to allow a BAe takeover. A similar meeting on GEC's bid is due on November 24. At the meeting, it was explained that neither contender could buy more than 15 per cent of VSEL in the market until a majority of shareholders had accepted one bid. That prevents GEC increasing its 15 per cent holding and could be important when the shells start to fly next month. Meanwhile, Attwoods finished the week with a flourish, promising shareholders it would put itself up for auction if they rejected the hostile Pounds 364m cash bid from Browning-Ferris Industries of the US, writes Peggy Hollinger. Yesterday's announcement made clear that this bid is not about the independence of a company which has, in recent years, seriously disappointed its shareholders. As one of Attwoods' advisers said yesterday: 'It is all about value.' BFI is offering 109p a share and 85p per preference share. Already, it has secured the agreement of Attwoods' largest shareholder, Laidlaw of Canada, which owns 29.8 per cent. That agreement has severely restricted Attwoods' room for manoeuvre. If independent shareholders reject BFI's offer, with no other alternative in sight, then Laidlaw's open anxiety to sell the stake is certain to overshadow the share price. Given that overhang and its own track record, Attwoods has decided to push the value argument by re-valuing its UK assets upwards by Pounds 30m, publishing improved first-quarter profits, and promising investors a higher return from a break-up. Now, shareholders must decide if the disposal proposals represent a real alternative to BFI's offer. BFI, for its part will have to decide before Friday whether to raise its bid. The fact that Attwoods' shares are trading above the offer - they closed last night 1p up at 115p - means the market is still expecting a revised offer. Shareholders have plenty of time before they have to make up their minds: final acceptances are not due until December 2.</p>

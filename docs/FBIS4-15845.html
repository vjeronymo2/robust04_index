			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Item from roundup of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, ITAR-TASS reports: </F> "Chelyabinsk Residents in Luck"]    [Text] The results of a sociological survey commissioned  by the city administration and carried out in Chelyabinsk by  specialists from the Urals branch of the Center for the  Improvement of Labor Organization, Production Management, and  Social Development, caused a near sensation.    The sociological survey showed that the status of people in  Chelyabinsk, compared with 1992, the year of the collapse, had  improved in terms of all indicators: They are materially better  off, the housing situation is less acute, basic living standards  and the quality of food have improved and are now above average  for the region, and the level of prosperity and social  protection has risen. The point is that a system of social  protection has started operating this year. Thus, expenditure  on food now accounts for 49 rather than 70 percent of the family  budget, as it was last year.</p>

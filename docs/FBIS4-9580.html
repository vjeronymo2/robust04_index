			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Peter Javurek: "Zhirinovskiy Is To Visit the </F> Slovak Republic in May"]    [Text] Bratislava--Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the leader of the  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, will probably come to  Slovakia on 14 or 15 May. A LIDOVE NOVINY reporter has found out  that he should stay in the West-Club in Bratislava's Kamzik  Restaurant as a private person. Staff from the West-Club  confirmed this information to LIDOVE NOVINY. They added that the  Russian ultranationalist will probably be in Bratislava for two  days, but his program is not known. It is clear from another  source that the owner of the West-Club invited Zhirinovskiy to  make the private visit.    Last week, representatives from the extraparliamentary  Liberal Party protested against Zhirinovskiy's forthcoming  visit. Zhirinovskiy was originally supposed to come to Slovakia  in April. He apologized later, saying he was "too busy."  Liberal Party Executive Secretary Pavol Weiss met last week  with Slovak National Party (SNS) First Deputy Chairman Juraj  Molnar in one of Bratislava's cafes. The meeting, which had been  instigated by the SNS representative, ended in a physical  incident.    According to P. Weiss, Molnar, who recently took part in the  "Pan-Slavic congress" organized by Zhirinovskiy's party in  Moscow, tried to convince him of the need for a "Pan-Slavic  union," in which Slovakia would cease to exist, and of the need  for a party like V. Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party.  According to the liberals, Molnar even said frankly to Weiss  that the Slovaks "will lick the boots of Russian soldiers." P.  Weiss ended the conversation by physically assaulting Molnar in  front of witnesses. In the meantime, the liberals have submitted  a request to the Interior Ministry asking it not to allow  Zhirinovskiy to visit Slovakia.</p>

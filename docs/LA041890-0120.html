			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK: BOYD GETS ONLY A PART OF HIS WISH LIST FOR CHAPMAN  BASKETBALL TEAM  </P> <P> In his first full season of recruiting at Chapman College, Coach Bob Boyd hoped  to get help inside and outside for his basketball team. Last Wednesday, the  first day players could sign national letters of intent, he got one but not the  other.  </P> <P> Chapman signed two 6-foot-6 community college forwards, Alan Schlines of Orange  Coast and Chris Warmerdam of Cabrillo College in Aptos, Calif. Both averaged 14  points and nine rebounds and should help spell the Panthers' inside starters,  Rog Middleton and Frantz Reyes.  </P> <P> "I think we have helped ourselves," Boyd said. "We needed some support in there  with Roger and Frantz, but we do need to get a couple of perimeter people."  </P> <P> One player who got away was Cypress College's Vince Hizon, the Orange Empire  Conference player of the year. Boyd said Hizon, a guard/forward who averaged  15.2 points, had considered Chapman before choosing Boise State, a Division I  school.  </P> <P> Boyd hopes to add two more players.  </P> <P> Recruiting at the Division II level has been a new experience for Boyd, who  coached 20 seasons at Division I schools (Seattle, USC and Mississippi State).  </P> <P> "It's quite a puzzle to solve," he said. The situation at Chapman is trickier  than most because the school offers only 10 scholarships -- two less than the  Division II maximum. And as the only private school in the California  Collegiate Athletic Assn., it has the highest tuition costs in the conference.  </P> <P> "We really don't have the opportunity to split up scholarships like a lot of  the state schools in our league. You just don't find anybody in a position,  financially, to not go on full scholarship."  </P> <P> Job searching: Chapman has four finalists its search for an athletic director:  David Adams, a former athletic administrator at the University of Akron; Joseph  Biedron, athletic director of Monmouth College in West Long Branch, N.J.; Dave  Currey, an assistant football coach at UCLA who was football coach at Cal State  Long Beach and athletic director and football coach at Cincinnati, and Kay Don,  the senior women's athletic administrator at Cal State Long Beach.  </P> <P> The finalists will be interviewed Monday, and college administrators hope to  make a decision by May 1.  </P> <P> Another search: Christ College Irvine administrators want to hire a men's  basketball coach by next Tuesday. The final two of eight candidates will be  interviewed this week. Estancia High basketball Coach Tim O'Brien, will be  interviewed today.  </P> <P> Hard sell: Advancing to the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics  basketball tournament last month in Kansas City, Mo., for the first time hasn't  yet proved to be a boon for recruiting for the Southern California College  men's team.  </P> <P> "We like to think it might help," said SCC Coach Bill Reynolds, who  half-jokingly added: "I told my wife to keep the phone lines open. . . . But  they aren't knocking our doors down."  </P> <P> Reynolds said he isn't sure how helpful the postseason success will be for  recruiting in the long run, but hopes it will at least ensure that more players  will have heard of the school.  </P> <P> Staying hot: SCC's baseball team dropped out of a tie for first in the Golden  State Athletic Conference after losing to front-runner Cal Baptist, 6-5, last  week, but catcher Denny Berni continued his stay among the conference's hitting  leaders.  </P> <P> Berni went five for seven with five runs batted in, raising his batting average  to .418. He has nine home runs and 40 RBIs. In conference games, he is batting  a conference-leading .531.  </P> <P> College Division Notes  </P> <P> High school softball pitcher Laurie Bauer of Butte, Mont., signed a letter of  intent to play for Chapman. . . . Heather Mead, a Mater Dei High graduate and  Saddleback College volleyball player, will attend Chapman, as will Andre  Fahamivu (Faha) Banks, a 5-foot-6 point guard on the Santa Barbara City College  women's basketball team. . . . Christ College Irvine has hired Edward Brown to  coach the men's soccer team. Brown, who played soccer at Pacific Lutheran in  Tacoma, Wash., has coached a number of youth clubs in the Pacific Northwest.  </P></p>

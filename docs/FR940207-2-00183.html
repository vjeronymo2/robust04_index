			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. The Contracts will be distributed through PNMR, an affiliate of the Company, that is a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The Contracts will be individual flexible premium and individual single premium deferred variable annuity contracts. The Contracts provide for accumulation of Contracts values and payment of monthly annuity payments on a fixed and variable basis. Certain of the Contracts will qualify for federal tax advantages available under the Internal Revenue Code (``Qualified Contracts'') and certain of the Contracts will not (``Non-Qualified Contracts''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The minimum initial and subsequent purchase payment for the flexible premium Qualified Contracts is $50. The minimum initial purchase payment for the flexible premium Non-Qualified Contracts is $2,000, with a minimum subsequent purchase payment of $250. The minimum initial purchase payment for the single premium Non-Qualified Contract is $25,000; the minimum subsequent purchase payment is $2,500, with additional purchase payments allowed within a six-month period following the remitting of the initial purchase payment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Contract owners may transfer all or a portion of their interests in a subaccount to another subaccount of the Separate Account. Such transfers may be made without charge, at any time prior to the date upon which annuity payments begin, provided that there have been no more than twelve transfers made in a Contract year. If more than twelve transfers are made in a single Contract year, the Company reserves the right to deduct a transfer charge from the amount which is transferred which will equal the lesser of $10 or 2% of the amount transferred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The minimum partial transfer amount is the lesser of $500 or the Contract owner's entire interest in the subaccount, unless the Contract owner is participating in the automatic transfer program which provides for pre-establish automatic transfers of at least $250 from a subaccount. No partial transfer will be made if the Contract owner's remaining Contract value in the subaccount would be less than $500 after the transfer (unless the Contract owner is participating in the automatic transfer program). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. When the Contract value is less than $50,000, the Company will deduct an annual administration maintenance charge of $30 from the Contract value on the last day of each Contract year and in the event of a full withdrawal. This charge is designed to reimburse the Company for general administrative expenses which it incurs in the establishment and maintenance of the Contracts and the Separate Account. Prior to the annuity date, this charge is not guaranteed, and may be changed for future years; in no event may it exceed $35 per Contract year. Applicants represent that the charge has not been set a level greater than its cost, and contains no element of profit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. In addition, relying on Rule 26a&hyph;1 of the 1940 Act, the Company deducts an asset-related administration charge on each valuation date, at an annual rate of 0.15% of the average daily net asset value of the Separate Account. This charge is designed to cover the shortfall in revenues from the annual administration maintenance charge, and will not increase. The Company does not intent to profit from this charge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. For each withdrawal (whether partial or full) after the first in any Contract year, the Company deducts a withdrawal charge that equals the lesser of $25 or 2% of the amount withdrawn. The withdrawal charge is an administrative charge,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a sales charge, and is used to pay for administrative expenses incurred by the Company in connection with withdrawals after the first in any Contract year. No withdrawal charge is deducted when the Contract owner is participating in the systematic withdrawal program or is exercising a settlement option. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. The Contracts do not provide for a front-end sales charge. Instead, a full or partial withdrawal of a Contract prior to the annuity date is subject to a contingent deferred sales charge (``CDCS''). The CDSC is a declining charge which is graded down 1% per year from 8% to 0% over eight years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. The Company assumes mortality and expense risks under the Contracts. The mortality risks arise from the contractual obligation to make annuity payments for the life of the Annuitant, and to waive the CDSC in the event of the death of the Contract owner. The expense risk assumed by the Company is that the actual expenses involved in administering the Contracts may exceed the amount recovered from the annual administration maintenance charge and the asset-related administration charge. To compensate it for assuming these risks, the Company deducts a mortality and expense risk charge on each valuation date, at an annual rate of 1.25% of the average daily net asset value of the Separate Account. Approximately 0.90% of the 1.25% charge represents mortality risks and 0.35% represents expense risks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Applicants state that if the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover the actual costs, the loss will be borne by the Company. Conversely, if the amount deducted proves more than sufficient, the excess will be a profit to the Company. The mortality and expense risk charge is guaranteed by the Company not to increase. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

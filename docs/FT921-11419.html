			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Peat protection deal is attacked A DEAL announced yesterday between Fisons, the pharmaceuticals and horticultural company, and English Nature, the conservation organisation, over areas of peat extraction was attacked by other environmental groups. Under the agreement Fisons, the biggest peat producer in the UK, is donating nearly 8,000 acres of peatland to English Nature. Of that, 2,800 acres that have planning permission for peat extraction will be managed by English Nature for conservation purposes. That leaves 5,000 acres where Fisons is already extracting peat and will be allowed to continue to do so. The Ipswich-based company has promised to assist in restoring the land for conservation after commercial use ends. Fisons said its peat production would continue at existing levels. Environmental organisations say that stripping the earth for peat destroys irreplaceable lowland bogs. All the sites are listed as of special scientific interest. Mr Robin Maynard, of Friends of the Earth, speaking for the Peatlands Campaign, a consortium of environmental organisations, said English Nature was sanctioning the destruction of its own sites of special scientific interest. Mr Bob Lankester, chairman of Fisons' horticulture division, said the agreement was a 'balanced way forward'. Mr Tony Baldry, junior environment minister, congratulated Fisons and English Nature on the agreement. Yesterday Friends of the Earth and people from Thorne, near Doncaster, South Yorkshire, took a 7,000-name petition to Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, asking him to save Thorne Moors, one of the sites handed to English Nature on which peat extraction will continue. Other sites given to English Nature in the deal are Hatfield Moor, South Yorkshire, Glasson Moss and Wedholme Flow in Cumbria and Shapwick Heath and Westhay Moor in Somerset. English Nature advises the government on conservation and manages sites of special scientific interest. Environmentalists have seen Fisons as a test case for getting institutional investors to put pressure on a company. Fund managers and insurance companies that control more than 40 per cent of Fisons shares were asked to urge the company to cease peat cutting.</p>

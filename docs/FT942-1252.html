			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Norway (11): Not much left on the shelf - Energy, the oil's running low, turn up the gas The era of Norwegian 'elephant' size oil discoveries, as they are known in the industry, is over. While it is too early to write the country's obituary as an oil producer, there is little geological evidence that current levels of oil production can be sustained beyond the decade. Currently western Europe's biggest oil producer, with daily output of more than 2.4m barrels, Norway's ranking would have fallen behind Britain this year had the government not opened the oil taps full-bore, to compensate for a loss in revenue caused by weak oil prices and a weaker dollar. According to forecasts by Wood Mackenzie, the Edinburgh-based energy consultant, crude oil production will hit 2.67m barrels a day this year and rise to 2.82m b/d in 1995, before peaking at a daily rate of 2.85m barrels in 1996. In 1993, the state's net petroleum revenue comprised slightly less than 10 per cent of total revenue, while petroleum exports accounted for one third of total exports, and related investments represented one third of total Norwegian investment. Petroleum also represented 15 per cent of GNP. Total capital expenditure in the offshore petroleum sector last year peaked at a record estimated NKr60bn, 7.5 per cent of GDP, and may have added substantially to mainland GDP, because oil equipment goods - production platforms in particular - are, for a large part, manufactured by land-based industry. But there is no immediate prospect of any new, significant oil discoveries being made on the Norwegian continental shelf. The last big discovery - Norne, made in 1986 - is expected to yield peak annual production of around 15m barrels of oil a year, just 12 per cent of that of the giant Statfjord field, discovered 20 years ago, at the dawn of Norway's oil age. The size of new discoveries is expected to diminish to an average 20m tonnes of oil equivalent, compared with 90m tonnes for fields now producing, and 40m tonnes for those currently being developed. Earlier this year, the government proposed a comprehensive overhaul of energy policy, and more recently scrapped immediate plans to sharpen petroleum taxes - both moves in a desperate attempt to stimulate petroleum activities to stem the awaited steep decline in oil output. In a white paper presented in March, the government called for exploration acreage to be expanded by 16 per cent, and for reform of rules for exploring in the Barents Sea, to make it more attractive. It also intends to speed up the process for approving oil discoveries for development, and a number of proposals have been made to streamline licensing rules and management of the state's oil and gas resources. Norway has little choice but to stimulate oil activity; not only is output set to decline dramatically, but stiff competition has emerged from oil regions elsewhere in the world vying for investment. For the first time in many years, foreign oil companies operating in Norway are having to fight for funds from headquarters to maintain investment. Several are even undertaking substantial streamlining operations, in which staff levels are being cut sharply. Earlier this year, the French oil company Total announced a strategic reorientation in which it closed its office in Stavanger, Norway's oil capital, retrenched to Oslo, cut staff from 150 to 100 - all to achieve annual cost savings of more than NKr20m. Total has also warned that interest in Norway's next licensing round, for which new acreage will be put on offer next year, will be kept at a minimum unless the country's draconian tax regime is realigned to reflect the reality of current oil prices. In Norway's 14th licensing round last year, both Esso and Shell refused to apply for high-risk acreage, and subsequently withdrew from bidding in protest against stringent operating conditions. Mobil recently announced that it would complete a reorganisation of its drilling department in August, after finishing its last well as operator. 'With no wells to drill, we cannot justify keeping together a drilling group sized as we are to drill wells and accomplish the myriad of other activities associated with being an active operator,' drilling manager Iain Montgomery told staff. Elf Aquitaine this month revealed plans for a dramatic reduction in staff in Stavanger, and numerous other oil companies are reluctant to embark on new development projects while oil prices remain weak and petroleum taxes high. Investment in the petroleum sector is expected to fall by 8 per cent this year, and will decline dramatically within the next two years unless oil companies commit to new projects. Last year, Norway boosted recoverable petroleum reserves by 259m tonnes of oil equivalent to 5.89bn tonnes, but the increase was due to adjustments to reserves of producing fields and discoveries not yet developed, rather than to exploration success. Out of a total of 18 wildcat explortion wells drilled in 1993, just three small discoveries were made, yielding only 9m tonnes. Optimists, however, point out that 60 per cent of the continental shelf has yet to be opened for exploration. What is certain is the success which Norway is achieving in the transition to becoming an important gas-producing nation. Its share of the western European gas market will soon reach 15 per cent. 'While our oil production will probably reach its zenith in the near future, the large investments in gas-field development will lead to a substantial increase in Norway's gas production from 1995 to the year 2000,' says Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the prime minister. Gas production is expected to reach as much as 70bn cubic metres by the turn of the century, while gas sales contracts already amount to more than 50bn cubic metres annually. More than half of western Europe's proven gas resources are found on Norway's continental shelf. Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, believes that, while the 20th century was the age of oil, the 21st is set to become the gas era, particularly as concern for the environment becomes the driving force behind the growth of gas consumption.</p>

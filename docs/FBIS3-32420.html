For 10 years the International Bank of Finance has been  operating in Cuba and was the first to carry out this type of  financial activity, the local press indicated.    BICSA has a capital worth 1 million pesos payable in German  Marks contributed by local corporations that make up the group  of shareholders. The banking institution seeks to encourage  foreign trade and to participate in the development of local  enterprises to produce products and services targeted for export  or sale in a freely convertible currency.    BICSA president Jose Vaz explained that the bank's creation  "is in response to the nation's policy aimed at multiplying  banking activity to strengthen and develop it." Until a decade  ago, such activity was concentrated in the National Bank of Cuba  and the People's Savings Bank, Vaz recalled. He added that among  BICSA's possible main customers are the industrial and trade  companies, as well as persons who wish to use the checking  account and security box services.    According to the official, a network of correspondents in  approximately 70 nations "will guarantee that the users can  carry out their transactions in Canada, almost all of Latin  America, Europe, the main Asian trade centers, and some African  nations."</p>

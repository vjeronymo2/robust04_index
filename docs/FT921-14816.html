			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Maxwells defy Commons: Controversy over refusal to answer select committee questions MR KEVIN MAXWELL and Mr Ian Maxwell defied a parliamentary select committee yesterday, triggering heated controversy over parliament's right to inquire and the citizen's right to remain silent. Their refusal to answer questions about the disappearance of hundreds of millions of pounds of pension fund money from their late father's business empire may provoke a full debate of the Commons, possibly as soon as next week. Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP leading the social security committee's inquiry into Mirror Group Newspapers' pension fund affair, said last night the Maxwells' defiance 'raised matters of crucial constitutional importance' that put the future development of the committee system in the balance. In the absence of clear precedent, the social security committee would now take the advice of the Commons - a procedure involving direct behind-the-scenes talks between the two main parties - before formally reporting the Maxwells' refusal in an official report. There was widespread speculation last night that this may lead to a full Commons' debate and possibly even punitive action, though fierce controversy continued over whether parliament has the right to fine or even imprison those who defy its authority. Lawyers for the two brothers said their refusal to testify or produce any documents demanded by the select committee was because criminal charges were expected soon. During the hearing the only words spoken by the brothers were their names, and when they said three times, barely audibly: 'I will answer only through my counsel.' In a packed Grand Committee Room in Westminster Hall, Mr George Carman QC, Mr Kevin Maxwell's lawyer, said: 'It is plain and clear and respectful but unambiguous that Kevin Maxwell is not going to answer any questions.' The brothers had 'a precious constitutional right and an historic one' to remain silent, to prevent them from incriminating themselves in any future criminal charges from the Serious Fraud Office's five investigations into the Maxwell empire, their lawyers argued. Mr Carman said: 'In my judgment, criminal charges are likely, and they are likely soon.' He and Mr John Jarvis QC, for Mr Ian Maxwell, said that the Maxwells vigorously denied any wrongdoing. Gesturing at the banks of television cameras in the hall, the QCs said the committee threatened to become a 'trial by television, not to be tolerated in a civilised society' which could prejudice potential jurors in future cases. Mr David Shaw, Conservative MP and committee member, committee, said: 'They're trying to block us at the first hurdle, but we don't stop there.' With the committee meeting in private later this week to consider precedents, the brothers risk being held in contempt of parliament, a charge comparable to contempt of court. Late last night, Mr Graham Allen, a Labour member of the Commons procedure committee, said it was clear the House could not 'let this go' without severely diminishing parliament's powers. Prof George Jones, a professor of government at the London School of Economics, said that the row represented a 'turning point' in the future of the committees, reformed in 1980 to enhance their powers. Mr Field described as unacceptable the conditions cited by the lawyers in order for the Maxwells to give written answers. These were confidentiality from SFO probes as well as from the media. In the last, tense half-hour, Mr Field persisted in putting the committee's questions to the brothers. Only his fourth question - whether the brothers could offer advice about safeguards for pension funds - extracted a concession that the Maxwells might comment in writing. Hours before the select committee started, Mr Kevin Maxwell was in court to hear his bid to be allowed to remain silent renewed in the Court of Appeal. He is appealing against the decision of Mr Justice Hoffmann in the High Court on December 23 that he must answer questions put to him by the provisional liquidator of Bishopsgate Investment Management, who is trying to trace more than Pounds 450m missing from Maxwell pension funds. The appeal is expected to last two days and may be followed by a cross-appeal from Mirror Group Newspapers.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Call To Order in Algiers"] </F>   [Text] The resignation of the government of Redha Malek,  who was succeeded on Monday, 11 April, by Mokdad Sifi, former  minister of equipment, above all served as a warning. When  thanking Mr. Malek, who had become a little too talkative for  their liking, President Liamine Zeroual, and through him the  Army commanders, sent out a very clear message, namely, that it  is they, and not the civilian leaders, who are responsible for  managing the crisis. It is they, and not the "politicians,"  even if they are the actual government leaders, who will decide  what attitude to adopt vis-a-vis Islamist groups.    This change does not necessarily imply that an ideological  turning point has been reached. The departure of Redha Malek is  totally in keeping with the (khaki-colored) "cleansing"  precedents at the top. His predecessor, Belaid Abdesalam, who  was held in contempt by the French-speaking elite, which had  described him as a "secular assimilationist," was not merely a  victim of his political opinions. In the eyes of the military,  his main failing was that he had not managed to succeed in  regaining the confidence of leaders in Western capitals, whose  financial support has become crucial for the country.    Paradoxically, it is quite for the opposite reasons that  Redha Malek, a career diplomat who prided himself on being on a  particularly good footing with the United States, was cruelly  forced to resign. His resignation came two days after Algiers  had sent a "letter of intent" to the International Monetary Fund  (IMF), a prelude to the signature of an agreement opening up the  way for new loans and the rescheduling of Algeria's foreign debt.    In other words, Mr. Malek's mission had virtually been  fulfilled. The military commanders, who were anxious that their  "protege" should not become too important in the political  arena, preferred to retire him early. On Sunday, the press was  raising the prospect of an imminent ministerial reshuffle.  Fueled by rumors, political circles had, for several days,  already imagined that the prime minister might be on his way out.    The last week's dispute opposing the former prime minister  and the secretary general of the Assembly for Culture and  Democracy (RCD), Said Sadi, was not enough to save Mr. Malek.  Distancing himself, somewhat belatedly, from the modernist  camp, he did not succeed in convincing the authorities of his  neutrality and his loyalty to the army. The fact that he  recently described the Islamist groups as "barbarians,"  "traitors," and "anti-nationalists" irreversibly classed him  among the so-called "eradicators" who are hostile to a dialogue  with the heirs of the former Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). By  adopting this position, he could not but embarrass the military  hierarchy, which is more determined than ever to save the  appearances of unity and cohesion.</p>

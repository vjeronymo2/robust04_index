			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Bristol Water turns in Pounds 5.24m BRISTOL WATER HOLDINGS yesterday reported its first annual result since it came to the market in November 1991. Pre-tax profits for the year to end-March came out at Pounds 5.24m and were achieved from turnover of Pounds 47.9m. In the previous year pre-tax profits were Pounds 2.97m and turnover was Pounds 42.1m. Sir John Wills, chairman, said the improvement in profits had been achieved with the assistance of a cost-cutting programme which had helped secure the effi-ciency gains necessary for the core business to grow satisfactorily. The board took a conservative view of diversification, he said, believing that the maintenance and development of the core water supply business should be the company's first priority. A final dividend of 18.7p makes a 28p total. The dividend is covered 2.5 times by earnings per share of 68.9p (38.9p). Following consultation with the Director General of Water Services, prices for 1993 would increase by an average 7.3 per cent - 1.1 per cent below the maximum permitted, Sir John said.</p>

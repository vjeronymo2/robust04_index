Mr. Peres made these remarks to our political  correspondent Shlomo Raz.    Minister Peres met with visiting French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe this morning. Following the meeting, the guest said  that beginning next month, Israelis visiting France for short  periods will not require visas. The two ministers also agreed  on bilateral space research cooperation. It was also reported  that Israel and France will tighten their political and military  relations, especially in the research sphere.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Business and the Law: Pensions and equal pay - European Court The European Court of Justice gave judgment last week in the first of a batch of cases on the effect on pension schemes of the equal pay principle in Community law. The common thread running through the cases was the precise effect of the Barber judgment. Although the cases were joined and there was a 'joint' opinion on them by Advocate General Van Gerven, the Court decided to rule on the first case alone. This left a number of issues with which the Court must still deal. However, an important question arising out of the Barber decision has now been answered. The case on which the Court ruled concerned Mr Ten Oever and his deceased wife. Prior to her death, his wife, who had worked in the cleaning trade, had paid into a collective occupational pension fund, jointly financed by employers and workers. Until January 1 1989, the pension fund made provision only for a widow's pension. Mr Ten Oever's wife died in 1988. Mr Ten Oever applied for a widower's pension, but his application was rejected on the ground that, when his wife died, the pension fund rules did not provide for such a pension. Mr Ten Oever then brought an action before the Dutch courts, alleging the refusal was contrary to the equal pay provisions in the Rome Treaty. The Dutch court referred two questions to the European Court. The first was whether the payment of a widower's pension fell within the Rome Treaty provisions on equal pay. The Court reiterated that the concept of 'pay' comprised any consideration in cash or in kind, whether immediate or future, provided the worker received it, albeit indirectly, in respect of his employment. The fact, thus, that certain benefits were paid after the termination of the employment relationship did not prevent those benefits from falling within the concept of 'pay' in the Treaty. Thus, said the Court, Mr Ten Oever's widower's pension did fall within Treaty equal pay provisions. The fact that, by definition, the pension would not be paid to the worker but to the spouse was irrelevant. The point was the pension had been acquired in the employment relationship and was paid to the surviving spouse in respect of the deceased spouse's employment. The second question related to the temporal effects of the Barber judgment. The Barber case held that occupational pension schemes fell within the scope of the equal pay provisions of the Rome Treaty. But because of the huge financial implications of the judgment, the Court decided individuals could not rely on the relevant Treaty provisions before the date of the judgment - May 17 1990. The question before the Court in the present case was the extent of this restriction. Did it mean only those workers who became paying members of an occupational scheme after May 17 1990 would be entitled to rely on the Treaty provisions? Or, did it mean all pension payments made after May 17 1990 would be covered, irrespective of the date of the periods of employment in which the pension rights were accrued? The Court held the principle of equal pay should apply only to benefits payable in respect of periods of employment after May 17 1990, except in the case of workers or those claiming under them who had before that date initiated legal proceedings or introduced an equivalent claim under national law. The Court was no doubt aware of the warning given by Advocate General Van Gerven that a different conclusion would be superseded when the Maastricht Treaty came into force. The Court still has to deal with issues raised by the other cases. These include whether the Barber ruling applies to occupational pension schemes other than those envisaged in that case; whether the use of actuarial calculation factors differing according to sex is contrary to the Rome Treaty provisions on equal pay; and whether the same provisions can be relied upon against the trustees of an occupational scheme.

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Stately B &amp; B's of England: Christopher Price tests a discreet and classy venture by Britain's tourist industry There are no advertisements for one of the British tourist industry's newest ventures. Nor are there any signs outside 200 of the most beautiful places in Britain which offer guests a night's lodging. In fact, anonymity is almost a condition for those taking part in the scheme. 'A bed and breakfast sign outside the house? Good Lord, no. We don't want just anyone calling in,' said Philip Archer, a retired farmer of Welland Court, a 15th century manor house set at the foot of the Malvern Hills. It is a refrain echoed by his fellow mansion owners, who, for reasons ranging from impecuniosity to boredom, last month began opening up their homes to paying guests. 'If people just rolled up willy-nilly we wouldn't know what sort they were,' agreed Richard Cunningham, owner of a listed Jacobean manor house in Sussex. The task of finding the right type of guests is being undertaken by Discover Britain, a Worcester-based agency which, in keeping with its publicity-shy members, has limited its advertising to overseas tour operators. 'Quite a number of our owners prefer to be discreet about offering B &amp; B and so will take only overseas visitors,' said Andrew Grieve, the agency's managing director. Some owners had also expressed concern that potential burglars might turn up to assess their valuables if they advertised in the UK. There are plans to extend the scheme to the UK in the autumn, but Grieve admitted: 'I don't expect all the owners will want to take part.' Most owners do it because they need the money. Maintaining a large country house is expensive at the best of times, and the recession has put off some much needed repair work. Sarah Callander-Becket, owner of Combermere Abbey, a Grade I listed 12 century abbey set in an 1,100-acre estate in Shropshire, has a double incentive. 'We have serious maintenance and repair projects to undertake and overseas guests will not only help finance a new roof for our 16 century library, but also help advertise the new stables we are converting into holiday cottages.' 'We're all in it for the money, let's be honest,' said Sarah Burgoyne, 'I could tell you about my love of entertaining, which would also be true. But it's basically about trying to keep this place going,' - a Grade II listed 17th century manor house, complete with lake, tennis court, swimming pool and exceptional gardens within earshot of Glyndebourne opera house. Burgoyne, a widow with two young children, intends to run the B &amp; B venture alongside her Edwardian garden furniture business. Several of the owners are Lloyd's names. Sir Graham Lake, owner of Magdalen Laver Hall, an early Georgian mansion, said: 'I'm not expecting to make that much from it, but it might make up some of the syndicate money I've lost.' Belinda Hextall, of 15th century Baverstock Manor near Salisbury, put a braver face on it. 'Yes, we have got a Lloyd's problem hanging over us and it's a big open syndicate - but that's not really the reason. We have nine bedrooms here, my husband works away half the week in London, the children are day boarders and I like to keep busy.' Lake, who spent many years abroad in the colonial service, said: 'We're hoping to meet some interesting people through this. We do really enjoy entertaining.' Grieve agreed. 'These are people who are used to entertaining, have in many cases spent years at it and are finding that with their children grown up have these big empty houses. They're the perfect hosts and hostesses.' The cost of one night's accommodation and breakfast is the same rate for all the properties included in the 'Mansions and Manors' programme - Pounds 34 per person. Dinner is an additional Pounds 15 per person. Some overseas tourists book their chosen houses through tour operators. But the most popular method is a scheme enabling touring visitors to pre-purchase vouchers for the mansion of their choice. The only condition is that they give 48 hours notice - and it is at the owners convenience. 'The beauty of this scheme is that you can say 'no',' said Callander-Becket, a view echoed by many of the owners interviewed. For those country house owners considering the scheme, the agency despatches an inspector to check on the suitability of the property and answer queries. The maximum number of guests allowed per night is six, a figure which stays within most council tax rules and avoids the need for a change-of-use planning application for of the premises. Most insurance companies are also comfortable with this figure as being no different from having normal house guests. None must sleep above the first floor in order to comply with fire regulations. Capital gains tax does not come into play while the B &amp; B activity is not a principle use of the house. Income has to be declared, as with any business, but after setting costs against it, Grieve said the scheme remains 'pretty profitable for all concerned.' After Discover Britain's commission has been paid, members receive Pounds 26 per guest. He estimated that in a good week during the summer a house could earn Pounds 500 net a week. The agency encourages its members to extend every hospitality to their guests and to involve them as much as possible in the daily routine of the house. This will usually mean a welcoming cup of tea on arrival, a tour of the house and gardens and the use of many of the facilities. For their part, guests are entreated 'not to treat your hosts as porters or housemaids,' - even though some of the owners interviewed said their housemaids or au pairs would be doing the bulk of the domestic duties. The hospitality was evident to varying degrees at the three houses visited by a colleague and me. At Burgoyne's house, tea and cake were served by our host in the drawing room, the au pair who would normally help was out walking the dog. A tour of the house and grounds followed, Burgoyne giving us an animated potted history of the house, her life - she is particularly proud of her prize-winning Chinese Croad Langshaw chickens - and the Glyndebourne opera. The guest rooms were spacious and, like the house itself, decorated and furnished in the grandest Georgian style. Dinner could be taken either in the large kitchen, or in the smaller but stately dining room, and either with Burgoyne and her au pair or alone. So far her two sets of guests - one Belgian, one Canadian - have opted to eat with their host. 'I've really enjoyed the entertaining,' said Burgoyne. 'In fact, I got on with one set of guests so well that I took them to a poultry show. They thoroughly enjoyed it.' Further east in Sussex, King John's Lodge, so named because King John of France was held prisoner there in 1356, is surrounded in prize-winning gardens. The welcome here was also warm, if a little guarded. Richard Cunningham and his wife had decided to make a separate lounge area for guests, deciding that 'both parties like a bit of privacy.' They had not received any guests as yet, but by all accounts, breakfast and dinner would also be taken alone. 'We'll be too busy preparing it,' said Cunningham. His management consultancy business has taken over part of the house, so space to wander around in was also restricted. At East Mascalls, a 15th century manor house nestling in a picturesque vale on the South Downs, we were greeted rather formally by the lady of the house who showed us to an elegant first floor bedroom overlooking the large lawned back garden. Donwstairs, we were served an early evening aperitif, although our host was surprisingly shy about discussing the house, referring all questions to her husband, who was working at his heating engineering business. When he arrived, he quickly disappeared to feed their prize labradors. I took the opportunity to inspect the gardens. After our previous receptions, it was all slightly uncomfortable. We had already decided to eat out, and the husband recommended and drove us to a local pub, offering to pick us up later. On our return, he served us his best single malt and for the first time both hosts seemed relaxed. We chatted until the small hours, during which time and in keeping with many of the other home owners, they claimed they were doing B &amp; B more for the company than the money. The next morning, formality returned and we took our breakfast alone, served by our reticent hostess. Just prior to our departure and true to form, she said: 'I would not like to see our names in the paper. I don't think we want any publicity about this.'</p>

Molder said a state-owned enterprise, a company with state  participation and a private firm are involved in the project.    As next step, Estonia hopes to launch production of shells.    Manufacture of domestic cartridges was put off because of  the  high cost price.    Lithuania is at present the only Baltic nation to produce  its  own ammunition -- cartridges and hand grenades. The country  plans soon to begin making 60 mm and 80 mm cannon and shells for  them. The Latvian Defense Ministry has invited tenders for the  manufacture of cartridges.</p>

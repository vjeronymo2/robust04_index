			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE HOUSING CHIEF TAKES POST WITH BUILDERS GROUP  </P> <P> Christine Diemer Reed, California's top government housing official, will take  over as executive director of an Orange County builders trade group on July 1.  </P> <P> Reed, 36, will succeed John Erskine as head of the Orange County region of the  Building Industry Assn. of Southern California. Erskine announced earlier this  year that he was joining a local law firm.  </P> <P> Reed was appointed head of the state Department of Housing and Community  Development by Gov. George Deukmejian in 1986. She had previously served as a  deputy attorney general and as deputy secretary for housing in the California  business, transportation and housing agency.  </P> <P> Reed is married to Dana Reed, a partner in the prominent Costa Mesa-based law  firm of Reed &amp; Davidson.  </P> <P> More than 1,000 builders, developers and other businesses belong to the BIA's  Orange County region, according to an official with the trade group. It has  played a key role in shaping the course of development in several Southland  areas, but perhaps is best known for being a linchpin in the business  community's successful efforts to beat back the slow-growth Measure A on last  year's Orange County ballots.  </P></p>

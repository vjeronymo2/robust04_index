			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Sharp drop in company failures THE NUMBER of companies passing into receivership and administration last month dropped to the lowest level since December 1990, indicating possible economic recovery, figures from accountancy firm Touche Ross showed yesterday. There were 389 receivership and administration appointments, according to statistics derived from the London and Edinburgh Gazettes, compared with 527 in March and 441 in April last year. Mr Christopher Morris, national director of corporate special services at Touche Ross, said the decline was 'indicative' of support from banks towards companies to which they have loaned money. 'This shows grounds for very cautious optimism,' he said. 'But one swallow doesn't make a summer. We can be much clearer about a trend when we see the May and June figures.' The proportion of appointments for last month fell in London and the south-east - further evidence that the effects of the recession, which affected the region particularly badly, may be receding. There were 30 per cent fewer appointments in the service sector than last year, while there were sharp increases among wholesaling and distribution, hotel and catering, and retail. Mr Morris cautioned that business failures normally peak 18 months after the bottom of a recession, partly because companies are unable to borrow money as they expand. He said banks also sometimes called in receivers when they saw the prospect of recovering the value of assets in companies to which they had made loans. However, his recent discussions with banks had disclosed that a decreasing number of companies were in their 'intensive care' departments on the brink of insolvency. National Westminster was the bank that most commonly called in receivers and administrators, with 97 appointments, followed by Barclays, Lloyds and Midland. Bank of Scotland and the Royal Bank of Scotland also saw an increase in appointments, which Touche Ross said reflected the increase in failures in Scotland and the north. Coopers &amp; Lybrand was awarded the largest number of appointments.</p>

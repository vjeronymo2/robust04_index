			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["bho"-signed report: "Deported Kurd Allegedly Tortured"] </F>   [Excerpt] Dresden, 14 Apr -- According to the Association  of Germans and Foreigners in Chemnitz, a Kurd deported to Turkey  from Saxony was arrested by the police immediately after  arriving in Istanbul and tortured for three days. They wanted  him to supply information about the Workers Party of Kurdistan  [PKK], "although he is not a member of that party," the  Association's spokesman Klaus Mueller told FRANKFURTER  RUNDSCHAU. The Dresden Alliance 90/Greens quoted from a letter  Cetin's lawyers Christian Fischer and Gert Merzky have sent to  the Chemnitz court: "We have information that he was also  physically tortured and that he has visible traces of that  torture." Cetin was deported on 6 April, together with his wife  and five children, after his application for asylum was rejected  on 17 March. Mueller called the fact that the family was  deported before the period for filing protest expired on 17  April a "violation of the principle of due course of law."  [passage omitted]</p>

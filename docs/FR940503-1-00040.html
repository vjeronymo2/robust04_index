			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Congressional intent to afford the Respondent a less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formal, non-APA hearing is explicit in the legislation. Although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such hearing must provide the Respondent with a reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to be heard and to present evidence, such hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall not be subject to the procedures under sections 554 or 556  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the APA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 1, 1991, the Agency proposed non-APA consolidated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules of practice for the administrative assessment of civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalties at 40 CFR part 28 (56 FR 29,996). Although the part 28  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules are intended to consolidate all other non-APA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative penalty programs currently administered by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency under uniform rules of practice, the field citation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program was excluded from those proposed rules. Programs covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by part 28 include Class I administrative penalties under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 309(g) of the Clean Water Act, section 109(a) of CERCLA, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 325(b) of EPCRA; and administrative penalties under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1423(c) of the Safe Drinking Water Act and sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 325(c) and (d) of EPCRA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are several compelling reasons for developing hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures that are better suited to the field citation program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than those provided either by proposed part 28 or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consolidated APA rules of practice promulgated at 40 CFR part 22,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 45 FR 24363 (April 9, 1980). The part 28 rules provide many of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same procedural rights in part 22 that are designed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comport with APA requirements. These rights include prehearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conferences; subpoena authority; discovery rights; and cross-examination. The major differences between the two rules are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that part 28 provides for a Presiding Officer instead of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrative Law Judge; imposes page limits on written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submissions; and eliminates the right to appeal the decision of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Presiding Officer or Regional Administrator to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the part 28 procedures, resolution of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative penalty proceeding could take seven or eight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> months. This lengthy time period would diminish the utility of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the field citation program in addressing minor violations quickly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and efficiently.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of the penalty programs covered by the part 28  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures provide for maximum per day per violation penalties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well in excess of the $5,000 limit authorized for field  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> citations. Using the part 28 hearing procedures could result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spending more money to adjudicate field citation appeals than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be justified by the expected monetary recovery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the foregoing reasons, the Agency is considering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using a more streamlined set of hearing procedures drafted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically to apply to the field citation program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's proposal relies on some of the part 28 provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which ensure expedited proceedings. This proposed option also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relies on the rules at 33 CFR subpart 1.07, 43 FR 54186 (November  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20, 1978), which govern hearings on statutory penalties imposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the Coast Guard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 311(b)(6) of the Clean Water Act, the Coast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guard is authorized to assess a civil penalty of up to $5,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against any owner, operator or person in charge of a facility or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessel that discharges either oil or a hazardous substance. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violator may challenge the penalty assessment at a hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governed by the subpart 1.07 procedures. The similarities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between this program and the field citation program make the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart 1.07 regulations an appropriate model for hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures. These Coast Guard procedures were found to satisfy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> due process under the Constitution in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Independent Bulk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transport <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 480 F. Supp. 474 (1979).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The part 28 regulations were used as a model for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following major provisions of the proposed part 59 hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures: the Presiding Officer's duties and responsibilities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consent orders; prehearing conference; information exchange;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> post-hearing submissions; and review of the Regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator's decision by the Environmental Appeals Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The subpart 1.07 regulations were used as a model for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following provisions: certain preliminary matters; confidential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business information; hearing procedures; and the scope of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regional Administrator's authority for issuing a decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The relevant part 28 provisions were selected to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fundamental fairness while streamlining the procedures available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to Respondents. The Presiding Officer under part 28 is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized to exercise a great deal of discretion to expedite the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presentation of evidence in administrative cases. In that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regard, the most pertinent authority adopted from the part 28  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations allows the Presiding Officer to limit the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> witnesses and the extent of direct examination and cross-examination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions adopted from subpart 1.07 further streamline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the administrative process for penalty assessment, while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guaranteeing fundamental rights. The Respondent is allowed under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart 1.07 to submit written arguments and evidence in lieu of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requesting a hearing. Such response allows the Presiding Officer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to make a determination on the administrative record without the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delays inherent in conducting the prehearing conference,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information exchange, and hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the subpart 1.07 provisions allow the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Presiding Officer to determine the appropriate form of testimony:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oral; written; or recorded. Subpart 1.07 also simplifies the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing process by allowing the Respondent to present facts,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements, documents and other relevant evidence. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relatively informal nature of the proceeding provides the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity for expedited penalty assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Hearing Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under proposed part 59, the field citation would be issued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during or shortly after an inspection by an EPA officer or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employee. The citation is subsequently served upon the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent by first class mail or equivalent. Within thirty days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after service of the citation, the Respondent must either request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a hearing; provide written evidence and arguments in lieu of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing; or pay the penalty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The  Armenian side in the talks, which were held between the Armenian  and Azerbaijani defense ministers with Russian Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev in Moscow, asked for time to withdraw the Armenian  forces from the territories they have occupied in Azerbaijan.    Reliable sources have said that Azerbaijan Defense Minister  Mamed-Rafi Mamedov held talks with Armenian Defense Minister  Serzh Sargisyan in the presence of Pavel Grachev. The two sides  agreed on the conclusion of a cease-fire agreement. The  Azerbaijani side stressed that the withdrawal of Armenians from  the territories they have occupied is essential for the success  of the agreement. The Armenian side responded by asking for 10  days for the withdrawal of their troops. However, the  Azerbaijani side agreed to a period of two days.    Russia proposed to dispatch observers to Karabakh on the  last  day of the talks. However, Azerbaijan rejected that proposal.    Apparently, the Armenians, who have been quickly retreating  in the face of recent Azerbaijan National Army attacks, have  decided to call for a cease-fire in order to gain time. That is  why they have asked for 10 days.    Several reliable sources have said that the Armenians are  trying to gain time though dilatory tactics in order to receive  aid from Russia and other countries and reorganize their  military forces.</p>

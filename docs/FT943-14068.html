			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Japan's widening trade gap hits hopes Japan's trade gap widened by 14.8 per cent to Dollars 11.35bn (Pounds 7.3bn) in the year to June, a serious blow to the Finance Ministry's belief that the surplus had peaked. The increase, fuelled by a 20.3 jump in exports to the US and a 14.1 per cent rise in sales to the rest of Asia, brings Japan's overall trade surplus for the first six months of the year to Dollars 60.01bn, a 5.1 per cent increase from the 1993 period. In May the surplus fell for the first time in six months. Japan's politically sensitive surplus with the US rose by 14 per cent to Dollars 24.56bn in the opening six months - or by 43 per cent in June alone  -driven by the expanding US economy's appetite for foreign goods. 'The figures reflect the economic strength of the US and Asia, driving up exports there. What is missing is a recovery in Japan,' said Mr Jim Vestal, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo. Japan's demand for imports grew by 8.3 per cent in June, or an underlying 11 per cent after adjusting for a fall in oil prices, a slight slowdown on previous months. Over the first six months, imports rose by 7.6 per cent. This is slightly higher than exports, at 6.8 per cent. The renewed surge in the yen, dating from the last week in June, has led some analysts to doubt that the economy will grow enough in the second half to bring the sharp drop in the surplus they were forecasting. The government's Economic Planning Agency yesterday recognised that the recent spurt in the yen's value casts a shadow over recent improvements in corporate earnings and business sentiment. 'If it had not been for the appreciation of the yen, the Japanese economy would have been close to a state of bottoming out,' an official said. Private sector economists believe that recovery would be stifled if the yen rose to Y90 to the dollar, but that growth would be possible at Y100. The yen fell slightly against the US currency in Tokyo yesterday, from Y98.19 to Y98.30 to the dollar. The latest bankruptcy figures indicate that the health of smaller companies continues to be fragile. Debts of bankrupt companies fell by 12.7 per cent in the opening six months of this year, but the number of corporate collapses still increased by 1.5 per cent to 6,925, according to Teikoku Databank, a credit research agency. Within that, a record 63.2 per cent of bankruptcies were directly caused by poor economic conditions. Separately, Tokyo department stores yesterday reported that sales fell by an annual 3.4 per cent in June, an improvement on May but still the 28th month of decline.</p>

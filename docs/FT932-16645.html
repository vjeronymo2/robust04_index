			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / What they say in the South 'People are cautious and unwilling to spend money on non-essentials until such time as they are convinced that the fortunes of their company or their own job is secure for the foreseeable future.' Robert Peacock, store group chairman 'The biggest stimulus we need is confidence. Housing has been identified as the engine for recovery, but we need confidence to act as the fuel. . . the jobs that are around are very few and far between.' Martin Smout, Wimpey Construction 'Retailers would love to latch on to hard evidence that the industry is coming out of the doldrums. But they are exercising a high degree of caution. They want to be in with the hot products but they don't want to catch a cold by overstocking with products that don't sell.' David Sandilands, Bluebird Toys</p>

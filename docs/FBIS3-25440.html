It was called to protest over a pay  award the workers didn't get because the government took it to  court. The government hit back by warning the strikers that  they will be dismissed, and arresting a number of union leaders.  The union, itself struggling financially backed off, but not  all the workers have heeded the call to go back. From Harare,  Rachel Rawlings reports:    [Begin Rawlings recording] Eight senior members of the union  were picked up in the early hours of this morning and taken to  Harare Central Police Station for questioning. They were told  they had contravened the law and order maintenance act by  inciting a strike in an essential service where strike action is  forbidden. But union officials said this afternoon the strike  was called because the existence of the union itself was under  immediate threat, and strike action in such circumstances was  allowed under the Labor Relations Act.    Union President (Wilfred Chanaiwa) said the management of  the  Post and Telecommunications Corporation, PTC, seem to be trying  to destroy the union by interfering with the collection of  subscriptions and harassing union officers. The PTC is  challenging in the Supreme Court a Labor Tribunal ruling giving  workers a 12.5 percent pay increase. According to Mr.  (Chanaiwa), if union subscriptions aren't collected in full,  they won't be able to hire a lawyer or even pay their own phone  bills. After a meeting this morning at the Ministry of Labor,  union officials called off the strike because of a threat by  Minister John Nkomo to issue an immediate disposal order which  would suspend the union and get the PTC the right to sack all  union members.    Instructions to return to work were broadcast on the radio  this afternoon, but certainly in Harare went unheeded. The  capital's central post office, usually extremely crowded and  busy, was deserted, and canvass bags covered the unemptied  letter boxes. Representatives of the union and PTC management  are due to meet tomorrow with officials from the Ministry of  Labor to address the union's grievances. [end recording]</p>

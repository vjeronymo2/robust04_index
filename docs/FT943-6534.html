			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / This Week: Music Those London audiences lucky enough to have seen the Royal Opera's production of Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg, one of Covent Garden's unequivocal successes of last season, will enjoy the first-ever digital recording of one of Wagner's more tuneful works, conducted by the highly-experienced Wagnerian, Wolfgang Sawallisch on EMI. Excellent performances by Bernd Weikl as Sachs, Ben Heppner as Walther and Cheryl Studer as Eva are memorably backed by the Bayerische Staatsoper orchestra and chorus. Those latter-day Meistersingers, Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti, chose a suitably demotic setting, the Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, in which to repeat the triumph of their World Cup celebration in 1990. The Three Tenors in Concert 1994 (Teldec) is trailed as a recording of 'the biggest concert in the world', a grandiose claim seemingly untroubled by the possibility that many of the 1bn television spectators were only waiting for the real business of the day - the World Cup Final. Zubin Mehta once again conducts; this time it is the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra which gets to play all our favourite tunes. Hard to avoid the feeling, however, that the Three Tenors phenomenon has probably outlived its artistic usefulness, notwithstanding the tremendous boost it has given opera since that starry night at the baths of Caracella in Rome. Since his Genesis days, Peter Gabriel has had a reputation for being among the most pioneering of all live rock acts; his Peter Gabriel Secret World Live (Real World/Virgin) was recorded in Modena, Italy from last year's international tour, and features a predictable selection of favourites. Best, perhaps, to see the video, directed by Francois (32 Short Films about Glenn Gould) Girard and featuring a highly theatrical show co-produced by Gabriel and Robert Le Page. Eeriest release of the week is Jeff Buckley's intriguing Grace (Columbia), for the extraordinary similarity he bears to his late father, the much under-rated and idiosyncratic singer-songwriter Tim. Seven tracks are self-penned, while there are fascinating cover versions of Benjamin Britten's Corpus Christie Carol and Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Arts: The Queen and I - Theatre From Leicester via a national tour and the Royal Court, Sue Townsend's comedy has passed to the West End. As you must know, both the play and the original 'novel' are about the present royal family, imagined as reduced by a newly republican Britain to a grim council estate in Leicester. And why not? Ms Townsend chooses, however, not to explore many questions. I do not mean that she ought to have explored any of them; only that her leaving them untouched (why has the republic treated the royals so brutally? do they learn anything significant in their exile? do their neighbours?) restricts her play to a simple, homely vein in a never-never land. The time of its notional future must be just weeks away, since the royals we meet here have done nothing newly ridiculous since the ludicrous things we think we know about already. Though there are mischievous little sallies about those, none is followed up, and no character develops. For the guiding premise is only this: wouldn't it be funny if the Queen and her clan were stuck in a council estate? Here I should declare a disability, from birth. All Brits, one gathers, sometimes dream about meeting the Queen (often in unlikely circumstances, but most often over tea) - even hard-Left Brits. That suggests that she occupies a special place in your national dream-world, somewhere far beyond ordinary assessment. When Ms Townsend brings her on to the stage in the Celia Johnson-ish persona of Paula Wilcox, she comes ready-made as an icon; you can then be titillated by hints of lese-majeste, and reminders of recent 'misconduct', and by the royals' supposed incomprehension of council-estate demotic. Those account for nearly all the comic substance of The Queen and I; those, and a steady dribble of knowing references. For example, Prince Philip insists on having his tea 'in my World Wildlife Fund mug]' Ha ha. Later the Queen remarks that she has 'never met a butcher - except Bomber Harris, of course.' Ha ha. But I liked the stuffed but lively corgi and the baby, both in Spitting Image style. Thanks to television, we expect stage-royal figures to be good impersonators. Miss Wilcox makes a shy, engaging Queen, with glints of something shyly aggressive. There is crepitating charm from Gillian Hanna's Queen Mum (and Crawfie); David Horovitch's Philip is a testy but kindly soul out of sit-com, and Toby Salaman's Charles a sympathetic, full-blooded impersonation. Lizzy McInnerney's Di looks good, though the accent is more striving-toward-Sloane-from-below than upper-class drooping Sloanewards; Carole Hayman's Margaret is a creature from Noel Coward's stage milieu. Pearce Quigley is outstandingly gormless as Prince William, two other chaps and a Mrs Newman. Their caricatured speech betrays scarcely any common ground, so we get no sense of an aristocracy collectively at bay in an unfamiliar real world. In Ms Townsend's 'novels', there is something steady and unwinking behind their cute prose surfaces. Here, that is dissipated among all the actors' turns and the continual one-joke vignettes. But the amiability-factor is pretty high; and if you can top it up with your own monarchical kink, you should enjoy the show. At the Vaudeville Theatre (071 836 9987)</p>

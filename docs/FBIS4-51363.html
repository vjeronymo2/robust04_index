Comrade Xie Fei said: Guangdong should strive to build a  competent and high-quality contingent of workers, and advocate  and develop five fine spirits, namely, the spirit of acting as  masters of the country and the enterprise, the spirit of  selfless devotion, the spirit of reform and innovation, the  spirit of hard work, and the spirit of solidarity and mutual  assistance. To this end, government departments concerned and  trade unions at all levels across the province should show  concern for the livelihood of workers and make every possible  endeavor to help workers with difficulties in their daily lives  overcome those difficulties.

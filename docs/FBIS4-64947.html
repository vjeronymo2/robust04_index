			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--Azeri President Geydar Aliyev, who made a  brief stopover in Ankara on his way from Brussels, asked Ankara  for more military cooperation, particularly in the field of  training.    Diplomatic circles said after the visit that Aliyev had  particularly asked for Turkish military trainers to train the  Azeri National Army and advise on military strategy. The Azeri  president was also seen having extensive talks with Turkish  Chief of Staff Dogan Gures before and during a working lunch in  the Presidential Palace.    Aliyev noted that he hoped the signed accords between the  two  countries--including a friendship and cooperation accord, as  well as one on military training--would be implemented. "We  have had consultations on speedy implementation of the signed  accords," he told a press conference at Esenboga Airport after  his talks.    He said the ties would be enhanced with NATO member Turkey  following its newly-signed Partnership for Peace deal with the  alliance.    He said Azerbaijan's six-year-old war with Armenia made the  clauses of the agreement specially important for his country,  but did not elaborate.    His remarks in Ankara followed the failure of a new round of  Nagorno-Karabakh peace talks in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, where the  deputy speaker of the Azeri Parliament said his side objected to  a clause in the draft agreement providing for peacekeeping  forces from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) being  brought into the conflict zone.    Afiaddin Dzhalilov told reporters that the document did not  mention occupation of parts of Azerbaijan by Armenian forces.  The draft accord, which provides for a cease-fire from May 9,  was signed by all other participants, but Dzhalilov's refusal to  join made it invalid, REUTERS reported from the Kyrgyz capital.  "Turkey will continue to be the advocate of Azerbaijan's  righteous demands," Demirel said, in reference to the Azeri  calls for Armenian withdrawal from its territories. In a veiled  reference to the Kyrgyz and Russian initiatives, a statement  from the president's Press Office said Turkey supported the  Minsk process of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe (CSCE) for the establishment of peace in the region.    Demirel said in the statement that Turkey was ready to do  what it could in the democratization process in Azerbaijan.    Aliyev, in turn, assured in the press conference that  Ebulfaz  Echibey, the deposed president of Azerbaijan, was "living well"  in Keleki, a small village of Nakhichevan.    "God give him long life," he said.    Turkey has attempted in the past to establish cooperation  between the two leaders in Azerbaijan, claiming their  cooperation would ensure domestic stability and enable a united  fight against the Armenian attacks.</p>

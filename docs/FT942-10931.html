			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Food &amp; Drink (The American Way): I'll take pastrami, in Manhattan - Peter Berlin goes in search of a sandwich and finds a symbol of an entire culture There is a New York familiar to millions who have never been there. It is the screen city of Kojak, Cagney and Lacey, NYPD Blue and The French Connection. Law-abiding television watchers around the world know exactly what the inside of a New York police station looks like. We know these are in Manhattan, even if they are only anonymous film sets, because when the detectives are too busy to lunch, their colleagues bring them a pastrami sandwich. For me the unsolved mystery at the end of every episode was: what is pastrami? My dictionary defines pastrami as 'highly seasoned smoked meat'. The word comes from Romanian via Yiddish, imported to New York by Jewish immigrants. I went to the Carnegie Deli on Broadway, itself a set in Woody Allen's film Broadway Danny Rose. I ordered a pastrami sandwich. The waiter brought me an entire cow, sliced, with two slices of rye bread. There was more meat on my plate than Tevye (of Fiddler on the Roof fame) would have seen in a whole year. The sandwich is not so much a reminder of the old country as a monument to the wealth of the new home. But then at Dollars 9.45 (Pounds 6.50) it ought to be. The meat was moist and fatty - my waiter had told me not to order 'lean' because it would be too dry. The surprise was that it resembles boiled rather than smoked meat; pastrami is smoked and boiled or steamed. It was not particularly spicy. I found it dull and, defeated by the bulk, declined the doggy bag. Still I may be wrong. The sandwich came blessed by the thousands of celebrities whose signed photos smile down from the walls at the low rows of bare long tables, proud to have eaten at the Carnegie. The Asian tourist at my table was evidently satisfied, he told his girlfriend that this was the real New York experience. Tomorrow they would come back for a corned beef sandwich. Carnegie's boasts that it serves the 'best pastrami in the world'. So hoping this was an exaggeration, I headed downtown, to the lower east side and the 2nd Avenue Deli. The menu at the 2nd Avenue Diner offered the information that in 1910, 600,000 Jews lived on the lower east side. The menu also offered beef lo mein and turkey kabobs (sic) as well as the more traditional 'Roumanian' tenderloin steak, Nova Scotia lox and potato kugel. I could not be tempted. I ordered a pastrami sandwich. The decor, like the fare on the menu, was heavy and serious. The sandwich was much the same: an over-generous serving of good but boring meat. By the time I penetrated the seedier reaches of the lower east side my heart was heavy, and not just with cholesterol. At Katz's, on a stretch of Houston that used to be ghetto but has gone downhill, I received a pleasant surprise. Katz's has remained where it was and as it was (except for a modern cash register) while the Jews of the lower east side have moved up and out. Down one wall is a long counter behind which white-coated middle-aged men prepare the food. The motto, unchanged in 50 years, is: 'Send a salami to your boy in the army.' I ordered a salami sandwich. The man in the white coat, Robert Krinsky, was distraught when he heard I could not face any more pastrami. He took his knife to his side of pastrami, a slim hunk of meat, which could not possibly have yielded slices of the width that I had so far tried. It was drier and tastier than elsewhere. I asked Krinsky where pastrami came from. 'From New York,' he replied, indignantly. 'Everything has to do with the fresh drinking water.' (Manhattan takes its water from reservoirs in the mountains of upstate New York.) The Indians, says Krinsky, were the first to use the local water to preserve meat. Salted, pickled or smoked meat and fish and vegetables were always a staple of the Jewish ghettos in Europe, preserved against the bad times. 'Your water in England smells, if you go to Queens (a New York borough) the water there smells.' Even the bread, said Krinsky, laying my meat between two slices of plain, white rye, was better because of the water. 'You won't have tasted better bread.' Katz's, said Krinsky, a salesman as much as a sandwich maker, cooks its pastrami, even though that makes the meat shrink and cooked pastrami must be sliced by hand. Others, he confided mentioning no names, steam theirs. Krinsky is nostalgic for a lost past. Katz's represents a better time and place. 'It is not what it was,' he says gesturing to the street outside, 'nothing is. It used to be better. For me the 1950s were best.' Katz's - large, bare, full of atmosphere - is the place for tourists to find a good, manageable pastrami sandwich. It may put some visitors in mind of Kojak; for Jewish New Yorkers, like Krinsky, it conjures up memories, not of the old country, but of old New York, a city of immigrant communities where a waiter could look out of the door and see familiar faces. Carnegie Deli, 854 Seventh Ave between 54th &amp; 55th. Tel: 212 757 2245 Second Ave Deli, 156 Second Ave at 10th. 212 677 0606 Katz's Deli, 205 E Houston at Ludlow. 212 254 2246</p>

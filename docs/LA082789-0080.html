			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: A DEATH PIQUES INVESTORS' INTEREST IN HAWAIIAN FIRM  </P> <P> There are a number of reasons why the stock of Honolulu-based Alexander &amp;  Baldwin Inc. should have been rediscovered by Wall Street.  </P> <P> The stock should be rediscovered because the takeover battle for Sea  Containers, a British company, has refocused attention on the long-forgotten  value of container shipping operations, such as the one owned by Alexander  &amp; Baldwin.  </P> <P> And Alexander &amp; Baldwin shares should also be getting more attention  because the company owns valuable real estate in California as well as almost  96,000 acres of Hawaiian land. With Japanese investors having a seemingly  insatiable appetite for land, especially in the Pacific, that could mean that  Alexander &amp; Baldwin's assets are vastly undervalued by the stock market.  </P> <P> But those weren't the reasons that Alexander &amp; Baldwin's stock rose $4 a  share, or more than 11%, in unusually heavy trading recently. Embarrassing as  it is to admit, the real cause of the jump was the death of the wife of a guy  who tried to take control of the company a number of years ago.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Forgot About Company  </P> <P> Let's take this one step at a time. Harry Weinberg, a Hawaiian businessman and  investor, was a member of the Alexander &amp; Baldwin board until he turned  rebel in 1985. At the time, Weinberg owned about 14% of Alexander &amp;  Baldwin's outstanding shares.  </P> <P> Weinberg, who is 82 or so, failed in his attempt to take control of Alexander  &amp; Baldwin's board, and eventually he sold most of his stock back to the  company.  </P> <P> But that still left him with a hunk of Alexander &amp; Baldwin stock still  under his control. And analysts say Weinberg's estimated 5.6% holding has  always made Alexander &amp; Baldwin vulnerable to another takeover try. And the  most likely time for any such coup would be upon Weinberg's death.  </P> <P> Harry is said to be ailing, but he's still around. And Wall Street eventually  forgot about the takeover potential of Alexander &amp; Baldwin.  </P> <P> The analysts forgot about it, that is, until earlier this month, when Jeanette  Weinberg, Harry's wife, passed away in Baltimore. Suddenly, Wall Street's  ghoulish interest in Alexander &amp; Baldwin seemed to be rekindled.  </P> <P> Jeanette Weinberg's obituary ran in the Hawaiian newspapers Aug. 14 and 15. On  Aug. 14, Alexander &amp; Baldwin's stock closed at $35.25 on volume of just  37,650 shares in over-the-counter trading.  </P> <P> Trading picked up Aug. 15, when volume jumped to 77,500 shares. But Alexander  &amp; Baldwin's stock was still at $35.25.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Undervalued Stock  </P> <P> On Aug. 16, the day after the obit ran, Wall Street finally rediscovered  Alexander &amp; Baldwin's stock. It jumped $2.50 that day on volume of 349,860  shares and another $1.50 the following day on volume of 374,655 shares.  </P> <P> Last week, the stock backtracked a bit as investors seemed to come to their  senses.  </P> <P> Alexander &amp; Baldwin is probably no more -- or no less -- a takeover  candidate today than it was a month ago. But the death of Mrs. Weinberg, and  the stock activity that it seemed to produce, has caused the few Wall Street  analysts who follow the company to take a closer look at its assets. And what  they see is a company whose stock price should be higher.  </P> <P> Ronald B. Morrow, who tracks the company for Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;  Co., estimates that Alexander &amp; Baldwin could be worth between $50 and $55  a share in a buyout. O. Lee Tawes of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. is a little more  generous at $60.  </P> <P> Tawes thinks that Alexander &amp; Baldwin's shipping business could be worth  between $30 and $35 a share if taken private, and its real estate could be  worth about $25 a share.  </P> <P> The rest of Alexander &amp; Baldwin's value, Tawes says, lies in its sugar  business and the securities that it owns, including a big stake in Bank of  Hawaii.  </P> <P> While Alexander &amp; Baldwin has taken some defensive measures against a  takeover attempt, the company management doesn't own a lot of stock. So company  insiders won't have a lot of say if push comes to shove in a takeover attempt.  </P> <P> But there are some drawbacks for anyone attempting to take over Alexander &amp;  Baldwin. Sally Smith, an analyst at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons, and others say it  is a well-run company. So criticism of Alexander &amp; Baldwin's management  might not get a raider far.  </P> <P> And most of that real estate, while developable, will have to be rezoned before  anyone would be able to cut down the sugar cane and put up, say, a hotel.  </P> <P> Alexander &amp; Baldwin's management might have some say in just how  cooperative local authorities are with any raider.  </P> <P> Two female sociologists will contend in a new book that many of the inroads  that women have made in previous male-oriented occupations occured because men  no longer wanted the jobs.  </P> <P> Patricia Roos, a sociologist at Rutgers University, and Barbara Reskin,  professor of sociology at the University of Illinois, will make that and other  disconcerting points in an upcoming book titled "Job Queues, Gender Queues"  (Temple University Press).  </P> <P> "The extent of the gains" for women in previously male-dominated jobs "have  been exaggerated," says Reskin. "Women get in because the jobs have become less  attractive to men."  </P> <P> Reskin and Roos drew their conclusions after studying 14 occupations for two  years each. Women have made progress, the researchers say, infiltrating the  pharmacology profession as well as getting jobs as insurance adjusters,  typesetters and bank managers.  </P> <P> The two sociologists say women are still better off by taking these jobs. On  average, they earn between 65% and 70% of what the men earned for the same  position, which is better than they normally do.  </P> <P> But the two scientists also found that even within the male bastions where  women were admitted, there was segregation of the sexes. "In every single case  within each occupation, men and women are segregated into different jobs."  Women, for instance, generally get jobs selling residential real estate, while  men still dominate commercial real estate sales.  </P> <P> The two contend that women make out best when some outside force -- such as a  government affirmative action program -- takes up their cause.  </P> <P> The book is due out sometime next year.  </P> <P> Wall Street is apparently justified in trying to keep track of Pennzoil's  activities in the securities markets. According to a filing made recently by  Pennzoil with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company had $1.4  billion invested in marketable securities at the end of June, compared to just  $983 million last December. Sorry, folks, but Pennzoil wasn't specific as to  where it was investing all of that loot. Wall Street has been waiting for  Pennzoil to spend some of the billions that it won in a lawsuit against Texaco  on an acquisition . . .  </P> <P> The wise guys on Wall Street are calling last week's agreement to acquire  Hawaiian Airlines a "takeunder," since the $22-a-share price that ex-baseball  Commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth is paying is well under what the stock of HAL  Inc., the parent company, was selling for on the open market . . .  </P> <P> Naughty, Naughty. That's what some honest traders were saying Thursday morning  after Holiday Corp. announced that it was selling its hotel chain as part of a  big restructuring. Holiday's stock had risen nearly $8 a share the day before,  and even an investigator with a stuffy nose could smell inside trading. The New  York Stock Exchange is already on the case, and the SEC shouldn't be far  behind. Holiday Corp., incidentally, did something naughty too when it publicly  announced Wednesday that it didn't know why its stock was moving higher. Could  it be that its multibillion-dollar deal just happened overnight? . . . As  analysts predicted here a few weeks ago, most hotel and casino stocks got hot  right after Holiday's big announcement . . .  </P> <P> Program trading helped push the stock market to record levels last week. Should  investors be worried once again that the tail (program trading) is again  wagging the dog (the market) as it seemed to do when the market crashed in  1987?  </P> <P> The father of the program trade, Jeffrey Tabak of Miller Tabak Hirsch &amp;  Co., says investors have nothing to worry about in 1989. Even though program  trading activity is still very strong, the investment technique isn't likely to  cause any great programs for the market, Tabak claims.  </P> <P> Tabak, whose firm executed the first program trade in the early 1980s, argues  that the real culprit in the '87 crash was portfolio insurance, an investment  technique which essentially caused institutional investors to sell stocks en  masse when the price of equities started to slide.  </P> <P> Portfolio insurance also used computers to trade bundles of stocks quickly, but  it isn't true program trading, whose purpose is to trade -- or arbitrage --  stocks to make up any discrepancy between the stock and options markets.  </P> <P> "Because portfolio insurance, the real villain, is now dead, people needn't be  concerned with true program trading," Tabak says.  </P> <P> Portfolio insurance isn't used much anymore. When the technique didn't "insure"  anybody against losses in the '87 crash -- and may, in fact, have contributed  to losses -- most institutional investors just dropped the system and moved on  to other things.  </P> <P> But program trading -- the arbitrage kind -- hasn't gone away, and probably  never will. In fact, the use of computers to execute large trades quickly has  been prospering.  </P> <P> According to the New York Stock Exchange, 9.4% of its average daily volume in  July was executed through program trades. While the number has been  fluctuating, many market experts think that program trades are still visible  enough to scare small investors out of the market.  </P> <P> "Program trading really only brings liquidity to the market, which helps  everyone," Tabak says. Liquidity, for those who don't speak the language, means  that you'll be able to get the hell out of the stock market quickly the next  time that it's headed for a crash.  </P></p>

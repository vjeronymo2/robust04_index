First, we must further carry  out the task of arming the entire party with the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Second, we  must stick to the guidance thinking of maintaining stability,  rousing people's drive, and promoting reform and development to  guide the trends of public opinion properly. Third, we must  strengthen ideological and moral education to do well in  building spiritual civilization in addition to persistently  pursuing education on professionalism and social ethics. Taking  the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristic as  a guide, and proceeding from practical reality on the various  fronts, we must explore a unique way of conducting propaganda  and ideological work. Fourth, we must uphold the guiding  principle of serving the people and socialism and the  double-hundred policy to create prosperous socialist literature  and art. Fifth, we must further strengthen foreign-related  propaganda work to actively promote cultural exchanges with  foreign countries exalting the image of opening up.    In his speech, Comrade Xie Shijie emphasized: Party  organizations at all levels in our province must strengthen  their leadership over propaganda and ideological work. They  must devote their main efforts to doing a good job in the  following aspects:    1. Increasing the ideological understanding of leaders at  all levels to constantly enhance their consciousness of grasping  things with two hands to truly strengthen the building on the  various propaganda and ideological fronts and enhance the  political and professional quality of our propaganda and  ideological workers.    2. Actively promoting structural reform on the propaganda  and ideological fronts to bring about prosperous development of  the propaganda and cultural undertakings.    3. Conscientiously implementing a new policy for propaganda  and cultural work and gradually increasing the investment in  propaganda and cultural undertakings.    4.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ivan Frantsenyuk, general director of the </F> Novolipetsk Metallurgical Combine: "We Are Surrounded on All  Sides"]    [Text] The combine considers it extremely necessary to take  steps to end the production recession. The plan we outlined for  this year has indicators which are higher than in 1992--for  agglomerates, coke, cast iron, and steel. But today, like  everyone else, we are in a difficult financial position--we are  insolvent. We owe 6 billion rubles [R] for the mineral raw  material, R3 billion to the coal miners, and R4.5 billion to the  power engineers. Our total debt for bank loans is R4 billion.  Altogether, we owe R32.4 billion, and we are owed R26 billion.  Our debtors include a number of pipe plants--the Volga,  Almetyevsk, Chelyabinsk, Seversk, Moscow, and Leningrad plants.  The pipe manufacturers alone owe us over R17 billion.    We cannot be insolvent: the power engineers have already  told  us the transmission of power to the combine is being cut back by  40 percent. We will be leaving those customers who do not pay,  and the combine has already worked out a combination of steps in  this direction.    We have asked the Committee on Metallurgy to resolve a  number  of problems which could improve our financial position through  government organs.    They include matters related to foreign economic activity.  How do we take part in this activity if we are handcuffed and  our legs are shackled? We are paying a 25-percent duty to import  equipment intended for renovation, we are paying taxes on  exports, 10 percent for Russia's stabilization fund and other  funds and local organs. What is left for enterprises from their  foreign trade activity? There are also additional requisitions  in the form of a tax on profit obtained from exports. Last year  we paid R64 billion for this tax alone.    The State Customs Committee is hampering work in foreign  trade operations as well. We are even prepared to transfer part  of the wage fund to the Voronezh Customhouse: let them develop  and increase their work force. They work on one shift, but we  work on three: our production is continuous, and the combine  ships its output for export day and night. As a result, hundreds  of railcars with products destined for export. But the customs  people do not have the time and people to inspect them. When  imported equipment arrives, the customhouse does not authorize  it to be unloaded.    We must not be exasperated by the railroad tariffs  introduced  recently, which make the shipment of materials cost more than  the materials themselves.    It is time to turn our attention to the entire taxation  system--this is a system which is killing the producer! By  paying the taxes, we are essentially providing credit to  everyone without interest. But why, if there is no ability to  pay, don't they give us interest-free credit for even 3 or 4  months? If the combine does not pay in time, then fine it or tax  it whatever you think necessary. But in principle, why are we  worse than any other enterprise in other countries? Why do we  receive credit at 210 percent, while it is 8 to 12 percent there?    In December, the combine began a plant to turn out 1 million  refrigerators--a reliable, modern enterprise. Why not remove the  tax on the profit which we are counting on for the foreign loans  of $276 million, at least for the first 3 years? We still owe  $176 million of this sum, but we have to pay the state the tax  on profit. What kind of concern for consumer goods production is  the state showing here? Despite the tremendous difficulty, we  have also organized the production of trailers (10,000 units  annually), motor vehicle spare parts, tape recorders, television  sets, and other video equipment, but now we have to pay taxes on  all the production facilities, in which a tremendous amount of  money has been invested. This is why there is no development of  consumer goods industry in the country: you have your knuckles  rapped if you decide to organize it.    One more question. Previously they left a 5-percent fund for  enterprises in the event that it was necessary to deal with an  accident, prevent a production stoppage, or the like. But the  Ministry of Finance abolished the "first aid." We are asking  that the government raise the question of setting limits for  enterprises' urgent needs.    By the end of the year, all the money will be swept out for  the budget--the federal and oblast budgets--and there won't be a  ruble left for the enterprises! All the funds are confiscated  automatically before the first of February as tax payments. How  are we to pay our employees? We ask the government to reserve 10  percent of the enterprises' production cost of the metal  products turned out to pay for wages. At the same time, it  should be kept in mind that in countries with developed  metallurgical production, a minimum of 30 percent of the  production cost of output goes for employee wages.</p>

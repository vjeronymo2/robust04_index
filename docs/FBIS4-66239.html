			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chang Ching-feng (1728 7650 0023): "Under the </F> Shocking Impact of China's Land Added-Value Tax"]    [Text] Investments are tending to shift toward residential  housing and the renovation of old city districts, and since no  land added-value tax will be levied on deals involving  low-profit houses, the land added-value tax has no substantial  consequences for real estate traders dealing in these kinds of    properties. Those that will have to feel adverse effects  are investors in commercial buildings, medium and high-class  residences, and developers of large tracts of land.  <H5>  New Tax System Good for Fair Competition </H5>   After Mainland China promulgated its land added-value tax,  it  first caused a great stir among Hong Kong's real estate trade  and later also evoked a strong reaction from mainland real  estate dealers. It has already become a hot topic of discussion  these days. We have to admit that for a long time past the tax  burden on real estate dealers on the mainland had been  exceptionally light, and the rate of investment returns [hui bao  0932 1032] had been very high, which was not at all consonant  with the principles of fair competition. For instance, before  promulgation of the real estate added-value tax, a foreign real  estate company had to pay only a 3 percent commodity-house  business tax and a 33 percent enterprise income tax. The tax  burden was really rather light for the real estate trade. I made  a very simple table giving a financial analysis of development  plans, comparing the rate of after-tax investment returns under  the old and under the new tax law. The computation indicates:  Under the old tax system, the lowest consolidated tax rate was  37 percent and the highest 42 percent. The lower the amount of  added-value, the higher the rate of consolidated tax, and the  larger the amount of added value, the lower the rate of  consolidated tax. This was highly unreasonable. The highest rate  of after-tax investment returns could be, at its highest, 189  percent and at its lowest 29 percent, allowing indeed a very  high rate of returns. Under the new tax system, the lowest rate  of the consolidated tax is 53 percent and the highest 73.2  percent. The smaller the amount of added value, the lower the  consolidated tax rate. The higher the amount of added value, the  higher the consolidated tax rate. The rate of after-tax  investment returns could, at its highest, reach 80.4 percent and  at its lowest be only 23.45 percent. This did away with the  unreasonable state of affairs under the old tax system, and is  beneficial for fair competition, beneficial also for the  rational disposition of adjusted social resources.  <H5>  Positive and Negative Effects of the Value-Added Tax </H5>   Positive Effects of the Value-Added Tax    1. The land added-value tax has a certain significance and  function in that it ensures orderliness in land and other real  estate transactions in the market, in that it rationally  regulates increment from land value gains, and in that it  protects the interests of the state and promotes modernization  projects.    2. The new tax has a positive effect in that it adjusts the  structure of real estate investments by encouraging local and  outsider real estate developers to invest more in low-profit  residences and in renovations in old city districts, and in that  it thereby promotes optimal structuring of real estate  investments. That is so because the new tax law stipulates that  all sales that show a profit of 20 percent or less of the cost  are exempt from land added-value tax.    3. The new tax law is also most significant and effective in  protecting actual large investments of real estate developers.  It actively combats speculation in land and buildings, and other  unscrupulous activities seeking sudden undeserved large profits.  It has a restraining effect on the overheating of the real  estate market, and it regulates the direction in which social  funds should flow. It safeguards the capital needs in certain  "bottleneck" sectors and in industry.    Negative Effects of the Land Added-Value Tax    Under the new tax system, the rates of China's consolidated  tax on real estate are from 53.1 to 73.3 percent, which would be  an exceptionally high rate among the countries of Southeast  Asia. If land added-value tax would be levied throughout the  nation, we are afraid, it would deal yet another blow to the  mainland real estate market, which at the present time is  adversely affected by macro-regulation and control and by a  generally depressed market. Because real estate development is  investment for comparatively long durations, real estate  developers will normally place investments only if they can  expect fairly high rates of returns. When real estate developers  see that an excessively high tax will be levied, and the rate of  returns will be reduced, they will most probably temporarily  defer the project in question, or rather stop the intended  project altogether, unless they can shift the tax burden onto  the consumers.    Moreover, in view of the imperfect state of the present  legal  system, "underground trading," which had formerly been involved  in many real estate projects, may again raise its head, and many  more real estate dealers will adopt irregular trading methods,  such as writing out false invoices, and this would be felt as  "unfair" by the majority of discipline-conscious and law-abiding  real estate dealers.    Furthermore, the second-hand real estate market will also be  adversely affected. The second-hand real estate market is  extremely important for the development of the entire real  estate market. In China, the second-hand market is already much  inconvenienced by procedural problems, and the problems would  become even more serious by the effects of the added-value tax.  In that case we figure that in future sellers will demand sundry  expenses (such as fitting-out expenses) in addition to the house  prices, as a means to evade tax.    In sum, in areas and cities where investments have already  shifted toward private residences and the renovation of old city  districts the land added-value tax will in reality have no  adverse impact, because low-profit houses are exempt from land  added-value tax. Those who will really be affected are bound to  be investors in large office buildings, in medium- and  high-class residences, and developers of large tracts of land.  However, this is precisely the initial purpose of promulgating  the land added-value tax.    According to latest reports, the land added-value tax has  been designated a local tax. That means, the local authorities  have the power, with the approval of the central finance and tax  departments, to be flexible in the implementation and  application. The Guangzhou Municipal Government will these days  announce that it will permit the transfer of many-storied  houses, an act which is extremely important for the invigoration  of the second-hand market. On the whole, the land added-value  tax will not seriously and adversely affect developments in the  real estate trade, but will rather ensure that the Chinese real  estate trade will enjoy for a certain period a sustained,  stable, and healthy development, for which prospects are very  good.

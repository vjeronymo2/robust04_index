			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Arts: Identity crisis in the Euro-movies - Nigel Andrews explains why it is becoming more and more difficult to tell European and Hollywood films apart History had been made. The world's future was open for business. But the American with the punchdrunk tie and eyes bright with sleep-deprivation leaned into the microphone for one parting shot. 'You cannot sustain a functioning democracy,' he rasped, 'and control what people see, what they view, and what they hear. We will fight that forever]' Swell of music. Track out from press-conference table. Roll end credits. If not in pre-production already, Gatt The Movie surely soon will be: with Dustin Hoffman as Mickey Kantor and Sir Peter Ustinov as Sir Leon Brittan. The world loves movies about the movie business, and the final stages of the Uruguay Round turned out to be nothing but movies. 'Audio-visuals' was the swank term in the near-interminable squabble about whether Europe should drop its protectionist stance towards its film/TV industry or America bow to the exceptional status of 'culture' in trade negotiations. Years ago - let us flashback to the formative prehistory of this debate - culture and European cinema really did seem homonymous terms. We who grew up through the 1950s and '60s remember the rituals. On with the school scarves. Out with the bikes. Off to the local arthouse - every town had one - for the latest Bergman, Fellini or Godard. There on screen, in glorious monochrome, medieval knights and tortured artists and existential French prostitutes scrimmaged about among the great questions of life and death. This was cinema as secular sacrament. Even our eyes mimicked genuflection by flicking down, every three nanoseconds, to the English subtitles. Europe back then was art, Hollywood was entertainment. There was no enmity between the two kingdoms because each offered a different dispensation. But since then a growing crisis of identity and confidence has hit continental cinema. It was discernible long before Gatt Round 7, in the emergence of a perverse quasi-colonial rapprochement of style between EC and US cinema. Put simply: for the last ten years we have had a hard time telling European and Hollywood films apart. All those clonable Euro-movies snapped up for US remakes like The Vanishing and Three Men And A Baby. All those glossy, Tinseltown-influenced directors like Jean-Jacques (Diva) Beineix, Luc (Nikita) Besson and Pedro (Women On The Verge Of A Nervous Breakdown) Almodovar. Worse still, it is hard to think of any indisputably great film-maker at work on the continent today. Giants with fiercely individual visions born out of individual cultures - the ultra-Italian Fellini (carnivals, high living), the hyperbolically Swedish Bergman (suicide, religion, rocky islands) - seem extinct, leaving the landmass to talented, variable mortals who move like travelling salesmen from country to country, co-production to co-production. Even the most respected and individualistic directors today are condemned to this itinerant way of life. Poland's Krszystof Kieslowski made his last two feature films in France; Frenchman Bertrand Tavernier's last film was a bilingual Franglais production starring Dirk Bogarde; and Italy's Bernardo Bertolucci (The Last Emperor) and Germany's Wim Wenders (Wings Of Desire) shoot all over the world from Morocco to China, New York to New Guinea. Wenders, who occasionally doubles back to Berlin to make movies about those stateless beings called angels, is fully aware of this new nomadic movie Europe - and of the scant room it has for a cinema of national flag-waving. 'These individual cultures,' he told me, 'these film 'nations' as they once were, must face the fact that they can only preserve some of their identity, their national feeling, if they subordinate it under the banner of Europe. I don't think we can much longer pretend you're making a 'German' or 'French' or 'Italian' film. Those notions will have to be given up. We're going to have to believe in a 'European' cinema, where local stories can be told under a common roof.' Even if not suffering a multiple identity crisis, Europe is experiencing a painful rite of passage. So can the soothsayers of EC culture be right in suggesting that if we took Hollywood out of the equation, French, German, Italian film-makers and the rest would bounce straight back to peak health? After all US directors frequently remake films conceived in Europe, but the Europeans never remake US productions. Still, they might if they had the money. The anti-Hollywoodites pick out the following notifiable evils. They (Hollywood) make films that are high on hardware, low on human insight. And their movies are like a factory product: fashioned according to public demand by a multiple workforce, including teams of screenwriters, umpteen producers and even the sneak preview audiences whose scorecards can send a film back for last-minute fine-tuning. But why, if Hollywood is so philistine/unfeeling/mechanistic in its approach to cinema does it keep being attracted to European films? ''Because we are the opposite]' says Jaques Fansten, the French director whose sentimental hit, Cross My Heart, was snapped up by Stephen Spielberg. 'American film-makers say, You're lucky in Europe because you can still make films that are personal] In Hollywood they have 20, 30, 50 people who have a say in how the film is made.' But could the two industries live together? That must be difficult so long as Europe buys half of all American production and America buys some 1 per cent of films and TV shows from the EC . . . Despite claims that American distributors exercise excessive market power, this imbalance also reflects European moviegoing taste. The other big worry is about cultural imperialism. France's best-known director, Bertrand Tavernier says: 'It is a terrifying danger. America can impose on Europe a whole way of making movies. On public TV in France, practically one-third of programmes are in English.' That, surely, is the fault less of Hollywood than of the destabilising effect of the break-up of individual European cultures under the impact of EC 'unity'. But show a Frenchman a glimmer of transatlantic input and he suspects conspiracy. 'America takes film seriously,' says Tavernier, 'not just because it is a big industry, but because it sells a way of life. They know cinema is a vehicle for ideas, and they want to sell those ideas over the world. The Americans take cinema, and the propaganda power of images, very seriously.' So we are back to Coca-Cola and McDonalds. But even if Europe dislikes this Goliath, and his tendency to wield soft drinks monopolies in one hand, spiked club in the other, what in a free world can our Continental David do? 'We must have strict rules] But after all this is the lesson of American cinema. When you see all those Westerns, when you see films like Man Without A Star, where you have fights between the homesteaders and the big cattle baron, they always want to put up barbed wire to protect their 'culture.' And the cattle baron says, 'This is a free country, my cattle can go wherever they want, especially across your land to get to the river.' And the people say, 'Build a road]' But he won't build a road. So the people bring in Kirk Douglas to fight the cattle baron. That is what we need in Europe. We need Kirk Douglas (passionate Tavernier chuckle) to help us]' And the world needs Hollywood to start marshalling its arguments in a propaganda war that Europe is fast turning in its own favour, questioning and re-defining terms like 'free market' and 'protectionism' as it does so. Is there a cattle baron in the house?</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / MCI plans Dollars 2bn assault on US local phone markets MCI Communications, the innovative US long-distance telephone company, yesterday announced a Dollars 2bn initiative to compete with America's Baby Bell local phone companies. It also unveiled an intensified programme of investment in its own information 'super-highway', a network for transmitting huge amounts of data at high speed. The company said that it and various 'associated partners' were expected to invest more than Dollars 20bn over the next six years to deliver new long-distance and local communications to business, homes and research institutions, under a new brand name: networkMCI. MCI played the central role in forcing competition into the US long-distance telephone market in the 1970s and 1980s. Until recently Baby Bells have enjoyed virtual monopolies. Yesterday's announcement was the clearest indication so far of MCI's long-range strategy in America's information revolution, which is blurring the boundaries between the telecommunications, computer and television industries - as well as the regulatory and legal divisions between long-distance and local telephone companies. Even so, the company left uncertain many important details of its plan - including the names of its potential partners and just how much they would contribute to the Dollars 20bn expenditure figure. Mr Bert Roberts, the chairman, noted that last summer's global alliance with British Telecommunications, which is investing Dollars 4.3bn in MCI in return for a 20 per cent stake in the company, had given MCI added flexibility in financing its capital spending programme. The most dramatic element of MCI's strategy is its plan to compete against the local telephone companies, as one of a number of so-called Competitive Access Providers (CAPs), which operate efficient fibre optic networks in big cities, creaming off particularly profitable business customers by offering cheaper rates for bulk traffic. MCI already owns a subsidiary, acquired in 1990 from Western Union, which has telecommunications access to over 2,000 office buildings in US cities. It is to give this business - renamed MCI Metro - a big boost by investing Dollars 2bn in fibre optic cable rings and modern traffic switching facilities, initially in 20 leading metropolitan areas. By sharply increasing its presence in the local market, MCI will reduce the huge 'access fees' it must pay local telephone companies to carry long-distance traffic the last few miles to customers. MCI also announced it had now deployed a key ingredient of modern communications networks - high-speed SONET transmission technology - in half its system, substantially more than its long distance rivals.

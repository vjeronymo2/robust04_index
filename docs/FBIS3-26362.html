			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special feature" by Jiang Yuan (3068 6678)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 1 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The craze  for large-scale business-canvassing activities launched by  various local authorities from the mainland in Hong Kong will be  markedly scaled down this year.    According to information from a relevant quarter, a relevant  department under the State Council has issued instruction to  various localities since the second half of last year,  stipulating that from then on when provinces, autonomous  regions, and municipalities stage business-canvassing activities  in Hong Kong and overseas, they must submit their plans to the  relevant State Council department for examination and approval;  as for counties, cities (county-level cities), and first-grade  enterprises directly under the central authorities wanting to  stage business-canvassing activities in Hong Kong and overseas,  their applications will be scrutinized more stringently, and  they must submit applications not only to the next higher  government for examination and approval, but also to the  relevant State Council department for approval. The instruction  also stressed that various kinds of business-canvassing  activities must attach importance to practical results.    At the same time, apart from strictly restricting various  localities from staging business-canvassing activities outside  the country and borders, the relevant State Council department  also instructed that regarding various kinds of  business-canvassing activities organized by the localities, and  various kinds of festive activities "staged in the name of  culture, but turned out to be economic and trade operas,"  regulation and control will be strengthened, and centralized  arrangements will be made.    According to information, the reason for the Chinese  Government to make up its mind to exercise strict control over  various localities wanting to stage business-canvassing  activities outside the country and border is because many  negative effects caused by the excess business-canvassing  activities in the past have already gradually surfaced. Among  the effects are:    First, too much "untrue foreign capital."    Many investment projects which are made in the name of  foreign firms or foreign sources, are in fact made by mainland  organizations (mainly state-run organizations) which transfer  their funds overseas and then back home with a new name, and the  purpose is to evade taxes and to enjoy the preferential policy  in the areas of taxes and import and export of quotas for  foreign-funded enterprises. Such moves not only cause losses in  government revenue, but also bring about great chaos to various  economic domains and links.    Second, the proportion of foreign capital being made really  available is extremely low.    The excess business-canvassing activities have created an  unhealthy practice of being "false, big, and empty," and led to  a situation in which the unfulfilled letters of intent and  agreements on huge amounts of investment fly in the sky  everywhere. A certain big province in the north said at the end  of last year that it had attracted $6 billion of foreign funds,  but in reality less than $100 million of the foreign funds was  really made available.    Third, astonishing waste and extravagance.    Over the past one or two years, business-canvassing  activities staged outside the country (border), especially in  Hong Kong by various localities, have involved larger and larger  delegations and increasingly extravagant layouts, while some  people have used the business-canvassing activities as excuses  to travel on public funds, to the serious extent of practicing  fraud and putting the cart before the horse. In order to cover  up the economic "hole" which involved a large amount of money,  they could only report false results in the business-canvassing  activities.    In light of this situation, and in order to check corrupt  practices in economic activities, the State Council has promptly  sent a strongly worded "red-letterhead document" to various  localities in the whole country, strictly controlling those who  want to stage business-canvassing activities in Hong Kong and  overseas, and saying that violations of the regulations will be  looked into according to law and discipline.</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Arts: Welles on Welles - Screen THIS IS ORSON WELLES by Orson Welles and Peter Bogdanovich HarperCollins Pounds 20, 519 pages DO WE laugh or cry at This Is Orson Welles? Probably both. This is the conversational swansong of a master film-maker, but tears keep turning to chuckles at Welles's sense of the ridiculous about cinema. For 500 pages he holds forth on every subject, from The Magnificent Ambersons to amateur magic, from radio drama to Rita Hayworth, from the tricks of filming snow scenes (white cornflakes in Citizen Kane, refrigerated soundstage in Ambersons) to the trials of spending too many years in the Hollywood sun. On the way, he reveals more about the secret currents in his own cinema than an armada of biographies have done, before and since his death in 1985. 'Last' is not quite the mot juste for this interview tome. It was edited by Jonathan Rosenbaum from conversations Welles had with critic-filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich in the late 1960s/early '70s. When both men became too busy to tidy it for publication, the manuscript hung about, then got lost for five years, then found again. But the book will surely be the 'last' published work starring Welles's own voice. As in Truffaut's Hitchcock opus, the movies are dissected and demythologised by the man who should know. Lucky accidents and the inspirations of others are confessed; auteur theories are taken to the cleaners. But it is not all deprecation of his own genius. The more the book barrels along, with Welles protesting the long interrogation sessions (Bogdanovich: 'How about Fellini?', Welles: 'How about a little rest?'), the more a new and self-revealing film-maker emerges. It is easy to see why Welles earned the old image of a showman-dilettante: too much success too young, too many vaunted projects left unfinished. The world is still picking over the bones of Don Quixote and The Merchant of Venice. And it would be picking over The Other Side of the Wind too, his rumouredly brilliant dark comedy about film-making starring John Huston and P. Bogdanovich, if only it could obtain the tied-up negatives and see the material. But Welles rejects the role others have cast him in: that of an eternal dabbler, a playboy of Western cinema. The reasons for unfinished films are painfully explained. And Welles's own taste, far from favouring the gimmicky, prefers the elegiac Ambersons to the tricksy Kane, the rueful Chimes At Midnight to the bizarre The Lady From Shanghai. He also claims cogency for some movies that do seem like empty pyrotechnic displays. He defends The Trial - often viewed as an example of Euro-Expressionism gone bananas - as his most personal film: a bleak human comedy rather than a piece of high-camp Kafka-Gothic. If we believe Welles - and the man who radio-hoaxed a nation with The War Of The Worlds requires pinches of salt - he was a gifted dreamer woken too soon by the realities of a philistine business. There are two horribly sad passages in the book. In one Welles gnaws his heart over the multi-picture deal he thought would follow Touch Of Evil in the late 1950s, but which Universal dropped on seeing the finished film. 'It was just too dark and black and strange for them'. In the other, Bogdanovich recounts a late-night TV screening of the studio-butchered Ambersons that he and friends watched with Welles present. Or almost present. The film's creator hung back, made some barbed comments, vanished into another room, came back, then spent the remaining film looking out through the darkened window. His eyes were moist when he turned round at movie's end, says Bogdanovich. We can wonder about how much Welles, the master artificer, confected even these theoretically intimate moments. What we cannot wonder about is the evidence of Welles's greatness before us on screen. It was not just technical bravura and a flair for alchemising image into metaphor. It was the sense of human existence as a single, ironic sweep: giving us the time-lapse segues of Kane, the compacted social history of Ambersons, even Harry Lime's Welles-scripted speech in The Third Man, aphoristically colliding Renaissance Italy with cuckoo-clock Switzerland. 'It's not that the world's so small,' Welles muses at one point to Bogdanovich, 'it's that history is so short. Four or five very old men could join hands and take you right back to Shakespeare.' But summing up human history or another human life in a wry snapshot is easier than doing the same with one's own life. What makes us laugh in this book is Welles's exposure of the little local impostures that add up to the ephemeral lunacy of 'success'. Like his story of Churchill standing up by pre-arrangement in a Venice hotel whenever Welles passed by. Object, to impress potential backers. But what tugs the heart is the regret of a great artist for all the great art he never made: for a life that gradually turned to unfulfilment and hollow fame. Citizen Welles, by making Citizen Kane, became his own self-fulfilling prophet. Bogdanovich even reminds us, in a postscript to the book, that Welles chose to have his ashes scattered 6000 miles from Hollywood on a Spanish farm where he had once been happy as an 18-year-old boy.

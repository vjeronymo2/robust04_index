			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi VNA May 20 -- A light house is being built on  the Da Tay Island of Truong Sa Archipelagoes (Spratly) by the  Maritime Navigation company.    When completed, this light house 20 metres in height, will  be  visible from 16 nautical miles.    Due to difficult working conditions on offshore islands, the  company leadership constantly takes care of the workers' life,  providing them with enough foods, vegetables and fresh water.  The company is now managing nearly 30 light houses from  northern Province of Quang Ninh to the central Province of Quang  Nam Da Nang and the Truong Sa archipelagoes in the East Sea.</p>

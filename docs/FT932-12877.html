			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Contours alter on the Vance-Owen map: Change is probably on the cards for 'the only game in town' THE Vance-Owen plan for Bosnia may never be declared formally dead, but few observers still believe that it can serve unchanged as the basis for a durable peace settlement, after its latest rejection by the Bosnian Serbs. The funeral oration for the plan cannot be delivered for the simple reason that the package of tougher international sanctions decided by the United Nations Security Council, due to come into effect today, are linked to the plan. The sanctions are specifically intended to force the Bosnian Serbs to endorse the plan, as the result of pressure applied on them by their Serbian 'big brother' in Belgrade. If the Security Council, or the US and its allies alone, should decide to take military action, be it the selective lifting of the arms embargo to help the Bosnian Moslems or air strikes against Bosnian Serb supply routes, those measures, too, will officially have the same political objective. In the well-worn phrase often applied to it by commentators, it is still the only game in town, meaning that it is still the only official political blue-print for a peace settlement, backed by both the United Nations and the European Community. Its defects are widely recognised. But so is the fact that these very flaws are the result of the insistence by the international mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, to preserve both an independent state of Bosnia-Hercegovina and the virtual autonomy of its various ethnic groups in regions which they traditionally inhabited. The result would be the withdrawal of the Bosnian Serbs from much of the territory they occupy at present, reducing the area allocated to them from 70 per cent of the total to 43 per cent. Those considerations are considered to be central to any peace settlement by the international community, particularly given the Bosnian Serbs' undisguised desire to submerge an independent state of their own in a greater Serbia. But they have made it difficult to devise a viable alternative project showing the same degree of impartiality or one which could muster anything like the same international support as the Vance-Owen plan has done. Western opinion has tended to blame the Bosnian Serbs for all the plan's setbacks during the many months it has been discussed by the warring parties in Geneva and New York. But the question has often been asked whether, even if the Bosnian Serbs had endorsed the plan, it was ever realistic to believe that it could be effectively implemented or offer a durable solution to Bosnia's complicated ethnic and political problems. The viability of a state divided into 10 semi-autonomous provinces, many of which are separated from others with the same ethnic composition, has always been questionable. The policing of the borders of this jigsaw of cantons and the freedom of movement along specially designated routes linking different parts of the country, would be an extraordinarily difficult task. At a conservative estimate it would require at least 60,000 UN peacekeepers to do the job for an indefinite period. That could last at least two decades given the bitterness felt by all the ethnic groups - Moslems, Croats and Serbs - at the atrocities perpetrated against each other. And even such a large number of UN troops might not be sufficient to prevent a renewed outbreak of hostilities. Even if the Bosnian Serbs can be forced by tougher international sanctions, or military intervention, to reconsider their outright opposition to the plan, it seems increasingly improbable that it will survive in its present form. Given the mutual hostility between Moslems, Serbs and Croats, a greater concentration of the various ethnic groups in homogeneous regions is much more likely to be the long-term outcome of the Bosnian imbroglio than the Vance-Owen map, however sophisticated and equitable it is on paper.</p>

Although coalition party  representatives met twice, they failed to reach a conclusion due  to a gulf over whether to offset the proposed income tax  reduction with a hike in the consumption tax, the officials said.    Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito (the Japan  Renewal Party), told reporters the meetings broke down, adding  that the ruling parties will hold another round of talks on  Wednesday to thrash out a decision.    "It all depends on the SDP (Social Democratic Party)," said  Takashi Yonezawa, secretary general of the Democratic Socialist  Party.    The SDP, the largest force in the seven-party coalition  government, has objected to the idea of raising the consumption  tax, presently at 3 percent, to cover the diminished revenue  resulting from the proposed income tax cut.    The income tax reduction is expected to be the core of a  fresh economic stimulus package to be finalized by Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's cabinet on Thursday.    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told reporters later that the  party is willing to consider a more balanced tax system but  oppose the consumption tax hike coupled in the same package with  an income tax reduction.    He indicated it is acceptable to issue relatively short-term  national bonds, like those that mature in five years, to fund  tax cuts.</p>

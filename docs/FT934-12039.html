			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Changes to dividend calculations FROM TODAY, the London Share Service pages show gross dividend yields calculated in a slightly different way. The changes, which also affect the net dividend reported in each Monday edition, bring the figures into line with those used for the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index and other FT-SE Actuaries indices. Previously, the individual company share price listings on Mondays showed the total of each company's dividends for the last full financial year. This meant that the figures were only updated once a year, and did not reflect the impact of dividend changes. The new method is that the figure is updated after every dividend announcement, whether interim or final. For most companies, this means that the figure will be updated twice a year. At the six month stage, therefore, the total gross dividend per share will typically be the latest net interim dividend plus the net final dividend paid in the second half of the company's previous financial accounting year, plus the tax credit which currently stands at 20 per cent. The same procedure, suitably modified, will apply to those few companies that pay dividends more than twice a year. Dividends declared by a company up to 5pm each weekday will be reflected in its shares' gross dividend yield in the following day's tables. Dividends declared later in the day are held over for 24 hours. Where companies make explicit forecasts of end-year dividends, the yield figures reported are modified to reflect these projections. Details of the rules of thumb used in handling dividend announcements appear in the accompanying table.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- RULES USED FOR REPORTING THE TOTAL DIVIDEND IN THE FT'S LONDON SHARE SERVICE.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CIRCUMSTANCE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Interim increased without any qualification by company.  -Interim increased with the advice that an increased total is   expected.  -Interim reduced with no advice about future dividend policy.  -Interim passed but company indicates that a final will be paid.  -Interim paid in current year when no interim paid in previous year,   with no statement regarding future dividends.  -Interim increased/decreased to reduce disparity between interim and   final dividends.  -Interim passed with no indication as to whether a final will be paid.  -Interim passed and company indicates that a final will not be paid.  -Interim unchanged and company expresses doubt about ability to   maintain previous year's total.  -Interim declared when no dividends at all were paid in the previous   year.  -Interim followed by zero final with no company indication about   future dividends.  -Interim increased with the advice that the final will be increased by   the same rate.  -Special/extraordinary dividend declared by company ie, a one-off   bonus dividend.  -Special/extraordinary dividend declared for the third consecutive   year.  -Last accounting period not equal to twelve months.  -Nil or partly-paid security.  -Forecast by company.  -Zero forecast by company but it says that it hopes to resume   payments.  -Maximum forecast by company.  -Forecast cannot be related to existing shares because of merger.  -Increased/decreased first-quarter dividend with no advice about   future dividends.  -Increased/decreased first-quarter dividend where the company normally   pays same first 3 quarterly dividends and then a final.  -Company announces an increased dividend for the first three quarters   and forecasts an increased final amount.  -Government changes the rate of tax credit applicable to dividends.   (Currently 20%.)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- RULE/ACTION  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Assume unchanged final - add interim to previous final dividend for   new total.  -Assume unchanged final - add interim to previous final for new total.  -Assume unchanged final - add interim to previous final for new total.  -Assume unchanged final - new total will be the previous final   dividend.  -Add interim to previous final dividend to give new total.  -Assume unchanged total dividend - do nothing.  -Assume unchanged final - new total will be the previous final   dividend only.  -Assume that no dividend will be paid - new total will be zero.  -Assume unchanged final - total dividend will remain unchanged.  -Assume zero final - new total will comprise of this interim only.  -Use last interim dividend for new total.  -Multiply last year's final by the same percentage increase as the   interim and add to the interim for new total.  -Assume unchanged total - exclude this 'special' dividend from total.  -Add the dividend into the running total.  -Adjust dividend to 'per annum' basis.  -Use same dividend as the fully-paid security and use fully-paid price   to calculate yield.  -Use company's forecast total.  -Use zero total.  -Use company's forecast total.  -Use adjusted historical total - amount paid in company's last   complete accounting period.  -Add to previous year's 2nd, 3rd quarter and final dividend for new   total.  -Multiply the first-quarter dividend by 3 and add this to the previous   final dividend for new total.  -New total is the sum of the three quarterly dividends plus the   forecast final.  -From the start of the new financial tax year, ie 5th April, all   dividends held in the database will be 'grossed-up' at the new rate.  -This also applies to dividends already paid.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- While the most common circumstances in dealing with dividends are dealt with above, the Committee may introduce new or additional rules from time to time at its discretion.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFTER THE FALL;  </P> <P> MCENROE CRITICIZES U.S. EFFORT IN DAVIS CUP  </P> <P> John McEnroe, who reached the final of the U.S. Hardcourt in Indianapolis  Saturday, is upset that the United States didn't reach the final of the Davis  Cup.  </P> <P> Because of a shoulder injury, McEnroe missed the U.S. semifinal match in  Munich, where Boris Becker led a 3-2 West German victory.  </P> <P> McEnroe told ESPN that Michael Chang should have replaced him and also  questioned Andre Agassi's play.  </P> <P> Chang was asked to play but chose not to because of a lack of preparation.  Agassi's 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 loss to Carl-Uwe Steeb gave West Germany an  insurmountable 3-1 lead.  </P> <P> "Where was Chang?," McEnroe said. "Why wasn't he there? I'm very surprised that  he wasn't there, and the effort that Agassi showed in the last match was very  surprising. And I think that doesn't help Davis Cup."  </P> <P> Agassi had trailed Steeb, 5-0, in the fourth set.  </P> <P> McEnroe said it was painful to watch the Davis Cup on television.  </P> <P> "I felt like I could have made a difference," he said. "I feel like one of my  strengths is that I'm a team player . . . and that I can get the other guys up.  </P> <P> "You could see that was really missing. There were a lot of lost souls over  there."  </P></p>

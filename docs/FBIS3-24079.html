			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by R. Mogilevskiy, general director of the </F> Sociological Scientific Research Center Joint-Stock Company,  under the rubric "Social Monitoring": "A Choice for Centuries?"]    [Text] Three-quarters of Petersburg voters would vote  today the same way they did on 12 December. On the other hand, 7  percent of those participating in elections today would not turn  out altogether, and another 10 percent are not certain they  would vote the same way. Another 7 percent of voters today would  vote differently.    The greatest number of those who definitely would change  their decision are among those who voted by party lists--4  percent. The smallest--in federal and one-seat districts--1  percent each. Thus, had the elections taken place today, the  Petersburg electorate most likely would have reaffirmed its  choice. The only questionable variable is the outcome of the  referendum, which required a 50 percent plus one electoral  turnout.    The elections are an accomplished fact, however, and now  Russian voters may watch their doing. It appears that their  observations do not add to their joy. In any case, in Petersburg  only 9 percent of respondents are satisfied with the composition  of both chambers of the parliament; only 2 percent are satisfied  with the composition of the State Duma, and 5 percent--with that  of the Federation Council. Those not satisfied with the  composition of either the State Duma or the Federation Council  comprise 45 percent, and 40 percent have no opinion. Of course,  different groups of voters have a different idea of the  approximate composition of the parliament chambers. It is clear,  however, that the deputies' authority in the eyes of Petersburg  voters is low.    In discussions over the past few weeks a hypothesis was  advanced that the success of the LDPR, which received about  [figure illegible]8 percent of the vote in Petersburg, was due  to the fact that the candidates had been able to recruit new,  previously passive, groups of voters. Our research does not  support this hypothesis. Ninety-two percent are voters who after  1990 have participated in all or almost all elections and  referendums. So most likely a certain change in the preference  structure is to be explained by a shift on the part of the  electorate to different political values and social expectations.    Thus, on the threshold of elections to the City Assembly,  voter preferences remain practically the same as they were  before 12 December. The political fate of the representative  branch in the city will be decided by a group of "familiar"  voters, of whom more than 60 percent are women, 70 percent are  persons over 40, about 70 percent have higher and intermediate  vocational education, as a rule working, and more than 60  percent are workers and office workers. The assembly composition  will depend on whether the candidates find arguments and  political programs that will preserve or change these people's  choice, for, as research shows, it is hardly possible to count  on a mass influx of new voters in March.    The survey was conducted by the St. Petersburg Sociological  Scientific-Research Center by way of telephone polling. The  sample included 1,105 respondents. The statistical error along  controlled parameters (sex, age, and education) is within 3  percent.</p>

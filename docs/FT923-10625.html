			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / British Aerospace poised to unveil strategy for recovery: Group expected to focus on profitable core activities MR John Cahill, the new chairman of British Aerospace, is expected to unveil next month his recovery strategy for Britain's biggest manufacturing company aimed at refocusing the group on its profitable core military aircraft and Airbus activities. Mr Cahill, former BTR chief executive, will make his first public policy statement as BAe's chairman when the company announces its financial results for the first half of its current fiscal year next month, aerospace industry officials and City analysts said yesterday. The strategy of refocusing the company on core activities is also expected to entail heavy asset write-offs which some City analysts believe could amount to around Pounds 750m as well as a possible dividend cut. BAe is experiencing difficult trading conditions in its main markets and activities, and the City expects the group to report a loss in the first half and for the whole of fiscal 1992. Analysts estimate an operating loss of between Pounds 40m and Pounds 50m for the full year before provisions. The write-offs, and fears of a dividend cut, depressed BAe's share price which yesterday fell a further 10p to 180p. This is less than half the price of the rights issue of 380p last winter and less than a third of the share price of 576p 12 months ago. BAe's share price was also hit by a report that the European Commission might require the UK government to recoup interest on Pounds 44.4m of aid it paidto BAe when the company took over the Rover car group in 1988. The EC is expected to issue in September a new order for repayment by BAe of the Pounds 44.4m 'sweeteners' and possibly interest which it considers illegal state support. But City analysts yesterday suggested the EC initiative was relatively modest in the face of BAe'sdeeper structural problems. Mr Cahill has already introduced stricter disciplines on capital spending and is expected to accelerate efforts to cut the cash drain from unprofitable or non-core activities. A priority is a solution to the company's loss-making regional jet business. BAe has been struggling to find international partners for its regional jet oper-ations. UK aerospace industry officials said yesterday the company was increasingly likely to shelve its BAe 146 regional jet programme if it failed to find partners. One hint that the the company's regional aircraft operations are to be reshaped imminently was the decision to transfer all 146 product support operations to BAe's Airbus division. This would ensure continued product support for 146 operators in the event of an decision to shut down 146 production. In spite of doubts over the future of the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) programme in which BAe is a leading partner, the company's military aircraft activities continue to be regarded as one of its main strengths together with its 20 per cent stake in the European Airbus large airliner consortium.

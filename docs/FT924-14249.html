			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Tebbit: plain in Spain: Press Review SOMETIMES, I think it is a shame that British disputes are not conducted in Spanish. The Conservative conference's debate about Europe on Tuesday was exciting enough in English, but even Lord Tebbit gained in translation. In the pages of El Pais, he called on the prime minister, John Major, to raise 'la bandera de todos los patriotas de Europa.' No longer was he the 'Chingford Skinhead' but, perhaps, a fashionable 1968 Latin American terrorist on a lecture tour, or a peculiarly fanatical supporter of General Franco circa 1937. By comparison, the French was a trifle desiccated: Tebbit in Le Figaro demanded, 'd'abord une politique pour la Grande Bretagne, en suite une politique pour la Grande Bretagne et enfin une . . .' etc. The Italian version was inevitably opera: The foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, delivered the aria 'Reject this folly' (Respingete questa follia) in Il Sole: 24 Ore. The paper's London correspondent, Alessandro Merli enjoyed the Tebbit's speech and the reaction: 'Behind his shoulders, from a podium that seemed to have been designed for the Soviet politburo in the good old days, Major and his colleagues observed him in silence with the same impassivity, and the same complexion, as the late Brezhnev.' For the Germans, of course, a day late as always, it was the textual analysis which counted. When the noble lord turned to John Major he was, according to Bernhard Heimrich in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, even more deadly than in the 'German' section of his speech. ''You need our support, Sir, we give it to you.' The cold hostile word, the insult in this sentence is the tiny word 'Sir.' It says more than a 1,000 words.' Heimrich noted that the former minister Kenneth Baker had defected to the 'No-to-Maastricht' camp and would vote against the Treaty in spite of party obligations. He was 'true to the motto of another great European, Martin Luther: 'I can do nothing else.'' Baker said that in German, and it sounded indeed like true Luther-German.' That is probably the last thing the more paranoid Tories want to hear, firm in their belief that it was 1940 all over again. But Britain does not stand alone this time round. An interesting 'war of words,' as Major would say, has broken out between the Italian tycoon Carlo De Benedetti and the editor of Der Spiegel, Rudolf Augstein. Writing in his magazine, L'Espresso two weeks ago, Sig De Benedetti said, 'The Italians, the English, the Spaniards and all the others . . .cannot pay for the containment of east German unemployment by increases in their own unemployment . . .' In other words, the rest of us should stop having to pay for German reunification. The article was headed 'Die for Dresden? No.' Herr Augstein seemed to miss the point when he replied, 'Italy should rather think of the Mezzogiorno . . . Why a double standard? Should we rebel against the bad economic management of southern Italy?' Die Welt joined in saying the 'supermark' could not be blamed for Italy's troubles and its Rome correspondent complained about the rising tide of 'Germanophobia' in Italy. Finally, what should have been a footnote last week but I came across it only an hour before the deadest of deadlines and hardly knew what to make of it and the odd frisson it created. First a few words of introduction for those who have forgotten their school history. In 1870, Kaiser Wilhelm met the French ambassador in the little town of Ems near Koblenz. The outcome of that meeting was related in a telegram, which Bismarck then edited for publication in France where it aroused great anger. Years later Bismarck said it was all part of his successful plan to start the Franco-Prussian war. So it was that the Borsen-Zeitung wrote: 'The publication of the views of Bundesbank President Helmut Schlesinger on the pound crisis in British papers reminds us of the vaguely understood 'Ems Telegram' from our history books.' So here is the awful coincidence. An Ems Telegram in 1870; an EMS Telegram in 1992. It is, perhaps, fortunate that the pun does not work in German.

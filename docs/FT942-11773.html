			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Powell Duffryn unwinds Spanish joint venture Powell Duffryn and its partner CEPSA have sold Proquimica, their joint chemical storage business venture in Barcelona, Spain, to Terminales Portuarias for Pta2.09bn (about Pounds 10m). The sale follows CEPSA's strategic decision not to maintain an investment in chemical storage facilities in the future. The company, which also owns bulk storage facilities in the UK, US, Australia and South Africa, intends to reinvest the proceeds in upgrading and extending the range of services offered through its other storage activities. Mr Bill Andrews, Powell's chief executive, said that CEPSA's decision to withdraw 'led us to conclude that our bulk liquid storage activities would be better served by redeploying resources to our other terminal locations, rather than increasing our investment in Barcelona'.</p>

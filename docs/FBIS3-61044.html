Andrusenko,  R.G. Dukov, and Yu.R. Fomin, Voyennoye izdatelstvo, Moscow,  1989, 70,000 copies, 336 pages, illustrated]    [Text]  <H5>  Annotation </H5>   This book examines the actions of a motorized rifle (tank)  platoon in various types of battle based on the requirements of  formal documents containing regulations, advanced experience of  instruction, and the experience of the Great Patriotic War. It  uses specific examples to show the work of the platoon commander  for organizing combat, command and control of the platoon in  battle, and organizing its all-round support.    The book is intended for subunit commanders of the Ground  Forces and officer candidates at military schools.  <H5>  Foreword </H5>   Guided by Lenin's doctrine on protecting the socialist  fatherland, the Communist Party and Soviet Government are  tirelessly concerned with increasing in every possible way the  defensive might of our homeland and further strengthening the  combat readiness of its armed forces.    Our country's successes in development of the economy,  science, and technology have made it possible to equip all  services of the armed forces and branches of troops, including  the Ground Forces and their basis--motorized rifle and tank  large units, units, and subunits--with the most modern armament  and combat equipment and thereby sharply raise their combat  capabilities.    Motorized rifle and tank subunits equipped with armored  fighting vehicles [BMP's], armored transport vehicles [BTR's],  and tanks are able to carry out the most diverse missions in  battle, reliably engage enemy personnel, tanks, BMP's, BTR's,  artillery, and antitank weapons, combat enemy aircraft and  helicopters, advance swiftly, and defend stubbornly.    But it is still not enough to have modern armament to  achieve  success in battle. A decisive role here belongs to the  person--the soldier--who possesses high moral-political,  fighting, and psychological qualities and has mastered combat  equipment and weapons and the art of organizing and waging  battle in complex and diverse situation conditions.    A platoon commander must be highly educated in the  military-technical and tactical respect, know the combat  capabilities of his subunit, and skillfully and tactically  competently use them in battle. The basic purpose of this book  is to help him do this.    The book's material corresponds to curricula for training  officer candidates of higher combined-arms and tank command  schools in military disciplines. The theoretical heritage of the  classics of Marxism-Leninism on military issues and the works of  M.V. Frunze, M.N. Tukhachevskiy, and P.I. Batov were used in  writing this book. At the basis of this work are the  requirements of the Field Manual of the Ground Forces and  regulations and manuals on preparing, organizing, and waging  modern combined-arms battle by subunits.    The authors of the book set as their task to disclose the  basic questions of preparing, organizing, and waging the basic  types of battle and to examine the actions of a platoon during  battle in special conditions.    The authors devoted primary attention to the work of the  platoon commander for organizing battle, command and control of  subunits in battle, the actions of a platoon in the defense, the  offensive, on the march, in march security and security at the  halt, and on reconnaissance.    The drawings and tactical diagrams illustrating the  platoon's  actions in various types of modern combined-arms battle will  serve to master this material better.    The book is intended for subunit commanders of the Ground  Forces and officer candidates at military schools.  <H5>  Chapter 1. Fundamentals of Modern Combined-Arms Battle </H5> <H5>  1. Essence of Modern Combined-Arms Battle </H5>   Soviet military art regards battle as the basic form of  tactical operations of troops, an organized armed clash between  large units, units, and subunits of the warring sides which is  strikes, fire, and maneuver coordinated by objective, place, and  time to destroy (rout) the enemy and carry out other tactical  missions in a specific area during a short interval of time.    Before the appearance of firearms, hand-to-hand fighting of  soldiers armed with edged weapons was the essence of battle.    With the development of firearms, fire became the most  important significant element of battle. It made possible  confrontation of the warring sides at a distance without making  direct contact (but not precluding it) and thus increasing the  spatial scope of battle, which was also significant for that  period of development of society and military affairs.    Massive equipping of troops with automatic weapons,  artillery, tanks, and aviation resulted in battlefield success  being achieved through coordinated efforts of subunits, units,  and large units of all branches of troops participating in it.  Battle became combined-arms battle, and its spatial scope  increased even more.    Defeating and routing the enemy can be achieved only by  powerful strikes by all types of weapons, timely exploitation of  the results of their strikes, and also by aggressive and  decisive actions of subunits, units, and large units of all  branches of troops and special troops.    Modern combined-arms battle requires skillful use of all  weapons and combat and special equipment, a high degree of  mobility and organization, full intensity of moral and physical  forces, inflexible will for victory, iron discipline, and combat  cohesiveness. This is achieved by high combat proficiency;  conscientious fulfillment of one's military duty; steadfastness,  bravery, courage, and readiness of personnel in any conditions  to strive for total victory over the enemy; superiors' knowing  their subordinates, personal contact with them, attention to  their daily combat life and needs, and high exactingness towards  them; instilling in subordinates faith in the rightness of our  cause and devotion to the socialist homeland and the Soviet  Government.    Modern combined-arms battle can be waged both in conditions  of using nuclear and other weapons and with using only  conventional weapons. The presence of nuclear weapons and other  weapons of mass destruction in the enemy's hands, at a high  degree of readiness, requires their continuous detection and  destruction by the troops and, at the same time, accomplishment  of measures to protect against weapons of mass destruction and  the ability to wage battle in conditions of their employment.  <H5>  2. Forces and Assets of Modern Combined-Arms Battle </H5>   The nature of battle and the methods of waging it depend  primarily on the material basis, that is, on the armament,  combat equipment, and people using these means of warfare.    Based on an analysis of a large amount of historical  material, F. Engels concluded: "Nothing depends on economic  conditions like the army and navy. Armament, personnel,  organization, tactics, and strategy depend primarily on the  level of production achieved at a given moment and on means of  communication. It is not the `free creativity of the mind' of  genius military leaders that functioned in a revolutionizing  manner here, but the acquisition of better weapons and the  change in soldier material; at best, the influence of genius  military leaders is limited by the fact that they are adapt the  method of waging battle to the new weapons and to the new  fighting men."*    Means of warfare have the most revolutionizing influence on  methods of combat operations. "Military tactics," noted V.I.  Lenin, "depend on the level of military equipment..."**    Another component part of the material basis of  battle--people and their morale--also has a great influence on  the change in the nature of battle and the methods of waging it.  Characterizing the role of the morale factor, V.I. Lenin wrote:  "In any war, victory in the final analysis is determined by the  morale of the masses who shed their blood on the field of  battle."***    These words of V.I. Lenin fully retain their importance in  today's conditions. Despite the tremendous power and  capabilities of the new weapons, people remain the fundamental  principle without which any equipment, any weapons will be  useless and armed conflict is simply inconceivable.    The current period of development of military affairs is  characterized by the appearance and rapid development of  qualitatively new weapons fundamentally different from those  which were used during the last war, full motorization of the  army, intensive mechanization, and also an ever-increasing  introduction of electronics into the troops.    Nuclear weapons are the principal, most powerful weapon of  the enemy. Skillful use of them makes it possible to destroy  with a high degree of effectiveness and in short periods of time  the enemy's weapons of mass destruction, inflict large losses on  the enemy, destroy structures and other installations, create  zones of radioactive contamination and areas of destruction,  debris, fire, and flooding, and also exert heavy psychological  pressure on the population and armed forces personnel. They are  used without warning, massively, and in combination with  conventional weapons.    Nuclear weapons include all types of nuclear munitions and  means of delivering them to targets. Massive, group, and single  strikes can be delivered by nuclear weapons. Destruction of  enemy installations by nuclear weapons can be accomplished by  air, surface, and underground (water surface, underwater)  nuclear bursts. Various types of missiles and aircraft are the  primary means of delivering nuclear munitions to the targets.    As the primary weapon, nuclear weapons have a decisive  influence on the nature of battle and give it an exceptional  decisiveness, dynamic quality, and unprecedented spatial scope.    Conventional weapons comprise all fire and strike weapons  using artillery, antiaircraft, aircraft, small-arms, and  engineer munitions and burning mixtures. Conventional weapons  can be used independently or in combination with nuclear weapons  to destroy enemy manpower and combat equipment and also to  demolish and destroy various installations.    The dialectics of military affairs are such that in addition  to the decisive importance of nuclear weapons, the role of  tanks, artillery, aircraft, and other conventional weapons  remains great. It is especially important to bear in mind that  under certain conditions, combat operations can be conducted  using only conventional weapons. Thus, the task is in modern  battle to learn to how to make skillful use of the increased  role of motorized rifle subunits, units, and large units, the  fire and striking power of tanks, and the effectiveness of  airstrikes and artillery fire.    Changes in weapons and combat equipment have had a  significant influence on the content, nature, and methods of  waging battle.  <H5>  3. Characteristics of Modern Combined-Arms Battle </H5>   By characteristics we mean the important attributes and  particular features which disclose the nature of battle in one  or another war.    The nature of battle is the sum total of general  characteristics inherent to this a given battle and determining  its attributes and particular features. The characteristics of  battle are not unchanging; improvement of the material basis of  battle also entails a change in its characteristic traits. The  comparatively low level of development of weaponry during World  War I predetermined the exceptional slow rate of development of  battle, its limited scope, and insufficient decisiveness.  Conversely, the sharp qualitative improvement in weapons during  World War II and the increase in their numbers gave battle a new  content and caused its high maneuverability and dynamic nature.    Equipping the troops with various types of nuclear weapons  and other latest combat equipment and the changes associated  with this in training personnel created different conditions for  combat operations and caused profound changes in the nature and  methods of conducting them.    Modern battle is characterized by decisiveness,  high maneuverability, intensity and fluidity, rapid and abrupt  changes in the situation and diversity of methods used to wage  it, development of combat operations on land and in the air over  a broad front and to a great depth, and conducting them at a  high tempo.    Decisiveness of combat operations is predetermined  by the decisiveness of political goals, the acute class nature  of a future war, the use of powerful modern weaponry creating  all the necessary prerequisites for conducting such operations,  high moral and fighting qualities of personnel of the Soviet  Army, and the progressive nature of our military science.    Decisiveness is manifested in the goals of battle and the  methods of achieving them, in the selfless actions of the  troops, their inflexible desire to carry out the combat mission  fully in all types of battle and in any situation, operating  with initiative and maximum persistence and perseverance. Of  great importance is educating officers in the spirit of  decisiveness, boldness, persistence, the ability to carry out to  the end, irrevocably and without hesitation, the decision to  crush the enemy, willing to assume responsibility for  demonstrated initiative and to use every opportunity to carry  out the combat mission. Indecisiveness and passiveness in battle  lead to defeat.    Further qualitative development of weapons and combat  equipment will increase even more the decisiveness of battle and  the requirements for training of personnel of subunits, units,  and large units.    High maneuverability of modern battle is the  result of the use of powerful weaponry and a sharp increase in  the mobility of combined-arms subunits, units, and large units  due to their complete motorization, their being equipped with  highly mobile combat equipment, and also the lack of a  continuous front in the defense and in an offensive.    Modern weapons make it possible to inflict heavy losses on  the enemy, and the high mobility of troops makes it possible to  utilize quickly the results of nuclear and fire strikes, attack  the enemy on the move and advance swiftly into the depth, and  accomplish maneuver with various goals in short periods of time.    In the past, maneuver of troops was usually limited to their  relocation to occupy a favorable position with respect to the  enemy to make strikes. Today, maneuver is also used for troops  to utilize in a timely manner the results of nuclear and fire  strikes, quickly shift efforts to the depth or to a new axis,  negotiate zones of radioactive contamination and areas of  debris, flooding, and fires, withdraw troops from under enemy  nuclear strikes, and replace units and subunits suffering large  losses and losing combat effectiveness.    Intensity of combat operations is the result of  the aspiration and ability of potential enemies to conduct  aggressive combat operations with decisive goals. In these  conditions, achieving victory in battle will require our troops  to have high combat proficiency and moral-psychological  training, skillful actions, and maximum intensity of physical  and spiritual strengths.    Fluidity of battle is caused by the might of  modern weapons, their speed, and ability in a short period of  time to inflict a decisive damage on the enemy, attack swiftly  on the move and complete the rout of the enemy following nuclear  and fire strikes, and exploit success into the depth at a high  tempo.    In conditions of fluid combat operations, the struggle to  gain time and the ability of officers to assess the situation  quickly and assign missions based on good tactical training and  sound skills in command and control become more important than  ever before.    Rapid and abrupt changes in the situation are a  new characteristic of modern combined-arms battle. The rapidness  of the change in the situation is determined by the short time  during which significant changes take place in the positions,  condition, and nature of troop operations. It depends on the  ability of modern weapons to suppress or destroy certain enemy  targets in a minimum amount of time and also on the speed of  troop movement.    The abruptness of the change in the situation is expressed  in  the radical qualitative change in the disposition of friendly  and enemy troops, the correlation of forces and assets, and the  radiation and chemical situation, the rapid approach of the  reserve, the drop of an assault force, the making of powerful  surprise strikes by combat helicopters, and, as a result, in the  abrupt change in methods of operations and in the shift from one  type of battle to another.    In the past, when there were continuous fronts and close  contact between subunits, battle developed evenly from one line  to another, particularly when breaking through an enemy defense.  A change in the correlation of forces and assets took  considerable time. In modern battle, both sides' use of powerful  weapons, the high mobility of troops, and their great fire and  hitting power lead to a radical change in the situation not only  in hours but in minutes, and when nuclear weapons are used--even  in seconds.    The increase in the speed of effect and power of weapons,  particularly neutron and laser weapons, and also the mobility of  troops will also increase the importance of this characteristic  of battle in the future. This makes it necessary to train troops  to carry out any combat mission under conditions of extremely  rapid and abrupt changes in the situation and train commanders  to be able to react quickly and competently to these changes,  demonstrating decisiveness, initiative, creativity, and  independence.    Diversity of methods used to wage battle is a  characteristic resulting from the high dynamic and fluid nature,  diversity of the situation conditions, rapid and abrupt changes  in the situation, the possibility of shifting from one weapon to  another, rapid changing in the types of combat operations, and  also the sharp increase in the combat capabilities of troops and  the great diversity of their weapons and the missions being  carried out during battle.    The lack or limited effect of the above factors in wars of  the past resulted in the theoretical elaboration of only a few  methods of waging battle. In one battle or another, subunits,  units, and large units chose, as a rule, one of the methods,  which rarely changed during the course of carrying out the  mission.    For victory over the enemy today, a commander must have the  skill of using the entire diversity of methods of waging battle.    By method of waging battle we mean a variant of employing  forces and assets to defeat the enemy and achieve the set goals.  As historical experience shows, methods of waging battle  continuously change and improve as its material basis develops.  They also depend on the missions assigned to the troops, the  conditions of carrying them out, the capabilities of the troops,  the composition and nature of actions of the enemy, and terrain  characteristics. The great diversity of missions being carried  out by subunits, units, and large units and of the weapons they  use and the diverse nature of enemy actions and of terrain  conditions result in the fact that methods of modern  combined-arms battle will be quite diverse.    In a defense, the basic methods of waging battle are:  engaging the main enemy grouping during the process of its  advance and deployment for an offensive by using surprise  nuclear strikes, airstrikes, and artillery strikes; repelling  attacks by enemy tanks, motorized infantry, and airmobile troops  by using the fire of all ground and air forces and assets in  front of the forward edge of the battle area; and stubborn  holding of the most important areas in the depth combined with  conducting counterattacks.    An offensive with the use of nuclear weapons is accomplished  by inflicting decisive damage on the enemy with nuclear strikes,  delivery of conventional strikes, and the swift advance of  subunits, units, and large units following these strikes to  complete the rout of the enemy and seize vitally important areas  (installations).    In an offensive using conventional weapons, the necessary  degree of damage to the enemy can be achieved only on a narrow  sector of the front. Therefore, the following must be at the  basis of the methods of the offensive in these conditions:  massed use of weapons and aviation on a narrow front;  breakthrough of the defenses on this sector by motorized rifle  and tank subunits; exploitation of success into the depth and  towards the flanks; encirclement and destruction of the main  body of the enemy's defending forces in coordination with  adjacent subunits.    Development of combat operations on land and in the air  over a broad front and to a great depth, and conducting them at  a high tempo is the result of the increase in combat  capabilities of troops and the maximum range of weapons. This  has resulted in a considerable expansion of the spatial  boundaries of battle and an increase in its tempo. For example,  before new models of small arms and BMP's (BTR's) entered  service in the motorized rifle platoon and new models of tanks  entered service in the tank platoon, a platoon could advance on  a front up to 200 meters wide and defend a strongpoint up to 300  meters across the front and up to 200 meters deep. A platoon's  capabilities increased sharply when they were equipped with new  weapons and equipment. According to contemporary views, a  platoon is able to attack a defending enemy successfully on a  front up to 300 meters wide and defend a strongpoint up to 400  meters across the front and up to 300 meters deep.    In the future, with an increase in the firing range of  artillery and the development of aviation, the spatial  boundaries of battle will continue to increase in depth. At the  same time, a similar development of our potential enemies' means  of waging battle and an increase in the combat capabilities of  their troops will not make it possible to increase substantially  the width of the front of advance and defense of our subunits,  units, and large units.  <H5>  4. Basic Principles of Modern Combined-Arms Battle </H5>   Principles of combined-arms battle--these are the basic  guiding tenets and the most important recommendations for  organizing and waging battle as a whole.    The principles are the fundamental base for a platoon  commander's creativity for his making the correct decision. At  the same time, they are not the decision itself, for in such a  case they may be turned into a predictable pattern and unsound  recipes for victory. They must not be examined isolated from one  another. To achieve success in battle, a platoon commander must  skillfully use all the principles, taking into account the  situation at hand.    The basic principles of waging modern combined-arms battle  are: constant high combat readiness of the subunit; a high  degree of aggressiveness, decisiveness, and continuity of waging  battle; surprise of actions; maintaining continuous coordination  in battle; decisive concentration of the main efforts on the  main axis and at the necessary time; maneuver of forces, assets,  and fire; consideration and use of the moral-political and  psychological factors in the interests of carrying out the  assigned mission; all-round support of battle; maintaining and  timely restoration of the platoon's combat effectiveness; firm  and continuous command and control of the platoon; inflexibility  in achieving the planned goals; carrying out decisions made and  assigned missions.    Constant high combat readiness for carrying out the  combat mission is achieved through correct understanding of  one's mission, excellent combat proficiency of all personnel,  and their readiness for operations in conditions of the enemy  using weapons of mass destruction; a high political-moral state,  discipline, and vigilance of personnel; manning and supplying  the platoon with everything necessary for waging battle;  constant readiness of weapons and combat equipment for immediate  use and readiness of personnel for carrying out assigned  missions; skillful command and control and accomplishment of  combat support measures.    A high degree of aggressiveness, decisiveness, and  continuity of waging battle involve the constant striving  for a complete rout of the enemy. The platoon commander's  decision to crush the enemy must be firm and carried out to the  end without hesitation. The platoon commander must instill this  determination in his subordinates and constantly train them for  successful accomplishment of combat missions.    This is achieved by: thorough knowledge of the enemy;  seizing  and holding the initiative; boldness, daring, persistence, and  perseverance of personnel in carrying out combat missions; quick  utilization of the results of nuclear and conventional  engagement of the enemy and also the results of fire from the  platoon's own weapons; skillful crossing or bypassing of  obstacles, zones of contamination, and areas of destruction,  fires, and flooding; waging battle in the day, night, and in any  kind of weather; combat support; timely replenishment of  expended ammunition, fuel, and other supplies, as well as  servicing and maintenance of armament and combat equipment.    Surprise of actions involves using techniques,  methods, and weapons the enemy does not expect. It makes it  possible to catch the enemy unawares, cause panic in his ranks,  paralyze his will to resist, sharply reduce combat  effectiveness, disrupt command and control, and thereby create  conditions for defeating even superior enemy forces.    Surprise can be achieved by non-stereotyped use of available  combat equipment and armament; keeping the scenario of the  upcoming battle and preparations for it secret; misleading the  enemy with respect to our intentions; secrecy in bringing the  subunit to combat readiness and reducing the time period for  preparing for battle; striking the enemy where he does not  expect it; beating the enemy to the punch in actions; skillful  maneuver of fire, forces, and assets; and strict accomplishment  of camouflage measures and secrecy.    Maintaining continuous coordination between squads  (tanks) in the platoon and attached assets involves coordinating  their efforts by missions, lines, and time.    In organizing coordination, the platoon commander must  thoroughly know the combat mission of his subunit and the  methods of carrying it out, the missions of adjacent subunits,  reference points, and warning, control, and coordinating signals  established by the senior commander, and have communications in  the platoon and with adjacent subunits.    The platoon commander determines the coordination procedures  when making the decision and gives instructions on coordination  after assigning the combat mission. Coordination is organized  and maintained throughout the battle.    Decisive concentration of main efforts on the main axis  and at the necessary time enables the platoon commander to  achieve superiority over the enemy or successfully oppose  numerically superior enemy forces, make most effective use of  available forces and assets, and place the enemy in an  unfavorable situation.    Maneuver of forces, assets, and fire is an  important component part of battle. It makes it possible to  seize and hold the initiative, foil the plans of the enemy, and  successfully wage battle in a changing situation.    Maneuver of forces and assets is accomplished in order to  occupy a favorable position for firing against the enemy's most  vulnerable spot or for attacking him in the flank and rear.    The types of maneuver of forces and assets are close  envelopment, wide envelopment, a combination of them, and  withdrawal (diagram 1). Close envelopment is a type of maneuver  accomplished to break out to attack the enemy's flank. It is  done usually in close fire and tactical coordination with  subunits operating from the front.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-001C-06A>           Diagram 1: Types of Maneuver by Subunits in Battle </FIG>          Wide envelopment is a deeper maneuver executed to break out  to attack the enemy from the rear. As a rule, it is accomplished  only in tactical coordination with subunits operating from the  front.    Withdrawal is primarily a forced type of maneuver used to  pull friendly troops out from under an enemy attack and occupy a  more favorable position with respect to the enemy. It is  conducted only with permission of the senior commander.    A maneuver should be simple in concept and be conducted  quickly, secretly, and suddenly for the enemy. Speed of maneuver  is achieved by organizing it in a short period of time, high  speed of movement of subunits, and crossing various barriers and  obstacles on the move.    Maneuvering of fire involves concentrating the platoon's  fire  against one important target, timely shifting of fire from one  target to another, and simultaneous firing by the platoon  against several targets (Figure 1).   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-001C-07A>           Figure 1. Types of Maneuver by Fire [CO--Concentrated Fire; MCO--Motorized Rifle </FIG>          Consideration and use of the moral-political and  psychological factors in the interests of carrying out the  assigned mission are an important condition of achieving success  in battle. This is achieved by always having a thorough  knowledge of the political-moral and psychological state of  platoon personnel, organizing and conducting active political  work to strengthen it; systematic study of the enemy's  moral-political qualities; revealing his strong and weak points;  and actively countering his ideological subversions and  propaganda.    All-round combat support involves organizing and  accomplishing measures aimed at maintaining the platoon's high  combat readiness, preserving its combat effectiveness, and  creating favorable conditions for successful and timely  accomplishment of assigned missions.    All-round support of the platoon includes: combat,  technical,  and logistic support.    Combat support in the platoon is organized based on the  commander's decision in all types of battle and also when moving  and getting into position. It includes reconnaissance,  protection against weapons of mass destruction, camouflage,  engineer and chemical support, and security.    When organizing technical and logistic support, the platoon  commander must take timely steps for replenishment of  ammunition, refueling, performing servicing and maintenance of  combat vehicles and armament, and providing personnel with  individual protection and decontamination gear, food, and other  supplies.    Maintaining and timely restoration of the platoon's  combat effectiveness involve organizing and conducting  measures to ensure high combat proficiency of subunits, their  timely manning and supplying them with everything necessary for  battle, and also the ability to carry out assigned missions.    Firm and continuous command and control of the platoon  and inflexibility in achieving the planned goals and carrying  out decisions made and assigned missions are achieved  through constant knowledge of the situation; timely decision  making and implementation; precise assignment of missions to  squads (tanks) and attached and supporting assets; initiative  and personal responsibility of the platoon commander for his  decision; correct battle employment of his and attached  subunits; and stable communications with them.  <H3>  5. Fundamentals of Combat Employment of the Motorized Rifle  (Tank) Platoon </H3>   A motorized rifle (tank) platoon, being a tactical subunit,  carries out an important mission for destroying the enemy in  battle. Numerous combat examples and the experience of combat  training of troops show that the platoon, possessing powerful  armament and combat equipment, in coordination with subunits of  other branches of troops, special troops, and independently, is  capable of the following:    --in the defense--using organized fire, inflict  damage on the enemy in front of the forward edge of the battle  area; repel attacks by enemy tanks and infantry; battle  low-flying air targets; and stubbornly defend an occupied  strongpoint;    --in the offensive--boldly combining fire and  movement, swiftly attack the enemy, destroy his personnel,  tanks, armored fighting vehicles, artillery, antitank and other  weapons, and offensive nuclear and chemical weapons; combat  enemy aircraft and helicopters; at a rapid pace develop the  offensive, repel counterattacks, and pursue a withdrawing enemy;  make hasty crossings of water obstacles, negotiate obstacles and  debris, and consolidate captured lines.    In addition, the platoon can successfully carry out other  missions in reconnaissance and security.    When carrying out combat missions, a motorized rifle (tank)  platoon usually operates as part of a company. In  reconnaissance, security during movement and at the halt, and  also in an assault group, it can also operate independently.    Depending on the nature of the mission being carried out,  the  terrain, enemy pressure, and other situation conditions, a  motorized rifle platoon can carry out missions operating  dismounted (on skis in the winter), on armored fighting vehicles  (armored transport vehicles), and as an assault force on tanks.  Machinegun, grenade-launcher, flame-thrower, and antiaircraft  squads may be attached to it; a combat-engineer squad and  chemical reconnaissance scouts can be attached when performing  independent missions in march, halt, and combat security and in  reconnaissance. During operations in security and as an assault  group, tanks may also be attached to a platoon.    Motorized rifle, combat-engineer, and flame-thrower squads  and chemical reconnaissance scouts may be attached to a tank  platoon in a combat situation (as a rule, when performing  independent missions).    Depending on the situation, a motorized rifle (tank) platoon  carries out its mission in march, approach march, and combat  formations.    A platoon's march formation is a column. In a column, a  platoon executes a march, pursues a withdrawing enemy, displaces  as the battalion reserve, and also can execute a maneuver on the  battlefield. The march formation should ensure the platoon a  high speed of movement, economy of forces and assets, and rapid  deployment into combat formation.    During dismounted operations, a motorized rifle platoon may  also use the approach march formation, which is the alignment of  the platoon in squad columns dispersed frontally into a line of  squads abreast (Figure 2). the intervals between squads in this  case may be up to 100 meters. Reinforcements attached to the  platoon proceed behind the guiding squad or are located at a  position indicated by the commander. The approach march  formation of a motorized rifle platoon is used to reduce the  time for deployment into combat formation and reduce  vulnerability to enemy artillery fire and airstrikes.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-001C-08A>           Figure 2. Approach March Formation of a Motorized Rifle Platoon </FIG>          The platoon takes up a combat formation for waging battle.  It  must correspond to the assigned mission and ensure successful  waging of battle; complete utilization of the combat  capabilities of the platoon's and attached subunits, the results  of engagement of the enemy by nuclear and conventional fires,  and favorable terrain conditions; stability and aggressiveness  in defense; least vulnerability to enemy fire; and maintaining  continuous coordination and command and control of subordinates.    In defensive fighting, the combat formation of a motorized  rifle platoon consists of the combat formations of squads  located at positions, combat vehicles (armored transport  vehicles), and reinforcements occupying fire positions both at  the forward edge of the platoon strongpoint and in its depth.    The combat formation of a tank platoon in a defense consists  of tanks and reinforcements located at fire positions at the  forward edge or in the depth of the strongpoint.    The combat formation of a motorized rifle platoon in an  offensive during operations on BMP's (BTR's) and of a tank  platoon consists of an extended line of combat vehicles and  reinforcements (figures 3 and 4). The intervals between vehicles  in the extended line may be up to 100 meters. The combat  vehicles of reinforcements may operate in the extended line or  directly behind it.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-001C-08B>           Figure 3.

Combat Formation of a Tank Platoon in an Offensive </FIG>          During a motorized rifle platoon's operations dismounted,  its  combat formation consists of an extended line, armored fighting  vehicles (armored transport vehicles), and reinforcements.    The squad combat formation consists of an extended line and  the combat vehicle (armored transport vehicle) (Figure 5).   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-001C-09A>           Figure 5. Combat Formation of a Motorized Rifle Squad in an Offensive </FIG>      <H5>    6. The Platoon's Combat Equipment and Armament </H5>   Organizationally, a motorized rifle platoon  consists of a headquarters element and three motorized rifle  squads.    A motorized rifle platoon's armament consists of armored  fighting vehicles (Figure 6) or armored transport vehicles  (figures 7 and 8), machineguns, assault rifles, shoulder-fired  antitank rocket launchers, a sniper rifle, pistols, and hand  grenades.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-001C-09B>           Figure 6. Armored Fighting Vehicle </FIG>       <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-001C-09C>             Figure 7. BTR-70 Armored Transport Vehicle </FIG>       <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-001C-09D>             Figure 8. BTR-80 Armored Transport Vehicle </FIG>          The armored fighting vehicle is designed for waging battle  by  a motorized rifle squad. It considerably increases the  firepower, mobility, and protection of personnel on the  battlefield and makes it possible to operate successfully in  various situation conditions.    The fighting vehicle has armor capable of defeating  small-arms fire and designed to protect against shell fragments,  a system of collective protection from weapons of mass  destruction, and thermal smoke generating equipment, and has  high maneuverability. It can cross water obstacles afloat, be  transported by air, and negotiate sectors of contamination,  destruction, and various obstacles.    The BMP-1 armored fighting vehicle is armed with antitank  guided missiles (ATGM's), a 73-mm smoothbore semiautomatic  antitank gun, and a 7.62-mm machinegun (PKT) paired with it.    The assault compartment of the BMP is equipped with firing  ports, which enable personnel to fire their machineguns and  assault rifles without leaving the vehicle. The BMP can engage  enemy tanks at a range of up to 3 km and also deliver effective  fire against his personnel and weapons. Accommodation of platoon  personnel in armored fighting vehicles is shown in Figure 9.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-001C-10A>           Figure 9. Accommodation of personnel in BMP </FIG>          Armored transport vehicles, being the platoon's means of  transport, largely perform the role of armored fighting vehicles  in battle, supporting squads with machinegun fire in an  offensive and when they are conducting a defensive battle.    The BTR-60PB (BTR-70, -80) armored transport vehicle is a  fighting, wheeled, armored, amphibious vehicle armed with a  14.5-mm KPVT heavy machinegun capable of destroying lightly  armored targets and a 7.62-mm PKT machinegun paired with it. The  armament is situated in the turret mounting. The armored  transport vehicles have a high off-road capability and are able  to make hasty crossings of water obstacles, trenches, and  vehicle pits. Like the armored fighting vehicle, the armored  transport vehicle has armor which makes it possible to protect  personnel reliably against small-arms fire and shell fragments  and also reduce severalfold the casualty-producing effects of  nuclear weapons.    Accommodation of platoon personnel in armored transport  vehicles is shown in figures 10 and 11.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-001C-10B>           Figure 10. Accommodation of personnel in BTR-60PB </FIG>       <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-001C-10C>             Figure 11. Accommodation of personnel in BTR-70 </FIG>          The Kalashnikov assault rifle (AKM) is the basic individual  weapon of platoon personnel for engaging enemy troops at a  distance of up to 400 meters. When delivering concentrated fire  by a squad or platoon, the effective range can reach 800 meters  against ground targets and 500 meters against air targets.    The Kalashnikov light machinegun (RPK) is the automatic  weapon of a motorized rifle squad. It is designed for destroying  enemy troops and weapons at a range of up to 800 meters and  aircraft, helicopters, and paratroopers at a range of up to 500  meters.    Kalashnikov machineguns (PKT) mounted on armored fighting  vehicles, armored transport vehicles, and tanks can successfully  destroy enemy troops and weapons as well as air targets at a  range of up to 1000 meters.    The motorized rifle platoon is also armed with a sniper  rifle, which makes it possible to destroy important individual  targets (enemy officers, observers, snipers, gun crews,  low-flying helicopters) at a range of up to 1300 meters.    To combat tanks and other enemy armored assets, besides the  BMP's armament, the platoon also has shoulder-fired antitank  rocket launchers, capable of reliably destroying targets at a  range of up to 500 meters, and antitank hand grenades.    Organizationally, a tank platoon usually consists  of three tank crews. It has modern tanks which possess high fire  characteristics, powerful armored protection, and high  maneuverability.    The tanks have guns with high ballistic characteristics and  rate of fire, armor-piercing and high-explosive fragmentation  shells, and gun control equipment. The armament makes it  possible to engage ground, air, and surface targets by both  direct and indirect fire. A tank platoon is capable of  delivering effective concentrated fire against openly disposed  tanks at a range of up to 3 km, against enemy weapons and troops  at a range of up to 4 km, and against concentrations of combat  equipment and troops at a range of up to 6 km.    The capabilities of the tanks' armament control system make  it possible to carry out fire missions successfully by firing on  the move at a speed of up to 20 km/hr.    The armor of a modern tank makes it possible to decrease the  effect of a blast wave on the crew by a factor of 3-4 and the  effect of penetrating radiation by a factor of 10, completely  eliminate the effect of thermal radiation, and successfully  withstand fire from conventional weapons, including antitank  weapons. All this ensures, on the one hand, a high degree of  survivability of tank platoon personnel and, on the other,  combined with fire, gives it great striking power in battle.    A tank's maneuverability is demonstrated in its mobility,  off-road capability, and its ability to relocate quickly to  threatened sectors and open fire on the enemy. Thus, a tank  platoon can move in a column at an average speed of 25-30 km/hr,  attack the enemy at a speed of 8-12 km/hr, pursue the enemy at a  speed of 10-15 km/hr, and cross water obstacles up to 5 meters  deep under water.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 7 KYODO -- Former Construction  Minister Kishiro Nakamura has refused to give himself up  voluntarily to prosecutors for questioning over his alleged  receipt of 10 million yen from leading general contractor Kajima  Corp. in January 1992, NHK TV reported Monday [7 March].    NHK said prosecutors plan to arrest Kajima's former Vice  President Shinji Kiyoyama on suspicion of involvement in the  sending of the money to Nakamura.    It also said prosecutors will raid offices involved and hold  a meeting shortly to discuss how to handle the probe following  Nakamura's rejection to come forward for questioning.    Investigators suspect Nakamura accepted the 10 million yen  in  reward for his influence to help prevent the lodging of a  criminal complaint against contractors by a trade watchdog body  over bid- rigging practices. Nakamura's deed may constitute  bribery, investigative sources said.    If convicted, a bribe taker could be imprisoned for up to  five years, according to the penal code.    Nakamura, 44, an incumbent conservative member of the House  of Representatives, was a senior member of the Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP)'s construction lobby at the time of the  receipt of the money.    He served as construction minister from December 1992 to  August 1993 under then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.    Law enforcement authorities are required to ask for  permission from the Diet for the arrest of a legislator while  the legislature is in session. The Diet is currently in a  150-day ordinary session that started in late January.    Kajima's Kiyoyama, who is suspected of sending the money to  Nakamura, allegedly asked him to put pressure on the Fair Trade  Commission (FTC) not to file an accusation with prosecutors  against a bid-rigging scandal involving Kajima and 65 other  construction firms in Saitama Prefecture, just north of Tokyo.    A local executive of Kajima, one of Japan's three largest  general contractors, reportedly served as head of a club of the  66 construction companies involved in bid-rigging in the  prefecture.    At the time, Nakamura served as the deputy chairman of the  LDP's panel on the Antimonopoly Law.    Nakamura reportedly met then FTC Chairman Setsuo Umezawa,  62,  several times from the end of 1991 to early 1992 to discuss the  FTC's activities.    The FTC, investigating the scandal involving public works  projects in Saitama Prefecture, announced in May 1992 it would  not file an accusation and instead ordered the 66 companies to  stop the allegedly unfair business practices.    Kiyoyama, 67, has already been charged with giving a 20  million yen bribe to former Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi while he  was in office.    In a series of scandals involving major contractors,  prosecutors have so far indicted two governors, two mayors and  dozens of executives of construction firms. No Diet member has  so far been arrested.</p>

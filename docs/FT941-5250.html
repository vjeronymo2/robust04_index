			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Birds Eye recalls 16,000 packets Birds Eye frozen foods yesterday recalled 8,000 packs of crispy chicken, which it said could contain bits of red plastic, and 8,000 packs of potato waffles, which could contain metal. The recall was because of two separate production problems at a factory in Lowestoft, Suffolk. Only a handful of packs are thought to be affected. Birds Eye said only one customer was known to have been hurt, suffering a very small cut to the tongue.</p>

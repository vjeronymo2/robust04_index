			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Letter: ILO will see off critics, insists TUC leader Sir, Some of your readers may have been alarmed by your headline reporting Prof Keith Ewing's description of the International Labour Organisation as moribund (Employment, February 17). Contrary to what was reported, the body of international labour conventions has continued to grow in significant ways in the 1980s with the adoption of new instruments on collective bargaining, safety and health at work, and last year on working conditions in hotels and catering. Prof Ewing was quite right to focus attention on the damage done to the ILO by the British government in persisting in its violations of conventions protecting basic human rights. But he was wrong to imagine that a body which, almost alone among international agencies, survived the demise of the League of Nations and took the withdrawal of the US for two years in its stride, will not prevail. I am heartened by the firmness with which the ILO supervisory bodies have withstood the attacks on them by the British government. Of course, it does weaken the ILO when a government of the country which has made a greater contribution than any other in building it up as the most effective agency in the UN system for promoting development and social justice, shows an invincible insolence towards its well-based criticisms of GCHQ and of several policy areas. This is not without its costs to Britain in terms of embarrassment to allies and charges of hypocrisy. I recall that not so long ago the regimes in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Brezhnev's Soviet Union adopted a similar approach to the ILO's criticisms. My money is on the ILO to see off present attacks and strengthen its role in protecting working people in all countries for which it is uniquely equipped and which is more than ever needed.

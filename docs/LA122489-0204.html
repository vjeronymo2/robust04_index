			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE BEST AND THE WORST FROM '89;  </P> <P> NEIL YOUNG'S CONCERT, SCR'S 'SUNDAY IN THE PARK WITH GEORGE' WERE AMONG THE TOP  TREATS FOR ORANGE COUNTY'S ARTS AUDIENCES  </P> <P> Today, the Calendar staff of The Times Orange County Edition offers its  assessment of the best and worst in the county's arts scene during 1989. The  picks are from Mike Boehm (pop music), Cathy Curtis (art), Jan Herman and Mark  Chalon Smith (theater), Chris Pasles (classical music and dance), and Max  Jacobson (restaurants).  </P> <P> </P> <P> POP MUSIC / MIKE BOEHM  </P> <P> BEST CONCERTS  </P> <P> Neil Young (Pacific Amphitheatre, August)  </P> <P> Elvis Costello (Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, September)  </P> <P> The Byrds reunion (Coach House, January)  </P> <P> Bonnie Raitt and Richard Thompson (Coach House, June)  </P> <P> Doc Watson and John Hammond (Coach House, May)  </P> <P> WORST CONCERTS  </P> <P> 2 Live Crew (Celebrity Theatre, September)  </P> <P> Rick Astley (Pacific Amphitheatre, September)  </P> <P> Queensryche (Irvine Meadows, May)  </P> <P> BEST ALBUMS BY O.C. BANDS  </P> <P> Eggplant, "Monkeybars" (Dr. Dream)  </P> <P> Walter Trout Band, "Life in the Jungle" (Bozz of Electra -- import only)  </P> <P> National People's Gang, "Orange" (Dr. Dream)  </P> <P> NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN  </P> <P> GREAT DIPLOMACY AWARD  </P> <P> To Club Postnuclear. The day before it was scheduled to go before the Laguna  Beach City Council for a beer permit, Postnuclear staged a free noontime  concert by the Dead Milkmen. The show attracted a rowdy, overflow crowd that  disrupted neighboring businesses and ensured a strong dose of ill will at the  council hearing. The beer permit was shot down, hobbling the brewless  Postnuclear in its attempt to become a regular concert venue.  </P> <P> FELIX UNGER AWARD  </P> <P> To Timbuk3's fastidious road manager. Opening for Timbuk3 at the Coach House,  the Swamp Zombies found themselves yanked off stage in mid-set for the crime of  spilling some beer on a stage rug laid out for headliner Timbuk3. The spill was  the accidental result of using a beer bottle as a percussion instrument.  </P> <P> CHILD WELFARE AWARD  </P> <P> To Rod Stewart. At the Pacific Amphitheatre, Rod the Mod had a small boy  brought out of the audience to lend atmosphere to the father-son benediction,  "Forever Young." When the kid's bit was over, Stewart went on with his show  without first seeing to the youngster's safety. The untended tot teetered until  his father gathered him down from the stage.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ART / CATHY CURTIS  </P> <P> BEST MUSEUM EXHIBITS  </P> <P> (unranked, grouped by institution)  </P> <P> "American Landscape Video: The Electronic Grove" (Newport Harbor Art Museum)  </P> <P> "Erik Bulatov: Paintings 1971-1988" (Newport Harbor)  </P> <P> "L.A.

He didn't sing; he  gargled.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THEATER / MARK CHALON SMITH  </P> <P> It wasn't the greatest year for local theater, with only a handful of  productions standing out as memorable. With that qualifier, here are my best  picks for 1989.  </P> <P> PROFESSIONAL  </P> <P> "You Never Can Tell": South Coast Repertory's handling of this early Shaw play  had a tartly comic sway that served it well.  </P> <P> "Gypsy": This traveling show starring Tyne Daly brought some rousing energy to  the Orange County Performing Arts Center. Daly put her own signature on the  role created by Ethel Merman. "Hard Times": Five actors played 19 characters in  this imaginative, technically fine SCR stage version of Charles Dickens' 1854  novel.  </P> <P> SMALL AND COMMUNITY  </P> <P> "Ain't Misbehavin' ": The Orange County Black Actors Theatre played this  tribute to Fats Waller with plenty of sass.  </P> <P> "The Glass Menagerie": A muted and sensitive treatment of Tennessee Williams'  classic was offered by director Marla Gam-Hudson at the La Habra Depot  Playhouse.  </P> <P> "Showboat": Director Rob Barron found the right current, brisk but not  turbulent, in Fullerton Civic Light Opera's production of the Jerome Kern and  Oscar Hammerstein musical.  </P> <P> COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES  </P> <P> "A Streetcar Named Desire": UC Irvine, under William Woodman's able direction,  did justice to Tennessee Williams' masterwork of erotic vulnerability.  </P> <P> "Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street": This Rancho Santiago College  production lagged at times, but the strong cast was still able to tap into its  moodiness and dark humor.  </P> <P> "The Bald Soprano": The Rancho Santiago College Professional Actors  Conservatory's approach to this seminal "theater of the absurd" play had its  flaws but was still clever enough to satisfy. Besides, it was refreshing to see  Eugene Ionesco for a change.  </P> <P> WORTH MENTIONING,  </P> <P> IF FOR THE WRONG REASONS  </P> <P> "Heat": Way Off Broadway in Santa Ana has a reputation for quirkiness, even  when it presents something of merit. But the tiny playhouse outdid itself with  this jaw-droppingly bad play about a Charlie Manson-style murderer who writes a  novel called "The Guitar That Tortured Women" -- in his free time.  </P> <P> "Night of January 16th": Ayn Rand took time off from postulating her  "objectivism" philosophy to pen this hopelessly muddled courtroom whodunit.  It's not clear why the L.P. Repertory Dinner Theatre decided to revive it. This  was a mistrial all the way.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CLASSICAL MUSIC AND DANCE / CHRIS PASLES  </P> <P> BEST PERFORMANCES  </P> <P> Guest conductor Vakhtang Jordania conducting the Pacific Symphony in  Shostakovich's monumental Fifth Symphony at the Orange County Performing Arts  Center in Costa Mesa in March.  </P> <P> The Vienna Chamber Ensemble setting standards in chamber music playing in an  Orange County Philharmonic Society-sponsored program at the Center in April.  </P> <P> Riccardo Muti leading the Philadelphia Orchestra in a pair of concerts  sponsored by the Philharmonic Society at the Center in May.  </P> <P> The Kirov Ballet in a reconstruction of Petipa's "Le Corsaire" at the Center in  August.  </P> <P> Lawrence Foster, first of this season's guest conductors vying for the open  music director's position with the Pacific Symphony, at the Center in October.  </P> <P> San Francisco Ballet in Balanchine's "Theme and Variations," Jerome Robbins'  "Interplay" and Jiri Kylian's "Forgotten Land," at the Center in October.  </P> <P> The Lewitzky Dance Company bringing the first modern dance to be presented on  the Segerstrom Hall stage, Lewitzky's "Nos Duraturi" (to Stravinsky's "Symphony  of Psalms"), with the Master Chorale of Orange County led by William Hall, at  the Center in October.  </P> <P> WORST PERFORMANCES  </P> <P> The Johann Strauss Orchestra of Vienna offering flat-footed three-quarter-times  playing in an Orange County Philharmonic Society-sponsored program at the  Center in January.  </P> <P> New York City Opera's numbing production of Mozart's "Die Zauberflote" at the  Center in January.  </P> <P> Keith Clark leading the Pacific Symphony in a conjectural "reconstruction" of  Beethoven's "Tenth" Symphony, from the composer's sketches and fragments by  Scottish musicologist Barry Cooper, at the Center in February.  </P> <P> Clark leading a stupendously dull account of Bruckner's Ninth Symphony in a  curious substitute program for the originally announced -- but cut for cost  reasons -- Verdi Requiem that also enlisted soprano Aprile Millo in several  arias by Verdi, at the Center in April.  </P> <P> The Imperial Bells of China offering a Valentine-sweet, quasi-folk culture  program on the very day that Chinese troops moved in to massacre the  democracy-movement supporters in Tien An Men Square, at the Center in June.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RESTAURANTS / MAX JACOBSON  </P> <P> Here are my first ever Oranges and Lemons award winners for the local dining  scene, and boy, was 1989 ever busy.  </P> <P> BEST MEAL  </P> <P> To the Robert Mondavi Food and Wine Center in Costa Mesa and guest chef  Jean-Pierre Vigato of Apicius Restaurant in Paris, for a November dinner of  leek terrine, lamb, and a carmelized apple dessert to die for. If this is  representative of what the center has in store, I'm pitching a tent on their  grounds. One loud bravo and four oranges.  </P> <P> BEST NEW RESTAURANT  </P> <P> Kachina, in Laguna Beach, is the hands down winner here. Oh, the ambience may  be self-consciously trendy (Santa Fe crossed with Melrose Avenue) and some  dishes may be a little too precious for their own good (grilled quail salad  with papaya chutney), but I still love the place. Owner David Wilhelm is a real  creator. Let's hope he doesn't get wanderlust. Three and a half oranges.  </P> <P> MOST WELCOME ADDITION  </P> <P> Kitayama of Newport Beach. As an authentic gaijin in Tokyo, I came to love  seasonal Japanese specialties such as stews, casseroles and finger foods. At  long last we have Kitayama, a Japanese restaurant where sushi is not the  featured player. Three oranges.  </P> <P> BEST CAREER MOVE  </P> <P> Early in the year, chef Andrea Rogantini (of Rex in Los Angeles and Milan's  Marchesi) was an unhappy camper, a corporate leash around him in the kitchens  of Tuttomare. Today he is doing it his way at Bagatta, and nobody does it  better. Three oranges.  </P> <P> MOST CONSISTENT  </P> <P> If quality and consistency are the cornerstones of the restaurant business,  Hans Prager understands the masonry. The Ritz is one restaurant where you can  depend on the kitchen, the service staff, even the parking attendant. Prager,  an old-fashioned Viennese taskmaster, never forgets a face. Two and a half  oranges.  </P> <P> MOST DISAPPOINTING  </P> <P> Gustav Anders was one of the best restaurants in San Diego County before  relocating to South Coast Plaza, but a restaurant cannot live in the past. No  one doubts chef Ulf Strandberg's ability to cook (a delightful bar menu,  wonderful smoked fish) but the diffident service, erratic main courses and high  prices are making many of the restaurant's fans impatient. Two lemons.  </P> <P> MOST OVERPRICED  </P> <P> Five Feet Too in Fashion Island is the sequel to Five Feet, a Laguna Beach  Chinese restaurant where the high prices seem more justifiable. Owner Michael  Kang has plenty of good ideas, but an inexperienced team of cooks makes it  virtually impossible for him to deliver. Three lemons.  </P> <P> WRETCHED EXCESS  </P> <P> This is a special award given to the many investors who backed the astronomical  number of new Italian restaurants in the area. Some of them aren't bad but, hey  fellas, they can't all make money. I'm awarding four lemons because you may  need them to cut down food costs before next year is out.  </P> <P> WORST NEW FLAVOR  </P> <P> The chowder cook-off at the San Clemente Pier looked like great fun for the  crowds who showed up, but they didn't have to judge it. I haven't had a bowl of  chowder since. Twenty south county restaurants participated, and I'm not naming  names. So if it's chowder you want, try Kennebunkport, or opening a can. Four  lemons.  </P> <P> MOST DISTURBING TREND  </P> <P> The explosion of franchises. What ever happened to the mom-and-pop restaurant?  </P></p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Row over jobless figures escalates Angry letters between senior civil servants at the Department of Employment and Mr John Prescott, the shadow employment secretary, were yesterday given a public airing after he refused to apologise for making 'misleading statements' about the official unemployment figures. Mr Peter Stibbard, director of statistics at the department, has accused Mr Prescott of misrepresenting the outcome of a meeting between them held earlier this month. He published the letters after Mr Prescott failed to retract his comments by yesterday's deadline. In a letter dated March 23, Mr Stibbard robustly denies a claim by Mr Prescott that official statisticians 'now recognise that the unemployment rate is certainly half a million more than is recorded' and had 'admitted that changes in the way unemployment is counted have removed at least 400,000 people from the official figures'. 'I object very much to the way we have been used to shore up misleading statements issued by Mr Prescott, particularly as we neither 'recognise' nor 'admitted' anything of the kind,' writes Mr Stibbard. Mr Prescott, who made his comments earlier this month, yesterday stuck to his assertion that the monthly statistics are a 'con on the public'. 'My dispute with the statistics is that they are not an accurate measure of the level of unemployment, but that the government continues to represent them as such,' he said. 'The monthly claimant count and quarterly Labour Force Survey both show useful trends in the labour market. What neither show is how many people are really out of work in the UK. That is why we need a new, broader measure to run alongside the two,' he added. Mr Stibbard's decision to publish the letter - a rare move for a senior civil servant - is the latest twist in a long-standing row. Critics of the government say the monthly claimant count, which includes only people out of work and claiming benefit, does not capture the true jobless total. They say it excludes nearly 1m, such as young people who are not on Youth Training schemes but are not eligible for benefit, married women seeking jobs and people who are on other forms of state support such as sickness and disability benefit. The department says its quarterly labour force survey, based on International Labour Organisation guidelines, compensates for the shortcomings of the claimant-count series.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- The seven ruling coalition  parties' policy coordinators agreed on the details Monday [7  February] of an increase in liquor tax rates on beer, sake and  shochu (Japanese white distilled liquor) in response to  complaints from European Union nations. The tax rates on  whiskey, however, will be left unchanged.    The raise will increase the tax on beer by 8.86 yen per 633  milliliter bottle. The retail price of beer is likely to rise  by 10 yen per bottle, coordinators said.    The raise, which will become effective in May at the  earliest, has been sought by the EU countries, which complained  that liquor tax rates on shochu are much lower than those on  whiskey.    As a result of the increase, tax rates on whiskey will be  3.9  times those on grade A shochu instead of the existing 5.1 times,  and 6.0 times those on grade B shochu instead of the current 8.7  times, the coordinators said.    The tax on sake will increase the price of a 1.8 liter  bottle  by 12.6 yen.</p>

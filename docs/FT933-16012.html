			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Greycoat in finance talks with Postel GREYCOAT, the property group, is in talks with Postel Investment Management about a financial restructuring. An announcement about a Pounds 120m refinancing, which involves the restructuring of Greycoat's debt and capital base, is expected today. The announcement of restructuring talks prompted the preference shares to rise from 34 1/2 p to 51 3/4 p, while the ordinary shares dipped from 20 3/4 p to 19 1/2 p. Greycoat, which is heavily exposed to the central London office market, has come under increasing financial pressure. Last September, it was forced it to pass its preference dividend and rescind its recommendation to pay a final dividend. In its half year to end-September, it incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 39.2m. Without a restructuring, Greycoat's financial position would deteriorate sharply over the next few years, as a result of its reliance on stepped coupon bonds, on which interest payments rise as the bonds mature. Postel, which manages the pension funds of the Post Office and British Telecom, owns 5.38 per cent of Greycoat.</p>

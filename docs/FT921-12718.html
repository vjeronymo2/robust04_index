			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: EC insurance Two quite different events yesterday suggest that concentration in European insurance is speeding up. The first was a meeting in Stockholm between four leading Scandinavian insurers, which could lead to a new alliance grouped round Sweden's Skandia. The other was a proposal by Italy's La Fondiaria to reorganise three of its quoted subsidiaries into bigger units. The latter can be seen as a purely domestic affair, inspired by the need to tidy up La Fondiaria's sprawling corporate structure. But the move, which involves putting three previously separate motor insurance activities under one roof, has also been prompted by expectations that motor tariffs will be freed from government restrictions at the end of this year. Speculation to this effect has led to a 12 per cent jump in Italian insurance company shares since Christmas. While this may seem a national matter, it is worth remembering that the Italians are only acting on motor tariffs because of an EC instruction. Brussels legislation often seems divorced from commercial reality, but in the insurance field it has already had a powerful political and psychological impact. The same will no doubt be true of the key Third Non-Life Directive, which provides for home country control and which almost unnoticed was given the political go-ahead by the 12 last month. The single market apart, the main factor driving mergers is the urgent need to address the poor profitability of companies' core activities.</p>

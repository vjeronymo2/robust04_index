During the January-October period of 1993, cross-Taiwan  Strait trade totaled US$12.52 billion, the official said, adding  that Taiwan's foreign trade totaled US$135 billion during the  period.    However, statistics released by Hong Kong customs showed  trade with Mainland China via Hong Kong totaled only US$7.16  billion, up 20.05 percent over the same period of last year.    Exports to the mainland via Hong Kong grew 24.1 percent over  1992 tallies to reach US$6.26 billion during the period. While  imports from Mainland China through the British colony totaled  US$900 million, down 2.13 percent.    However, if statistical differences between Hong Kong and  BOFT figures are taken into account, Taiwan's exports to  Mainland China reached US$11.62 billion during the period,  accounting for 16.41 percent of total exports.</p>

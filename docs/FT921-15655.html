			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Arts: Today's Television BBC2's endearing series about vehicles which have refused to die, Perpetual Motion (8.30), moves on to the Blackpool tram. This has survived so long it is back in fashion thanks to the greenies. In the first of three programmes, The Goldring Audit, the former aviation correspondent of The Economist, Mary Goldring, reports on the world's busiest international airport: Heathrow (9.00 C4). Do we believe that the second part of the mini-series 'tying off the ends' of Dynasty (9.30 BBC1) is really the last we shall see of this batty story, or is it more likely that Alexis and Blake will go on making final appearances like Nellie Melba and Frank Sinatra? The years pass and still nobody fills the breach in public affection left vacant by Morecambe and Wise. Until somebody turns up we shall just have to make do with material such as A Bit Of Fry And Laurie but it is unlikely to be repeated for millions of nostalgic fans in 2017 (9.00 BBC2). Things are never so bad that a dose of Taggart can't make you feel a bit more glum. The depressing little Scottish detective begins yet another story of man's inhumanity to man at 9.00 on ITV.</p>

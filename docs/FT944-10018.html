			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Attwoods Attwoods' new defence against the Browning-Ferris bid at least has the virtue of novelty. UK companies have occasionally tried to ward off predators by promising partial demergers. By offering to dismember itself, Attwoods is breaking new ground. Such a move has sometimes been used in the US though often in conjunction with a large, up-front payment to shareholders. The problem for Attwoods is that it is offering no cash now, and provides precious little indication of how much cash will be available later. If it had been able to put names and numbers on the expressions of interest it has received, that would be another matter. But the document states it can provide no formal estimates of proceeds and adds limply that the plan will only be put into effect if Attwoods is able to achieve 'proper' value for shareholders. To convince investors that the BFI bid undervalues its constituent parts, Attwoods also has to explain the non-appearance of a white knight. It argues that no single company would want it all and that those which could afford the lot could run into monopoly problems. Yet if, as Attwoods maintains, the break-up value is really much more than BFI is offering, it is hard to believe one of the smaller US waste groups could not rustle up the money. It is just conceivable that third parties are waiting to see if BFI raises the bid by next Friday. If a white knight fails to show, Attwoods' proposal will be a pretty feeble substitute.</p>

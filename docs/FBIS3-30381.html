If confirmed by the UN Security  Council, he will replace compatriot General Jean Cot at the end  of March, Butrus-Ghali told a news conference.    Paris had proposed de Lapresle as Cot's replacement one week  ago. France has the largest contingent of troops in the former  Yugoslavia with 6,000 soldiers.    Butrus-Ghali and Cot had disagreed over the general's  repeated public demands that he be given the authority to order  use of air support in Bosnia-Hercegovina if he deemed it  necessary. Butrus-Ghali delegated this authority to his  civilian representative in Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi of Japan,  for two operations specific to Srebrenica and Tuzla.</p>

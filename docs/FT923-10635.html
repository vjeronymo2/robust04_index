			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / Foreign Affairs: Continent of conflicts - Ethnic disputes lie at the heart of many of Europe's problems What could have been done to prevent the chaos in Yugoslavia?' asks a pamphlet published last week by the Oxford Research Group, an independent study organisation*. The question may seem academic until one looks at a map, at the end of the pamphlet, showing 60 'current and emergent conflicts in Europe'. Most involve ethnic groups whose national aspirations cut across not only existing state borders but also, in most cases, any alternative federal borders. The author, Mr Hugh Miall, lists a further 14 conflicts in the Caucasus not shown on the map and observes wryly that 'this list does not include the conflicts in the non-European parts of the former Soviet Union, ie: central Asia, eastern Russia and Kazakhstan.' The thickest cluster of conflicts is in the Balkans, with a second intense concentration in and around the ex-Soviet republic of Moldova. The map is shaded in an original way - the darker a country is shaded, the higher the proportion of the population belonging to the largest ethnic group. No state scores 100 per cent but a suspiciously high number rates 99 per cent: Austria, Denmark, the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal and Poland. This happy state of ethnic homogeneity is, of course, what so-called 'ethnic cleansing' operations in Bosnia and elsewhere are aiming for. The fact that Bosnia-Hercegovina is the palest area on the map, with the largest group (the Moslems) representing only 44 per cent of the population, explains why the effort to produce ethnic homogeneity is so protracted and bloody. Ethnic homogeneity is not indispensable to a peaceful existence, as the example of Switzerland shows. But the individual Swiss cantons are, by and large, linguistically homogeneous. A cantonal solution was proposed for Bosnia-Hercegovina by the EC, and at one point accepted in principle by all three communities there. The problem is that it is impossible to delineate a satisfactory canton for the Moslems, who are (or were) scattered throughout the republic. Mr Miall has also published a book**, which examines how and where disputes have been settled peacefully since 1945. As he says, 'there are two main phases in conflict when resolution is more likely to be achieved. The first is at an early stage, before attitudes become too fixed and behaviour too hostile. The second is at a later stage when the conflict has become a stalemate and the parties are exhausted.' Obviously, it is better to settle conflicts in the first phase; hence the emphasis on 'early warning' and 'early action' in the document adopted by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) in Helsinki three weeks ago. The CSCE also established a High Commissioner on National Minorities, described as 'an instrument of conflict-prevention at the earliest possible stage'. There is a danger, of course, that by drawing attention to national minorities this 'eminent international personality' will create or exacerbate problems which might otherwise be solved by quiet assimilation. Some of the most successful nation states, such as France and the US, have simply denied the existence of national minorities among their citizens, insisting that citizenship and nationality are co-terminous. But in the present climate few central and eastern European states can hope to solve their problems that way. The dominant idea in the region today is that states should belong to nations (or 'peoples'), not vice versa. Many states are adopting constitutions which define them as 'the state of' the Croat or Lithuanian people, as the case may be. This implicitly excludes from citizenship those who do not share that particular national identity, thus inciting them to look to another state for protection. The Estonian government, representing a 'people' which comprises only 60 per cent of the state's population, has gone so far as to reserve citizenship to members of that people. It argues that the rest of the population - mainly ethnic Russians - comprises immigrants (or their descendants) illegally introduced by an occupying power, the Soviet Union. One may sympathise with that argument, but it is not one the international community can afford to endorse. However deplorable the forced population movements in Europe after 1939, any attempt to reverse them could lead only to chaos. The only approach that offers any hope is to start from the principle that whole populations should not be blamed or punished for past crimes. In particular, civilian populations should be allowed to stay where they are and should not be denied human or civil rights on the basis of ethnic origin, language or national identity. A different issue is raised by the continued presence of ex-Soviet troops in independent states which do not want them. Most of these troops are Russian, or at least speak Russian, and would like to go home if only they had homes to go to. The Russian government says, sometimes, that it intends to bring them back but there is much ambivalence about it. Russia's handling of the break-up of the USSR has so far been admirably unlike Serbia's handling of the break-up of Yugoslavia. More people have been killed in Sarajevo alone than in the whole of the former Soviet Union - at any rate in incidents involving Russians, as opposed to those where 'peripheral' nationalities are fighting each other. But, as a Serb speaker noted on Monday at a conference sponsored by the New York-based International Peace Academy, the situation in Trans Dnestr - where Russian-speakers have proclaimed independence from Moldova under the 'protection' of the 14th Soviet Army - is similar to that at the beginning of the Serbo-Croat war, when Serbs in Croatia proclaimed independence and a supposedly neutral federal army was sent in to keep order. It sided with the Serbs. The proposed 'CIS' peace-keeping force in Moldova could easily do the same. Indeed, the Commonwealth of Independent States could become a fig-leaf for Russian troops reasserting control in parts of the former Soviet Union. The CSCE and other international bodies can still avert these looming conflicts if they act in time. The most urgent task is to persuade states such as Estonia and Moldova to take seriously the grievances of Russian-speaking minorities so that Russians will see international pressure as the best instrument for protecting their stranded compatriots. *New Conflicts in Europe: Prevention and Resolution.

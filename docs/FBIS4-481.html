			<p>BFN     [Text] The leader of the Freedom Front, General Constand  Viljoen, says his party still has to sign two agreements with  the ANC before the elections. Addressing a public meeting in  Vereeniging, Gen. Viljoen said the first dealt with procedures  for counting votes to establish Afrikaner support for a  volkstaat [homeland]. It would also make provision for  community councils for areas outside the volkstaat to enable  Afrikaners who did not live in the volkstaat to keep in touch  with the volkstaat government. Gen. Viljoen said it was hoped  that the agreement could be signed within days.    He said the second agreement would define the term self-  determination. Gen. Viljoen said it was necessary to define the  term to avoid any misunderstanding after the election. It also  enabled people voting for a volkstaat to know exactly what they  were voting for. He said he insisted on as many representatives  at foreign embassies as possible to be present at the signing of  the accords to forestall a turnabout by the ANC after the  election .</p>

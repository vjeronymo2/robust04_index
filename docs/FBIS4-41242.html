			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Popular Front Chairman Zyanon </F> Paznyak by unidentified reporter at the BTK Television studio in  Minsk on the "Presidential Rostrum" program -- live]    [Excerpts] [Reporter] How will Belarusian-Russian  relations develop when you become president?    [Paznyak] I believe that this is one of the key questions.  Eastern policy, in particular our relations with Russia, will  undoubtedly be a priority in our foreign political activities.  What is my vision of this policy? I think that we should  strive for initiating equal, partner-like relations with our  eastern neighbor. This is very relevant, and Belarus should come  forward with this initiative. I think that we will have to hold  negotiations on this issue with the Russian president. We will  have to try and organize a meeting and clear up all the issues  concerning Russia, Belarus, and our mutual interests, the more  so since quite a number of these issues have piled up. We are  just as interested in good relations as Russia, given that  Belarus is the state through which Russia can maintain contacts  with the West. That is why we have things to discuss and must  see them through to completion. I believe that the president of  Russia is the right type of leader and the kind of politician  with which we can discuss and resolve these problems.    [Reporter] People sometimes ask whether [Russian Prime  Minister] Chernomyrdin would like to conduct business with  President Paznyak. As we know, Vyachaslaw Kebich's trump card  is the allegation that Chernomyrdin will refuse to deal with  anybody other than Kebich.    [Paznyak] The prime minister of Russia will be dealing with  the prime minister of Belarus, while the president of Russia  will be dealing with his Belarusian counterpart. This is the  procedure.    [Reporter] The administration frightens people with  cock-and-bull stories saying that once Paznyak assumes the post,  Russians will be told to go back to Russia.    [Paznyak] I must say that this is a hackneyed propaganda  cliche. Still, this issue seems to worry many people, because  many people treat the propaganda campaign very seriously. That  is why I want to state clearly and precisely: Nobody, including  myself, is going to drive Russians out of Belarus. This is  absolutely absurd. Our task, including mine, will be to  guarantee all Belarusian citizens, including ethnic Russians, a  life that would be better than in Russia itself. Our task is to  make Russians in Belarus feel that market reforms, democracy,  and the freedoms for which we have been fighting will provide  them with significant privileges. The Belarusian Popular Front  [BNF] was the first to address the issues of the rights for  ethnic minorities, religious groups, and cultural-national  autonomy. The BNF addressed these issues in its first program;  BNF deputies initiated their discussion in the legislature. The  development of the law-governed state which we are advocating,  reform, and the sociopolitical ideas championed by the BNF will  guarantee civic peace in Belarus. It was the BNF that lobbied  the idea of single Belarusian citizenship. The Law on  Citizenship was almost entirely drafted by the BNF and the  Supreme Soviet had to adopt it. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] How many times a month will prices be increased  if you become president?    [Paznyak] From the first days of my presidency, I will  pursue such a policy as to stop price increases altogether.  This will be done in the following way: A national currency  will be introduced, appropriate policy will be conducted, and  appropriate laws adopted to prevent the senseless issuance of  credits. Production output will increase -- all these measures  will help curb price increases and stabilize the situation. The  stabilization of prices is the primary task of reform. Later,  when this stabilization is achieved and reform continues, the  situation will diametrically change; and, having curbed  inflation, we will gradually arrive at a normal price structure.  [passage omitted]    [Reporter] Kebich took out a lot of credits. How will  President Paznyak deal with that issue?    [Paznyak] In October 1992, Belarus had no debts. Today, our  per capita debt is around $200. I discussed this problem at my  meeting with President Clinton at the beginning of 1994. I  asked why the United States was granting loans to the current  government, which was not using them properly. The credits are  being eaten away and embezzled -- we checked that. The  government is granted credits, which later will have to be paid  back by the people. We will start paying them back as early as  1996, when this government will have resigned and its officials  are off living in their villas. That is why I suggested that  credits be given to finance economic reform. I was happy to  hear the U.S. State Department announce 10 days later that the  United States was going to take such a stance with regard to  credits. We will have to pay back those debts, but my  government will try to put an end to embezzlements and improper  use of funds, after which this capital will be used to finance  economic reform. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] What is your attitude toward the unification of  monetary systems?    [Paznyak] I have addressed this issue many times and I want  to repeat that my attitude is absolutely negative, because this  is a bluff. Russian economists, including Gaydar, and our  experts have both proven in detail that this is an impossible  operation. Nevertheless, this process is continuing. What is  the essence of the unification? Instead of the unification of  two monetary systems, the merging of two mafia clans, the Moscow  clan and the Belarusian clan, is under way. Such clans have  been formed in Russia and Belarus, and they have access to  governing the state and they currently have common interests.  The mafia is going international and becoming more integrated.  The monetary merger is actually the unification of the  interests of two clans. The Moscow grouping aims to grab our  property by legal methods, have a guarantee of free transit of  Russian gas and oil via Belarus. The military-industrial  complex and certain political forces in Russia are interested in  preserving nuclear arms and antiaircraft defense units on  Belarusian soil. The Belarusian grouping has interests of its  own, the primary one being to avoid responsibility for  corruption and the collapse of the economy; shift this burden  onto the shoulders of the Moscow administrations. They will  also have guarantees that what they have managed to grab will  not be taken away. This is a very grave problem, for we will be  staying on our land but have no property. I am categorically  against such policy, which has been continuing for eight months  now. To what has it led? Belarus has lost one-third of its  GNP; we are losing 25 billion rubles per day; business activity  has stopped; investments frozen; plants are being closed down.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / International Company News: Mercedes confronts Japan on foreign soil - Martin Dickson in New York looks at Mercedes-Benz's plans to open a plant in the US FIRST BMW, now Mercedes-Benz. Germany's two leading luxury car makers suddenly both want to manufacture cars outside their domestic base and both want to do so in the US. But the bold strategy has its risks. Mercedes announced on Monday it intended to build a plant in the US, at a cost of about Dollars 300m, which would make a new kind of four-wheel-drive sports utility vehicle. A site would be chosen in the next three or four months, and production of up to 60,000 vehicles a year would begin in 1997. Two-thirds of production would go for export,with one-third for the US market. BMW announced last summer it would build a Dollars 350m plant in South Carolina to manufacture up to 90,000 cars a year by 1995, about half of them for export. The type of vehicle remains a secret. Two inter-related factors have been pushing the Germans in this direction: the need to confront head-on the rapid rise of Japanese luxury car marques in the US, and the high cost of building cars in Germany. For Mercedes, an additional factor is a change in corporate strategy under which it will make vehicles outside its luxury niche. Since the late 1980s, the Japanese have come from nowhere to capture nearly 31 per cent of the US luxury car market, with marques such as Lexus (owned by Toyota) Infiniti (Nissan) and Acura (Honda). They have captured sales from both European importers, who account for about 21 per cent of the market, and Detroit's Big Three, whose market share has shrunk to about 48 per cent. BMW has enjoyed a strong sales rebound over the past year, thanks to new products, and Mercedes has seen rather more chequered growth, but the combined annual US sales of the two companies, at about 130,000 units, is far below the 196,000 peak reached in 1986. Keen pricing has been crucial to the success of the Japanese marques and, in spite of periodic accusations that the Japanese were dumping, German manufacturers acknowledge their Asian rivals have a large cost production advantage over them. Manufacturing in the US, where parts and labour costs are lower than in Germany, should narrow this differential. Mr Helmut Werner, vice-chairman of Mercedes, says the company's US plant should have production costs 30 per cent below those of its European operations - though the group is in the throes of a cost drive aimed at cutting European costs by precisely this amount anyway. Manufacturing in America may help shelter the German companies from currency fluctuations, since the strength of the D-Mark against the dollar has tended to push up the price of European models when American consumers have been looking for more value from their vehicles. In addition, making cars in the US should give Mercedes and BMW valuable experience in battling the Japanese in the world's biggest and most open car market, before the Japanese launch their inevitable thrust into the European luxury market. 'To be successful in the world, a company has to be successful in the US,' said Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, chairman of BMW, when he broke ground for the company's plant in South Carolina last September. BMW raided Honda, the Japanese company with the longest manufacturing presence in the US, for two of the top jobs at its South Carolina plant. One of the duo, Mr Al Kinzer, was recently quoted as saying he and his colleague would 'glean from the best of what we learned at Honda and put it to use to help BMW'. Mercedes has an additional reason for putting its new plant in the US. The vehicle to be built there represents a new departure for the company, into the fast-growing sports utility segment of the market, which includes products such as Britain's Range Rover and Chrysler's Jeep Cherokee. The US is by far the largest and most innovative market for such vehicles, having seen sales grow from a mere 240,000 units in 1980 to 1.1m in 1992. Mercedes makes a four-wheeled drive vehicle, in Austria, but this primarily serves military markets and production is being phased out. However, manufacturing in America involves risks for the two companies, which are only too well aware of the fate of compatriot Volkswagen, which invested in a US plant in the late 1970s, only to pull out in 1988 after heavy losses, due to weak productivity and a reputation for poor quality at its Pennsylvanian plant. A challenge for BMW and Mercedes is to retain the prestige of their cars for quality, while losing their Made in Germany tag. This may be easier for Mercedes, since the company has experience of manufacturing in the US and other world markets through its commercial vehicle division. In the US, it owns Freightliner, which last year for the first time became the top-selling truck in the heavy Class 8 category, taking a 23 per cent market share. Freightliner's former chief executive, Mr Dieter Zetsche, was promoted last year to head passenger car engineering worldwide. Mercedes is taking a risk with the type of vehicle it is building in the US. Entry to the sports utility market is one of the first results of a change in corporate strategy which is to involve it in a broader range of products. The four-wheel-drive vehicle, will be aimed at the middle of the US market, against competitors such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ford Explorer, selling in the Dollars 20,000 to Dollars 30,000 range, rather than the Range Rover, at over Dollars 40,000. 'There are excellent opportunities to position ourselves with our quality and safety philosophy as a premium car producer in these new market segments,' says Mr Werner. However, the sports utility segment is crowded and fashion-conscious, and Mercedes is not known for reacting rapidly to changing consumer tastes. The US venture could prove a tough test of its new strategy.</p>

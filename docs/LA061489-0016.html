			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SLOW BURN OF GENTRIFICATION IN FAIRFAX  </P> <P> When the venerable Pan Pacific Auditorium in the Fairfax neighborhood went up  in flames, it took nearly six decades of Los Angeles history with it. Yet the  loss of this landmark could pale by comparison to an even more devastating  tragedy looming less conspicuously: the gradual sacrifice of the vibrant  Fairfax neighborhood to gentrification precipitated by large-scale commercial  development.  </P> <P> Los Angeles needs to treat exceptional, increasingly fragile communities like  the Fairfax district that housed the Pan Pacific with special care because we  have precious few of them. For nearly 60 years, the Fairfax neighborhood has  attracted a population of largely elderly people of modest means, most of whom  are Jewish and many of whom are immigrants. Over the years they have been  joined by young families eager to share a way of life exemplified by the tiny  mom-and-pop stores, small houses of worship, bakeries and delicatessens that  line Fairfax and nearby streets, all built on a scale that welcomes  pedestrians.  </P> <P> This vision of Fairfax, however, is becoming anachronistic and could become  downright obsolete unless creative action is taken soon. Farmers Market, in the  center of the neighborhood, is the proposed site of a 2-million-square-foot  upscale development, including a hotel, theaters and boutiques. If this  collection of enterprises seems incongruous with the description we have just  painted of the neighborhood, it is because the developers fully expect the  neighborhood to change when the project is completed. Commercial developments  of similar scale are contemplated for other neighborhood sites, including the  Park La Brea apartment complex. Indeed, until the fire, the Pan Pacific was to  have been developed into a commercial complex.  </P> <P> The consequences of this dramatic infusion of nouveau commerce into the  neighborhood could be disastrous. Even with the passage of Proposition U and  efforts by City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky and others to "downzone" certain  blocks, recently one city planner noted that the displacement of low-income  seniors in the Fairfax area continues. Small, multiple-unit apartments are  being gutted and upgraded, and younger, more affluent tenants are replacing the  traditional residents.  </P> <P> This trend is certain to accelerate once developments like the one proposed for  Farmers Market take root. And the dilemma is exacerbated by the existence of a  provision of the Los Angeles rent-control ordinance, under which an apartment  usually may be rented at whatever rate a landlord chooses when it becomes  vacant. Of course, new developments are exempt from rent control altogether.  Senior citizens on fixed incomes and young working-class families will soon no  longer be able to rent apartments that an earlier generation found affordable.  </P> <P> This change in demography also portends another casualty: Without its  traditional patrons, the long-extant ethnic commerce of the neighborhood could  not be sustained. If this vision were to become reality, an irreplaceable part  of our culture and traditions -- not that of the Jewish community alone, but in  an important way, of all of us -- would be lost forever.  </P> <P> They say you can't stop "progress," but we can do a much better job of defining  our terms. First, the City Council should pass an ordinance that requires city  planners to analyze the cultural, social and historical implications of  proposed developments before they are approved. And developers should be  required to take these implications into account in designing their projects.  Municipal planning should be undertaken in a more comprehensive fashion, rather  than the all-too-frequent piecemeal basis that has characterized the evaluation  of proposed developments. Historic preservation laws should be strengthened to  more permanently protect designated monuments and neighborhoods. Those who own  property should be permitted to develop it, but not without, for example,  creating affordable housing where the development is likely to diminish it. In  all, city government must assume leadership in helping developer and homeowner,  apartment dweller and landlord to transcend divisive bickering and achieve a  result that benefits the community.  </P> <P> If a consequence of the Pan Pacific fire is the awakening of a neighborhood to  the necessity of creative action to preserve its existence, then perhaps the  destruction of a landmark might lead to the affirmation of a community.  </P></p>

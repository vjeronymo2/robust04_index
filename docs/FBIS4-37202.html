			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Arab League Secretary General Ahmad 'Ismat </F> 'Abd-al-Majid by Gudrun Harrer in Vienna; date not given: "`The  War in Yemen Is Homemade'"]    [Text] [Harrer] In Vienna you signed an agreement between  the Arab League and UNIDO (United Nations Industrial Development  Organization) on industrial cooperation. Is the Arab League now  limiting its ambitions to the economic sphere after the  permanent setbacks in the political sphere -- the Gulf War, the  civil wars in Yemen, Sudan, and Somalia?    ['Abd-al-Majid] Our organization is, after all, an  association of individual sovereign states, and we must not  reduce this sovereignty in any way. Yes, there are joint  political interests of the Arab states but, unfortunately, time  and again there are also differing positions. Still, politics  remains our main cause.    Yemen is certainly an example of misguided cooperation  within  the country. In my opinion certain elements have caused this  fighting, for personal reasons and because of problems between  individual parties.    [Harrer] Are you also thinking of groups outside Yemen,  individual countries of the Arab League, to be more precisely --  such as Saudi Arabia, for whose interests Yemeni unity is  running counter?    ['Abd-al-Majid] No, in my opinion the war in Yemen is  homemade. There was no need of outside intervention. Just  think of the ideological differences between the Marxist south  and the conservative north. Unity, which was concluded in 1990,  was incomplete, there has never been just one army or a single  currency. What unity is that? Not even a military or an  economic one.    [Harrer] When all other Arab countries support Yemeni unity,  why then has the Gulf Cooperation Council, which is actually  nothing more than a regional cooperation forum within the  League, in a statement de facto accepted the breaking off of  South Yemen?    ['Abd-al-Majid] No, that statement is not that clear. It  was only meant to say that unity cannot be forced upon one  partner, which is also my opinion.    [Harrer] So no war by proxy? Media reported that Iraqis  were fighting on the side of North Yemen, whereas Saudi Arabia  has old resentments against North Yemen not least from the time  of the Gulf War.    ['Abd-al-Majid] I know nothing of Iraqis in North Yemen.  No, this is certainly not the right approach to the Yemeni  problem: First one has to stop fighting and then seek ways and  means for reconciliation.    [Harrer] You have also repeatedly appealed for Arab-Arab  reconciliation with Iraq.    ['Abd-al-Majid] I have never been under the illusion that  the problems with Iraq could be solved overnight. What I wanted  to say was that we finally have to face these problems and that  we must learn from past mistakes. This also implies to admit to  faults and responsibility.    I said very clearly that in the case of Iraq, the fault was  its aggression against Kuwait. This now means: Implementing the  UN resolutions, recognizing borders, compensation for victims.  Iraq is about to fulfill the resolutions, but not all of them  yet.    [Harrer] Is it justified to maintain the UN sanctions?    ['Abd-al-Majid] I have personally repeatedly demanded to end  the suffering of the Iraqi people, not for political but for  humanitarian reasons. The quicker Iraq fulfills all the  conditions, the quicker the sanctions will be lifted.    [Harrer] What is the Arab League's position on the progress  in the Palestinian-Israeli agreements? Do you feel left out?    ['Abd-al-Majid] One thing people tend to forget is that in  September 1991 -- even before the Madrid conference, which was  held in October, the Foreign Ministers' Council of the Arab  League adopted a resolution with only two out of 21 votes  against, that welcomed the peace process. As I said, that was  before the Madrid Conference, which proves the will for peace on  the part of the Arab countries. Yet, Israel can, of course, not  have the cake and eat it: This means, peace for occupied  territories.    [Harrer] One subject, which, among others, also applies to  your home country, is radical Islamism.    ['Abd-al-Majid] Islam does not tolerate violence and  terrorism. Thus, Islamism must be seen as a social, political,  and economic phenomenon, and radicalism of this sort exists in  non-Islamic countries, too. In Egypt, the situation is  meanwhile under control.    [Harrer] Is there no alternative to the very violent way in  which the cause of Islamism is waged -- I am thinking of the  many death sentences?    ['Abd-al-Majid] Each country has its own way of dealing with  terrorism. Yet, why should we accept the killing of innocent  people while the criminals then claim human rights for  themselves? We must first of all think of the victims.</p>

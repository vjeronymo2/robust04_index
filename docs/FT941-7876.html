			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / World Trade News: US seeks EU aid on Japan market battle US trade officials have approached the European Commission with fresh suggestions for a joint European-US initiative to persuade Japan to open up its markets. EU officials have responded cautiously, with Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, stressing that he does not wish to emulate the US's combative approach towards the Japan. But as EU officials grow concerned about the implications of the US-Japanese trade row for the Gatt deal, as well as Europe's own mounting trade deficit with Japan, the concept of a new trilateral approach has received serious consideration in the commission. 'It may well be the right course now is to trilateralise the whole process,' commented Sir Leon at the end of last week, as EU and US officials held working meetings to discuss the matter. The 'trilateral' concept, aired by Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, in Brussels last month, has been emerging since the Japanese-US trade talks began to falter, commission officials say. 'When it was clear the US-Japanese talks started to break down we were approached by the Americans saying can you help us,' explains one commission official, who stresses that so far the discussions remain exploratory. But although in public EU officials insist the main focus remains the Gatt meeting in Marrakesh, with the US-Japanese trade row gathering pace, US pressure over the issue has stepped up - leaving the commission in an uncertain position. On the one hand, commission officials say the EU has little intention of abandoning its own, more collaborative, approach towards Japan. This involves a combination of diplomatic pressure and a trade assessment mechanism to open Japanese markets. Although Sir Leon says he would favour some form of macro-economic framework agreement for Japanese-EU trade, he opposes US suggestions of specific trade targets or a quota system. But on the other hand, the EU's continued trade deficit - some Ecu26bn (Pounds 19.65bn) last year - has left many in the commission suspecting that new tactics may be needed. And although the lack of individual economic muscle among the separate member states means Europe has little chance of emulating the US strong-arm tactics, Europe officials remain reluctant to eschew any benefits that could come from the US's approach. 'If market opening was working, the EU would want to share in that,' says one diplomat in Brussels, who says many of the apparent difference between the EU and US over the concept of trade quotas remained largely semantic, particularly in the greyer area of market 'indicators'. But with the US and EU apparently holding different ideas of what a 'trilateral' initiative might entail, few expect any joint initiative to emerge before the Marrakesh meeting. Meanwhile, the Japanese show no signs of wishing to bow to any new joint pressure, however informal. Mr Tetsuo Yakashita, first secretary of the Japanese delegation in Brussels, says: 'Sir Leon has talked about this, but there is nothing very concrete yet.'</p>

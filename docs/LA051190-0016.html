			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Downbeat Cannes: The 43rd Cannes film festival opened on a somber note Thursday  night with Akira Kurosawa's "Dreams," an exploration of the famed Japanese  director's hopes, fears and premonitions of death.  </P> <P> Fear was the key to the eight dream sequences that comprised the 80-year-old  artist's 28th and most personal film. It is already being spoken of as  Kurosawa's last testament. But Kurosawa made it clear he was not finished yet,  saying he hoped eventually to be able to film three dreams omitted from the  original work because of expensive special effects required.

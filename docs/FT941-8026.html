			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Homosexual age of consent lowered to 18 The age of consent for sex between homosexuals is to be lowered to 18 after the Commons last night rejected a common age of consent for homosexuals and heterosexuals at 16 and voted for the compromise favoured by Mr Major. Mrs Edwina Currie, Conservative MP for Derbyshire South, whose clause to the criminal justice bill advocating a common age of consent was defeated by 307 votes to 280, pledged to continue the fight for equality. And she warned that the UK was likely to be forced to change the law by the European Court of Human Rights if the Commons delayed the matter much longer. Although two cabinet ministers were among 42 Conservatives voting for a common age of consent, a number of prominent Labour members ensured the reform was defeated. An overwhelming majority of 265 voted to reduce the age of consent for gay sex from 21 to 18. Mr Jerry Hayes, a Conservative co-sponsor of Mrs Currie's clause, said: 'It does not say a lot for tolerance and equality.' Rightwing Tories said they would vote against any change at third reading. During the debate Mrs Currie was frequently interrupted from her own side. She was accused by Mr Tony Marlow (Northampton North) of 'voting to legislate buggery of adolescent men'. While Mr Bill Walker (Tayside North) argued that homosexuality was 'neither natural nor normal'. But Mrs Currie said a law which allowed heterosexuals to marry at 16 but judged homosexuals to be different was 'nuts', adding: 'There is no logical argument for discrimination and there is no biological one either.' Sir Anthony Durant (Reading West) put forward an amendment proposing 18 as the age of consent for gay sex, which was backed by the prime minister and his cabinet. He argued that most 16-year-olds were 'very confused about their sexuality'. Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, made an impassioned plea to lower the age of consent for homosexuals, arguing that in some cases it was important for the House of Commons to be a step ahead of public opinion. After the vote homosexual rights activists attempted to storm the entrance to parliament but the doors were locked.</p>

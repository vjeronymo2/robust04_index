			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze has described as  historic the visit to Tbilisi February 3 by Russian President  Yeltsin.    Addressing in Tbilisi Friday the conference of the Union of  Georgian Citizens, he said that the signed agreements would  provide results shortly.    Shevardnadze called groundless the fears by certain forces  in  Russia and Georgia that the treaty of friendship and cooperation  between the two countries may destabilize the situation in the  North Caucasus. The Georgian leader said that the treaty had  been signed for a ten year period, and if one of the sides did  not demand its annulment, it would be extended automatically.    Speaking about the possible creation in Georgia of Russian  military bases, Shevardnadze said that the problem was not yet  solved. At the talks, he said, the two sides only agreed on  forming expert teams to consider the problem.    Answering the question on circumstances behind the death  Thursday in Tbilisi of deputy Georgian Defense Minister Niko  Kekelidze, the Georgian leader said that the act of terrorism  (Kekelidze died following an explosion in his house) was not  committed for political reasons. Organized crime is behind the  murder.    Speaking about the resignation of Georgian Defense Minister  Georgiy Karkarashvili, Shevardnadze said that he would meet him  and ask him to explain the reasons.</p>

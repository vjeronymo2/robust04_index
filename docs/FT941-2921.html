			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Malaysia - EU should unite against threat (1) Sir, Clearly the government has decided that, in the case of the Malaysian government's embargo on giving contracts to UK firms, the best course is to adopt a low profile and hope it all blows over. And prime minister John Major and foreign secretary Douglas Hurd et al are right - this decision will be rescinded after a decent interval of time. However, even from a business perspective, this mousey approach is not ultimately satisfactory, as it ensures that British business will be more likely in the future to be damaged by events and press reporting at home - if governments abroad see that they can use the trade weapon for political purposes with impunity, they are more likely to do so. Outside the purely business arena, it is frankly astonishing that a tougher response, such as the threat of retaliatory trade sanctions, is not being pressed forcefully by all those concerned with basic freedom and democracy. The issue should be one in which the EU as a whole could unite to apply a major threat (though support for Britain is likely to be at a low point in Brussels due to the debacle over enlargement and the blocking veto). Malaysia's prime minister Dr Mahathir Bin Mohamad (Letters, March 17) openly acknowledges that it is the perceived 'vilification and libellous attacks' in the British press which he cannot stomach. He complains that 'British newspapers are freely available in Malaysia', but that 'Malaysian newspapers are not available to the British'. In fact, Malaysian newspapers are freely available in the UK but are little read because the public does not choose to do so. The Malaysian government's clear link between the trade sanctions it has imposed and the UK's free press is a direct attack on our freedom values. Dr Mahathir prefers the route of authoritarian force to that of debate. It may seem only a small affair, but the principles involved demand firmer action by the British government.

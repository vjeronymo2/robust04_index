			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC'S CORNER  </P> <P> American TV stations were supposedly being freed of prior constraints when the  Federal Communications Commission (FCC) summarily repealed its 38-year-old  Fairness Doctrine in 1987. The rule, which required stations to give balanced  treatment of "controversial issues of public importance," supposedly inhibited  them from tackling troublesome hot potatoes.  </P> <P> In fact, says a new study, those uninhibited stations now give less time to  public affairs than they did before the rule was thrown out. Comparing  programming aired on commercial stations in 1988 with a similar period in 1979,  Essential Information, a public-interest research group, found a 51% decrease  in the amount of time devoted to "issue-oriented public affairs" material.  </P> <P> Consumer advocate Ralph Nader, who founded the group, says, "This study refutes  FCC predictions that repeal of the Fairness Doctrine would remove an impediment  to presenting issue-oriented public-affairs programming on television."  </P> <P> On Capitol Hill, Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) and his telecommunications  subcommittee have begun marking up legislation to restore the Fairness Doctrine  and make it law. Markey says the study "underscores the importance of Congress  reinstating the Fairness Doctrine as soon as possible" and reveals the  "intellectual bankruptcy" of the FCC's rationale for killing it.  </P> <P> Both the House and Senate voted to make the doctrine law in 1987, but President  Reagan vetoed the bill. Reagan and his FCC clung to the idea that marketplace  forces would compel stations to do their civic duties, but the record shows  they have cut back on the kind of public-minded programming that benefits the  community.  </P> <P> At the same time, the fallout from deregulation has been an epidemic of trashy,  gutter-minded tabloid TV shows like "A Current Affair," "Geraldo" and "The  Reporters." Some stations actually consider these to be public-affairs  programming. They sometimes deal in affairs, but that's about as far as it  goes.  </P> <P> For its Fairness Doctrine study, Essential Information looked at programming on  217 TV stations in 50 markets from January through April of last year and  compared it with a similar period nine years earlier. Jim Donahue, the staff  researcher who wrote the report, says that local TV Guides were used to gather  programming data because the FCC no longer requires stations to file their  program logs.  </P> <P> Donahue says that the FCC couldn't care less about the public interest and that  its decision to repeal the Fairness Doctrine was "based totally on ideology to  enhance corporate interests rather than the interests of the audience."  </P> <P> Sally Lawrence, speaking for the FCC, was not impressed by Donahue's findings.  "This report is nothing short of outrageous," she said. "There is nothing in my  data file that corroborates this study." Lawrence claims networks and local  stations are doing more public-affairs programming, not less.  </P> <P> The very day that the study was released, FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick was at  the White House submitting his resignation. The resignation had nothing to do  with the study. The Bush Administration is expected to name a successor who has  a less fanatical ideological agenda -- and someone who thinks the job of a  regulatory agency is to regulate, not stand back and watch.  </P> <P> In other words, kinder and gentler television may be on its way.  </P> <P> Some aspects of the doctrine remained in force after 1987, mainly those  concerning ballot issues such as referendums and propositions. A report  released in February by the Public Interest Research Group found many stations  unaware that such provisions were in effect. Of those that acknowledged such a  requirement, the study found, 98% "agreed to present opposing points of view"  on such issues as California's voter crusade to cut insurance rates.  </P> <P> But among stations that considered all Fairness Doctrine obligations to be  extinct, only 56% were willing to give time to opposing viewpoints.  </P> <P> "This conclusion stands as powerful evidence that the Fairness Doctrine works,"  the report said.  </P> <P> Sources on Capitol Hill say the new, revived Fairness Doctrine should reach the  House floor by the end of April. The Supreme Court may be asked eventually to  rule on its constitutionality, though it upheld the principle behind the  doctrine in its landmark Red Lion decision in 1959.  </P> <P> Donahue says no TV network sent reporters to cover the press conference at  which the results of the study were revealed. He called one network to tell it  of the report on the Fairness Doctrine and the response he got was, "the what  Doctrine?"  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNISTS TAKE BIG LEAD IN BULGARIA VOTE  </P> <P> The ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party took a strong lead in early returns after  a surprisingly fair vote on Sunday, setting up communism's first victory in the  new age of East European democracy.  </P> <P> Bulgarian television reported that with about 20% of the vote counted, the  renamed Communist Party had 47%, compared to 34% for the opposition Union of  Democratic Forces.  </P> <P> A West German polling organization that had proved highly accurate in  predicting the vote in East Germany, Romania and Czechoslovakia gave the  Bulgarian Socialists an even higher share, 48.5%.  </P> <P> "The results are pretty consistent, which gives us confidence in their  accuracy," said Reinhard Schlinkert of the Bonn-based INFAS research firm.  </P> <P> INFAS, which was banned from conducting exit polls but set up a network for  precinct reports, projected 32.3% for the Union of Democratic Forces, 8.7% for  the Movement for Rights and Freedom backed by Bulgaria's 1.5-million Turkish  minority, and 8.1% for the Agrarian Party.  </P> <P> Turnout was well over 80% nationwide, reflecting the respect East Europeans  have shown for the novelty of choosing who will lead them.  </P> <P> Central Electoral Commission Chairman Jivko Stalev said that no serious  irregularities were reported at the polling places, and U.S. and West European  observers likewise said the voting had been a tribute to tolerance and  fairness.  </P> <P> Bulgaria's election was one of the few cliffhangers in this year's succession  of free votes in the region.  </P> <P> Reformed Communists were trounced in East Germany, Hungary and Czechoslovakia,  and the National Salvation Front in Romania has denied any common ground with  the discredited party.  </P> <P> The Bulgarian opposition appeared to be rising quickly in recent weeks, and it  was favored among the capital's 1.2 million residents, who gave more than 50%  support to the 16-party Union of Democratic Forces.  </P> <P> A crowd of nearly 1,000 rallied outside election headquarters well into the wee  hours of today, waving blue opposition banners and chanting in support of the  political underdogs, apparently unaware their favorites were running a distant  second.  </P> <P> Vote counting progressed slowly despite the aid of computers sent by the U.S.  government and other backers of democracy. Western diplomats monitoring the  tabulations made little effort to hide their disappointment over the  pro-Communist result.  </P> <P> Bulgarians, saddled with $11 billion in foreign debts and a declining economy,  may have feared the opposition's call for stepped-up reforms, opting instead  for the relative security of the status quo.  </P> <P> "We're doing quite well. No big surprises," said Kalin Mitrev, a Socialist  diplomat watching the vote projections with obvious satisfaction.  </P> <P> Full results from the first round are expected late today, and a runoff will be  held in a week to decide contests in which no candidate won at least 50%.  </P> <P> The balloting will seat a 400-member Grand National Assembly, with half the  deputies chosen through a party popularity contest and the other half in  individual constituencies. Results released late Sunday were for the party  preferences.  </P> <P> International election observers said the vote apparently proceeded without  major incidents, an element of surprise after a campaign of mudslinging and  allegations of foul play by the Socialists.  </P> <P> "It has been very calm, fair and balanced," said Lyubomir Mitov, a nonpartisan  monitor sent to the village of Jordankino from the national Committee for Fair  Elections based in Sofia. "It's gone much smoother than we expected."  </P> <P> Union of Democratic Forces leaders had accused rural supporters of the  Socialist Party of threatening punishment of opponents in backward, isolated  regions of Bulgaria.  </P> <P> In villages like Razliv, an enclave of several hundred tucked between folds of  the verdant Balkan range, Bulgarians spoke out in defense of the party that is  the only power many of them have ever known.  </P> <P> "I've already worked hard all my life, and I want to go into retirement knowing  what the circumstances will be," said 65-year-old Maria Atanassova, a toothless  milkmaid chuckling with other plump matrons on a sagging bench outside Razliv's  sole cafe.  </P> <P> "There have been some bad things done by the party over 45 years, but there  have also been good things as well. People won't forget that," chimed in Penka  Petkova, dressed in mourning black. "I voted for the BSP, as did my son and  daughter. My husband died last year, but he would have voted for them, too."  </P> <P> Marin Pavlov, chairman of Razliv's Socialist Party, sat on the stoop of the  nearby post office, smoking, trading gossip and tipping an imaginary hat to  acquaintances trudging through oppressive heat to the polling place across the  parking lot.  </P> <P> "I've been a member of the BSP for 35 years," said Pavlov, using the initials  for the new name taken on by the Communists in April. "The party, regardless of  mistakes, has done a lot for the nation, and with the restructuring that is  taking place, I believe it will be the political force to lead the country out  of crisis."  </P> <P> A cluster of cafe patrons and exiting voters, who had sidled up to listen in on  the political chat, all nodded their agreement.  </P> <P> Only Ivan Vruchkovsky, a local election monitor, stood up to be counted for the  Union of Democratic Forces.  </P> <P> "In villages, especially, democracy still has not penetrated the minds of the  people. They are still fearful," said Vruchkovsky. "The people have been  repressed for 45 years."  </P> <P> In the nearby town of Pravec, a more affluent resort and computer-manufacturing  region about 45 miles east of Sofia, the community of 900 seemed sharply split  but far from fractious.  </P> <P> Voters en route to the polls stopped in at the Union of Democratic Forces club  for cold drinks and lollipops for the children, while the Socialist Party  headquarters across the courtyard blared Elvis Presley songs to entertain the  strollers.  </P> <P> Rositza Guleva and Mariana Vassileva, both 28-year-old sales clerks at the  local department store, were asked for whom they had voted.  </P> <P> "After the Communist Party failed for 45 years to achieve progress, it's time  for someone else to try to improve the situation," said Guleva, explaining her  preference for the Union of Democratic Forces.  </P> <P> Vassileva, smiling at her friend's dissent, said the Socialists "have learned  from the mistakes of the past" and present the best hope of avoiding chaotic  changes in the economy.  </P></p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zimbabwe's first platinum development given go-ahead The go-ahead was given yesterday for Zimbabwe's first platinum mine. Broken Hill Proprietary, the large Australian steel and natural resources group, announced that it would proceed with the ADollars 310m (Pounds 142m) development of a mine and associated processing facility at the Hartley complex, on the country's Great Dyke. The project is a joint venture with Delta Gold, another Australian mining and exploration group, although its funding will be provided solely by BHP. Assuming that an investment agreement is successfully executed with the Zimbabwe government, BHP will have a 67 per cent interest in the project, with Delta retaining 33 per cent. According to Mr Peter Vanderspuy, Delta's chairman, Hartley may be linked with other properties on the Great Dyke to form a substantial platinum producing area. He said recently that BHP and Delta were involved in talks with RTZ Corporation and Anglo American Corporation about pooling their interests. Mr Vanderspuy suggested that the Great Dyke was geologically similar to the Bushveld Complex of South Africa, the world's biggest repository of platinum group metals. He believed the Great Dyke area had the potential to support operations producing up to 600,000 troy ounces of platinum a year - about 15 per cent of present western world demand. Delta said recently that discussions the Zimbabwe government had 'progressed well' and that 'agreement-in-principle' had been reached on an investment framework for the project. It is expected that the development will begin fairly early in 1994. Collaboration between the two companies on the potential project began three years ago. Delta, which holds an exclusive prospecting order on a 640-square-kilometre area in the region, covering a major part of the Hartley Complex, invited BHP to undertake a feasibility study on the possible extraction of platinum group metals in 1990. Under an agreement between the two companies, BHP was required to let Delta know by the end of 1993, whether it intended to proceed with development of the mine. Last week, announcing BHP's half-year results, Mr John Prescott, BHP's managing director, made clear that the Melbourne-based company intended to keep to that timetable. The ADollars 310m project expenditure will be spread over a three-year period, and the project will initially be designed to permit the mining of about 2.2m tonnes of ore a year. Delta recently estimated that, on the basis of 2.1m tonnes of ore a year, the mine would turn out some 150,000 troy ounces of platinum, 110,000 ounces of palladium, 11,500 ounces of rhodium, 23,000 ounces of gold, 7m lb of nickel and 5m lb of copper. The project is expected to employ over 2,000 people. News of BHP's decision lifted Delta Gold shares, which ended the day up 10 cents at ADollars 3.77. BHP, however, shed 16 cents, to ADollars 16.36, in the generally weaker Australian market.</p>

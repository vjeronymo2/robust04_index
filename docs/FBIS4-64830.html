			<p>BFN     [Text] Commenting on rumors of a murder attempt against  his life, the Archbishop of Albania Anastasios stressed in a  statement that for 33 months, under particularly difficult  conditions, he has been touring through Albania to revive the  Orthodox Church without any protection at all. The love and  prayers of hundreds of thousands of Orthodox and thousands of  other friends are enough, said Archbishop Anastasios. The  Archbishop of Albania also stressed that the truth will finally  shine and his work will remain as proof of honesty, love, and  solidarity among the peoples.    Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today referred to  the statement of Archbishop Anastasios and stressed that the  archbishop of Tirana and the whole of Albania always acts on  behalf of the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. The Greek  Government, said the spokesman, is clearly very interested in  the rights of the Greek minority in Albania, which is Orthodox  Christian in religion. In this sense, the spokesman stressed,  we are interested in the smooth operation and exercise of rights  by the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church to a degree which  includes the religious and worship needs of the Greek minority.</p>

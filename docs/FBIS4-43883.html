			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Conor O'Clery: "Taoiseach Foresees Cross-Border </F> Authority"]    [Text] Boston -- A form of cross-Border authority with  executive powers is being sought by the Government in  negotiations with Britain as a quid pro quo for dropping  Articles 2 and 3 from the Constitution, the Taoiseach [Irish  Prime Minister], Mr Reynolds, has said.    In an interview in Boston yesterday with THE IRISH TIMES, Mr  Reynolds said it was futile to talk in isolation about removing  the constitutional claim to the North and that there had to be a  balanced constitutional agreement. Spelling out for the first  time what this means, Mr Reynolds said: "Institutional links  between North and South will have executive powers. That's the  type of overall framework we're looking to."    He said there was still a "fair bit of work to be done" in  the talks between officials from Dublin and London, but he was  hopeful he and British Prime Minister, Mr John Major, could  achieve their aim of agreement by mid-July.    Mr Reynolds was in Boston to receive the Christian A. Herter  Memorial Award from the World Affairs Council of Boston for his  role in the peace process.    President Clinton sent a message of congratulations to Mr  Reynolds who, he said, had earned the respect and admiration of  world leaders for his contribution to peace.    In his acceptance speech, Mr Reynolds laid stress on the  need  for a balanced constitutional accommodation. New arrangements,  he said, "must provide a clear and explicit institutional  framework for the development of the necessary North-South  co-operation and co- ordination in areas of mutual benefit."    Expanding on this in his interview, Mr Reynolds said there  had to be an even-handed approach in the negotiations with  Britain and therefore the Government of Ireland Act 1920 and  Articles 2 and 3 should be on the table "for negotiation both  ways."    "That's the Act that set up partition in the first place,  but  it also had the intentions of the British Government at the time  to move on towards eventual unity of Ireland, and that (in the  meantime) intermediate steps would be taken," he said.    Asked if he was seeking a quid pro quo involving some type  of  cross-border authority with executive powers in return for the  dropping of Articles 2 and 3, Mr Reynolds said: "Those are the  type of areas we are exploring between the two governments at  the moment. What I'm saying is institutional links between North  and South will have executive powers. That's the type of  overall framework we're looking to, but that emanates clearly  from the contents of the Downing Street Declaration."    Mr Reynolds acknowledged that unionists might view this as a  form of the Council of Ireland which they had strongly rejected  in the past.    In the declaration, "we make it clear that there has to be a  wider settlement involving other relationships, internal  relationships in Northern Ireland, North-South co-operation and  an institutional framework to reflect the diversity of the two  parts and between the islands of Ireland and Great Britain."    On the role of the United States, Mr Reynolds said the  message from the United States to the nationalists was: "We're  here to support you but we're not here to support any  continuation of violence. Give up the violence and you can rely  on us for our support to see that the cause is not ignored and  that whatever commitments are given will be implemented."    Mr Reynolds continued: "That's a very important guarantor  situation for the United States and the people in the United  States to have taken up." He said he now expected a response  from Sinn Fein to the Downing Street Declaration by "the early  days of July, if not before."</p>

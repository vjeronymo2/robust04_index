			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The House of Representatives held an ordinary  session this morning under Brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab Mahmud,  member of the House's Speakership Office.    At the outset of the session, the people's deputies reviewed  and ratified the minutes of the previous session after urging  and appealing to the government agencies to transport and  distribute the basic food commodities available in large  quantities at ports, mills, warehouses, and silos. These  commodities, the House stressed, must be distributed to citizens  in all governorates of the Republic of Yemen, and merchants and  the public and private food suppliers must sell the commodities  hoarded in their houses to the citizens at the official prices.  The agencies charged with monitoring prices must fulfill their  tasks in this and other fields, continuously and without showing  any leniency. [passage omitted]</p>

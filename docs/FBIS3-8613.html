			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The agreement negotiated by Poland with the London  Club means a reduction of more than 45 percent on a debt that  amounts to $13.2 billion. The repayments of the debt are to  last 30 years. They will not exceed $400 million a year.  During the first five years, the repayments will be lower and  will increase after 2009, when the servicing of debts owed to  governments of creditor countries assembled in the Paris Club is  to come to an end.    The agreement embraces all of the constituent parts of the  debt: long- and medium-term credits, outstanding interest, and  the short-term revolving credit.    [Correspondent Krystyna Koziol] The agreement with the  London  Club on a reduction of our debt, negotiated by Poland during the  night, is a very important event for Poland, said Prime Minister  Waldemar Pawlak at a news conference devoted to this matter and  held at the Office of the Council of Ministers.    Several governments worked to achieve this success, as well  as many politicians and experts, added the prime minister. He  stressed that the agreement with the London Club brought to an  end the restructuring process of our foreign debt. This event,  said the prime minister, will have a significant influence on  our economic situation.    Acting Finance Minister Henryk Chmielak stressed that, in  negotiations with our creditors associated in the London Club,  we achieved the goals we had set ourselves: We had lowered the  costs of servicing of our debt, adjusting them to our  capabilities. And the second important goal achieved was a  reduction of our debt, comparable to that granted us by the  Paris Club.    The results of the negotiated agreement, emphasized Minister  Chmielak, are fully satisfactory. With this agreement, we have  achieved a full normalization of our financial relations with  the West. This is a sign for Western investors that investing  in Poland is growing more attractive.    Deputy Finance Minister Krzysztof Krowacki, government  plenipotentiary in talks with banks, underlined that the  repayments of the debt were to take 30 years and would not  exceed $400 million per year. In many regards, said Minister  Krowacki, the main negotiator of the agreement, we have obtained  better conditions than those we received from the Paris Club.  The agreement that this reduction would also apply to  outstanding interest is without precedent, he added.    And one more thing: Until now, because of our debt to the  London Club, our daily interest grew to the tune of $2 million.  From 20 March, on the basis of the agreement, this growth will  decrease by 45 percent.</p>

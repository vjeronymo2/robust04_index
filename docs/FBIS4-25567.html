			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chen Chieh-hung (7115 3381 1738): "Deng Xiaoping Is </F> Opposed To Erecting Statues and Building Memorial Halls for  Himself"]    [Text] According to a source in Beijing, in a letter to  the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and in a talk  with members of the central Secretariat in mid-April, Deng  Xiaoping solemnly indicated his disapproval of the practice of  raising his image to an excessively high level.    In his letter to the Political Bureau, Deng said: I recently  learned that party and government departments, units,  enterprises, and schools in some localities wanted to erect  statues of me, cast badges of me, repair my former residence,  and build memorial halls for me. This is an indication of the  respect and solicitude which the party and the people have for  me, and I am deeply moved by and gratified for this, but I also  feel deeply uneasy. It is hoped that the central and local  authorities will do a good job of persuading them not to erect  statues of me, repair my former residence, or building memorial  halls for me, and I extend sincere tribute and gratitude for  this.    In a talk with members of the Secretariat, Deng said: I hope  you will not raise me to an excessively high level in publicity.  May I suggest that the Secretariat issue a circular, calling on  people not to erect statues of me or build memorial halls for  me. Even after I go, this should still be upheld. Shaoqi [Liu  Shaoqi], the Premier [Zhou Enlai], Chen Yun, Peng Zhen, and I  raised the issue of opposing the personality cult at the Eighth  CPC National Congress. At that time it was aimed at countering  the personality cult starting to develop around Mao Zedong, but  it was not upheld later and it led to the feverish cult for Mao  Zedong and brought grave misfortunes to the party and the  people. This state of affairs was basically curbed after the  Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. Some  time ago, some people in the party suggested hanging the  portraits of present leaders. Comrade Zemin [Jiang Zemin] was  opposed to this, and I supported him. It is right to hang the  portraits of present leaders, but it is better not to. In 1980  the central Secretariat made a decision against hanging the  portraits of leaders for the next 20-30 years in an effort to  eliminate blind worship and superstitions concerning any one  individual.    Deng added: Of course, it will not do for a state or a  political party not to have a program or a theory guiding its  practice. The party's and state's theory of construction and  development should be the crystallization of collective wisdom,  which has stood the test of practice. These theories still have  to be constantly substantiated, improved, and revised along with  the progress of the times and the development of the state. One  or several individuals may play a substantial, or even a crucial  role at a certain stage or period. Nevertheless, one or several  individuals belong to the party and the people, and therefore it  is inadvisable to publicize any one individual to an excessively  high level. True, some of my viewpoints differ from, and may  even be antagonistic to Marxism. Some people in the outside  world and in the party label me a "revisionist," and even a  "traitor" to Marxism. Talking about revisionism, it is  necessary to see in which direction it is "revised." If, after  revision, the line, principles, and policies can push forward  and accelerate state development and progress, enrich the  people, and improve their living standard, then we should  continue walking along this line. The most fundamental and  important task of a political party governing on behalf of the  people is to enhance the state's comprehensive national power  and to improve the people's living standard. If we fail to do  so, what right do we have to govern on behalf of the people?    Deng added: From now until the end of this century, it is  still necessary to give more publicity to the line of the Third  Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the  resolution of the 14th party congress, and the leading  collective of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang  Zemin as the core. In the last five years, there has been  another substantial change in the country which finds  concentrated expression in the firm and strong leadership of the  present leading body. This is the result of implementing a  correct line, a fact that all people without prejudice will  admit.    The source said that Deng Xiaoping indicated explicitly that  he should not have conferred on him such titles as honorary  state president, honorary chairman of the military commission,  honorary chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference, and so on, because this would put him in an awkward  position.</p>

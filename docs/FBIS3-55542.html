			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent T. Orlova; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Today in Moscow, representatives of centrist parties  discussed the possibility of holding presidential elections in  Russia this year.    Taking part in today's open sitting of the Centrist bloc,  apart from the hosts, were representatives of 14 parties and  associations whose political inclinations and ideologies were in  complete contrast, even at first glance. For instance, the  Sakharov Union of Democratic Forces -- the initiator and creator  of the Centrist bloc; the Muzyka publishing house; and arriving  slightly late, but accompanied by a whole detachment, leader of  the Pamyat National Patriotic Front Dmitriy Vasilyev. Very  impressive, don't you think?    It was Mr. Vasilyev who began the discussion on the only  issue on today's agenda: The possibility of holding early  presidential elections on 12 June this year.    Well, the sitting started very sluggishly, and after  numerous  appeals by Chairman Vladimir Voronin [head of Sakharov Union of  Democratic Forces] to begin discussing this vital political  question, which received no response, the distraught chairman  had to repeat his opening speech once again to rouse the sleepy  participants.    Today's meeting is expected to result in the signing of a  joint document on the need for early presidential elections.  Many participants already believe that such a decision will be  adopted.</p>

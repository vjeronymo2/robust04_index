			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Japanese moved by plight of Kurds INTERNATIONAL charities have often found Japan hard going. Japanese will make great sacrifices for the sake of family and close friends but are less easily moved by the plight of strangers. There have always been exceptions, but Japan lacks a single international charity of the scale of Oxfam in the UK, Medecins sans Frontiers in France or Care in the US. While the Japanese government is the world's largest provider of assistance to developing countries, contributions by private organisations are small in comparison with the west. Japan is a relative newcomer to the club of rich nations; its self-consciously insular people have little experience of involvement in international affairs; their religious traditions lack the missionary spirit of Christianity. When the Japanese government last year asked for volunteers for medical missions to the Gulf, only about 20 people responded. But there are signs that things are changing. The graphic television coverage of the destruction of Kuwait, the bombing of Iraq, and the sufferings of the Kurdish refugees has made Japanese more aware of the world around them. The appointment of Mrs Sadako Ogata, a tough-minded university professor, as United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, has made people realise that they have a role to play beyond their shores. Government has led the way, with Dollars 128m being given from the public purse for refugees and other victims of the war. Of this, Dollars 100m is going for the Kurds, fully one quarter of the Dollars 400m worldwide appeal launched by the United Nations Disaster Relief Organisation. Japanese business has followed with a Y1.4bn appeal fund, to which Sony, the electronics group has contributed around Y400m. People also seemed to have been moved by the refugee crisis as never before. Miss Chikako Saito, an official of the UNHCR in Tokyo, says it has collected Y400m in the past few weeks, less than the Y500m donated for famine relief in the 1980s but money is still pouring in. 'The difference this time is that people want to know about the refugees. At the time of Ethiopia they just felt a vague sympathy. Now they want to know where the victims are and how they are suffering,' said Miss Saito. The Japan Red Cross says it collected 7,000 gifts worth Y300m in the first week after the war broke out in January. However, an official of the Non-Government Organisation for International Co-operation, an umbrella group for 13 volunteer groups, says it is too early to say whether Japanese attitudes have changed or not. 'Buddhists are passive, accepting things as they are and not trying to change them. So Japanese tend to feel sympathy but not to act. We need to establish organisations to make sure people can express their sympathies.'</p>

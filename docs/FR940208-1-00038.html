			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Methods 2A, 2B, 25A, and 25B in Appendix A of 40 CFR Part 60 are specified for measurement of total organic compound emissions from the vapor collection and processing system. Due to the inherent inability to measure mass emissions from elevated flares (elevated flare's flame is open to atmosphere and therefore the emissions cannot be routed through stacks), these test methods are not applicable. Therefore, the Agency has established performance requirements for flares. These performance requirements, including a limitation on visible emissions, are provided in &sect;63.11 of the proposed General Provisions, which specifies Method 22 for determining visible emissions from this hard to test type of flare.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before each performance test, the owner or operator would be required to use Method 21 to monitor potential leak sources in the terminal's vapor collection system during the loading of a gasoline tank truck or railcar. Leaks from the vapor collection and processing system would have to be repaired before conducting the rest of the performance test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each gasoline tank truck and railcar loading at an affected bulk terminal would have to pass an annual vapor tightness test using Method 27. This will ensure that fugitive vapor leakage from loading cargo tanks is minimized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's proposed emission standard includes continuous monitoring of an operating parameter as a requirement for vapor processing systems to ensure continuous compliance with the proposed 10 mg TOC/l emission limit. The vapor processing system's operating parameter ``value'' would be established during the initial performance test of the vapor processor. Exceeding or failures to maintain, as appropriate, that operating parameter value would be a violation of the emission limit requiring maintenance and repair and documentation in a quarterly report to the Administrator. The parameters that may be monitored include organic compounds concentration for carbon adsorption and refrigeration condenser systems, and combustion or condenser temperature for thermal oxidation and refrigeration condenser systems. An owner or operator may substitute an alternative parameter or vapor processor type upon the approval of the Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At new bulk gasoline terminals installing a vacuum assisted vapor collection system, the proposed standards require continuous monitoring of the pressure in the collection system, to ensure that a vacuum exists at all times during loading. No specific vacuum limits are being proposed. As with parameter monitoring of the vapor processing system, this vacuum monitoring will ensure that fugitive vapor leakage is effectively reduced through the continuous compliance for the proposed vacuum requirements for the vacuum assist system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The pumps, valves, and other specified equipment in the gasoline liquid and vapor transfer lines at bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations may be sources of fugitive HAP emissions. The proposed standards include a requirement for an LDAR program in which pumps and valves are manually monitored using a portable VOC detector on a periodic basis, and then repaired if a leak is found. Under the proposed standards, monitoring would initially be carried out monthly at new facilities and quarterly at existing facilities. Provisions are included to reduce monitoring frequencies for valves on the basis of demonstrated low leak rates. When a leak is detected (meter reading of 10,000 ppm on a portable organic monitor), the owner or operator would have 5 calendar days in which to make an initial repair attempt, and 15 calendar days in which to complete the repair. Other equipment in gasoline liquid or vapor service at new facilities are required to have specified equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Recordkeeping and Reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed standards require four types of reports: initial notification, notification of compliance status, periodic reports, and other reports. The initial notification report apprises the regulatory authority of applicability for existing sources or of construction for new sources. This report also includes a statement as to whether the facility can achieve compliance by the required compliance date. The notification of compliance status demonstrates that compliance has been achieved. This report contains the results of the initial performance test, which includes calculation of the monitored operating parameter value for the vapor processor, and a list of equipment subject to the standard. Periodic reports submitted quarterly would specify exceedences of the emission standards, such as when the monitored operating parameter of a vapor processor is outside the value established during the performance test. Other periodic reports, which are submitted semiannually, include LDAR program and annual storage vessel inspection results. Certain additional reporting is occasionally necessary because a short-term response may be needed from the reviewing authority. For example, the Administrator may request more frequent reports of monitored operating parameter or LDAR data if it is deemed necessary to ensure compliance with the standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

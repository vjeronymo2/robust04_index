			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: GM sets break-even target for 1993 GENERAL Motors, which is in the throes of a wholesale restructuring of its loss-making North American vehicle operations, said yesterday that its target was for them to break even, before interest and taxes, in 1993. The target, given to a meeting of Wall Street analysts by GM's new management team, represents a great improvement on the company's performance over the past two years. Mr William Hoglund, GM's new executive vice-president for corporate affairs, said that in the first nine months of 1992 North America had lost Dollars 3bn before interest and taxes and did not expect to break even in the fourth quarter, though he would not be more specific. However, this year's losses represented a big improvement on the Dollars 6.1bn North America loss in the first nine months of last year. Mr Hoglund attributed about one third of this year's improvement to the volume and mix of GM's sales, about one third to better pricing and one third to cost improvements. Mr Jack Smith, who was appointed GM's chief executive last week after the forced resignation of Mr Robert Stempel, the company's former chairman and chief executive, told the analysts that GM was not depending on an economic upturn to return the group to profitability. 'We're implementing fundamental changes and a restructuring that will allow us to be profitable even in economic down-cycles.' Officials said the company was committed to reducing its vehicle production capacity in North American to 5.4m units a year in 1995 through the closure of 21 plants, of which only 14 have so far been identified. The remaining seven will be named before the end of the year, probably in early December, when GM has decided which products to concentrate on in the important mid-sized car market. The company said it should significantly exceed its target of cutting annual costs by Dollars 5bn by 1995. Mr J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who took over earlier this year as head of GM worldwide purchasing, said he had already achieved the Dollars 2bn of parts cost savings which GM said last April that it wanted to achieve by 1994. He aimed to double this figure by 1994. Mr Lopez, whose price-cutting demands have provoked controversy among GM's outside suppliers, also announced that the company would be establishing a 15-member council in January to get ideas from suppliers. The company said that based on modest US economic growth of around 2.8 per cent in 1993 it expected to sell 4.7m vehicles next year, 3m cars and 1.7m trucks. This would give it a roughly 34.5 per cent share of an overall market of 13.7m vehicles, which is broadly the same as now. The company's automotive components group said it was targetting double-digit productivity improvements in 1993, on top of a 12 per cent increase this year, and would move from 'a modest positive cash flow in 1992 to a significantly more positive cash flow in 1993'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["First Thing" program health segment by Dr. Miguel Barroso </F> Molina -- live or recorded]    [Excerpts] [Barroso] Good morning, listeners. Today we are  going to talk about the very important, overall environmental  cleanup plan. My guest today is Dr. (Adelaida Ibaz Monet), a  specialist in hygiene and epidemiology from Havana Province,  whom I welcome to this program.    [(Ibaz)] Thank you very much, Dr. Barroso.    [Barroso] Adelaida, what was the origin of this Overall  Environmental Cleanup Plan [Plan Integral de Higienizacion  Ambiental]? And let's call it PIHA, to give it an acronym.    [(Ibaz)] Since 1990, because of the restrictions of the  special period, there has been a gradual deterioration of the  hygiene and health conditions in Havana, and of course in the  province as well. This situation has brought with it a whole  series of difficulties in supplying water and in chlorinating  the water supply. There are also difficulties in treating and  disposing of liquid wastes, as well as in collecting,  transporting, and disposing of solid wastes.    Along with this has come an increase in the incidence of  infestations of different kinds, such as mosquitoes, flies,  cockroaches, and rodents. All this brings with it a  deterioration in hygiene and health habits, which in turn brings  significant changes in the incidence and mortality rates of  contagious diseases.    [Barroso] Doctor, what are the contagious diseases that most  increase in such a situation?    [(Ibaz)] Among them are acute diarrheas, different types of  hepatitis, leptospirosis, etc.    [Barroso] And tell me: Is not cholera among these contagious  diseases? What measures are being taken against cholera here in  Cuba? Because we know that there is a cholera epidemic, that  cholera is practically pandemic, in Latin America right now.    [(Ibaz)] As you have rightly said, the moment this cholera  pandemic hit America, our country took pertinent measures, and  there is an overall plan, in this connection. Our country is not  exempt from risk, of course, and such a thing would do us  serious damage, not just to health but also from the economic  point of view. [passage omitted]    [Barroso] There is a disease you mentioned that is on the  rise right now: leptospirosis. We know that leptospirosis is a  disease whose symptoms resemble many other illnesses, because it  can cause fevers. Sometimes people even have renal problems; we  know of patients who have displayed hematuria and turned out to  have leptospirosis. The disease can be benign but it can also be  fatal. What strategy are you using to prevent this increase in  leptospirosis? [sentence as heard] Which we also know to be a  disease caused by animals, right? I mean, it is a zoonosis.    [(Ibaz)] That is correct. Leptospirosis is a zoonosis that  is  transmitted not just by dogs, as is commonly believed. There are  other animals that can transmit the leptospira. The population  very frequently raises pigs and other domestic animals that can  also transmit the leptospira.    In Havana Province, in particular, as one of the first steps  prior to discussing this plan for cleaning up the environment  and after the surveying that has been done in the different  municipalities, we have begun implementing a plan to eliminate  rats. This plan basically entails diminishing the number of  rodents in the province and targets certain priority centers  such as cane camps, vacation time agricultural labor sites, food  program camps, schools and health establishments, and centers  where food is processed and sold.

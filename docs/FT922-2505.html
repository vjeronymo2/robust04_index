			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / UN troops bring Sarajevo airlift one step closer UNITED Nations officials are expected to start demilitarising Sarajevo airport and its surroundings today provided the ceasefire enforced since Monday continues to hold. Once the area has been demilitarised, UN officials are hoping a 1,000 strong Canadian battalion can be deployed by Sunday to take control of the airport. This could then pave the way for airlifting food and medical supplies to the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo which has been besieged by Serb irregulars for the past ten weeks. Sarajevo radio reported the city was generally calm though snipers continued to intimidate the population. Two foreign journalists were wounded, one critically. There are fears the ceasefire could break down following an agreement between Croatian president Franjo Tudjman, and Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic on Monday. The presidents agreed to recognise each other's republics, exchange ambassadors, and seek military cooperation in the 'armed struggle' against the Serbs.' Mr Izetbegovic said he was seeking military co-operation with Croatia 'because we are fighting against the same aggressor - the Serbs.' UN secretary general Boutros Boutros Ghali yesterday confirmed that forces from Croatia were fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina, and appealed to Zagreb to withdraw them. The forces, grouped under the Croatian Defence Council (CDC), now control large parts of northern Bosnia, and western Hercegovina, eastern Bosnia, where thousands of Serbs have been forced to flee into neighbouring Montenegro. Western diplomats said that Serb irregulars and Serbia's proxy army in Bosnia, led by Mr Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic, will now have to decide whether to abide by the ceasefire. Mr Izetbegovic yesterday said the Moslems would never again sit with 'Serb terrorists' at the European Community- sponsored peace conference on Yugoslavia, which is expected to resume once Sarajevo airport is reopened.</p>

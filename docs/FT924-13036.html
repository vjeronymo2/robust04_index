			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Deep mine of discontent: John Major's decision to go for growth reflects the weakness of his position Here we go again. It is U-turn time once more. We have returned to the traditional methodology of so many post-1945 British governments: fly blind, and back off when you bump into a rock. Yesterday's 1 percentage point cut in interest rates, relief though it may be, was just such an instinctive response. The Bank of England signalled on Tuesday that no early reduction could be expected, but a handful of backbench Tory MPs indicated on Thursday that the government could lose a vote on pit closures. Bingo: 1 point off. Suddenly last week's protestation at the Conservative party conference in Brighton that reducing inflation would be the guiding star of economic policy became ancient history. The new reality is that the single question that the chancellor and the prime minister ask themselves is: 'What will put the government back on its feet?' (Answer: growth.) We have been here before  -in 1972 and 1974 under the then Mr Ted Heath and, in far worse conditions, in 1978-79 under the then Mr Jim Callaghan. That unfortunate pair discovered that once a government is on the slippery slope each successive attempt to save itself propels it into deeper trouble. It could be happening again. Yesterday's interest rate cut will not necessarily buy the votes of sufficient Conservative backbenchers, although you can never tell how many breast-beating rebels will live up to their pretensions when division-time comes. If true to form, some who say now that they will vote against will abstain next week; others will change their minds at the last minute. Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the powerful backbench 1922 committee, is huffing and puffing, but will he blow the house down? Maybe. If all the opposition parties remain united the government's pit closure programme could be stopped if it comes to a parliamentary stand-off next Wednesday. Only a dozen Tory votes against the government could scupper it. Of course if Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, perceives that humiliation is in prospect there will be no defeat. Instead there will be a U-turn of sorts  -perhaps an agreement to set up an inquiry into British Coal's redundancy programme. Mr John Major regards the prospect of any U-turn with abhorrence. Naturally. A defeat on coal would be devastating. It may not happen. But his problem is that every effort he makes to retrieve the authority lost on September 16 is thwarted, either by bad luck or by poor judgment. At Brighton he showed the doggedness for which he is justly renowned. His keynote speech seemed sufficiently patriotic to buy him time. He insisted that he would push the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty through the Commons. Perhaps the worst was behind him. That was, however, a whole week ago. Today, with everyone wringing their hands over the state of the economy, Brighton seems irrelevant. Earlier this week Mr Major and his colleagues talked down expectations of yesterday's summit of European Community leaders in Birmingham. When the communique came last night this humility was seen to be wise. Gestures were made towards clarifying the concept of subsidiarity. There was talk of more open procedures - an EC citizen's charter, shall we way. Reassuring language about national identity was used. We shall have to wait until the Edinburgh summit in December to see whether these comforting words turn into addenda to the Maastricht treaty. Yesterday's sideshow was at best a public relations coup for Mr Major. It will not in itself restore the prime minister's reputation. In short, our old friends, alarm and despondency, have come back to stay. It looks as if they will be around for more than a few weeks. Alarm arrived a month ago, with the collapse of the government's European and economic policies. It began to settle in soon afterwards, as it dawned upon the electorate that the prime minister and his colleagues are in a state of shock from which they will not quickly or easily recover. Despondency made its re-appearance this week, with the announcement that the bulk of the coal mining industry is to be shut down. This would have been an unpopular decision at the best of times. It came at the worst of times, as unemployment continues to rise and the recession seems endless. The nation's doubts about Mr Major's administration have boiled over into a widespread belief that the government is in control of nothing, least of all its own strategies. An outburst of anxiety expressed in many private conversations has been matched by unprecedented public hostility from the Conservative press. 'John Major presides over . . . a bankrupt, clueless, lying, incompetent, arrogant administration,' wrote the Sun's commentator yesterday. 'He is weak,' said The Times. The rest of the media, the bishops, and venerable institutions have joined in. Politicians, who are as human as the rest of us, are not invulnerable to such assaults. It is difficult to say which way Mr Major will now turn. The government is secure. The opposition has no believable alternative strategy. The prime minister seems likely to survive in office, if only for the lack of any other leader who could unite the party. The conventional wisdom is that he may restore public confidence in his government if he removes Mr Norman Lamont from the Treasury and puts in a chancellor who can successfully present the retreat from high interest rates as a coherent package of restructuring measures. Perhaps. The difficulty is that there are obstacles in the way of such decisive action. They are all internal to Mr Major, who dearly wishes to be regarded as consistent, even when flexibility is called for. He only changes course when forced to do so. He does not want to see a second close colleague driven out of office by a media campaign - which is reasonable enough. He is in thrall to cabinet heavyweights such as Messrs Michael Heseltine, Kenneth Clarke and Douglas Hurd; he has yet to rise above them. With an overall majority of only 21 he does not wish to risk a backbench revolt; nor has he shown that he has the self-confidence necessary to disturb the factional balance within a bitterly divided party. Bold pronouncements of new directions would therefore be out of character. Mr Major's strength is his attention to detail. He has not demonstrated an ability to stand back and review the broad direction of his government, nor does he enjoy sage counsel from an elder colleague, as Lady Thatcher did when Lord Whitelaw was still active. The prime minister's course is therefore clear. He will go for growth, bumping from wall to wall, turning this way and that, and we will be bumped along behind him.</p>

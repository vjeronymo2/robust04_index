			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In an interview from Lusaka today, Jorge Valentim,  head of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola  [UNITA] negotiating team, said his movement is not making  unjustifiable demands for government posts. He said there has  been an equivocation about what is happening in Lusaka.    [Begin recording] [Valentim] There has been an equivocation.  On 6 March 1994, the government made its third offer. The  first offer was made on 13 December, and the second on 27  February. On 6 March, the government offered us the Ministry of  Health, and we accepted it. It offered us the Ministry of  Tourism and Hotels and we accepted it. It offered us the  Ministry of Commerce and we accepted it. It offered us the  Ministry of Construction Materials, but we told them that there  was no such ministry. In fact, there are no installations,  stationery, furniture, or even mats. This is a ministry that  was supposed to be created from the existing Ministry of Public  Works. On 27 February, the government offered us the Ministry  of Public Works. So, we suggested a minor change. There are no  other ministries that UNITA is asking in addition to what the  government has offered us. To say that we are asking for key  ministries while we are trying to (?accommodate) the  government's offer, is completely wrong and is contrary to the  proposals [words indistinct] placed on the negotiating table.    [Unidentified correspondent] So, is that the only  outstanding  issue to be tackled at the Lusaka talks?    [Valentim] That is one of the problems. We will now deal  with the question of governors. We have (?stated) our position  [words indistinct] for the sake of national reconciliation. We  also want other provinces where we feel we have a role to play  regarding [words indistinct] Huambo and Benguela.    [Correspondent] What was the government's response?    [Valentim] Well, instead of discussing the issue clearly,  the  government is saying that we are exaggerating and [words  indistinct] we ought to clearly debate the issue.    [Correspondent] You have lost the elections [words  indistinct] the government has offered you several ministries  and provinces. How can you [words indistinct]?    [Valentim] I think that what is a stake here is not the  question of elections, but how to resolve national [words  indistinct] that could permit national reconciliation, otherwise  there would be no negotiations and offers. We are negotiating.  [end recording]</p>

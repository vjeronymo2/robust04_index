			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: National Grid charges may be cut OFFER, the electricity industry watchdog, is likely to force the National Grid Company to cut its charges to electricity consumers. The company may protest to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission if the move goes ahead. Reports that Offer planned to penalise the company, which owns and operates the electricity network of England and Wales, by tightening the regulatory formula that governs how it can increase its charges, were circulating in the City yesterday. This prompted falls in the share prices of the 12 regional electricity companies, which between them own the grid company. One analyst said that National Grid's profits could be trimmed by at least Pounds 10m a year if Offer did cut the charges. Exactly how much profits fall will depend on how much Offer tightens the formula, which at the moment allows the company to increase its charges - which are paid by all customers taking power from the system  - in line with inflation. Every 0.5 per cent below inflation meant another Pounds 10m off the company's bottom line, the analyst estimated. Offer, which has been reviewing the Grid's charges since late last year, is due to announce its decision shortly. 'I believe the price cap will be negative (or below the RPI index),' one analyst said. The pressure for the regulator to cut the National Grid's charges is considerable, because many large electricity users, and regional electricity companies, believe the Grid's charges are pushing up the price of electricity unnecessarily. Earlier this week, some members of the Major Energy Users Council, which represents large industrial electricity consumers, suggested that one way to help provide British industry with competitive electricity prices was to cut the Grid charges.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - Introduction (1): In season, pick with care / Sales of Pep plans are still rising. . . and they will continue to be a vital savings vehicle, says Barry Riley, provided they are used in the right way, by the right kind of people Personal equity plans are becoming a big business. From faltering beginnings in the late 1980s they have been clocking up new sales peaks each year in the 1990s; and during the current tax year ending on April 5 the number of general plans sold could hit the one million mark. Last year 770,000 general plans were sold, worth Pounds 3.12bn, together with 140,000 single-company Peps worth Pounds 370,000. The total value of old and new plans now in existence is a matter for guesswork, but, given the strength of the stock market in the past few years and the surge in recent sales, the total assets now held in Peps could easily be approaching Pounds 20bn. The fall in interest rates during the past few years has stimulated the marketing of Peps as a means of generating tax-free investment income, to the competitive disadvantage of the building societies. And the bull market in equities has provided the stimulus for demand which was sadly lacking in the early days, in the wake of the 1987 stock market crash. A clear indication of the way things have been going was provided by the unit trust sales figures for 1993. Unit trusts (and to a lesser extent their closed-end counterparts, the investment trusts) have been major beneficiaries of the 1992 concession which allowed these collective funds to make up a full Pounds 6,000 Pep, rather than only Pounds 3,000 as before. In the April-December period, sales of unit trust Peps were worth Pounds 2.4bn, a jump of more than 100 per cent on the figure for the same months of 1992. With the peak sales season now under way, unit trust Pep sales could reach something like Pounds 3.5bn for the fiscal year, and they are responsible for perhaps two-thirds of all new general Pep business. In turn, Peps accounted for as much as a third of the record Pounds 9.1bn of net sales by unit trusts in 1993. Evidently the tax advantages of Peps are being marketed to investors with enormous impact. For many investors there are indeed great benefits. But there are also doubts about how much of the tax advantage eventually comes through to the bottom line as far as the average saver is concerned. Peps are generally invested in risky assets, and the costs of the plans can be quite high. The original concept of the Pep was that it should be entirely invested in equities (UK, later extended to the rest of the European Union) and exempt from tax both on income and capital gains. Unlike the personal pension plan, the other significant long-term tax shelter, there is no income tax relief on payments into the scheme. On the other hand, the assets in a Pep can be realised at any time; whereas personal pension assets are locked away until retirement and must then be used, in the main, to buy an annuity. So a Pep is much more flexible. Moreover the relaxation of the Pep formula in 1992, which allowed up to half the assets to be held in fixed-income investments, has encouraged product innovation. The past year's big sales winner, for instance, has been the Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial Higher Income Plan, a controversial but cunning 'pepable' package designed to deliver 10 per cent tax-free income (albeit by more or less eliminating capital growth potential). For conventional plans, relying on both income and capital gains, the tax advantages must be carefully assessed. With the average dividend income on equities now well below 4 per cent, the benefit of standard-rate income tax exemption is less than 1 per cent a year, compared with a typical annual management charge of say 1 1/2 per cent (quite apart from the extra one-off front-end charge levied on initial purchase). In the circumstances, something of a price war has now broken out in the Pep industry. Peps are not subject to the same restrictions as unit trusts, and so alternative methods such as so-called 'exit' charges - that is, charges levied on withdrawals within three or four years - are being tried out. Savers should therefore keep their eyes open. The general advice is that, although unit trust Peps can be expensive, the charges are often no higher than on the underlying units. So if you are buying units in any case, it often makes sense to buy them in the Pep wrapper. But comparisons with Peps directly invested in shares can be complicated. There is also the obvious point that the tax savings will be considerably more valuable for people in the 40 per cent income tax bracket. As for capital gains tax, only about 125,000 individuals actually pay this levy at present, a small fraction of the number who are buying Peps. After all, gains of up to Pounds 5,800 in a tax year are anyway exempt (Pounds 11,600 for a married couple) so only people with quite large portfolios and making big transactions need worry. Successfully avoiding CGT, however, can involve complex bed-and-breakfasting of holdings and a nightmare of intricate inflation-adjusted arithmetic to work out potential liabilities. Alternatively, there is the Pep. The beauty of the personal equity plan is that the benefits of the tax shelter grow over the long term. For serious investors who intend to build up portfolios over many years, Peps should be regarded as providing a basic and essential element of their tax planning. Already investors who have been taking full advantage of their annual entitlements from the beginning have accumulated sizeable tax-exempt portfolios - which could easily be of the order of Pounds 100,000 for a married couple. At this level, the ability to switch investments freely, without regard to CGT considerations, becomes of considerable importance. Remember that tax savings worth just 2 per cent a year will roll up to a total extra performance of some 50 per cent after 20 years. So the important thing to bear in mind is that a personal equity plan has an indefinite life, subject no doubt to the inevitable political uncertainties in the long run. Once cashed in, Peps are gone for ever, but at the rate of Pounds 6,000 a year (and Pounds 9,000 including single company plans) they can provide an unrivalled framework for lifetime savings. Peps are not for everybody. But so long as they are used in the right way, by the right kind of people, they will continue to be a vital feature of the savings market.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- How they've caught on  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Year                     No of plans        Amount                              ('000s)     (poundsm)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- GENERAL PLANS 1987 (calendar year)             270           480 1988                             120           200 1989-90 (15 months)              580         1,600 1990-91 (tax year)               500         1,600 1991-92                          640         2,260 1992-93                          770         3,120  --------------------------------------------------------------------- SINGLE COMPANY PEPS 1992 (1st 3 months)              110           270 1992-93 (tax year)               140           370  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Inland Revenue  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

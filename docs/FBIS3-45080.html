In implementing the "Decision [of the Third Plenum of the  14th CPC Central Committee]," we will run into various kinds of  complicated conditions, various kinds of problems will arise,  and various kinds of conflicts will take place.    Reform has promoted the development of the productive  forces,  enabled the economy to develop in a good direction, and improved  the people's living standards. However, the reform itself will  inevitably involve a redistribution of interests, or a  redistribution of powers and interests if you like, and this  will involve the interests of many people. When enterprises  cannot disburse wages or borrow money to disburse wages, this is  a problem of the distribution of interests and will cause  trouble if it is not properly handled, and it is a real problem.    No stability, no nothing. Without a stable social  environment, nothing can be accomplished. Stability is the  social foundation for implementing the "Decision."    Some cadres lack an adequate understanding of the need for  stability at this time. We have indeed developed these years,  but we should prepare for danger in time of peace and have a  sober understanding of various conditions.    In conclusion, without a stable situation there is no point  in talking about anything.    So-called stability mainly refers to emotional stability  among the masses. The masses are the main body carrying out  reform, reform is a revolution, and the masses are the driving  force behind reform. We must listen to the opinions and calls  of the masses and respect their innovative spirit. Without the  support of the masses, even a better decision will not work.</p>

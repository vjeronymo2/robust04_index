			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Friendly letters give way to despair: Robert Taylor on the lack of trust in negotiations over the signal workers' pay claim The signalling dispute is turning into one of the most serious industrial conflicts for a long time. Yesterday's failure by the conciliation service Acas to find enough common ground between the two sides to bring them back to the negotiating table indicates that the railway network faces weekly shutdowns into the autumn. Only last Wednesday hopes started to rise for the settlement of a dispute that has started to exasperate both sides. The exchange of friendly letters between Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack chairman, and Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT's general secretary, seemed to suggest that the two would soon be back at Acas making a deal. It has not turned out that way. Seasoned Acas officials have given up in despair. Inevitably Railtrack and the RMT have different versions about what has been going on during the past few days. The company is convinced that the union has never been serious about having negotiations aimed at resolving the dispute. Management believes the union leadership is growing increasingly out of touch with the mood of the normally moderate signalling workers and the union is using the grievances of the men in a wider political game to undermine the privatisation of the railway network. The company says that it showed a willingness to move in the talks through Acas by even agreeing that some of the proposed 6 per cent unconsolidated pay supplement should be integrated into signallers' basic rates, a move it had resisted before. According to Mr David Armstrong, the company's chief negotiator, Railtrack also offered to have a week of non-stop negotiations on the entire restructuring package for signalling staff which, if successful, would have allowed the company to resolve the 'short-term payments problem'. The union has rejected such peace offers, insisting that the signalling staff claim for an interim payment must be settled before restructuring talks start. In the opinion of Railtrack the RMT has not moved an inch since the conflict started eight weeks ago. The RMT insists that it has put a number of proposals to Acas in the past few days that show the union is ready to be flexible. These included an attempt to persuade the company to set out the efficiency savings that would come from the specific proposals on changing working practices contained in its restructuring package. But Mr Vernon Hince, the RMT's assistant general secretary, said last night that Railtrack had 'never addressed our claim seriously since June 8'. The company's exasperation can be seen in its decision to heighten the public rhetoric. Railtrack plans to decide its next step later this week. The company said: 'We believe the RMT is out of touch with the views of their signalling staff.' That assertion may be tested soon. One option is for Railtrack to hold its own ballot of the men in dispute to find out what they think. For the first time yesterday Mr Armstrong said the offer was now a rise of 7.2 per cent on earnings for signalling workers between April 4 and October 1 and a restructuring payment from October 1 which would provide increases on basic rates of up to 26 per cent, giving overall earnings improvements of up to 10 per cent. These figures look more attractive than those of eight weeks ago. The union insists they have never been on the negotiating table. Once more the two sides seem unable to agree on basic facts. It is this lack of trust between the RMT and Railtrack that lies at the heart of the conflict, with the government shifting day-to-day between being intransigent and conciliatory.</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Damages awarded against Nissan UK: Ex-executive wins Pounds 804,860 for unfair dismissal DAMAGES of Pounds 804,860 were yesterday awarded against Nissan UK, the car distributor, after a High Court judge ruled that a former assistant managing director had been unfairly dismissed. The award is believed to be the largest in an employment action. Mr Stan Cholaj, now managing director of the importer-distributor company for Seat cars in the UK, won the damages after the judge had ruled that Nissan UK had breached his employment contract by reducing his responsibilities to cover only the sales of fleet cars. Mr Cholaj, who worked previously for Ford UK and Thorn EMI, left Nissan UK in June 1989 after clashing with Mr Octav Botnar, chairman and managing director of Nissan UK. Shortly before, Mr Botnar had failed to sell his Nissan UK company to Nissan Japan, the car manufacturer, and was trying to boost sales of the outdated Bluebird model to fleet operators. Mr Botnar relieved Mr Cholaj of most of his responsibilities and instructed him to concentrate on building fleet car sales - an area in which he had little previous experience. Mr Cholaj, who had been on a salary of Pounds 150,000 a year with a 10-year notice period, had said his appointment to fleet sales had undermined his authority and must have been intended to do so. He had rightly felt humiliated by Mr Botnar altering his job responsibilities, Judge Laurie said. Before taking the job, Mr Cholaj had known of Mr Botnar's autocratic management style - and having gone into the kitchen had to put up with the heat. However, his contract had been breached because the job of supervising fleet car sales was not in line with his status as assistant managing director, the judge continued. Mr Botnar had adopted a 'take-it or leave-it attitude' and made the issue a resigning matter.</p>

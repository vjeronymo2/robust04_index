			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Observer: Coups I have known At last Italians know whom to thank for saving their country from a bloody coup d'etat. Why, Umberto Bossi of course, founder of the populist Northern League. Not that anyone actually knew of a threat of armed rebellion until the loquacious Bossi spilled the beans to some hacks on Monday. Back in 1987, 300,000 warlike League supporters were poised to stream down from the valleys around Bergamo, a hitherto peaceful northern Italian town, and march on Rome. Their intent? To depose Socialist prime minister Bettino Craxi. Only the intervention of Bossi The Wise, preaching the wisdom of democratic opposition as the best tactic for unseating a corrupt old political regime, saved the day. Ecco, seven years later, Craxi is in exile in Tunisia, and the League is in government. Just a slight snag with this heartwarming tale. That year, the League polled fewer than 28,000 votes in the Bergamo area. Indeed, excluding old people and children, there were only 667,000 potential warriors living in the entire province. So how come this fearsome revolt passed unnoticed by either the local authorities or the bergamaschi themselves? Yesterday Bossi was furiously denying he had said anything of the sort. But it had been too good a story to miss and Bossi still graced the front page of almost every Italian newspaper, while the Bergamo magistrates duly opened a file on local armed uprisings of the late 1980s.</p>

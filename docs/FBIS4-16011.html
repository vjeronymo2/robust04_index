			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan told Director of the  IMF's European Department Muhammad Shatman that the government's  decision to re-start the Armenian nuclear power plant was due to  the absence of alternative ways of softening the energy crisis.    To quote Bagratyan, Armenia counted on international  financial organizations' aid in putting the nuclear power plant  back into operation.    Shatman said that the IMF's executive council did not object  to helping Armenia and that this position had been confirmed  during the executive committee's Washington conference involving  15 donor-states. He said those countries welcomed Armenia's  policy of economic reforms.    He pointed out, however, that aid to Armenia largely  depended  on the situation in the region. "The donor-states are expecting  meaningful progress in the settlement of the Karabakh conflict,  he said. IF Note: Local experts note that until recently the  IMF abstained from extending credits to Armenia fearing lest it  might be used for military purposes.</p>

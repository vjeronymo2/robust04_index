On Wednesday President Yeltsin dismissed Yablokov from the  post of advisor on environmental and health matters and  appointed him the chairman of a mixed environmental safety  commission of the Russian Security Council.    "That was my request, Yablokov stressed. Lately I could not  work effectively enough. I said that to the president, implying  that he did not take much interest in environmental matters  either." Yablokov said that the decisions of the mixed  commission will be compulsory for discussion, unlike the  recommendations of a presidential advisor.</p>

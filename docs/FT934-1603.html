			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: Westmont excluded from oil auction Malaysian company Westmont Holdings, one of three foreign groups which submitted bids for 40 per cent of Philippine oil refiner and distributor Petron Corp, has protested its exclusion from the auction, Reuter reports from Manila. The group's local representative, Mr Manuel Estrella, said Westmont would contest the decision by the Philippine National Oil Co rejecting their bid without explanation. The Saudi Arabian Oil Co (Aramco) won a 40 per cent stake in Petron after bidding Dollars 502m or Dollars 62m above the minimum price of Dollars 440m. The Malaysian national oil company Petronas bid Dollars 421m. Monico Jacob, president of PNOC, Petron's parent company, said on Wednesday the auction committee returned Westmont's bid unopened after it failed to meet pre-qualification or technical requirements.</p>

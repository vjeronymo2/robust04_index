			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Economics Notebook: Why realignment should not block EMS reform What looked like a perfectly horrible week for Mr Norman Lamont, the UK Chancellor, has suddenly become more promising. Having failed so far to produce economic recovery at home, he was due to head for Washington later this week with the seemingly impossible goal of resuscitating economic policy coordination among the leading industrial democracies. Before yesterday's ERM realignment - and the even more striking announcement of an imminent cut in German interest rates - next weekend's meeting risked achieving a hollow victory. One similar, in fact, to that attained at the informal meeting of European Community finance ministers and central bank governors a week ago in Bath. If anything, the four point statement agreed in Bath to stand by existing parities in the European Monetary System exacerbated tensions in the system once the perception grew that the German Bundesbank was less than wholehearted in its support. Without yesterday's announcement, Mr Lamont would have had to face the problem of arriving in Washington as chairman of the EC finance ministers' council, to represent a continent with its monetary policies in disarray. The meeting would be one at which neither the US nor Japan, the other two main players, would want to commit themselves to policy change. The biggest problem bedevilling world monetary relations has been the large 6.75 per cent differential between official US and German short-term interest rates. The US, with a presidential election less than two months away, has shown no signs of wishing to abandon the flexibility that has allowed it to push its discount rate to a 29-year low of 3 per cent in a bid to stimulate its economy. In Bath, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, offered no hope of an immediate cut in German rates. Over the past week, it appeared that Mr Schlesinger was extremely displeased at the way the chancellor appeared to hype the Bundesbank's Bath promise not to increase its interest rates 'in present circumstances' into a victory for UK monetary diplomacy. That left Mr Lamont preparing to deliver a gloomy message at the G7: the increasingly bleak outlook for economic activity in the western world; the problems caused by inappropriate mixes of fiscal and monetary policy in both the US and Germany; and the hazards lurking behind the dollar's recent sharp fall. Yesterday's surprise move may ease currency market tensions in the short run, and will certainly restore his battered confidence. But he will have to admit, if only to himself, that his main problems lie not with the G7 but - still - with the EMS, on which the UK government has staked Britain's economic future. Measured against the terms of its prospectus, the EMS has performed abysmally recently. It was conceived in the summer of 1978 to create 'a zone of monetary stability in Europe'. One of the main reasons for its creation was a desire to protect Europe's economy from a weak dollar. The detailed negotiations that preceded the launch of the EMS in March 1979 were specifically intended to prevent it becoming a D-Mark zone. After the last big realignment of EMS currencies in 1987, new rules - the so called Basle-Nyborg agreement - were introduced to ensure that countries with virtuous economic policies (which at the time meant Germany) were not penalised in periods when the system was under strain in financial markets. Inevitably some of these goals have been altered or fudged over time. In particular, the worry about D-Mark dominance gave way to an acceptance that the D-Mark, as the most stable of Europe's currencies, should be the 'anchor' of the system. But now that the strains of German unification have been grafted on to the EMS structure as it emerged from the Basle-Nyborg discussions, the EMS has failed to deliver the promises in its prospectus. The recent exchange market turbulence and pressure on interest rates shows how it has been unable to act as a zone of monetary stability in Europe. It has not protected Europe from dollar weakness. The dominance of the D-Mark has been as strong as ever - a factor emphasised by last night's developments. Yet because the D-Mark has been unable to provide the low inflation standard that the system needs, countries with virtuous economic performances such as France, Denmark and Ireland, have been penalised. This latter phenomenon made the latest EMS crisis so different from previous episodes of strain in the ERM and in its 1970s forerunner the European currency 'snake'. In the past countries have also been forced to devalue, push interest rates to usurious levels and - in the case of the snake - quit the system. Disruptive though these episodes were, it could always be argued that the root causes of the problems lay with the countries in trouble. That was case with Italy. Until last night, the only penalty paid by Germany, in spite of its inflationary pressures, huge budget deficits and growing political and social weakness, had been a substantial increase in its foreign currency reserves through the forced purchase of Italian lire at the lower EMS intervention point. Admittedly, recent EMS problems are not wholly the fault of Europe's monetary policymakers or the Bundesbank. Financial markets have a lot to answer for. In a world where information travels at the speed of light, understanding seems still to spread at the speed of sail. The D-Mark's strength takes account of past glories and the fact that it has never been devalued, rather than Germany's problems now. Ministers are likely to portray last night's developments as a huge achievement. But although the EMS now looks better placed to survive next Sunday's French referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, it remains at risk. Mr Lamont, as president of the EC finance ministers' council, could do worse than order a thorough study of how it can be restored to a zone of monetary stability.</p>

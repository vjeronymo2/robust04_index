			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Orlov article: "Its Effectiveness Is Beyond Doubt, </F> But Could Be Increased"]    [Text] Will the Social Accord Treaty, which was opened for  signing 28 April 1994, be productive? A section of the  political forces and the mass media answered this question in  the negative, asserting that no real mechanisms exist for  implementing this document. In our view this is not so. For  all its outward lack of conflict and its "smoothness," the  treaty imposes quite definite obligations on the parties to it.    The Federation Council and the State Duma, for example, have  clearly defined the contents of the legislative acts which will  be adopted in the very near future: a constitutional law on the  government, a law on the budget, civil and land codes, a code of  labor laws, tax and banking legislation, laws on the minimum  living wage, on the delimitation of jurisdiction and powers  between the Russian Federation and its components, on local  self-management, on the fight against crime and corruption, and  on benefits for scientific, cultural, educational, and health  care establishments (Paragraph 3 Section 2, Paragraph 2 Section  3, Paragraph 1 Section 5, and Paragraph 5 Section 6 of the  Social Accord Treaty). This predetermines parliament's stable  and constructive work style.    The toughest restrictions have been placed on the trade  unions. Their obligation "not to hold or participate in the  organization of strikes for the purpose of redistributing budget  funds or allocating to individual sectors or territories  subsidies or benefits relating to state credits or taxation..."  (Paragraph 4 Section 2 of the treaty) signifies the end of  "solidarity strikes," which have had such a negative effect on  the socioeconomic and political situation in the country.    At the same time the obligations assumed by the government  and the associations of entrepreneurs and commodity producers  are clearly nonspecific and therefore inadequate. This was  precisely the reason why many potential supporters of the Social  Accord Treaty did not participate in the assembly's work. How,  then, can the treaty's provisions be concretized so as to make  them considerably more effective?    World practice in such agreements (which attests,  incidentally, that the Social Accord Treaty is not the fruit of  office creativity by the President's Administration) attests to  the need for rigid concretization of measures implemented within  the agreement's framework, with an indication of deadlines.  Thus, within the framework of the economic stabilization law  adopted by the U.S. Congress in August 1971 R. Nixon's  administration undertook the following measures on the basis of  agreements with employers and labor unions: In August 1971  prices and wages were frozen by the government for 90 days.  Thereafter it was permitted to increase them under government  control -- prices by 2.5 percent, wages by 5.5 percent a year.  At the third stage all restrictions were made voluntary, while  retaining state arbitration. Finally, the fourth stage, whose  implementation was completed by May 1974, proposed the  restoration of the practice of a controlled increase in prices  and wages. The implementation of the "social contract" in  Britain was different. In the summer of 1975 this agreement was  concluded between H. Wilson's government and the trade unions  for a period of two years. The trade unions voluntarily pledged  to limit their wage increase demands to 10 percent a year in  exchange for specific promises by the government to curb the  inflation index. Of course, in both the aforesaid situations  not all the proposed measures were fulfilled, but they had been  planned specifically and not in the form of phrases like  "develop the structural restructuring of ecopolitics" (Paragraph  1 Section 2 of the Social Accord Treaty).    So, specificness is the feature which is so lacking in the  agreement which has been opened for signing. The elaboration of  the economic appendix to it, clearly recording the obligations  of the government, the entrepreneurs, and the trade unions in  respect of macroeconomic indicators, will make it possible, in  our view, not only to expand the circle of "signatories" --  after all, this is not that important -- but also to create real  conditions for stabilizing the situation in the country.</p>

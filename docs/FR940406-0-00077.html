			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) When real property is conveyed as described in paragraph (e) of this section, the Department of Defense shall generally share in the division of future profits should the property be subsequently sold or leased. The division of profits shall be based on net profits and the share shall generally favor the local redevelopment authority. There shall be a 15-year time limit on the share of the profits. The government's portion of the receipts from the profit shall not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time it was conveyed to the local redevelopment authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Properties conveyed under the authority of Pub.L. 103&hyph;160, section 2903, to local redevelopment authorities under an economic development conveyance that are subsequently sold or leased shall be subject to recoupment (profit sharing) by the Department of Defense, except as provided in paragraph (e)(6) of this section. In the absence of a determination by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned that a different division of the net profits is appropriate because of special circumstances, the net profits shall be shared on a basis of 60 percent to the local redevelopment authority and 40 percent to the Department of Defense. The purpose of this recoupment policy is to allow the local redevelopment authority to benefit from the success of its efforts and from value created from zoning. Eliminating the requirement for initial consideration also frees the local redevelopment authority's income stream for use in funding infrastructure improvements needed to develop the property and increase its value. Sharing the profits, when they occur, will provide a return to the taxpayers for the property they originally paid for, without unduly burdening the community. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The total recoupment by the Government shall not exceed the fair market value of the property (or the top end of the range of values) calculated at the time of conveyance to the local redevelopment authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The standard excess profits covenant promulgated by the General Services Administration (GSA) at 41 CFR 101&hyph;47.4908 shall be used as a model deed provision to implement this recoupment policy, recognizing that the GSA provision will require tailoring for each parcel. The following changes and additions are required: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The deed provision will express the profit sharing established under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, unless explicitly modified by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The term of this deed provision in economic development conveyances will be 15 years unless released earlier by the government upon satisfaction of the recoupment requirement. The disposing Military Department will provide a statement, for use at any settlement, on the local redevelopment authority's compliance with the deed provision. The Military Department will formally release the provision when the government has received its share of the sale proceeds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The deed provision will forbid ``straw'' transactions (sales or leases to a cooperating party at a nominal price), transactions at other than arm's length, and other devices designed to circumvent the Government's recovery of its share of the net profits. The purpose of this clause of the deed provision is to provide a basis for the government to intervene if it appears that a transaction may adversely affect its interests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) In calculating the amount of any net profit from a sale or lease, the local redevelopment authority may include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Capital costs, as provided in 41 CFR 101&hyph;47.4908(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Direct and indirect costs related to the particular property and transaction that are otherwise allowable under 48 CFR part 31 including the allocable costs of operation of the local redevelopment authority with regard to that property. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) The annual report required by the GSA provision will be deleted, and a clause requiring notification to the disposing Military Department of sales or leases will be substituted. The notice of sale or lease will be accompanied by an accounting or financial analysis indicating the net profit, if any, from a sale, or the estimated annual profit from a lease. The accounting or financial analysis, and any other aspect of a transaction by the local redevelopment authority with respect to property transferred under this part, is subject to Department of Defense audit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

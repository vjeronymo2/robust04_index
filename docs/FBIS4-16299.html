			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Leonid Nikitinskiy report: "Gorbachev Satisfied With His </F> Position"]    [Text] Mikhail Gorbachev assembled a small group of  journalists at his foundation to mark the 100th birthday of  Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev. Khrushchev, in the estimation of  Gorbachev, who began his party career under him, was an  inconsistent and limited reformer, but nonetheless sincerely  attempted to liberalize the totalitarian Stalinist system. From  a subjective angle, it is possible to discern power struggle  motives in his actions, but his speech against Stalin soon after  the latter's death while his henchmen were still alive demanded  great courage on Khrushchev's part, in its consequences "exposed  the personality cult," and proved to be far more significant  than simply intrigue.    This conversation was interesting to journalists in the  light  of the biography of Gorbachev himself, since he quickly passed  from the "palace coup" of 1964 to 1991, when via similar  apparatus means Gorbachev himself was twice removed from power:  the first time in August -- unsuccessfully, the second, in  December -- successfully. The ex-USSR president, who is now  unlikely to be brought as a witnesses in the "SCSE [State  Committee for the State of Emergency] case," imparted many  details of the events, emphasizing the role of Boris Yeltsin in  their development. It will soon be possible to read about this  in Gorbachev's memoirs, which he has recently sent to his  publishers.    In their questions the journalists tried to prompt their  interlocutor further to project the recurring model of the  "palace coup" onto the present day, onto the potential threat of  the removal of President Yeltsin from real power. However,  Mikhail Gorbachev did not wish to delve into even a theoretical  analysis of this possibility. For all his undisguised negative  attitude toward Yeltsin, Gorbachev does not allow himself to  entertain the idea of his removal from power by other than legal  means, through elections, which, however, in his opinion, could  take place before 1996.</p>

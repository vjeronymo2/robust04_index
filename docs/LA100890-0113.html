			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SUPPORT GROWS FOR A TAX TRADE;  </P> <P> DEFICIT: AS TALKS WEAR ON, HOUSE REPUBLICANS ENDORSE A POSSIBLE COMPROMISE THAT  WOULD RAISE RATES FOR RICH IN EXCHANGE FOR CUTS IN CAPITAL GAINS.  </P> <P> With much of the government shut down for lack of funds, congressional leaders  struggled through the day Sunday to win bipartisan support for a new deficit  reduction package to replace the $500-billion plan that was rejected by the  House on Friday.  </P> <P> In a development that could break the budget logjam and reopen government  offices, House Republicans overwhelmingly endorsed suggestions for a compromise  that would raise income taxes on the very rich in exchange for a reduction in  capital gains tax rates.  </P> <P> The straw vote -- which came in a closed caucus called to explore GOP sentiment  for striking a new budget deal with the Democrats -- marked a stunning reversal  of the hard-line approach that GOP leaders had taken at the negotiations that  produced the earlier budget pact.  </P> <P> It was not immediately clear, however, how quickly any such compromise could be  put together. Democratic leaders said consideration of such a tax trade-off  would have to wait until congressional committees take up details of any new  package later in the week.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the Democrats pushed a new plan of their own aimed at  softening proposed Medicare cuts and shifting tax increases more toward the  wealthy. But they said their own proposal would contain few specifics, leaving  details for congressional committees to work out.  </P> <P> The Democratic plan also would reduce the extra share of Medicare costs that  the program's beneficiaries would have to pay to only $12 billion over five  years instead of $30 billion -- a move designed to gain crucial support of the  elderly, who had protested the earlier plan.  </P> <P> Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle had been especially leery about angering  senior citizens, who constitute a potent bloc of voters in congressional  elections, now less than a month away. Last week's plan sparked a barrage of  phone calls and telegrams from the elderly.  </P> <P> House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) expressed hope that a new budget  outline would be ready for action by the House late Sunday, in time to go to  the Senate for a vote today.  </P> <P> If a new package is adopted, the leaders then will seek to pass a separate  stopgap funding measure, needed to reopen government agencies before Tuesday,  when workers end a long Columbus Day weekend. Without such a resolution, most  federal workers would be sent home.  </P> <P> President Bush successfully vetoed a similar stopgap measure on Saturday and  selectively closed down a number of government operations, saying that he  wanted to keep the heat on Congress to approve a new deficit-reduction plan.  </P> <P> His action ignited partisan warfare on Capitol Hill, as the House failed by six  votes to override the veto.  </P> <P> Foley, who pleaded with Bush not to force a confrontation that might destroy  chances for a new bipartisan budget, vented uncharacteristic fury over the veto  Sunday, even as he sought to reach a new compromise with Republicans.  </P> <P> He accused Bush of "creating a crisis that is totally artificial," charging  that "We're injuring innocent people" affected by the shutdown.  </P> <P> "It's like saying we ought to rebuild the fiscal house of this country and he  sets the House on fire for awhile to get our attention," Foley complained.  </P> <P> Foley also sought to assuage rank-and-file Democratic lawmakers, who had been  angered by the fact that they were left out of the 4 1/2-month-long  negotiations between congressional leaders and top Bush Administration  officials.  </P> <P> Meeting with reporters in an ornate lobby off the House floor, he pointedly  noted that the new package was being drafted without any formal negotiations  with White House officials -- though he conceded that they were being kept up  to date informally.  </P> <P> He also insisted that the Democrats' new budget plan is aimed at "appealing to  members of both parties. It reduces the increased cost in the Medicare program  and provides a more equitable and fair distribution of taxes."  </P> <P> He said the plan would contain aggregate figures for reducing spending and  increasing taxes but details would be left up to committees -- mainly the House  Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee.  </P> <P> "There's not a dime's worth of tax increases -- not 10 cents' worth of cuts in  the budget resolution," he said. "It allows the committees to consider these  issues."  </P> <P> But that is just the thing that appears to concern Republicans the most. Many  minority party members voiced fears Sunday that if the details of the plan are  left to Democratic-controlled committees, the final package will not curb  spending enough to keep tax increases to the bare minimum.  </P> <P> "I've got reservations about referring details to my committee," said Rep. Bill  Archer (R-Tex.), top-ranking Republican on the tax-writing Ways and Means  panel. "We're out-numbered, 23 to 12."  </P> <P> Added Rep. Jack Buechner (R-Mo.): "We may get a bone out of the Democrats but  certainly not a five-course meal."  </P> <P> As behind-the-scenes negotiations wore on Sunday night without any sign of  agreement, Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) pressed for a stopgap spending  bill that would impose $40.1 billion in across-the-board cuts until Congress  can produce a permanent budget.  </P> <P> Normally mild-mannered, Foley erupted in fury at Gingrich's suggestion that  Congress was blocking a deal that would allow government operations to resume  by refusing to cooperate with the White House.  </P> <P> "Of all the people in this House, in this country, that has little claim to  cooperating with his President, it is the gentleman from Georgia," Foley  declared to cheers and applause from fellow Democrats.  </P> <P> Within minutes, House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) stormed onto  the floor to announce that he had been waiting for the last six hours in the  office of Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell of Maine with Senate budget  negotiators from both parties, but that no House Republican had shown up.  </P> <P> "I hope that someone would come from your side," Gephardt told GOP members, "so  that what the President has asked us to do for five months (and) yesterday and  today -- to get a budget resolution" can be done.  </P> <P> At their own caucus Sunday, Republicans debated whether to continue seeking a  compromise with the Democrats or instead to adopt a strategy of confrontation,  seeking to force Congress to enact deep spending cuts by persuading Bush to  veto appropriations bills deemed excessive.  </P> <P> House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.), one of those favoring a new  bipartisan accord, asked for a show of hands on a proposal to cut the tax on  capital gains to 20% -- from 33% now -- in exchange for boosting the ordinary  income tax rate on the wealthy to 32% from 28%.  </P> <P> Republican leaders said the plan -- which they said would reduce the deficit by  $13 billion over five years -- drew surprising support.  </P> <P> "There was at least a two-thirds majority for it," Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa) told  reporters later. "I think the leadership was stunned."  </P> <P> In recent days, even conservative Republicans such as Gingrich, who originally  opposed income tax hikes, have shown a willingness to consider such a tax swap  in hopes that lower capital gains rates would help stimulate the ailing  economy.  </P> <P> However, White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu said Sunday that the  Administration still opposes raising the top income tax rate. "We think we  ought to draw the line on tax rates and not raise the rates," he said on CNN's  "Newsmaker Sunday" program.  </P> <P> Sununu, obviously rankled that Gingrich had led a House GOP rebellion that  helped sink the original budget compromise, noted that it was Gingrich and  other Republicans who had insisted earlier on holding fast against any change  in income tax rates.  </P> <P> "This kind of flipping at this point on some of the specific markers that were  laid down is kind of surprising," Sununu said.  </P></p>

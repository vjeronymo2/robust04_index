			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 10 (XINHUA) -- China is going to launch  another 30 foreign satellites of different types from 1994 to  around the year 2000, a senior official announced here today.    Hui Yongzheng, vice-minister of the State Science and  Technology Commission, also said that China is researching and  fabricating a new generation of satellites, including the  large-capacity No. 3 Dongfanghong communications satellite and  the No. 1 multi-use earth resources satellite.    He revealed these plans at a news conference concerning the  ministerial conference on space applications for development in  the region of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and  the Pacific, which is to open in September this year in Beijing.    The official said that a series of China's Long March  carrier  rockets has been formed, and the type has been put into general  use and become standardized. It has also gone into mass  production.    "China has recently successfully launched the Long March-3A  carrier rocket, indicating the rocket not only can meet domestic  demands, but can also provide a wide range of services for the  international market," Hui said.    He revealed that China has been entering a new stage in  launching commercial satellites for foreign customers, with a  series of launching contracts being carried out.    He said that China will actively import foreign capital,  technology and management experience in a bid to speed up the  formation of the country's export-oriented space industry. The  export of civilian space technology and products will be  encouraged.    As to China's international cooperation in the space sector,  he said that China attaches special importance to developing  countries.    "China has signed governmental space pacts and key project  contracts with Brazil, India, Pakistan, Argentina, Iran and the  Republic of Korea," he said, adding that Sino-Brazilian  cooperation on the research and production of a resources  satellite is going smoothly.    China has also trained more than 40 space experts for Ghana,  Mongolia, Laos, Malaysia, Tanzania, Pakistan and Vietnam, he  said.    China each year invests about 400 million yuan in its  civilian space projects, he added. Now China's space industry,  with 100,000 staff involved, is available for research, design,  experimentation and fabrication of various satellites, carrier  rockets and other high-tech products.    He said that the Chinese mainland wants to promote exchanges  and cooperation with Taiwan in the space sector. The mainland  is holding a positive attitude towards cooperation in satellite  technology, ground systems, launch services and satellite  applications.    "However, up to now, there has been no substantial progress  in space cooperation across the Taiwan Straits," he said.    About sending men into space, he said that departments  concerned are organizing experts for discussion. But they have  to wait for a yes or no from the government.</p>

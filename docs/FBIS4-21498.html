			<p>BFN     [Text] Spindleruv Mlyn, East Bohemia, March 19 (CTK) --  Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said on Saturday [19 March]  that the Ministry of the Environment and the work of Environment  Minister Frantisek Benda were lacking in concept.    At a press conference during a meeting of the Executive  Council of Klaus' Civic Democratic Party (ODS), the prime  minister said he would therefore begin "fundamental discussions"  with the Christian Democratic Party (KDS) on solving the  problems in this area. Benda is a member of the KDS.    Following the dismissal of Deputy Environment Minister Petr  Gandalovic (ODS), the ODS has lost contact with this ministry,  Klaus said.    The Executive Council also appointed a committee to draft a  bill which would set a final limit on who would be eligible to  receive compensation for suffering endured during the communist  period.    ODS Chairman and Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus  emphasized  that the matter did not mean the end of general restitution of  property.    The committee will be headed by ODS Vice Chairman Jiri  Vlach.    Klaus said the number of cases concerning the redress of the  most serious grievances had passed its limit. "I fear that by  drawing things out extensively, we could reach the absurd  conclusion that every citizen was aggrieved during his life  under the communist regime," he said.</p>

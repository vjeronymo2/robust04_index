			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No reason for such fear Sir, In response to the letter from the self-proclaimed 'silent industrial majority' on supporting Europe (May 31), there is absolutely no evidence to support their fear that European employment legislation would lead to higher unemployment. In fact, the type of legislation proposed is a compromise that is less rigid than the legislation in existence in many European countries where unemployment is as low or lower than in the UK. And why would granting rights to employees, such as works councils, be damaging to competitiveness? Are we to believe that Germany and the Netherlands are not competitive? However, it seems that the industrialists are happy to keep alive the British tradition of social confrontation that has helped to wreck industry in the UK. Unfortunately for the silent majority, the European legislation is considered necessary precisely because, it seems, most industrialists do not recognise 'the responsibilities of industry to its employees'.

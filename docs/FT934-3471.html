			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (10): Suitable shoes for a Bimbo - Case study, how Stead &amp; Simpson trod the survival route Peter Gee, managing director of the traditional family shoe retailer, Stead &amp; Simpson, has put his career on the line for a Bimbo - and the board is delighted. The Bimbo in question may well have saved the 160-year-old company from extinction. It is insider speak for a management buy-in/buy-out, which involves both existing and outside managers. S&amp;S resorted to the transaction earlier this year, when it became apparent that this was the only way to survive. Four years under the ownership of property group Clayform Properties had squeezed both cash and investment at S&amp;S. 'We were looking at a blank wall,' says Mr Gee, whose family has been in the business since it was founded in 1834. S&amp;S's story in recent years makes unhappy reading. After years of independence as a solid, if somewhat dull company, Stead fell into the hands of aggressive developer Clayform Properties in 1989. Clayform was particularly attracted to S&amp;S's 110 freehold high street properties. Almost overnight, however, the property market collapsed. Clayform forced S&amp;S to enter into a series of sale-and-leaseback transactions, which provided instant cash for the parent, but left the footwear retailer exposed to the volatile rental market. When recession set in the following year, S&amp;S found investment in its own business virtually impossible. It was at this stage that Mr Gee, and Mr Martin Brayshaw, the finance director who came to S&amp;S with the takeover, realised that the retailer had to escape from Clayform's shadow to survive. In early 1992, they began to investigate the possibility of a management buy-out. By August they had a business plan and had recruited a team including a former British Shoe director to strengthen the merchandising division. There was only one problem. The oppressed retail sector had fallen heavily out of favour with venture capitalists. S&amp;S had several characteristics which made it unattractive to potential funders. First, it had been making increasingly heavy losses for three years. S&amp;S would also need to invest in its business, with the return not immediately apparent. The lead time - the period between the design and sale of a product - is particularly long in the shoe industry. Finally, S&amp;S needed to be freed completely from the worries of funding debt, so it could focus on its products and presentation. Messrs Gee and Brayshaw found little sympathy for their plight with potential City financiers. 'They were chiefly looking at a company where they felt they could hold the sales line and cut out a load of costs to get profits,' says Mr Gee. 'But we had cut and cut costs as part of Clayform.' S&amp;S could cut no further. Instead, 'what we had to do was drive sales forward.' Finally at the end of last year, S&amp;S was introduced to venture capitalist Apax. Here, almost unbelievably, S&amp;S found ready listeners. Apax had been on the lookout for a retailing investment. 'Our view was that it was a good time to go back into the retail sector, the shoe sector in particular,' says Mr Cyril Freedman, of Apax. After years of bloodletting, the UK shoe industry was beginning to show some signs of life. S&amp;S was attractive for several reasons: the well-known brand name and reputation for value; a focus on less fashion-conscious market towns; and strong administrative and financial controls. However, there remained the fact that S&amp;S's unusual needs made it something of a gamble. For Apax, the only way to reduce the risk was to add new management and demand a greater equity stake, along with a higher than normal degree of financial commitment from the team. 'It was very important that the people involved had a lot to lose and a lot to gain,' says Mr Freedman. Enter S&amp;S's current chairman, Mr Ken Bartle, with retail experience, particularly in merchandising, covering Trueform, Freeman Hardy Willis and Lilywhite's. He replaced one of the original team, at Apax's request. The revised management team was then asked to put up Pounds 500,000 to back Apax's Pounds 4m investment. Apax would get a 70 per cent stake in return. Clayform, anxious to reduce its debt, sold the S&amp;S business and Pounds 3.5m in borrowings for Pounds 1. Apax's investment was used to pay off the debt and clear the overdraft. By the middle of May, S&amp;S was ready to start its new life with cash of Pounds 750,000 and banking and credit facilities of Pounds 1.75m. Although these are still early days and cash is still tight, S&amp;S's management is convinced the Bimbo has done its work. It has given S&amp;S the headroom to focus on longer-term investment, while also dealing with the day-to-day battle in the high street. Apax and the management have even put up further funding for S&amp;S to purchase 22 more retail outlets. Apax, for its part, is looking to stay with S&amp;S for at least three to four years. At that stage, the footwear retailer that fell for a Bimbo may well return to the market.</p>

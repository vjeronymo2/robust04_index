			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Uncertainty hits Italian financial markets The accuracy of the Italian rumour mill has proved to be a double-edged sword for the Italian government bond market. On Monday, before the official results of the election were made public, both the bond and stock markets rallied sharply on speculation that Mr Silvio Berlusconi's right-wing Freedom Alliance would achieve an outright victory in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies. The June contract of the 10-year Italian government bond future on Liffe, which is seen to be a good barometer for the underlying cash market, surged by nearly three points to 112.67 on Monday, but since then it been unable to build on these gains. Yesterday afternoon the contract traded at 111.27, up just over one point on the day. Analysts hold out three reasons for the market's failure to make further gains in the wake of the elections. Firstly, the sharp gains achieved at the start of the week and the strength of the lira against the D-Mark has prompted a wave of profit-taking by speculators who had bought Italian bonds in the weeks leading up to the election in the hope that Mr Berlusconi would come out on top. 'These professionals are closing out their positions and this will put downward pressure on bonds and the lira,' says Mr Troy Bowler, international strategist at PaineWebber in London. Secondly, the market could face up to three weeks of uncertainty as Mr Berlusconi attempts to iron out differences between his two coalition partners, the Northern League and the MSI/National Alliance, in order to form a strong government. Thirdly, the bond market is worried about the possible adverse effects of Mr Berlusconi's tax-cutting policies on Italy's runaway budget deficit and on inflation, which could in turn force up interest rates. Mr Bowler notes that Italy's budget deficit for 1994 has already overshot its target of L145 trillion (Pounds 58.7bn) by L15 trillion. 'It is not clear whether there is the political will to present a mini-budget in order to bring the deficit back on target.' Other analysts believe that although the uncertainty is far from resolved, the risks are worth taking. Mr Julian Jessop, economist at Midland Global Markets in London, says that the most likely scenario is that Mr Umberto Bossi, the leader of the Northern League, will come to an agreement with Mr Berlusconi. 'A good general rule with any politician is to watch what they do and where their interests lie and not what they say,' says Mr Jessop. Mr Jessop also believes that a right-wing government is not a threat to economic reform and that in some aspects, such as privatisation, reform could be accelerated.</p>

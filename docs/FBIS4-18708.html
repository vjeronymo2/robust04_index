			<p>BFN     [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the chairman of the Russian  Liberal Democratic Party, who has constantly tried to draw  attention to himself while in Finland, left Finland at 1200.  Before he left, he had time to give a lecture on his policies  lasting nearly two hours to foreign correspondents working in  Helsinki. Zhirinovskiy's main message this time was that the  West should keep its hands off Russia. He considers himself to  be the savior of Russia. Sinikka Siekkinen has been following  Zhirinovskiy's visit to Finland.    [Siekkinen] During his visit, Zhirinovskiy has been busy in  different parts of Helsinki and given controversial statements,  sometimes at a striptease night club and sometimes at the grave  of Mannerheim. Immediately after his arrival, Zhirinovskiy  threatened Estonia with occupation and Finland with nuclear war,  but official Finland kept quiet on Zhirinovskiy's statements.  This is how Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto answered my  question today.    [Begin recording] [Siekkinen] Is Finland cringing before  Zhirinovskiy when Finland has not officially reacted to his  statements?    [Haavisto] In my view he has been here as the guest of the  Eduskunta, and in my view the Eduskunta should take  responsibility for his visit here and his possible statements.  [end recording]    [Siekkinen] Zhirinovskiy, who is experienced as a  troublemaker, has been banned from several countries, but  wherever he is, he raises curiosity. At the news conference  this morning, many had come to listen to Zhirinovskiy in order  to try to understand his line of thought. Zhirinovskiy rewarded  his listeners by giving a fairly comprehensive but confusing and  controversial review on the aims of his policies. The starting  point of his policies is that Russia has been betrayed three  times this century: First during the Russian Empire, then during  communism, and now during the so-called democracy, however, this  time without weapons. Zhirinovskiy will not tolerate a fourth  time.    [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording in Russian fading to English  translation] Either the West leaves us alone and we take care of  our own problem and solve our own problems. [end recording]    [Siekkinen] He urged the West to keep its hands off Russia,  because according to Zhirinovskiy, Russia can solve its problems  itself and if the West does not realize this, the disintegration  of Russia will continue and there will be a third world war.  Zhirinovskiy regards himself as the savior of Russia with a  historic mission. The greatest threat to Russia comes from the  south, where there are 400 million Muslims. Zhirinovskiy  regards them as barbarians who also threaten Western Europe  unless he and Russia stop the south, with nuclear arms, if need  be.    [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording in Russian, fading to English  translation] I am against using, I am an opponent to the use of  any kind of weapons, whether it be nuclear or conventional but  [words indistinct] the interest of Russia. [end recording]    [Siekkinen] Zhirinovskiy says that he is against the use of  any kind of weapons, but if Russia is threatened, it has the  right to use all kinds of weapons it has, including nuclear  weapons. After these statements Zhirinovskiy left for home to  solve the problems of his own parliamentary group. Yesterday,  two members of his parliamentary group resigned, tired of  Zhirinovskiy's policies.</p>

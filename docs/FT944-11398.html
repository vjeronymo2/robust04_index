			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / I did it my way, says Carlos Salinas: Mexican president tells Damian Fraser law and social security problems are his only regrets With less than a month to go before his six-year term as Mexico's president finishes, Carlos Salinas says he only has two regrets: that he failed to reform the country's judicial system and to overhaul its near-bankrupt social security institute. 'I did not have time to carry these reforms out,' he said in an interview in Los Pinos, the presidential home. The difficult economic situation, partly a result of the delay in passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, postponed reform of the social security institute, he said. The murder last year of the Roman Catholic Cardinal of Guadalajara and the subsequent presidential election campaign, it is understood, put off planned changes to Mexico's notoriously corrupt and inefficient judicial system. These regrets aside, Mr Salinas asserts that he would not have done anything differently. He defends his pro-market economic policies as having laid the groundwork for sustainable growth, and for beginning to reduce Mexico's sharp inequalities in income. He argues that the rhythm of political reform was determined by the need to achieve consensus across the political parties and avoid instability, but the August presidential election was 'a victory for democracy'. One of the three declared candidates to head the incipient World Trade Organisation, Mr Salinas has the backing of the US, Canada, and all of Latin America. However, he is reported to have less support than Mr Renato Ruggiero, the European Union candidate, who has been campaigning more actively than the Mexican president. Mr Salinas says that before a decision is taken on the leadership of the WTO post, more countries should approve the Uruguay Round deal of trade reforms. 'The key question is when will the US Congress ratify the Uruguay Round,' he says, with the answer in his view depending on the outcome of the US mid-term elections tomorrow. Anything that puts in doubt the Uruguay Round would 'open the door to commercial wars, which would be the worse scenario for the end of the 20th century.' Mr Salinas is keeping a careful watch on the US elections for another reason: US-Mexican relations are expected to come under strain if the state of California approves Proposition 187, which would deny illegal immigrants non-emergency public services. Mr Salinas reiterated his attack on the proposition, saying it wrongly blamed migratory workers for California's own internal problems, and was 'xenophobic'. Mexico's Foreign Ministry is preparing a series of responses in case the referendum is passed, he says. Discussing his own legacy, Mr Salinas says economic reform was already well advanced when he took office, which enabled him to move rapidly in this area from the moment he was elected president. Thus his first years in office were characterised by the debt reduction agreement, sweeping privatisations, economic deregulation, and the decision to negotiate a free trade agreement with the US and Canada. By contrast, he implies, Mexico's political system had been touched less by reform when he took over. 'Generally in Mexico the electoral structure was arranged, let us say, to guarantee a victory of the PRI,' he says. 'It would have been very tense' if he had sought to dismantle the old political system faster. What was important was that he 'succeeded in introducing political reforms in favour of democracy and pluralism without causing a rupture'. Mr Salinas accepts that electoral and political reform needs to go further. He supports making the electoral institute totally independent of the government. It would 'not be a bad idea' if the opposition was given control of congressional committees that oversee government spending. He claims, in an argument that would not convince members of the opposition, that there has not previously been a consensus on such reforms. Commenting on the judiciary and social security problems he failed to tackle, Mr Salinas says it gives him 'great pleasure' that Mr Ernesto Zedillo, his hand-picked successor, has pledged to address these issues. Mr Salinas says social security reform will need to address shortage of funds (the so-called actuary deficit) and separation of the accounts of those enrolled in the institute. Mr Zedillo has sketched his approach to judicial reform, which among other changes, would establish a civil service for judges to encourage professionalism and greater integrity. While publicly unwilling to admit as much, Mr Salinas is also almost certain to hand over to Mr Zedillo the problem of how to disarm and integrate into society the Zapatista rebels in the state of Chiapas. Mr Salinas promises he will look for a negotiated settlement in Chiapas until the day he leaves office. But with Zapatistas showing no interest in talks with the Salinas government, the chances of success are negligible.</p>

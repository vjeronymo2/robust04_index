			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special articles on establishing a bankruptcy mechanism </F> and improving it"--first paragraph is LIAOWANG editor's note]    [Text] [Editors note] As the main components of  China's publicly owned economy, quite a great number of large  and medium-sized state enterprises have long lacked  competitiveness and vitality, their economic returns are not  good, and their productivity is low. An important reason is  that no bankruptcy mechanism has been established. As a result,  enterprises which should go out of business are still operating,  enterprises which should be invigorated cannot be invigorated,  and factors of production which should be reorganized remain  stagnant, all causing idleness and a waste of resources and  hampering the improvement of overall economic returns. To  escape this predicament, there is a need to establish a  bankruptcy mechanism which conforms with the socialist market  economy so that the suitable survive, the inferior disappear,  and the superior develop. This will help ensure the rational  allocation of resources and promote healthy economic  development. For this reason, LIAOWANG has invited three  academics from the State Economic and Trade Commission who have  participated in revising the Bankruptcy Law to express their  views from different angles. Their views are full of insights  and are thus worth reading. [End editor's note]  <H5>  Present Situation and Difficulties Should Be Clearly </H5> Acknowledged-- by Di Na [3695 1226]    According to incomplete statistics, all levels of people's  courts have handled 948 bankruptcy cases since the formal  implementation of the Bankruptcy Law on 1 November 1988. Of  this, enterprise bankruptcy cases handled in the last three  years account for 86.36 percent, standing at 818. This  development trend indicates that the old structure's role is  gradually weakening in harboring old enterprises and that a  bankruptcy and elimination mechanism which corresponds with the  demand of the market economy is taking shape. Its main  characters are as follows:  <H5>  Bankrupt Large- and Medium-Sized State Enterprises Are </H5> Increasing    Surveys in Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Sichuan, Hubei, and  Jiangxi Provinces suggest that there have been medium-sized  state enterprise bankruptcy cases in these provinces. These  bankrupt enterprises' assets exceed 10 million yuan each and the  ratio between their assets and liabilities is 1:2.5 or 1:3.63.  The asset liquidation rate is over 40 percent in the three  southern provinces but is a little lower in northeast China.  Each of these enterprises has more than 1,000 employees and the  largest has almost 3,000; retired personnel account for more  than 20 percent of the total number of employees and the highest  was 43.13 percent. Following the increased reform impetus,  large and medium-sized state enterprises which have incurred  losses for a long time and do not have much hope of survival are  beginning to go bankrupt. Unlike small collective enterprises,  whose bankruptcy only has a superficial bearing, the bankruptcy  of large- and medium-sized state enterprises involves structural  adjustments, asset allocations, debt repayments, employment,  social relief, and other problems of a more profound and  extensive nature, such as the strict implementation of policies.  Obviously, there are more problems in handling these bankruptcy  cases.  <H5>  In Most Cases Debtors Apply for Bankruptcy </H5>   The Bankruptcy Law provides that both creditors and debtors  may apply for bankruptcy. But a survey indicates that almost  all bankruptcy cases are filed by debtors. This suggests that  the debtors have improved their understanding of protecting  their legitimate rights and interests by legal means.  Comparatively speaking, because enterprises lack the necessary  covert system, it is difficult for creditors (except for banks)  to know an enterprise's credit situation, so they do not know  how their rights and interests have been damaged. In addition,  because the liquidation rate of bankrupt enterprises is unlikely  to reach 100 percent, creditors are generally unwilling to apply  for bankruptcy. Subjectively and objectively, this has reduced  the possibility of creditors applying for bankruptcy. To  provide legal protection for creditors, it is imperative to  establish an enterprise bankruptcy warning system.  <H5>  The Greatest Creditors Are Banks </H5>   As "fund allocations have been replaced by loans,"  enterprises' funds mainly come from bank loans, thus banks have  become the biggest creditors. Since the introduction of banking  system reform, specialized banks have become commercialized and  are assuming sole responsibility for profits and losses, as  financial enterprises operate. Therefore, banks themselves will  also face the problem of removing their burdens.    According  to an estimate by the state specialized banks, of 2,400 billion  yuan in credit funds, almost 400 billion is dormant, accounting  for 16.7 percent. About 60 to 70 percent of bank credit funds  come from citizens' deposits. If losses are too serious, this  will affect the banks' reputation and even endanger social  stability. Therefore, a policy must be cautiously worked out in  full consideration of the banks' capacity. Moreover, the  introduction of bankruptcy will help the banks to free  themselves from their predicament and reduce losses to a  minimum. In this sense, bankruptcy also serves as a kind of  protection for creditors and is a practical choice for banks to  protect their legitimate rights and interests. In addition, in  raising funds through various channels, some enterprises have  opened accounts with many banks and engaged in duplicate  mortgaging; the department in charge of enterprises instructs  some enterprises with a good reputation to act as sponsors for  enterprises with a bad reputation to obtain bank loans, or  otherwise the department itself acts a sponsor, causing a number  of bankruptcy cases to be linked to sponsorship. Obviously, it  is imperative to improve the relevant mortgage and sponsorship  policies in implementing the Bankruptcy Law.  <H5>  When an Enterprise Announces Bankruptcy, the Government Is </H5> Ready To "Pick Up the Corpse"    An enterprise should abide by the law when announcing its  bankruptcy, but in the current situation it is difficult to  fully abide by the law. Therefore it is often the case that  "bankruptcy is combined with merging." Namely, before an  enterprise announces its bankruptcy, the government will appoint  another enterprise to merge with or buy it, and all levels of  courts have taken this as a precondition in handling bankruptcy  cases. A survey indicated that assets under bankruptcy are hard  to enliven and even harder to convert into cash. No one cares  about buying a bankrupt enterprise's special equipment, big  buyers are not willing to buy its general-purpose equipment, and  small buyers cannot afford this equipment, so it becomes a scrap  of iron if dismantled, and banks find it difficult to assess  prices. A bankrupt enterprise sets prices for its factories and  equipment and asks a bank to accept them in kind, but existing  policies do not allow the bank to deal in these factories and  equipment. If the bank wants to authorize a company to deal in  these factories and equipment, no go-between is available ; if  it wants to auction them off, there is no auction center.  Finally, the government has no alternative but to buy them. In  providing jobs for employees of bankrupt enterprises, most local  governments are still acting as "mothers." Providing jobs for  bankrupt enterprises' employees is carried out administrative  means: Either the government assigns these employees to other  enterprises or the department in charge and the labor  (insurance) department share the responsibility to provide jobs  to these employees. On this issue, local governments do not  know what to decide: If they assign these employees to other  enterprises, this will trample on those enterprises' autonomy in  recruiting employees and goes against the Regulations on  Transforming State-Owned Enterprises' Operational Mechanisms.  If they do not assign the employees, they will ask mayors for  help, because the labor force market is not yet mature. The  situation is a little better in South China, where many city or  prefectural authorities convert assets under bankruptcy into  cash and provide each employee with 15,000 to 20,000 yuan if  they want to look for a job themselves. If there is an  enterprise willing to accept the employee, money will be  provided to the recipient enterprise. A survey indicates that  more than 90 percent of such employees are willing to accept  this method.    Practicing bankruptcy and establishing a bankruptcy  mechanism  are important issues which are inevitable in the course of  deepening reform and forming a modern enterprise system.  However, viewing the current bankruptcy situation, it is quite  hard to practice bankruptcy and form a bankruptcy mechanism.  Policy research on bankruptcy should be aimed at the following  four points:    First, relief for employees and their job arrangements.    Providing relief for employees and rearranging jobs for them  are the most difficult problems state-owned enterprises face  after bankruptcy. Recently, the government pointed out that  after an enterprise announces bankruptcy, the money derived from  asset transfers and auctions should first be used for employee  severance pay, transfers to other jobs, training, and basic  livelihood. Transferring and auctioning assets will help resolve  relief funds for employees after bankruptcy. Practice has  proven that the government cannot wholly take care of a bankrupt  enterprises' employees. These employees should be given jobs in  a decentralized way in accordance with the "Regulations on  Placement Arrangements for State Enterprises' Surplus Staff  Members and Workers." Namely, surplus employees should be  treated as job-awaiting personnel according to society's  capacity. During the job-awaiting period, they are entitled to  job-awaiting insurance, and if this is not possible, cash  converted from the bankrupt enterprise's assets should be used  for placement arrangements. To reduce repercussions in society,  the department in charge will be responsible for providing  relief and making placement arrangements for a bankrupt  enterprise's employees before the social insurance system is  improved. Many methods can be used to resolve the reemployment  problem of bankrupt enterprise's employees, such as transferring  them in an organized way, allowing them to participate in  overseas labor service, recommending them to other enterprises,  providing for themselves by engaging in production, and looking  for jobs by themselves.    Second, definition of a bankrupt enterprise assets.    Whether or not a bankrupt enterprise's land, welfare  facilities, and employee-raised funds should be listed as assets  under bankruptcy is an important question. When an old state  enterprise goes bankrupt, the net value of its fixed assets is  very low, what is valuable is generally its land. Whether or  not its land should be listed as an asset under bankruptcy can  be determined by how the land was obtained. To put it more  specifically, if the land utility rights were obtained by  compensatory means, the land should be listed as an asset under  bankruptcy; if not, the land should in principle not be listed  as an asset under bankruptcy but should be returned to the  government to encourage other units to buy the whole bankrupt  enterprise. The bankrupt enterprise's schools, kindergartens,  employees' dormitories, and other welfare facilities should in  principle not be listed as assets under bankruptcy. These  schools and kindergartens will be recovered by the government  after being converted into cash, dormitories should be sold to  individuals or housing departments to clearly separate  management from ownership, employees involved in fund raising  will be reimbursed as creditors or shareholders.    Third, mortgaging assets under bankruptcy and converting  them  into cash.    Many enterprises have mortgaged their assets as security to  obtain bank loans. The Bankruptcy Law provides that "assets  mortgaged as security do not fall into the category of assets  under bankruptcy." Therefore many localities have pointed out  that if the bank does not give up its priority entitlement to  compensation, the enterprise actually has nothing to declare  bankrupt for. A survey indicates that the mortgage rate of many  bankrupt enterprises' fixed assets is as high as 100 percent.  When an enterprise faces bankruptcy, it may not be able to pay  bankruptcy expenses because it lacks adequate assets to pay.  This is a difficult problem to resolve in practicing  bankruptcy. In addition, some bankrupt enterprises are located  in remote regions and their utility is low. It is hard to  convert their assets and land utility rights into cash.    Fourth, sponsor-related responsibility.    How to handle sponsor-related bankruptcies is another  problem  in practicing the Bankruptcy Law. Because the practice of  sponsorship is not standardized, in particular administrative  sponsorship is quite common, we should consider classifying  sponsors' debt repayment obligations. 1) Administrative  sponsorship provided after the promulgation of the State Council  Office's "Circular on Banning Administrative Institutions From  Acting as Sponsors in Economic Activities" on 23 February 1993  must all be nullified. 2) A unit acting as an administrative  sponsor which has become a legal person entity is responsible  for the loan repayments it has committed to. 3) If a unit  acting as an administrative sponsor and which remains an  administrative institution cannot afford the loan repayments it  has committed to, a financial department will repay the loan or,  if necessary, money will be deducted from the institution's  wages and administrative expenditure as punishment.  <H5>  Removing Ideological Obstacles--by Zhang Delin (1728 1795 </H5> 7207)    Since the introduction of reform and opening up, many people  have gradually improved their concept about bankruptcy. On 2  December 1986, the National People's Congress Standing Committee  formally ratified the "PRC Enterprise Bankruptcy Law (for trial  implementation), which came into force on 1 November 1988. But  so far, the bankruptcy concept has not taken deep root in  people's minds and no bankruptcy mechanism has been established.  There are many reasons, but for now it is important to remove  ideological obstacles.  <H5>  Bankruptcy Is Not a "Unique Practice Under Private Ownership" </H5>   For a long period we have linked bankruptcy to the nature of  ownership and have regarded bankruptcy as an inevitable product  and even a unique economic phenomenon of private ownership or  the capitalist system and that it has absolutely nothing to do  with the socialist system. As a matter of fact, bankruptcy is  an inevitable product of competition under commodity economic  conditions; whenever there is commodity production and commodity  exchange, bankruptcy will occur in the course of this production  and exchange. Bankruptcy is linked to the commodity economy and  its relevant competition system, not to the nature of ownership.  China is establishing a socialist market economic structure.  Bankruptcy and the need to establish a relevant bankruptcy  system are the demands of a market economy. The problem now is  not whether or not bankruptcy and the establishment of a  bankruptcy system are necessary but how to practice bankruptcy  and establish a bankruptcy system which conforms with reform  targets and current national conditions.  <H5>  Practicing Bankruptcy and Establishing the Bankruptcy System </H5> Are Positively Significant    Theory and practice in a modern market economy have proved  that a competitive market economic structure is the most  efficient mechanism and system for resource disposition in the  modern human society. Bankruptcy is an outcome of competition  and is also the beginning of a new round of competition.  Generally speaking, a bankrupt enterprise is an enterprise with  improper management and administration which is falling behind  and should be eliminated. Allowing the deserving to survive,  eliminating the inferior, and developing the superior is where  the vitality of economic development lies and is also a symbol  of social progress. Therefore practicing bankruptcy and  establishing a relevant bankruptcy system have important  bearings on deepening state enterprise reform, on forming a  modernized enterprise system, on establishing a competition  mechanism, and on optimizing the allocation of social resources.    Practicing Bankruptcy and Establishing a Bankruptcy  System Are Needed To Establish a Modern Enterprise System    A review of state-owned enterprises' operations in China  suggests that only a small number of them are operating  normally, quite a few of them lack vitality and operate with low  efficiency, and some even find it hard to continue operations.  How should these state-owned enterprises free themselves from  their predicament? In terms of target formula, there is a need  to establish a modern enterprise system. In other words, there  is a need to establish an enterprise legal person system which  corresponds with a modern market economy and large-scale  socialized production, a limited liability system, and a  relevant organizational system and management system. In terms  of implementation measures and detailed methods, the process of  introducing a new enterprise asset system as well as its  responsibility, organization, and management systems is a  process of establishing a bankruptcy system. Loss-incurring  state enterprises should have their assets reorganized and  systems updated through bankruptcy. In this sense, the process  of reforming state enterprises and establishing a modern  enterprise system is also a process of establishing a bankruptcy  system. In other words, without bankruptcy and a relevant  bankruptcy system, it will be very hard to establish a  competitive microfoundation or macromanagement structure.  <H5>  Bankruptcy Is an Economic Activity in the Course of </H5> Competition and Is Also a Legal Activity Which Proceeds in  Strict Accordance With Law    In a sense, the process of practicing bankruptcy and  establishing a bankruptcy system is a process of formulating a  relevant legal system. Therefore, to promote the establishment  of a bankruptcy system in China, a bankruptcy law should be  formulated which conforms with national conditions. China  already has a bankruptcy law for trial implementation, but it  takes the "planned commodity economy" as its structural  objective. Therefore, it is imperative to revise this  bankruptcy law by taking the socialist market economy as its  structural objective. Apart from observing laws of the market  economy in general and absorbing and referring to foreign  countries' successful experiences and practice in legislation,  we must base ourselves on national conditions in revising the  Bankruptcy Law. The bankruptcy system has gradually taken shape  in foreign countries in the course of free competition. This is  not entirely the same as China's background and economic  environment in which its bankruptcy system is being formed. In  pronouncing state enterprises' bankruptcies, we are facing  knotty problems such as how to distinguish between management  and ownership, how to straighten out the relation between  creditors and debtors, and how to establish an unemployment and  social insurance system. The settlement of these problems  requires the Bankruptcy Law to provide general stipulations and  our formulation of detailed methods and procedures. In addition,  because many state-owned enterprises face or are engaged in  bankruptcy, it is necessary, in the course of practicing  bankruptcy and through trial implementation, to gradually form a  bankruptcy system which conforms with the establishment of the  socialist market economic structure and national conditions and  which also converges with international practice.  <H5>  Ensuring the Establishment and Operation a Bankruptcy </H5> Mechanism by Legal Means--by Zheng Yang [6774 2799]    The nucleus of the bankruptcy system is that an enterprise  is  entitled to a legal person's property and independent  operational rights; more importantly, it is required to  undertake operational risks and perform its social  responsibility. For this reason, we should strengthen the legal  concept, learn how to apply the Bankruptcy Law, promote and  ensure fair competition between enterprises, and develop the  superior and eliminate the inferior to maintain good market  economic order. Efforts should also be made in the following  three aspects:  <H5>  In Legislation: Bankruptcy Legislation Should Be </H5> Strengthened Along With the Improvement of the Bankruptcy System    A bankruptcy law is the general way of legally standardizing  bankruptcy procedures and adjusting bankrupt enterprises' legal  relations. A bankruptcy law is quite important to deepening  China's enterprise reform, protecting creditors' and debtors'  legitimate rights and interests, and establishing a socialist  market economic structure. The existing bankruptcy law in China  is the "PRC Enterprise Bankruptcy Law (for trial  implementation)" promulgated on 2 December 1986 and formally  implemented on 1 November 1988. At that time, it portrayed  enterprise reform as well as social and economic development,  but the situation has changed and many new problems have arisen  since. In practice, we have not effectively enforced the  Bankruptcy Law, nor has our efficiency been high in handling  bankruptcy cases. This has seriously affected our efforts to  protect creditors' and debtors' rights and interests. Therefore  in this new situation, it is imperative to formulate a new  bankruptcy law suitable for all enterprise legal persons, to  comprehensively clarify the legal aim and basic principles of  this new law, and to provide stipulations on creditors' rights  and creditors panels, assets under bankruptcy and their  management, bankruptcy documents and applications, handling of  bankruptcies, court jurisdiction, conciliation and  rectification, bankruptcy pronouncements, bankruptcy  liquidation, and legal responsibility.    This will enable  the new bankruptcy law to conform with socialist market economic  development, to fully refer to and absorb the essence of foreign  bankruptcy laws, to converge and coordinate with international  practice, and to effectively protect the legitimate rights and  interests of creditors and debtors. To properly implement the  new bankruptcy law and fulfill the expected targets, detailed  implementation regulations should be announced as soon as  possible after the promulgation of the new bankruptcy law so as  to strengthen this new law's practicality and integrity. In the  meantime, the social insurance system should be improved along  with its legislation. The social insurance system basically  comprises these five aspects: social relief, social insurance,  social welfare, social assistance, and medical care. In  connection with this, there are five legal provisions, including  providing material relief for staff members and workers who have  special difficulties; the raising and use of social insurance  funds (such as providing relief for elderly people, patients,  unemployed people, and so on); and legal responsibility. These  legal provisions will help maintain social stability and  fairness and are indispensable to the market economy.  <H5>  Propaganda and Education: Propaganda and Education on </H5> Bankruptcy Law Should be Strengthened and the Concept About  Bankruptcy Should Be Improved    Due to the prolonged influence of the planned economy, many  people have belittled the role of the bankruptcy system and some  do not even know what bankruptcy and the Bankruptcy Law are.  Therefore, bankruptcy legal knowledge should be popularized and  propagated so that the concept of bankruptcy and elimination  will take deep root in the people's minds. In this case,  everyone will be able to reduce their mental obstacles to  understanding enterprise bankruptcy, improve their concepts of  bankruptcy, take precautions against bankruptcy, and prevent the  emergence of bankruptcy. Thus enterprise operators and  employees are required to have a sense of crisis or a concept  about bankruptcy so that enterprises will move ahead with  enterprising spirit, improve their management, produce better  economic results, strengthen their ability and adaptability in  the course of competition, and prevent themselves from going  bankrupt. In addition, when there is an application for  bankruptcy, the relevant department should try to reach a  conciliatory agreement with creditors so that self-rectification  can be carried out for revitalization.  <H5>  In Law Enforcement Bankruptcy Law Must Be Seriously </H5> Implemented To Protect Legitimate Rights and Interests    The normal operation of the market economy not only relies  on  legislation but also requires strict law enforcement. In this  respect, the most important point is to improve the quality of  relevant personnel and foster a number of professionals well  versed in handling bankruptcy issues. In the meantime, research  into bankruptcy crime must be taken into serious account.  Bankruptcy itself is not a crime, but in a bankruptcy case,  some debtors infringe on creditors' legitimate rights and  interests by illegal and deceptive means. As a result,  conciliation or bankruptcy cannot be carried out fairly or  smoothly. If the case is serious, it may constitute a criminal  offense. A policy should be worked out to deal with it. In  short, law enforcement ability should be improved so that the  implementation of China's Bankruptcy Law can be secured and  actual results achieved.</p>

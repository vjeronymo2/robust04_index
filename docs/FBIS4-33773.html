			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jose Carlos Santana] </F>   [Text] Belem -- After resolving the Haitian topic, the  General Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS)  immediately turned to a problem that is considered very serious  in the community of nations of the Americas: violence against  women. During the evening of 7 June, the delegates of the 34  countries attending the meeting approved the "Convention of  Belem do Para," an international juridical instrument "to  prevent, punish, and eradicate" all types of physical, sexual,  or psychological violence against the continent's female  population.    The approval of the document was considered a great victory  for a group of ambassadors who had worked for several months to  overcome the resistance of some countries, Brazil among them,  which were against the consideration of and debate on the  subject in Belem. In the end, despite sarcastic statements by  some delegates, and even after some typically macho kinds of  jokes, the convention was unanimously approved.    The United States, Brazil, Mexico, Jamaica, and Canada, the  countries that opposed debating the document during the plenary  session this week, have some objections to the convention's  text. Those countries preferred to reconsider the text and to  submit it in advance to the United Nations World Conference on  Women, due to be held next year in Beijing. Yet Ambassador  Zelmira Regazzoli, president of the International Women's  Commission (CIM), insisted on and succeeded in including the  topic on the agenda of the Belem meeting.    The convention has five chapters. Article 1 of Chapter I  states that violence against women is "any action that causes  death, harm, or physical, sexual, or psychological suffering to  women, either in the private or public sectors."    Chapter II can be summarized as saying that all women have  the right to live free of violence; that women must be  recognized to have the right to enjoy, exercise, and receive the  protection of all the human rights and liberties upheld by all  regional and international human rights instruments; and that  women can freely and fully exercise their civil, political,  economic, social, and cultural rights.    Still excited about the approval of the document, Venezuelan  Ambassador Ana Lucina Garcia Maldonado, who is also a federal  deputy and the author of bills defending women in her country,  yesterday told O ESTADO: "This is a really momentous event. We  are 250 million women in the Americas, and at the end of the  20th century we still cannot say that we enjoy the rights that  are recognized as belonging to all human beings. We still have  to submit ourselves to all kinds of violence and remain  practically silent, because no one protects us. Not much is  said about this, but it is known that at least 150 million women  in our continent suffer from one type of violence or the other.  A major step has undoubtedly been made, and I myself am  particularly very happy."    Ana Lucina, who suggested naming the Convention after Belem  do Para, added that all OAS countries will now have to ratify  the document in order to enforce it.  <H5>  Disappearance </H5>   A draft convention dealing with the forcible disappearance  of  people was also submitted to the OAS plenary session yesterday.  The document was approved on 7 June by a working commission  that addressed juridical and political topics. Everything  seemed to indicate that it would also be approved by all OAS  countries.    The convention defines forcible disappearance as the action  -- by agents of the state -- of stripping someone of his  freedom. Amnesty International, which was represented at the  meeting, is working to make the countries of the Americas  classify abduction as a crime.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 7 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the Mexican  Armed Forces stated they are conducting searches in Chiapas to  prevent the traffic of weapons and explosives, denying media  reports they had imposed "sieges" in that southeastern state.    "Searches are being conducted at the military checkpoints  established in the area with the sole purpose of preventing the  trafficking of weapons and explosives toward the conflict area,"  the National Secretariat of Defense stated.    The Armed Forces issued a communique to deny media reports  they had imposed "restrictions," "sieges," and "quarantines" in  an area where the conflict that began on 1 January is being  resolved.    The Zapatist National Liberation Army concluded the first  phase of a reconciliation dialogue with Manuel Camacho Solis,  commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, on 1 March.    The dialogue took place amid a virtual truce in San  Cristobal  de las Casas, 200 km southeast of Mexico City, following the  unilateral cease-fire ordered by President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari on 12 January.    The communique revealed that "the National Secretariat of  Defense stated categorically" that since the unilateral  cease-fire, the Armed Forces "have and will continue to  facilitate" the transit of residents, goods, and medical  attention.</p>

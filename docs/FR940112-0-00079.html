(The amount of income exceeding the State's income standard is referred to as an individual's spenddown liability.) In some instances the amount of projected institutional expenses at the Medicaid rate may not be enough to meet the individual's spenddown liability. In that case, the individual remains ineligible. However, the individual will become eligible when actually incurred institutional expenses at the private rate reduce income enough to establish eligibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As indicated in response to an earlier comment, the State Medicaid rate is the appropriate amount to use in projecting expenses because it reduces the need to reconcile projected and actually incurred expenses and helps to avoid erroneous determinations of eligibility. If an individual is not eligible because his or her spenddown liability exceeds institutional expenses projected over the budget period at the Medicaid rate, the State must determine eligibility based on deducting actually incurred institutional expenses or based on a combination of expenses actually incurred at the private payment rate and remaining expenses projected at the Medicaid rate. (If eligibility results and eligibility is retroactive to the first day of the month because the State provides coverage in whole months, expenses incurred at the private payment rate prior to the determination of eligibility remain valid. Ordinarily, a participating provider may charge an eligible individual no more than the Medicaid rate. However, these charges need not be adjusted since the charges were incurred at the private payment rate and since the charges were part of expenses needed to qualify the individual for Medicaid under the spenddown. Otherwise, the adjustment could result in the individual no longer being eligible for Medicaid during the month. Furthermore, unless required under State law or the terms of the State's provider agreement, Medicaid providers need not accept all Medicaid eligible individuals as Medicaid patients. Thus, during the period prior to the determination of Medicaid eligibility, the provider could be viewed as only accepting the patient as a private payment patient. Charges incurred after the determination of eligibility may not exceed the Medicaid rate.)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Example: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The individual is in the institution as of the first day of the month. The monthly spenddown liability is $1,500. The projected Medicaid rate for the month is $1,200 ($40 per day). The private rate is $1,800 per month ($60 per day). Since projected monthly expenses at the Medicaid rate ($1,200) are not sufficient to meet the spenddown liability ($1,500), the individual is not eligible. However, after remaining in the institution for 15 days the individual has actually incurred expenses of $900 at the private rate ($60 &times; 15 days). The projected institutional expenses at the Medicaid rate for the remaining days in the month are $600 ($40 &times; 15 days). Thus, as of the 15th day of the month the combination of actually incurred bills ($900) plus projected expenses at the Medicaid rate ($600) equal the spenddown liability ($1,500) and the individual is eligible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters expressed concern that institutional providers that admit individuals at the private rate will be paid only at the usually lower Medicaid rate. This payment differential may have negative effects, both on providers and beneficiaries. Providers will receive less compensation under the proposal, and it may cause providers to admit fewer potential Medicaid patients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It is not clear why the commenters believe that institutional providers will be paid less as a direct result of the policy to require States to project expenses at the Medicaid payment rate. Providers can charge patients at the private payment rate for expenses incurred prior to the determination of Medicaid eligibility when spenddown liability was unmet. The individual is responsible for the full amount of those charges. Providers do not have to accept the Medicaid rate until after the individual becomes eligible. Therefore, by using the lower Medicaid rate, there may be a delay in meeting spenddown. This delayed eligibility could actually entitle providers to the higher rate for a longer period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

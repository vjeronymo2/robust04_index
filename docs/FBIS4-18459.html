			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- The leader of the Free Democratic Party of  Germany [FDP], Klaus Kinkel, has again called on the members of  his party to make the independence of liberal policies clearer  vis-a-vis the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union  [CDU/CSU] and the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]  during the upcoming election campaigns. "Whereas the  conservatives and the SPD used to be worlds apart, Labor  Minister Bluem and SPD social affairs expert Dressler are  congenial brothers," Kinkel stated in the party organ LIBERAL  DISPATCH (April edition).    The FDP leader spoke in favor of more privatization and  deregulation in the economy. As a "counterforce" to the Greens,  the FDP must clearly support nuclear energy as a "transitional  energy," it must promote biotechnology and genetic engineering,  and reject general speed limits, Kinkel pointed out. Moreover,  his party should "vigorously advocate its role as the party  ensuring the rule of law" and support performance elites in  Germany.    It is particularly important "for the FDP to be noticed both  because of what it does and because of the way it does things,"  Kinkel continued. Credibility and style have become central  political messages. "Politicians may make mistakes, but they  cannot afford everything," the FPD leader stressed.</p>

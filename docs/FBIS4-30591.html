			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 27 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic  Liberal Party's nominations for National Assembly posts Monday  further bolstered President Kim Yong-sam's line after last  year's personnel reshuffle.    The nominations followed the common practice of choosing the  most-elected lawmakers, and no outstanding exceptions emerged.    But this was President Kim's first national lineup after  December's large-scale reshuffle of his party and the government  and last April's dismissal of Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, the  reason the nominations raised political antennae.    The new house speaker and assembly committee chairmen will  be  tasked with supporting the latter half of Kim's presidential  term and adapting to changing circumstances in inter-Korean  relations and the post-Uruguay Round trade climate, among other  things.    Local autonomy elections are coming up in June next year,  and  a massive redrawing of the DLP camp is looming late this year or  in early 1995. President Kim most certainly had this in mind  when he made the nominations.    In this context, Rep. Hwang Nak-chu was selected as house  speaker, even though his nomination entailed a minor political  gamble. The reason: Hwang was vice speaker when the ruling  camp railroaded the new budget bill through the assembly last  year.    The decision to promote Hwang reflects Kim's determination  not to be elbowed aside in ruling-opposition party relations.    Rumor has it that the current house speaker, Yi Man-sop,  will  stay and that Rep. Kim Yong-tae will be tapped as his deputy in  a goodwill gesture to the "TK forces," the acronym for those  from Taegu and North Kyongsang Province, and in consideration of  the upcoming by-election in Taegu.    Moreover, Reps. Kim Yong-tae and Kim Han-kyu were included  in  the list to appease the TK forces after the changing of the  house speaker.    Rep. Yi Chun-ku, who has the president's personal trust, won  the bid for house vice speaker in competition with Rep. Kim.    The house posts were filled with political considerations in  mind, but National Assembly committee positions were meant to  respond to the issue of regional and factional balance.    Floor leader Yi Han-tong orignally drew up a list that gave  more than half of the committee chairmen posts to lawmakers from  Pusan and South Kyongsang Province.    Secretary-general Mun Chong-su, however, changed the list  before it was sent to the president. In the end, the most  expected nominees, Kim Pong-cho and Chong Che-mun, were absent  from the list -- An indication of how important attaining a  regional balance was.    The final outcome stood at two from Pusan, two each for  Taegu, Seoul, Kyonggi Province, Inchon and North Chungchong  Province, one each from North Cholla Province and South  Chungchong Province, and one lawmaker from a national  constituency.    All of the choices, except for Rep. Pak Hui-tae and Sin  Kyong-sik, are old-timers who have served three terms or more in  office.    The last-minute dilemmas concerned the chairmen of the  foreign affairs-national unification, finance, national defense  and culture and information committees.    The DLP is planning on replacing all chiefs of city and  provincial offices with three-term or more lawmakers next month  and also on reshuffling party executive posts, foreshadowing a  stormy summer ahead.</p>

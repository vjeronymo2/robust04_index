			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Welsh Development Agency 'is fighting for its life' The Welsh Development Agency is fighting for its life, says a report published today by the Department of City and Regional Planning at the University of Wales, College of Cardiff. The report by Professor Kevin Morgan says the Welsh Office is 'seemingly unsure as to whether it (the agency) ought to have a future at all'. He states that the Welsh Office, chastened by accusations of failing to regulate quangos properly, had thrown the agency into disarray by recently rejecting its corporate plan. The publicly funded agency, the leading quango in Wales, had been informed 'it should go back to the drawing board to justify its very existence'. The report is the first substantial analysis of the agency's role since it became embroiled in controversy after criticism by the Commons public accounts committee last year. The senior management has since been replaced and the agency restructured. Prof Morgan argues that the new managers, recruited from the private sector, have been 'novices in the art of political bargaining'. They failed in consequence to appreciate the significance of the annual corporate plan in the public expenditure round at a time when the Welsh Office was under renewed Treasury pressure to look for savings. 'Having remedied its internal governance problems, it (the agency) now finds itself fighting for its life,' he states. 'While it is perfectly proper for quangos to justify their existence, to precipitate a crisis in the WDA at this delicate point in its career raises the question as to whether the Welsh Office is genuinely interested in having a robust development agency in Wales.' Prof Morgan suggests the crisis at the agency stems partly from the fact that Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, comes from a radically different Conservative tradition to that of Mr Peter Walker and Mr David Hunt, his predecessors. Mr Redwood had had an 'unnerving effect on the key Welsh institutions, including the Welsh Office, by extolling the market and by being less than effusive about the role of public-sector bodies like the WDA'. The report defends the agency for its positive role in modernising the Welsh economy and enhancing the environment. It 'deserves to have a future. Indeed, it seems surprising that there should be a question about this when the English regions are desperately trying to create their own versions of the WDA.' Arguing that such institutions need to be effective and accountable, Prof Morgan says the agency needs to develop better networking skills. He comments that although the Welsh Office is ideally placed to promote a networking ethos, and is formally committed to partnerships, it 'seems more concerned to retain control for itself than to empower the wider network'.

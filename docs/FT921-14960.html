			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Privatisation of big ports sails into a storm: The fierce controversy generated by the government's disposal programme inject a bit more competition into the ports industry and line the Exchequer's pockets at the same time. The plan was to privatise the 15 biggest of the 111 British ports that are run neither by local authorities nor the private sector, but by self-governing trusts set up under acts of parliament. It should have attracted little controversy. Most of the ports were expected to be quietly snapped up by management-employee buy-out teams rather than speculative bidders - safeguards were built into the scheme to prevent the ports from being turned into shopping malls. Yet the privatisation has turned into an embarrassing political debacle. Tomorrow the row will come to a head in the Commons when MPs are asked to approve the first privatisation - the sale of Tees &amp; Hartlepool, Britain's second-biggest cargo port, to the Teesside Holdings consortium. Tees &amp; Hartlepool had been a founder member of the pro-privatisation club. Like several trust ports, it was run by a management keen to take an equity stake in a business freed from the straitjacket of trust status, which prevented its expansion into related activities such as distribution and property development. There was, however, a catch. Under the privatisation legislation - the Ports Act 1991 - the management could not simply take the port over. To ensure best value for money for the taxpayer, the port had to be sold through a competitive tender refereed by the non-executive members of the trust. Proceeds would be split 50-50 between the port and the government. When the trust came to take its decision last month, it had to choose between four bids. The highest was Pounds 210m from Maritime Transport Services, owner of the Thamesport container terminal in Kent. Next was Pounds 180m from Teesside Holdings, a consortium comprising the Powell Duffryn industrial group, venture capital group 3i, and private interests in the Humberside area. Third was Pounds 150m from the management-employee buy-out team, and fourth Ocean Group, the distribution company, which is believed to have bid about the same. The fact that the buy-out team was outbid did not eliminate it from the contest. The trust had agreed with the government that price would be only one of three main criteria, the others being employee participation and benefits to the local economy. The trust provoked furious protests from the buy-out team, other contenders and local MPs by awarding victory neither to the highest bidder nor to the buy-out team but to Teesside Holdings. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, has said he is 'minded' to approve that decision. In a 13-page memorandum to the prime minister, Mr Stuart Bell, Labour MP for Middlesbrough, claims that: Teesside Holdings' bid said that, if it won, room would be made on the company's board for one of the trust's non-executives, thus presenting the judges with an unacceptable conflict of interest. Two of Teesside's directors had previously been directors of port companies that were put into liquidation in 1989, tion to meet redundancy payments of Pounds 6.6m. The Teesside bid provided for employee ownership of only 5 per cent of the shares, so failing to meet one of the criteria: the desirability of seeing the whole, or a substantial part, of the equity taken by managers and employees. Teesside was given the opportunity to bring in other investors and increase its bid twice during the contest. The buy-out team says that, if it had known employee participation would count for so little, it could have brought in other equity investors and pipped the Teesside bid. Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm advising the Department of Transport, says the buy-out team is being a poor loser. It simply misjudged the value of the preference the trust and the government would put on a management-employee buy-out. That is not the end of the affair. The Tees &amp; Hartlepool buy-out team says it will seek a judicial review of the trust's decision if Mr Rifkind confirms it this week. Worse, the managements of several other trust ports - Clyde, Medway, Tilbury and Forth - have privatisation plans in train, each raising the possibility of a fresh political row. To try to limit the potential for embarrassment, the Transport Department has imposed an information blackout on future competitive tenders so that bids will remain secret. It is also allowing Forth to avoid the tendering process by floating itself on the stock market, so undermining its own value-for-money principle. Whether those measures will be enough to forestall further rows is uncertain. MPs seem unlikely to be impressed by them and disappointed bidders in competitive tenders may still break their vows of silence. Unless Mr Rifkind has a last-minute change of heart over Tees &amp; Hartlepool, the controversy over that sale seems destined to haunt him until the general election.</p>

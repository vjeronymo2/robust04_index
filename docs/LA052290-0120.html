			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARTIST SUES THE REV. WILDMON OVER MAILING  </P> <P> A New York artist filed a federal court suit Monday against a right-wing  political organization that sent severely cropped versions of 14 of his images  to members of Congress, religious broadcasters and thousands of church pastors  labeled, "WARNING! Extremely Offensive Material Enclosed."  </P> <P> The action by multimedia artist David Wojnarowicz named as defendants the  American Family Assn., based in Tupelo, Miss., and its director, the Rev.  Donald Wildmon. Wildmon and his group have led an offensive against the  National Endowment for the Arts. The conservative opponents have accused the  NEA of funding pornography by giving grants to half-a-dozen exhibits, two  featuring Wojnarowicz work.  </P> <P> The Wojnarowicz suit seeks damages of "in excess of $1 million" for copyright  violation, defamation of character and violation of a New York state law that  seeks to protect artists against unauthorized alteration and dissemination of  their work.  </P> <P> Wildmon could not be reached for comment at the American Family Assn.'s  Mississippi headquarters.  </P> <P> The court action is believed to be the first direct attempt by an artist to  strike back through litigation at any of the foes of the NEA. As such, it  appeared to represent a major tactical development in the crisis over federal  funding of the arts and a larger debate over artistic freedom of expression  that has escalated sharply during the last 14 months.  </P> <P> But, at the same time, some prominent arts attorneys said they were concerned  that the Wojnarowicz lawsuit involves significant risks of failure --  especially on the claim of copyright infringement. They said, Wildmon may  easily be able to defend himself under a legal doctrine known as "fair use,"  which says reproduction of copyrighted materials can be tolerated if the public  interest is served and the reproduction does not engage in economic competition  with the original work.  </P> <P> Susan Duke Biederman, an attorney for the New York-based Volunteer Lawyers for  the Arts, said Wojnarowicz's strongest case may be the defamation count, with  the copyright infringement accusation the weakest. By and large, however, arts  lawyers praised Wojnarowicz's decision, saying the filing of the litigation  takes the political controversy over arts funding and censorship into an  appropriate forum for at least partial resolution of the blistering dispute.  </P> <P> "There is a bona fide wrong here that needs to be resolved between the  parties," said Duke Biederman. Filing the action, she said, "does sharpen the  swords." But, at the same time, Duke Biederman said the risks for artists at  large are great if Wojnarowicz should lose. "It would not only be a loss for  that artist. It would be a loss for all artists," she said.  </P> <P> "I think it's a very dangerous thing, a terrible thing (Wildmon) did,"  Wojnarowicz said in a telephone interview from his Manhattan apartment. "I  think he needs to be challenged on it. The nature of the mailing is basically  destroying work of mine and cutting it up and coming up with a series of images  that wholly misrepresented my work, and then putting my name on it.  </P> <P> "He essentially portrays me as a banal pornographer," said Wojnarowicz. "I'm  just beginning to show outside of New York. Once a museum sees something like  that (the American Family Assn. mailing), the assumption will be that this is  the essence of what I do."  </P> <P> Stephen Weil, deputy director of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in  Washington and an arts law expert, asserted that the Wojnarowicz suit clears  the way for making an argument in court that conservatives "may just be beating  up on artists incident to a larger agenda. I think artists ought not to permit  themselves to be beaten up upon."  </P> <P> The Wojnarowicz suit was prepared by a battery of private New York lawyers and  attorneys for the nonprofit Center for Constitutional Rights. It attacks a  Wildmon mailing that has emerged as one of the centerpieces of a renewed  assault on the NEA by the American Family Assn. and several conservative  congressmen.  </P> <P> In his court papers, Wojnarowicz seeks an injunction barring Wildmon from  distributing additional copies of the cropped artworks and from even calling  the pictures in question Wojnarowicz's work. The artist asked U.S. District  Court Judge William Conner to order the remaining copies of the American Family  Assn. materials impounded and order an audit of contributions received from the  mailing.  </P> <P> In the version of the mailing sent to most members of the House and Senate,  Wildmon wrote that the materials were being sent to 3,200 "Christian leaders,"  1,100 Christian radio and television stations and 178,000 pastors. "I think you  will be as offended by the photos as the average American voter is," Wildmon  wrote in a cover letter dated April 12.  </P> <P> Artists immediately applauded the decision by Wojnarowicz to sue Wildmon and  his group, which last year and earlier this year attacked the work of two other  artists whose work appeared in exhibits supported by the NEA.  </P> <P> "It's important that artists start to fight back," said Nan Goldin, a New York  artist who served as curator of a controversial show involving Wojnarowicz's  work last year. "It does me good as an artist to see David taking control of  this. I think it's a powerful example for other artists."  </P> <P> "Wojnarowicz's work has been totally misrepresented," said Susan Wyatt,  director of the New York gallery Artists Space, which hosted the show last year  and became embroiled in the NEA controversy when arts endowment Chairman John  E. Frohnmayer rescinded, but later restored, a $10,000 grant to support the  show, "Witnesses: Against Our Vanishing." "It is terrific that he has taken  this step," she said.  </P> <P> The Wildmon mailing extracted small segments of 14 images from Wojnarowicz  paintings, photographs and multimedia collages included in "Tongues of Flame,"  a one-man show at Illinois State University in Normal, Ill. The exhibit closed  in March, a month before the Wildmon mailing was distributed. The show received  $15,000 in NEA funding.  </P> <P> Like the majority of Wojnarowicz's work, "Tongues of Flame" is dominated by the  artists's rage at the plight of AIDS victims. Some of the pieces include  sexually explicit elements among larger, complex montages and other treatments  of the AIDS themes.  </P> <P> Wojnarowicz has AIDS. He has been active in a variety of AIDS-prevention  programs. Ironically, Wojnarowicz said, one of the images described as  offensive by Wildmon is a still from a video intended to promote safe sex  techniques among gay men. The freeze-frame shows two bare-chested men disco  dancing -- but contains no sexually explicit image.  </P> <P> The rest of the images in the Wildmon mailing represent drastically cropped  segments of other Wojnarowicz works. Two of the images are 8-by-10-inch  sections of a larger work that is 6-by-9 feet overall.  </P></p>

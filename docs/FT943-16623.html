			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Total football a matter of faith for Holland  -Simon Kuper in Boston finds that Dutch squabbles could undermine their natural ability The Dutch blame the heat. Soccer players boil at 47'C, and Holland's second-round game today against Ireland is their third in sticky Orlando, Florida. Naturally, there is more to the Dutch decline than Florida's heat. Go back six weeks to the European Cup final between Barcelona and AC Milan. Barca, led by Dutchman Johan Cruyff, play pretty total football, and Cruyff spent the days before the match knocking Milan - 'a team with only runners and defenders.' It would be better for football if Barcelona won, he decreed. Milan won 4-0, and in Orlando Cruyff's spirit lives on. The Dutch play pretty soccer, and they think they deserve to win. So far they have been lucky to beat little Saudi Arabia and Morocco - 2-1 each time - and they lost 1-0 to Belgium. The German press applauds any victory, but Dutch papers demand beautiful football, and players are spending hours after every match lecturing journalists on the weather. Lex Muller of the Algemeen Dagblad spoke for many when he called the Orlando side 'a too gentle team of ideal sons-in-law.' Holland's winners are back home in Europe. Ruud Gullit, whatever the myth, is no laid-back Rastafarian reggae-lover. He is a fierce competitor who walked out of the Dutch training camp three weeks before the World Cup because he thought that playing with four forwards was 'suicidal', and because he secretly dreaded a seat on the bench. Marco van Basten is chronically injured. Cruyff, who loves winning, is absent thanks to the saddest row of all. It was agreed two years ago that he would lead the Dutch to the World Cup. With him in charge, Holland might have had a shot at the trophy. Last December the time came to negotiate, and everything fell through. Cruyff asked for too much money (no great turn-up for the books, that); Lotto, kit sponsors of the Dutch team, took fright at his plans to promote Cruyff Sportswear at the tournament (another old story); the chairman of the Dutch FA pushed Cruyff to sign the contract in a week that Barcelona had three matches; and, when a final fax from the chairman came through at Casa Cruyff, the print was illegible. So Dick Advocaat, a gritty 1970s midfielder, is managing Holland, and the players are uninspired. English players always try hard, but Dutch ones are different. The Dutch squabble, a pastime that cost them the last World Cup and could cost them this one, too. It is a tradition inspired by two men: John Calvin, who taught the faithful to ignore priests and read the Bible for themselves, and Johan Cruyff, who taught them that a good scrap motivates people. Thanks to these two, a Dutch player believes that he is quite as likely as his manager to have the Truth. Hence Gullit thought he had a right to tell Advocaat how to play, while this week the players have been lobbying their coach to play an extra defender. Authority figures have a hard time in Holland. This team lacks leaders - figures who will remind the rest that this is a World Cup, who will chase opponents after 80 minutes in the heat, who call for the ball when nothing seems to be working. Ronald Koeman, the Dutch captain, lacks the cosmopolitan charisma of Gullit or Cruyff, and has the job for want of an alternative. At 33, Jan Wouters spends most of his time soliciting yellow cards, while Dennis Bergkamp, though already 25 and the best player in the team, is still a shy boy. Frank Rijkaard, the other great player in the side, has never wanted to lead. If it were up to him, footballers would get as much publicity as accountants or bricklayers, and though he is more gifted than Gullit, he always played in Gullit's shadow. Dick Advocaat dropped Rijkaard for the game against Morocco - just as Italy took off Roberto Baggio when the going got tough - and after the match a sedate Rijkaard explained to the press that 'not everyone can play at the same time.' Had Gullit been left out, he would have flown home. In the 1970s there were two Dutch clubs worth mentioning, Ajax and Feyenoord. Ajax players were ballet dancer types who invented total football, while Feyenoord players looked as though they had been dug out of the ground. Now there is only one serious club, Ajax, where nine of the players who started against Morocco spent their formative years. The Dutch have no men with beards anymore, and it shows. Their playing style is holier-than-thou. Though they are now down from four forwards to three, they use four mid-fielders, and the trio at the back includes two creative players in Koeman and Frank de Boer. (A 100-metre dash between them would be enlightening, but would take ages to complete). Advocaat, who used to be a defensive coach, is now refusing to play a fourth defender against Ireland. He points out that the Irish play with only one striker. That is true, but their mid-fielders will come down the wings. Ireland against Holland is chalk against cheese, and everyone knows what happens to cheese at 47'C.</p>

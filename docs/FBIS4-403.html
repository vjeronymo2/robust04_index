			<p>BFN     [Text] Skukuza April 8 SAPA -- Zulu King Goodwill  Zwelithini told State President F W de Klerk he would "walk the  extra mile" in an attempt to seek a solution to the violence in  kwaZulu/Natal, but negotiations had "reached the end of the  road".    The ruler of the region's eight million Zulus was addressing  Mr de Klerk, Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] Leader Mangosuthu  Buthelezi and African National Congress President Nelson Mandela  during their summit meeting at Skukuza in the Kruger National  Park on Friday [8 April].    The king accused Mr de Klerk of ignoring the "hideous and  despicable crime" when eight IFP members were shot dead and at  least four injured on March 28 outside the Shell House  headquarters of the African National Congress in Plein Street,  Johannesburg.    Referring to a reported agreement between ANC leader Nelson  Mandela and the police, in which the police agreed not to enter  Shell House on condition that weapons inside the building were  handed over to them, the king said: "You saw them being  ambushed, attacked and massacred... yet your police did not  enter Shell House to arrest the perpetrators and to secure  incriminating evidence."    King Goodwill said it was clear that meetings he had held  with Mr de Klerk had not been "fruitful" and "we have reached  the end of the road which we together opened on January 17,  1994".    He said it was obvious that the only way in which Zulus  would restore their kingdom was "through our own efforts as  Zulus and as freedom fighters".    Mr de Klerk was still defending a unitary state which gave  no  recognition for the separateness of the Zulu kingdom and nation,  he said. The Zulu nation had endeavoured to seek a peaceful and  negotiated solution, but any possible freedom in the territory  had been abolished by the "invasion" of the SADF [South African  Defense Force] and SA Police to enforce the state of emergency  in kwaZulu/Natal.    "I came (to the summit) because I felt it is my obligation  to  walk the extra mile in an effort to seek a solution to our  problems.    "However, I feel that you, Mr President, and I have  discussed  all that there is to discuss and that the time for discussion  has somehow run its course. I always feel that deeds speak  louder than words," the king said.    He said the restoration of the kingdom of kwaZulu had to be  resolved before an election was held in South Africa. "I am not  sure how we can make progress and in which direction. I know  that I am not prepared to go over again matters which you and I  have discussed at great length," he said.    The Zulu king said the key to successful negotiations was  whether the other leaders were prepared to listen to Zulu  aspirations, or whether, "like those who conquered us, you think  you must trample with your feet on those just aspirations of my  nation".</p>

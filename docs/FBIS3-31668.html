Zlenko, who arrived on a one-day visit to Slovakia today at  the invitation of Slovak Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik,  stresses the need to conclude the agreements on investment  protection and the prevention of double taxation between the  Ukraine and Slovakia. "The Ukraine attaches great importance to  the establishment of economic and trade relations with the  Slovak Republic," he says.    Zlenko warns against ethnic and nationalist separatism which  represents a problem for Slovakia also. He said  Slovak-Ukrainian cooperation could help neutralise these  phenomena, strengthen mutual relations and ensure stability in  the region.    Zlenko says that the Crimea conflict should be solved by  legal means in harmony with the Constitution. The efforts of  the Crimean Republic at broader cooperation with the  Commonwealth of the Independent States (CIS) are determined by  political, economic and historic circumstances. "The Crimea is  an integral part of the Ukraine and, therefore, Ukrainian laws  are valid there," Zlenko says.    He spoke in favour of a security system open also to those  countries which do not belong to the security structures of the  North Atlantic Alliance or the CIS. Currently there exist no  security guarantees for these states and their own strengths are  not sufficient to stand up to any "pressure of external forces,"  Zlenko said.    "The Ukraine is a European state," said Zlenko, pointing to  the Ukraine's striving to joint European political, financial  and "other" structures. "The Ukraine has declared that it will  be a state without nuclear weapons in the future," Zlenko said,  adding that that was a choice of a "certain form" of neutrality  from any military blocs.</p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS' LEE WILLIAMS TO RETURN TO CAMP  </P> <P> Pro Bowl defensive lineman Lee Williams, who left town Saturday in a contract  dispute with the Chargers, will end his walkout this weekend and return to  training camp.  </P> <P> General Manager Bobby Beathard said he was informed of Williams' decision in a  telephone conversation Wednesday with his agent, Steve Feldman of Newport  Beach.  </P> <P> Beathard said Feldman told him Williams will report back to UC San Diego  sometime Saturday. But he will not rejoin the team in time to take part in  three days of joint practices with the Phoenix Cardinals beginning today at the  Cardinals' training site in Flagstaff, Ariz.  </P> <P> "Lee is coming in because we felt we could be more productive dealing with the  club with Lee here than out," Feldman said.  </P> <P> Williams left camp over what Feldman said was a broken promise to renegotiate a  five-year contract Williams signed in 1988. Feldman said Williams was promised  by Beathard's predecessor, Steve Ortmayer, that the team would renegotiate the  contract if he had consecutive Pro Bowl seasons, which he accomplished last  year.  </P> <P> That contract, which runs though the 1992 season, will pay Williams  approximately $700,000 in base pay this season, sources have said. Feldman is  seeking a deal that would pay Williams more than $1 million a year.  </P> <P> "The leaving was more a reaction than a demand," Feldman said. "Our demands  remain the same. We're going to continue to request the club honor its  obligation to Lee."  </P> <P> But Beathard said the team has not changed its opposition to renegotiating  Williams' contract and made no concessions to assure his return to training  camp.  </P> <P> The announcement of his planned return to camp came one day before Williams  faces the possibility of a season-long suspension without pay.  </P> <P> Beathard said the suspension will not be imposed but that the team had not made  a decision whether to fine Williams for his absence. Under NFL rules, Williams  can be fined a maximum of $1,500 per day for not reporting to camp while under  contract.  </P> <P> The Chargers reduced to six their number of unsigned players when inside  linebacker Cedric Figaro signed and reported in time for the afternoon workout.  </P> <P> Figaro said he agreed to a one-year deal.  </P> <P> Figaro has started 19 of 22 games in his two seasons with the Chargers, but  this year he figures to be competing for playing time at inside linebacker with  Gary Plummer, who has led the Chargers in tackles in all four of his seasons  with the team, and Junior Seau, the team's unsigned No. 1 draft choice.  </P> <P> In other negotiations, Beathard said he extended by one day, until today, the  deadline for offensive guard David Richards to sign and report or face a  reduction in his latest contract offer.  </P> <P> Beathard said he granted the extra day after talking with Richards' agent,  Randy Vataha of Boston. Vataha said Richards had some extenuating circumstances  that justified an extension.  </P> <P> Beathard said after the afternoon workout that he had not heard from offensive  tackle Broderick Thompson, who had been given the same deadline.  </P> <P> The agent for Thompson, Jeff Irwin of Scottsdale, Ariz., has said Thompson was  told the team's offer would be reduced by $5,000 if had not signed by  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Wide receiver Troy Johnson was back at training camp Wednesday for the first  time since he was hospitalized Thursday after breaking three ribs and  puncturing a lung in a scrimmage against the Rams. . . . The Chargers have  re-signed linebacker David Brandon and placed him on injured reserve after  reclaiming him from waivers. Brandon is out for the season after knee surgery  in May. . . . The Chargers next practice at UC San Diego will be at 9 a.m.  Monday.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The head of the Marek Borowski's office in Pila has  told a Radio Koszalin reporter that the deputy prime minister  and minister of finance has declared that he will tender his  resignation from the post of minister [as heard]. This will  ensue if Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak does not reverse the  decision last week on the dismissal of Deputy Finance Minister  Stefan Kawalec. Stanislaw Wolny said that the decision by Marek  Borowski is all but 100 percent certain. The resignation is to  be presented to the prime minister most probably on Friday,  after Waldemar Pawlak's return from Brussels. This news was  commented as follows by spokesman of the Democratic Left  Alliance [SLD] Zbigniew Siemiatkowski:    [Begin Siemiatkowski recording] The resignation of Marek  Borowski was never considered. I can say more, Mr. Borowski is  a sufficiently responsible politician to be fully aware of the  fact that, first, he must continue that which he has undertaken.  Second, he was designated by the SLD to fulfill this very  important function and so he must be aware of the fact that only  the adoption of the budget can lead to the political  stabilization of the parliament, the Sejm, and the coalition.  And these are matters far more important than even the very  important considerations that have caused the crisis between  Deputy Prime Minister Borowski and the prime minister. Really,  all the issues that led to the crisis will be resolved only  after the return of Aleksander Kwasniewski, who is in Brussels  at the moment. Most probably he has already had the opportunity  to meet the prime minister and clarify the issues that led to  the sparks, the sparks along the government axis. Although this  is not yet a matter that would have the character of a coalition  crisis, this is a certain misunderstanding that we would wish to  have resolved among the interested parties.</p>

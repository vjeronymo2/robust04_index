			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / China and UK to hold more talks on HK airport THE APPEARANCE of greater Anglo-Chinese co-operation over Hong Kong was bolstered yesterday when the two sides agreed to hold both a second round of talks on the colony's multi-billion dollar airport and a meeting of the Joint Liaison Group (JLG). The meeting later this month of the JLG, which works out the details of the transfer, will be the first since late last year. It could provide Beijing with a face-saving forum in which to 'approve' the construction of Hong Kong's ninth container terminal, CT9. Since last November, China has blocked development of the container terminal as part of its strategy of non-co-operation on economic matters in retaliation for Governor Chris Patten announcing plans for Hong Kong's political development. Howver, there have been some signals that China might be prepared to de-link aspects of the colony's economic development from those of its political development. The outcome of next Friday's meeting of the Airport Committee will be watched closely to see if Beijing is prepared to give its approval to the construction of the Western Harbour Crossing - a submarine tunnel vital for the airport project - and associated land reclamation works. Also next week, Anglo-Chinese officials meet in Beijing for the fifth round of talks about Hong Kong's political development. The British team will try to engage the Chinese in detailed discussions about Hong Kong's 1994-1995 elections, having touched on them only briefly in earlier discussions. The Chinese have said that they want to use the fifth round to ascertain Britain's 'sincerity' in the process. Beijing has been angered by a committee of the Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong's law making body, discussing Mr Patten's plans for political reform, and by observations of a junior British foreign office minister that LegCo could amend any agreement reached by the two sides. Observers in Hong Kong have suggested that Beijing's concern with 'sincerity' is a convenient device to delay the real business of the negotiations.</p>

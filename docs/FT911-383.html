			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Arts: Faces over the last hundred years - The Royal Society of Portrait Painters' exhibition at the Mall Gallery QUITE POSSIBLY Louise, Duchess of Connaught, was simply a stout middle-aged lady with a double-chin. Then she sat to Sir John Singer Sargent and was transformed in a three-quarters length portrait. The haughty duchess was immortalised with her excess inches skillfully vanished away, swelling upwards but not outwards from black satin and puffs of white chiffon. Sargent and dozens of other celebrated Edwardian portraitists can be seen at the Mall Gallery where the Royal Society of Portrait Painters holds its centenary exhibition (until May 31). The exhibition honours many past members of the Society, starting with the bravura and opulent vision of the 1880s and 1890s generation of Lavery, Orchardson, Guthrie, Shannon, Solomon, and the Victorian old-timer, GF Watts. Strange that no portrait appears by Archibald Wortley, who therefore remains just a name although it was he was responsible for calling into being a society dedicated to giving portraiture higher status and an exhibition base broader than that offered by the Royal Academy. The second generation around 1910 brought in the very different approaches of painters such as Rothenstein, Strang, Orpen and Nicholson. The Strang portrait is particularly fine, a beautifully poised study of a gentleman which is strongly influenced by Degas. Quite one of the most remarkable portraits, however, is Harold Speed's powerful image of a surgeon operating for cataract. A difficult subject, one might think, brilliantly handled by a composition which focusses the viewer's gaze not on Dr Little's down-tilted face, but on his hands as he inserts scalpels into the horridly shining eye of his patient. This painting normally hangs in the Manchester Royal Eye Hospital, so this is a rare chance to see it. Sir Gerald Kelly's famous and exuberant portrait of Vaughan Williams and Brockhust's bewitching 'Clytie' should stop you in your tracks. So, no doubt, will 'Juanita Forbes', a preposterous Annigoni temptress who cradles an hour-glass in a surrealist landscape. There is a fine clutch of inter-war society ladies of the boneless, chiffon-wrapped variety. One of them by Cowan Dobson is actually called 'Chiffon'. Lipstick had become now quite the done thing for ladies but even so, this lady's lips are not for the squeamish. And so it continues, a crammed miscellany of portraits familiar and mostly unfamiliar. At the end is a small but interesting selection of work by present-day members. This is a large exhibition but it is not, alas, a generous one. The public pays for admission, which in the circumstances is perfectly reasonable. But what should an entry-fee buy you? This exhibition has no labels so some 90 per cent of the exhibits are anonymous. You have to buy the catalogue to find out even who the artists and sitters are. Now that smacks of sharp practice, the more so as the catalogue entries are quite remarkably uninformative - just a few lines from each artist's curriculum vitae and nothing about the paintings. As half the pleasure of portraits is as documents to social history, this is a fairly disastrous omission. These may be lean times for the Society, but even so I am surprised that in its centenary year it chose to go before its public in quite such a threadbare dress. My colleague William Packer has already written about the important exhibition of Canadian landscape-painting, The True North now at the Barbican Art Gallery. Our Home and Native Land is a pendant exhibition which has now moved to Canada House, Trafalgar Square from a previous, rather larger showing at Sheffield's Mappin Art Gallery. Arthur Lismer and Frederick Varley, two of the most famous and influential figures in the history of Canadian art, emigrated from Sheffield. So did a number of other artists, most notably Stanley Royle and Elizabeth Nutt, although Royle eventually returned to England. The exhibition explores the early influences on this generation of artists who, in an artistic environment subtly permeated by Ruskin's values, trained at the Sheffield School of Art for jobs in the commercial art world. Interestingly, these young artists' commitment to landscape-painting is placed within the context of the political movement to win greater access to the countryside for the urban proletariat. It is fascinating to see how that exceptionally gifted pair, Lismer and Varley, responded to the raw colours, the vastness, of the Canadian landscape. Equally, it is almost uncanny to find their late work turning back to close-focus Ruskinian studies of their youth. This is an exhibition Sheffield can be proud of. It shows the energy and passion for research which, funds permitting, flourishes in our provincial public collections.</p>

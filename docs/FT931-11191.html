			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Brussels expected to clear Hoover MR Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, has asked the Brussels civil service to investigate whether Hoover's relocation of jobs from Dijon in France to Cambuslang in Scotland infringes any EC regulations. The investigation follows a complaint from France, which the Commission must examine. Mr Delors and Mr Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner, are to meet a delegation of workers from Hoover's Dijon plant in Brussels today, by when the Commission is expected to have concluded that it has no grounds to act in the controversy. While officials in Brussels strongly criticise the fact that Hoover's new Scottish workers will have no access to pension rights and sickness benefit for the first two years of their contracts, most contend that the jobs transfer breaks no rules. Nevertheless, Mr Delors is expected to use the Hoover case to press hard for a relaunch of the EC's social action programme, aimed at raising working conditions and rights, when the new Commission is invested by the European Parliament next week. On Monday Mr Delors attacked the practice of 'job-poaching' by the levelling downwards of workers' rights in order to attract invest ment. Though he did not mention the UK or the Hoover case, French ministers meeting in Brussels did. The Commission president is also likely to raise the case at a European Socialist conference on jobs and growth in Brussels today. Aides to Mr Delors say cases such as Hoover are bringing the EC further into discredit among workers unhappy about the Community's inability to generate growth and jobs. One senior French official at the Commission remarked that 'this looks very bad for Delors in France,' where he is believed still to nurse political ambitions to succeed President Francois Mitterrand. The Commission's social affairs directorate was yesterday examining whether the Hoover deal infringed highly technical clauses in the 1980 insolvency directive. These relate to adequate protection for workers in the hypothetical event of insolvency, and in this case focus on Hoover's use of surpluses in its UK group pension fund to invest in the company. Officials acknowledge they are going through the motions, since the existence of the surplus indicates full coverage were Hoover to close.</p>

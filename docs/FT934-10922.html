			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Arguments for auditors' limited liability do not hold water Sir, The government is facing pressure to limit the liability of auditors within the UK. This, it has been suggested, might be achieved by allowing an auditor to agree with the company and shareholders a fixed-figure limit for liability by repealing Section 310 of the Companies Act 1985. The justification for this seems to be, first, the large number of big claims made in the US; second, the effect this has had on the global indemnity insurance market; and, third, that the offshore mutual insurance companies formed by the Big Six or Big Eight have been denuded by claims. These arguments do not hold much water on inspection. First, the particular legal structure and litigious nature of the US makes its experience inappropriate for an EC member state. Second, the professional indemnity market does take account of national differences, and, third, as the financial status of the mutual insurance companies is not publicly available, the validity of the last argument is not questionable. Furthermore, the office of auditor is not like other contractual providers of services. Dry cleaners may limit damages that can be awarded against them on ruination of your Armani suit, but dry cleaners are not indirectly regulated by the Department of Trade and Industry, and do not owe their existence and income to government itself. The licensed monopoly on the function of auditor is a privileged status for which the government should continue to insist upon unlimited liability. A cap would devalue the judgmental nature of the 'true and fair' view. When government interferes in the market, the effect on competition should be reviewed. Would the quality and the level of service be helped or hindered by a cap on audit liability? The lack of a cap means one of the major firms could become insolvent leading to a major shakeout of that firm's clients and the ruination of the partners. Such an insolvency might be beneficial since medium-sized and other specialist players might be encouraged to enter the market for audit of listed companies. The collapse would also encourage the unbundling of services, and perhaps the level of standards of the remaining participants in the market would improve. Proponents of capping think that the more risky type of enterprise might have set for it a high limit which would reflect the danger. The current, somewhat random basis of charging audit fees suggests this is wishful thinking. It seems to me that, the riskier the firm, the more likely the limit would be set at the minimum level. In conclusion, my feeling is: 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' The present system has lasted well enough for more than 100 years, and there seems to be no real pressure for change from the business community or from the public. Parliamentary time could be well spent on simplifying legislation. John A Newman, Chantrey Vellacott, chartered accountants, Russell Square House, 10-12 Russell Square, London WC1B 5LF</p>

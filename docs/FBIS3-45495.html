The province recorded a record of 2.6 billion Swiss  francs-worth of border trade with Russia last year, up 30  percent from the previous year and almost eight times the figure  for 1987, according to Cai Kaifu, chief of the provincial border  trade administrative bureau.    The province, sharing a 3,05-km border with Russia, enjoys a  roaring trade with that country.    Seizing the opportunities created by China's opening and  reforms, the province has quickened its steps in promoting its  border trade.    It has hosted four annual provincial trade fairs since 1990,  which have drawn business people from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macao,  Eastern European countries, Russia and other members of the CIS.    The province has so far opened 21 border cities.    With its easy access to Russia and other neighboring  countries, the province has attracted more than 6,000  enterprises from over 100 cities in China. They have set up  trade offices and export products to Russia.    The province now exports more than 4,000 varieties of goods  to Russia, whereas only a dozen kinds of exports were available  in 1987.    Motor vehicles, airplanes and mechanical products take up 80  percent of the province's total imports. Meanwhile, exports of  grain, edible oil and canned food in 1993 were twice the  previous year's figures, but there was a slight drop in exports  of garments and shoes.    Economic co-operation with the CIS involved one billion  Swiss  francs last year, three times the previous year's figure.    So far, more than 5,000 border trade companies of the  province have co-operation partners all over the CIS.</p>

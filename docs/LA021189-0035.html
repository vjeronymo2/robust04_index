			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISPARITIES IN PROPERTY TAXES CREATED BY PROPOSITION 13  </P> <P> The rebuttals to your excellent editorial on Proposition 13 display an amazing  logic. They seem to say that it is not fair, not consistent with our system, to  tax everyone on the same value basis. The "fat cats" of Brentwood, Bel-Air,  Palos Verdes, etc. believe it is their God-given right to sit on properties  whose values appreciate at a far faster rate than the average, or of inflation  in general, then, at their convenience, sell at huge profits having enjoyed the  largess of taxes at a small fraction of their less fortunate neighbors over the  years.  </P> <P> Who says you can't have your cake and eat it too?  </P> <P> PAUL GIAMPAOLO  </P> <P> Oceanside  </P></p>

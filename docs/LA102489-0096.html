			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: HOW THE FILMING OF THE FILMING OF ADS HELPS SELL  </P> <P> While preparing its super-secret Super Bowl commercial, a Nike production crew  spent several hours last week filming hockey great Wayne Gretzky on the ice.  Next week, it plans to film the man of many sports, Bo Jackson, on the  gridiron.  </P> <P> In turn, this film crew is also being closely followed -- and filmed. But those  following them aren't spies from Reebook. Nor are they Jackson or Gretzky  groupies. Those in the second film crew are actually Nike employees. They are  preparing a video about the making of the commercial.  </P> <P> That's right, a commercial for a commercial.  </P> <P> "America's heroes are in our commercials," said Liz Dolan, director of public  relations at Nike. "So the outside world is intrigued by these ads. They want  to see more than the 30-second commercial. They want to see every moment these  guys are on camera."  </P> <P> This seems to be the latest rage on Madison Avenue. For years, Hollywood has  made "behind-the-scenes" films about the making of major motion pictures such  as "Star Wars." Now the ad world is getting into the act in a big way. Nike  also recently filmed a "behind-the-scenes" video of its popular "Bo Knows  Baseball" commercial, in which Jackson appears to skate, play tennis and even  strum an off-key tune with guitar legend Bo Diddley.  </P> <P> The video about that ad, "The Making of Bo," is already being shown to  customers at a number of Footlocker shoe stores. And portions of the video --  particularly the part in which Jackson knocks over the commercial's director,  Joe Pytka -- have been aired during sports broadcasts on TV stations  nationwide.  </P> <P> A number of other big-time advertisers -- from Lee Jeans to Taco Bell -- have  also recently discovered that videos about the making of TV commercials can  become great marketing tools to inspire employees, impress retailers -- and in  some cases, intrigue consumers.  </P> <P> "If you're spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on a commercial -- and  millions to buy broadcast time for it -- a couple thousand dollars a day more  for a video crew is money well spent," Dolan said. Experts estimate that these  videos can cost $20,000 to $100,000 to produce.  </P> <P> Nike has even created an in-house production division to make the videos.  Multimedia Presentations in Culver City, which specializes in making commercial  videos, made some for Lee Jeans and Taco Bell. The videos were primarily used  to motivate employees and, in the case of Lee, impress retailers.  </P> <P> "There are lots of people in Middle America who have never seen how a  commercial is made," said Christopher Raser, vice president and executive  producer at Multimedia Group. "To them, this is very exciting."  </P> <P> Advertising experts say this can be an extremely effective marketing tool.  </P> <P> "It stresses to employees that the company is trying to include them as  partners in everything they do," said John A. Czepiel, associate professor of  marketing at New York University. "It's the closest thing you can do to  inviting them along to the commercial shoot."  </P> <P> Once the Lee Jeans salespeople have seen the video, they're sent out to show it  to executives at department stores and clothing stores that might carry Lee  Jeans. "Hopefully, it will motivate them to increase their orders," said Harish  Bhandar, an account executive at the Minneapolis agency Fallon McElligott,  which creates ads for Lee Jeans.  </P> <P> Last year, Taco Bell videotaped the making of its "Run for the Border" TV  commercials. These ads feature a number of risky stunts, including one in which  two guys jump off a fast-moving train. Taco Bell showed its behind-the-scenes  video to 1,000 employees at a company meeting.  </P> <P> "People are always interested in seeing how advertising is made," said Elliot  Bloom, senior director of public affairs at Taco Bell. The same video was later  shown to Taco Bell franchisees. "There's is no price you can place on the  excitement you can help to build when a new ad campaign is just breaking," said  Bloom.  </P> <P> But to the crews filming these videos, it's often a race against time.  </P> <P> The Lee Jeans video, for example, was filmed in Los Angeles in late January.  Less than two weeks later, it was shown to 300 Lee Jeans sales executives at a  meeting in Orlando.  </P> <P> And while some top commercial directors don't always enjoy the extra noise --  and extra people -- on their sets, they're beginning to accept these video  crews as necessary evils.  </P> <P> "With some commercials, the publicity can be as important as the commercials  themselves," said Joe Pytka, who directed the recent Bo Jackson commercial and  is directing Nike's upcoming Super Bowl ad. Pytka also directed the Lee Jeans  ad that was featured in a recent video.  </P> <P> Will these behind-the-scenes videos take the "magic" away from some ads?  </P> <P> In some cases, perhaps. For example, the "Making of Bo" behind-the-scenes video  reveals that Bo Jackson wasn't really wearing skates when he appeared on the  ice. "That disappointed me a little," said Pytka, who never showed Jackson's  feet during that sequence in his ad.  </P> <P> Pepsi, which makes some of the most talked-about commercials of any company,  says it doesn't see the value in these videos. "The problems of trying to get a  second camera crew on to a set can be a real hinderance," said Tod Mackenzie, a  Pepsi spokesman. "Everything else we do takes a back seat to the commercial  itself."  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Bozell Division Targets Entertainment  </P> <P> Bozell, the Los Angeles agency that places broadcast ads for clients such as  Warner Bros. and Lorimar Television, last week said it was setting up a special  entertainment division.  </P> <P> But the new division won't just handle TV and film spots. "When someone says  entertainment, everyone thinks of movies and television," said Dick Porter, who  has been named vice president and director of the entertainment division. "But  it also includes other activities like theme parks, sporting events and even  visitors bureaus."  </P> <P> Those are the kind of businesses that Bozell's new division hopes to attract.  </P> <P> Within the next year, Porter said he hopes to double the estimated $25 million  in current billings of clients in Bozell's entertainment division. That may  require some fancy footwork by Porter, who formerly worked at Bozell and most  recently was vice president of media at MGM. Several years ago, Bozell lost  DeLaurentiis Entertainment Group, one of its larger entertainment clients.  </P> <P> But no matter how much advertising a film does, there's one form of marketing  that usually works best of all, Porter said. "It's word of mouth that makes a  picture a hit or miss."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Contest Didn't Fly at First With Ad Chief  </P> <P> What does American Airlines have in common with Harry's Bar &amp; American  Grille?  </P> <P> How about a "write-alike" contest? And one Los Angeles advertising executive  isn't too thrilled about it.  </P> <P> That executive is Paul Keye, chairman of Keye/Donna/Pearlstein. About 11 years  ago, Keye came up with an idea to boost business at Harry's Bar in the ABC  Entertainment Center. He proposed an International Imitation Hemingway  Competition, in which writers were asked to compose short, original pieces that  mimic Hemingway' prose. An ad for the contest was placed in the New Yorker  magazine, and the winner was sent to the original Harry's Bar &amp; American  Grille in Florence, Italy -- an old Hemingway haunt.  </P> <P> Since then, the contest has made national news and won international  recognition, although it was discontinued in the past year.  </P> <P> Well, American Airlines recently announced a suspiciously similar competition  in its publication, American Way. Except that this contest asks people to mimic  the writing of author William Faulkner. The winner of the Faulkner Write-Alike  Contest gets a round-trip ticket for two to any place in the U.S. that American  flies.  </P> <P> "I felt it was so derivative and so unoriginal that I wrote them a blistering  letter," Keye said. "But the response I received from them was so gracious,  that I've decided to let it go."  </P></p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Shelling halts UN relief of Sarajevo THE old quarter of Sarajevo was bombarded by Serb irregular forces last night, defying fresh United Nations attempts to demilitarise and re-open the airport at the besieged Bosnian capital. Shelling also spread to other parts of the city and was heavily concentrated on the suburb of Dobrinja, which has been blockaded by Serb irregulars for the past 47 days. Bombardment of the city earlier forced UN officials to abandon plans to send in Canadian troops to take control of the airport. 'There is all out war here,' a UN official said, adding that the UN was trying to get the Bosnian presidency, the Serb irregulars, and Serbia's proxy army to sign a new agreement aimed at reopening the airport. Serb irregulars have blockaded the airport, preventing all food and humanitarian aid from reaching the city, whose 300,000 inhabitants have been besieged for 75 days. Members of the Territorial Defence force, which consists of Sarajevo's Moslem, Serb and Croat communities, and which is trying to defend the city, said yesterday that any new agreement was 'almost meaningless'. 'The Serbs sign a ceasefire, re-group, re-arm, and then bombard the city from the surrounding hills in an attempt to divide our city,' said Mr Mirsad Kulenovic, a former Yugoslav diplomat. Mr Sefer Halilovic, commander of the Territorial Defence force, criticised the UN for not doing enough to prevent the bombardment and killings. He said the UN had made no attempt to stop civilians in the suburb of Dobrinja from being taken out of their apartments by Serb irregulars. UN officials said their mandate limited them to negotiating the reopening of Sarajevo airport to allow an airlift of food into the city. Western diplomats and journalists in Sarajevo said that over the past three days, Serb irregulars had entered apartment blocks and had taken residents to a prison in Pale, east of Sarajevo, the headquarters of Mr Radovan Karadzic, and General Ratko Mladic, leaders of the Serb irregulars, and Serbia's proxy army. 'The innocent civilians are taken as hostages in exchange for Serb snipers captured by the Territorial Defence,' a western diplomat said. 'This is happening under the eyes of the UN. This is happening every day. It is unspeakable the evil which is taking place here.'</p>

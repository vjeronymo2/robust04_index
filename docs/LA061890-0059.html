THE MICROCHIP  </P> <P> The computer and I bet different races Sunday, but we still closed the week's  racing with losses.  </P> <P> Deposit Ticket in the fourth and Elusive Road in the fifth gave me two-thirds  of my triples, but Golden Voyager's easy victory in the sixth ruined them --  costing me $60.  </P> <P> Bob's Sunday Bankroll: $1,982  </P> <P> Sunday's Loss: $60  </P> <P> Current Bankroll: $1,922  </P> <P> The computer's bet in the eighth race, Classic Fame, finished behind two horses  that had been off for a total of nearly two years. Perhaps the computer, which  lost $80, should get back to BASIC.  </P> <P> Computer's Sunday Bankroll: $1,875.50  </P> <P> Sunday's Loss: $80  </P> <P> Current Bankroll: $1,795.50  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The following are recommendations (excerpts)  contained in a report submitted by the government's Tax  Commission to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on 21 June.    Section 1. Developments in tax reform after the "Interim  Report"    Section 2. Guidelines on concrete measures to implement tax  reform:    1. Building a balanced taxation system:    (2) Under a comprehensive program to promote tax reform,  it    is possible to implement the reduction of individual    income tax in advance of incrementing consumption  tax.    2. Ensuring fairness in the tax burden    3. Promoting administrative and fiscal reforms:    This commission strongly urges that such reforms be  implemented promptly and resolutely by both the national and  local governments under a specific guideline, simultaneously  with the implementation of concrete tax reform measures.  Members of the commission expressed the opinion that the  following specific steps be taken: Reorganization of the central  government ministries and agencies, retrenchment and  rationalization of semigovernmental corporations,  rationalization of personnel size in both national and local  governments, drastic review of all aspects of fiscal  requirements, and active measures to ease government regulation  and to narrow the gap between domestic and overseas prices.  While administrative reforms will not create substantial  revenue resources immediately, commission members expressed the  opinion that mid-term numerical targets or programs, such as a  "five-year plan for administrative reform" should be formulated  and implemented systematically by adopting concrete measures.    4. Feasible measures to cope with an aging society    (2) Increase in the people's share in the cost of dealing    with an aging society -- while it is believed that  the    concept of a (welfare) vision needs more rigorous    consideration, and more efforts need to be made to    achieve greater rationality and efficiency in welfare    systems and policies, a considerable increase in the    people's financial burden is still inevitable.    (3) Improvement of the fiscal system    (4) Necessity of increasing the tax burden    2) After considerable deliberation on the  (mechanical)    calculations [of the increase in tax burden], this    commission reached the following conclusions:    a. The people need to be informed  straightforwardly    about the increase in tax burden brought about  by    the increase in public services inherent in an    aging society.    b. Revenue sources for the redemption of stopgap    bonds should be dealt with in a proper way in  the    process of tax reform.    c. It is best to avoid having excessive  expectations    of a natural increase in tax collected.    d. Persistent efforts should undoubtedly be  exerted    to implement administrative and fiscal reforms,    and to ensure fairness in the tax burden, along    with implementation of concrete tax reform    measures. The scale of tax increase should be    held down to the minimum through such efforts.    Section 3. Reduction of individual income tax:    1. Basic thinking:    Tax brackets in the progressive tax rate structure should be  reclassified to lessen, as much as possible, the feeling among  the working population of a heavy tax burden, particularly the  middle- income group, the most productive segment of the labor  force.    2. Tax rate structure:    The application of each tax bracket should be expanded as  much as possible, particularly the 20-percent income tax  bracket, and the 10-percent individual residence tax bracket.  The highest tax rate should be reduced to about 50 percent.    3. Lowest taxable income:    In consideration of the additional burden on low-income tax  payers brought about by the increase in consumption tax, the  income threshold on which tax is paid will inevitably be raised.    Section 4. Increasing the consumption tax    1. Basic thinking:    It is necessary to raise the consumption tax rate, and  increase the share of consumption tax in the tax structure as a  whole.    2. Taxable consumption and tax rate structure:    No further exemptions from consumption tax should be  allowed.  The structure of a single applicable tax rate should be  maintained.    3. Preferential systems for small businesses:    (1) Tax exemption system for businesses -- Measures to    eventually include relatively large establishments in    taxable businesses should be considered.    (2) Simplified taxation system -- Scope of application    should be narrowed down, while also giving  consideration    to the clerical workload of small businesses.    (3) Deductible limit system -- Appropriate revision of  the    system, including possible abolition, is necessary.    4. Tax deduction for purchasing costs:    Keeping proof-of-purchase documents (invoices) -- vouchers,  delivery slips, or receipts -- should be included as one of the  requirements.    Section 5. Augmenting local revenue sources    1. Local revenue sources:    (1) The commission agreed on the significance of paying    taxes in the localities and checking how such tax    revenues are spent.    2. Possibility of a local consumption tax:    (2) Due to the need to increase local revenue sources,    the commission deliberated extensively the issue of a    "local consumption tax." The issue was considered in    relation to the problem of reducing the tax burden  for    individual residence tax, but the commission was not  in    a position to decide whether it is appropriate to    introduce this tax at present. It would like to  reach a    conclusion on the issue as soon as possible.</p>

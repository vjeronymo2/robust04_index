			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Inside Whitehall: Lobbyists welcome cabinet disclosure YESTERDAY'S cabinet committee disclosures were widely welcomed as a sign of greater openness. Knowing how and by whom collective decisions are made is already the common currency of those who make their living lobbying government, or whose business depends on it. Big organisations such as the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Directors - and large companies with sophisticated lobbying and public-relations sections - thought the move would make little practical difference because much of the information was already available to them. Mr Nigel Clarke, a director of GJW, a political consultancy, said that the publication itself was of limited value. 'Anyone involved in this area already knows these things exist,' he said, 'and it does not require the mind of Solomon to work out who's on them. None the less, Dr Ann Robinson, head of the policy unit at the Institute of Directors, said: 'I welcome more open government because it means better government.' Political lobbyists agreed in hoping the disclosures represented a greater readiness by the government to consult interested organisations. Mr Peter Luff, Tory MP for Worcester and a consultant with the lobbying company Good Relations, expressed a view shared by industry in welcoming the move as 'demystifying' relations with government. He thought it would have a salutary effect on lobbying companies. He said some sold information that encouraged clients to believe they obtained through 'conspiratorial' means, rather than relying on selling good advice about how to make a persuasive case to government. The reforms are likely to help the small-business sector, where expertise is not as great, and where specialist lobbyists are sometimes brought in to provide information that will now be readily available. Mr Stephen Alambritis of the National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses said the disclosures would be helpful in indicating which ministers were interested in certain subjects. In general, though, he did not think the current pattern of getting policies across would change much - small businesses, for example, would still be channelled through the Department of Trade and Industry and the relevant minister. Businesses and the lobbyists agreed that it was more important for them to know how to lobby effectively at an early stage, before a subject appeared on any cabinet committee's agenda. That was more important than discovering the identities of members of cabinet committees. Mr Clarke described much lobbying as going over policy details with middle-ranking departmental civil servants - 'where the decision starts'. Both categories also agreed, however, that while it would be helpful to know when cabinet committee meetings were taking place, so relevant points could be made, they could see why the government had decided against it. That was because of the danger that ministers could be swamped with too many approaches by the lobbyists. They had clearly come close to sharing a Whitehall view of the world before yesterday's disclosures.</p>

			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SESAME STREET LATEST KIDS' STORE ON BLOCK;  </P> <P> RETAILING: THE LIKES OF BERT AND ERNIE, BIG BIRD AND THE COOKIE MONSTER WILL  TEST THEIR MERCHANDISING STRENGTH AGAINST DISNEY AND HANNA-BARBERA OUTLETS.  </P> <P> Big Bird and Ernie met baby strollers -- lots of them -- parked outside the  nation's first Sesame Street retail store, which opened Thursday at South Coast  Plaza.  </P> <P> The Sesame Street General Store, which loosely resembles the set of the  long-running Public Broadcasting Service television show, is the first of a  dozen such outlets due to open in 1990. Three more stores will open this fall,  in Glendale, Palo Alto and San Francisco.  </P> <P> The Sesame Street store, operated by Sesame Street Retail Stores Inc. of  Hayward, Calif., features merchandise based on Sesame Street characters: Bert  and Ernie, Oscar the Grouch, Big Bird, Cookie Monster and Elmo.  </P> <P> The store is part of a growing trend toward stores specializing in cartoon or  TV characters. Walt Disney Co. has opened 67 Disney stores in the past three  years and Hanna-Barbera Productions recently opened two stores. The Disney  Store at South Coast Plaza opened in November, 1987.  </P> <P> "I think the Sesame Street concept will be a blockbuster," said Sarah Stack,  analyst with the Los Angeles brokerage Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards. "The  Sesame Street characters are easily as well-known as the Disney characters."  </P> <P> South Coast Plaza officials have gradually been building a children-oriented  section near the mall's Carousel Court. The new Sesame Street store joins The  Disney Store, F.A.O. Schwarz toy store, and the Bergstroms and GapKids  childrens clothing stores near the carousel.  </P> <P> The planning for Sesame Street stores has been in the works since 1988, said  Eugene Platin, president and chief executive of the chain, who was at the  Friday opening. The stores are targeting kids up to age 7 with clothing, toys,  books, stuffed animals, arts, crafts and games, home furnishings, and bed and  bath supplies.  </P> <P> Stack said the Sesame Street store is apparently trying to distinguish itself  from Disney by emphasizing an educational element. The Sesame Street store has  a wall where kids can draw and has other play spaces, while The Disney Store is  a more traditional outlet.  </P> <P> She said both will capitalize on the enormous popularity of their names. "The  name Disney or Sesame Street is a touchstone for all sorts of positive  associations," she said.  </P> <P> United Press International contributed to this article.  </P></p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Holidaymakers may sue Cunard Cunard, the shipping line owned by engineering and property conglomerate Trafalgar House, may be sued by holidaymakers denied a Christmas cruise on the QE2, Alan Cane writes. About 300 passengers were turned away hours before the liner set sail for New York on Saturday because of unfinished plumbing in about 100 of the 950 cabins. The action led to scuffles and chaos in the departure lounge. The QE2 returned from the Blohm and Voss shipyard in Hamburg last week where it had been undergoing a Pounds 30m refit. Sub-contractors had been working round the clock since the return to complete refurbishments on time but without success. Neither Cunard nor Trafalgar House could be contacted for comment last night. Reports suggest the shipping line had been offering disappointed holidaymakers a full refund, a free transatlantic cruise next year and Pounds 250 cash.</p>

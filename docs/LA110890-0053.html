			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO OFFICIALS OPTIMISTIC GAME WILL MAKE A RETURN VISIT  </P> <P> San Diego re-emerged Wednesday as a contender for the 1993 Super Bowl after the  National Football League announced that its decision to have Phoenix host the  game was endangered because of Arizona's failure to pass referenda honoring Dr.  Martin Luther King Jr.  </P> <P> Members of the San Diego Super Bowl Task Force were stunned earlier this year  when the city's bid to host the '93 event was thrown out on the first ballot.  But like a phoenix rising from the ashes, San Diego now appears reborn with  Phoenix on the outs.  </P> <P> The Washington Post quoted "a source close to (NFL Commissioner Paul)  Tagliabue" as saying there was an "80% chance" the game would be relocated to  San Diego.  </P> <P> In March, Phoenix edged out San Diego, San Francisco and Los Angeles for the  right to host the much-coveted game, which experts say represents a windfall in  excess of $150 million for the host city.  </P> <P> Mayor Maureen O'Connor sent a letter to Tagliabue on Wednesday, expressing  interest in having the NFL consider San Diego its alternate host. Paul Downey,  a spokesman for the mayor, said the $125 million brought into the city by Super  Bowl XXII in 1988 was a big reason.  </P> <P> Asked if San Diego had a chance to grab the '93 game, Downey said, "Absolutely,  absolutely. Many of the pundits earlier this year said San Diego and Los  Angeles were the favorites, but (Phoenix Cardinals' owner) Bill Bidwill  literally begged fellow owners."  </P> <P> Bidwill's dream of having the game in Phoenix appeared doomed late Tuesday  after Arizona voters rejected two ballot initiatives, either of which would  have designated a state holiday in honor of the civil rights leader, who was  slain in 1968.  </P> <P> Philadelphia Eagles owner Norman Braman, chairman of the NFL's Super Bowl Site  Selection Committee, said earlier this year that he would spearhead a drive to  have Phoenix removed as host if the King initiatives failed.  </P> <P> Chargers' owner Alex Spanos said Wednesday he would support Braman in moving  the game elsewhere -- specifically, to San Diego.  </P> <P> "I was very disappointed we didn't get it last March," Spanos said from his  Stockton office. "I thought we had a great chance to get it then. My opinion is  that it belongs there (San Diego). I'm sorry Phoenix is having the problems  it's having, but I would love it if we would have it in (San Diego) Jack Murphy  Stadium."  </P> <P> Spanos said he's hopeful the Chargers will have a team capable of playing in  the Super Bowl by 1993.  </P> <P> "That would be the best thing of all," he said. "But I make no predictions. I  quit doing that last year."  </P> <P> NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said Wednesday the issue would not be on the agenda  at a meeting of league owners for next Wednesday in Dallas.  </P> <P> Asked whether the new site would be limited to those cities that finished  behind Phoenix in balloting for the '93 game, or whether a wide-open  competition would result, Aiello said, "We just can't say. We had no plans for  an alternate site, for the likelihood that this might happen."  </P> <P> But Leon Parma, a member of the executive committee of the San Diego Super Bowl  Task Force, said Wednesday he had conferred with several NFL owners who assured  him the new site would be limited to those cities that finished behind Phoenix  in the balloting for '93.  </P> <P> Parma said league owners were "high on San Diego" because of the success of the  1988 Super Bowl, which then-Commissioner Pete Rozelle labeled "the best ever."  Parma noted that Rozelle is now a resident of Fairbanks Ranch in North San  Diego County.  </P> <P> Eagles' owner Braman, who led the anti-Phoenix lobby, is an officer of the  Greater Miami Jewish Federation and the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith  in Miami, one of his two cities of residence. One of the United States' leading  supporters of Israel, Braman also is active in Miami's black community.  </P> <P> "I know Norman Braman to be a man with a strong social conscience," said Arthur  Teitelbaum, Southern area director for the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai  B'rith. "I'm not surprised at all that he's taken a position that expresses  such concern and sensitivity to the memory of Dr. King."  </P> <P> But, ironically, San Diego has had its own controversies in how to honor the  civil rights leader, and some community figures speculated Wednesday that its  reluctance to pay proper tribute may play a role in the Super Bowl sweepstakes.  </P> <P> Market Street was re-named in honor of Dr. King, then named Market Street again  after area merchants complained. A proposal to have the San Diego Convention  Center named after King was rejected. And, finally, a portion of California 94  was dedicated in King's memory.  </P> <P> "Maybe the NFL will put the same conditions on San Diego," said City Councilman  Wes Pratt, who is black.  </P> <P> But Pratt said he supports the city's bid to host the game in 1993 and added,  "We do honor his holiday in the state and the county, and the city now has a  floating holiday (in honor of Dr. King). We have a degree of responsiveness  here that you just don't have in Phoenix. And I certainly urge the mayor to  rekindle the efforts to get the game here. It represents a tremendous economic  boon and opportunity for the city."  </P> <P> Pratt said San Diego's chances for bringing the game here as a result of  Arizona's controversy over King may focus attention "on the memory of the man  in a positive way. The city is considering a multitude of ideas (for honoring  King), one of which is a scholarship fund for children. Things are happening  with this issue. It's not dead, it's not dying, and the city will be forced to  deal with it further because of this Super Bowl question."  </P></p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Prediction likely to be bad bet Sir, Surely Laura Thompson ('Keep betting in the dark', July 25) is still living in the days of prohibition by suggesting that government deregulation is bad for the betting industry. She should perhaps reflect on the benefits to the consumer within the brewing and drink retailing industries in the provision of improved leisure facilities. The standards of comfort and catering have never been better. Her prediction that 'the bright new betting shops will lose more customers than they attract' will certainly prove to be one of her worst bets.

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Lloyd's Names vote in support of business strategy LLOYD'S OF LONDON members have strongly rejected moves to make new investors help bale out badly hit Names, boosting the confidence of the insurance market's management team as it seeks to attract fresh capital. Lloyd's announced yesterday that Names - the individuals whose assets support the market - had voted in a postal ballot by a margin of more than two to one to reject two motions opposed to plans put forward by the market's management. Mr David Rowland, chairman, said the result was 'a mandate to implement its business plan and return Lloyd's to profit'. The business plan, approved by the council, or governing body, in April, proposes sharp cost cutting and streamlining of business procedures to make the market more attractive to corporate investors. A vote in favour of two motions presented by loss-making Names would have severely damaged investor confidence in the market which has suffered losses of more than Pounds 5.5bn over the past five years. The market faces mounting litigation between loss-making Names and the agents who manage their interests. The rebel Names who had called for the ballot drew attention to the low response - only 18,137 Names voted, although 32,023 were eligible to do so. They said more Names had voted in favour of the critical motions than in a postal ballot last year. 'There are still a third of Lloyd's Names who are dissatisfied with the way things are being done,' said Mr Claud Gurney, the Name who called for last month's extraordinary general meeting which preceded the ballot. A total of 5,673 Names voted in favour and 12,104 Names against a motion calling on Lloyd's to accept that it owes a fiduciary duty of care to members. A resolution calling on Lloyd's to press new corporate investors to 'fully compensate' existing Names for a stake in the goodwill and assets of the Corporation of Lloyd's attracted 5,486 votes in favour and 12,252 against. Finally 13,623 names voted in favour and 4,179 Names against a third motion backing the council, its business plan and its moves to introduce corporate capital. The Association of Lloyd's Members, the biggest organisation of Names, welcomed the vote. Mr Neil Shaw, chairman of the ALM, said: 'We hope this marks an end to trial by extraordinary general meeting and an honest commitment to support for a realistic business plan.' Mr Richard Astor, a Name associated with past EGM initiatives, lamented the result: 'They deserve everything they get if this is the way they react.' General Accident results, Page 15</p>

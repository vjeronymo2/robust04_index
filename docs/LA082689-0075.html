			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POPE MEETS SENIOR SOVIET ENVOY FOR TALKS ON RELIGION, MIDEAST  </P> <P> Pope John Paul II met a senior Soviet envoy this week for talks on religious  freedom and the Middle East, the Vatican said.  </P> <P> The talks with Yuri Karlov, a personal representative of Soviet Foreign  Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, follow reports that the Vatican is studying a  possible papal visit to Lebanon.  </P> <P> The Polish-born pontiff is also widely expected to have an unprecedented  meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev if Gorbachev goes ahead with a  visit to Italy in November.  </P> <P> "Mr. Karlov discussed matters of common interest with the Holy Father, such as  religious freedom and peace in the world, with particular reference to the  Middle East," Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said.  </P> <P> Vatican and diplomatic sources say the Vatican has been studying the  feasibility of a lightning trip by John Paul to Lebanon. On Aug. 15, the Pope  said he felt an "interior command" to go there because of the upsurge in  violence.  </P> <P> He has directly accused Syria of seeking the destruction of the country and  appealed for an immediate end to fighting.  </P> <P> Vatican-Soviet relations have warmed gradually since June, 1988, when a  top-level Catholic delegation visited the Soviet Union for celebrations to mark  1,000 years of Russian Christianity.  </P> <P> But a major problem remains the Soviet Union's continued ban on the underground  Ukrainian Catholic Church, which Moscow does not recognize.  </P></p>

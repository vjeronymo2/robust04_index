			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRIFT TOWARD CHAOS IN U.S.  </P> <P> Congress-bashing, virtually institutionalized by Ronald Reagan and carried on  with a vengeance by his successor, is very much in vogue these days. It is  indefensible, on the face of it.  </P> <P> With 435 individual members in the House and 100 in the Senate, representing  the many and varied interests of 50 states and 250 million people, it is not at  all surprising that consensus is hard to come by. When you add to the mix  innumerable special interests, lobbies and the like, together with the  inevitable pulling and tugging within both parties from their own disparate  wings, it is in fact remarkable that anything gets accomplished at all. To  blame Congress for all our follies is simply too facile. And shockingly  irresponsible.  </P> <P> Further, it should be noted that President Bush has vetoed some 14 or 15 bills  that Congress did pass. The vetoes were sustained. But we know how hard it is  to come up with even a simple majority, let alone the necessary two-thirds to  override. Which raises an interesting question: Who is the real obstructionist?  </P> <P> SY KASOFF, North Hollywood  </P></p>

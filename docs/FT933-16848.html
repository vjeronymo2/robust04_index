			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: Philips to show gain of Fl 1.1bn on MEC sale PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, stands to make an extraordinary gain of Fl 1.1bn (Dollars 579m) on the recent sale of its minority stake in a semi-conductor joint venture to Matsushita of Japan. The gain, which is in line with analysts' predictions, will be included in second-quarter results due out on August 5. In May, Philips announced it was selling its 35 per cent stake in Matsushita Electronics Corp to its long-standing joint venture partner, Matsushita, for Fl 3bn. The company had declined to say how big the extraordinary gain would be. However, Philips was required to disclose the figure when filing its annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US, where it maintains a listing of ordinary shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Philips confirmed it would be using the proceeds of the MEC sale to redeem debt and to begin the process of cutting short-term debt. Part of the proceeds will be earmarked for early redemption of Fl 540m in outstanding conversion certificates issued by its finance company. It said the figure of Fl 1.1bn included foreign exchange gains as well as the cost of provisions needed to end or divest other parts of the Philips group. It declined to give details of the projected provisions. The extraordinary gain will significantly boost second-quarter results. In the first quarter, Philips' net profit fell by more than one-third to Fl 103m, due mainly to a drop in orders at its communications systems business in Germany. The divestment of MEC is expected, on balance, to be positive for Philips. The Japanese-based joint venture was barely profitable in recent years, and the reduction in debt will enable Philips to achieve savings on interest charges.</p>

The proposed Technical Specifications (TS) change does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Increasing the spent fuel storage capacity in the Unit 1 Spent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fuel Pool (SFP) from 2040 fuel assemblies to 2500 fuel assemblies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not increase the probability of occurrence of an accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since all fuel handling activities will be performed using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved procedures and compatible equipment, the probability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a fuel handling accident occurring is unchanged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Increasing the spent fuel storage capacity in the Unit 1 SFP to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2500 fuel assemblies will facilitate storing 1940 spent fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assemblies (including contingency) that have been discharged from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LGS, Units 1 and 2, and 560 low exposure fuel assemblies shipped  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to LGS from the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station. The decay heat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> load associated with the entire Shoreham fuel inventory is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insignificant, since it equates to less than 5% of the heat load  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generated from one (1) recently discharged full power fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bundle. Therefore, the actual decay heat load to the Unit 1 SFP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be equivalent to that which is generated from storing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1940 spent fuel assemblies discharged from LGS, Units 1 and 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Increasing the spent fuel storage capacity in the Unit 1 SFP to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accommodate the storage of 2500 fuel assemblies, as proposed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this TS Change Request, is bounded by the existing analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supporting the storage of spent fuel at LGS. The existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis considers design inputs for structural integrity,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criticality, and thermal-hydraulics and is based on the storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 2862 spent fuel assemblies. As documented in Section 9.1.3,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Spent Fuel Pool Cooling and Cleanup Systems,'' of Supplement 2 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NRC's Safety Evaluation Report, i.e., NUREG&hyph;0991, ``Safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evaluation Report Related to the Operation of Limerick Generating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Station, Units 1 and 2,'' the NRC indicated that based on its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> independent analysis the heat removal capability of the Fuel Pool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cooling and Cleanup (FPCC) system could only support 2484 spent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel assemblies. However, the LGS, Unit 1 TS currently limit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage of spent fuel to 2040 spent fuel assemblies. Since the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decay heat load from the Shoreham fuel inventory (i.e., 560 fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assemblies) is insignificant, the actual heat load to the Unit 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SFP will be equivalent to that generated from 1940 fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assemblies discharged from LGS, Units 1 and 2, which is less than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the limit currently specified [in] the TS (i.e., 2040 fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assemblies).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Relocating six (6) of the existing Unit 2 spent fuel storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> racks to the Unit 1 SFP will be conducted in accordance with PECO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Energy's Heavy Loads Program which was developed in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement the guidance delineated in NUREG&hyph;0612, ``Control of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Heavy Loads at Nuclear Power Plants,'' such that the likelihood of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a heavy load drop is precluded. The Unit 2 spent fuel storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> racks are identical to those already in use in the Unit 1 SFP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Procedures will be in place to ensure that the Unit 2 spent fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage racks are situated in the Unit 1 SFP to insure [ensure]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proper neutron poison alignment with the existing Unit 1 racks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The existing spent fuel storage racks are designed for rack-to-rack contact during design basis events without the loss of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structural integrity. The racks are also designed to withstand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the impact from a dropped fuel assembly without the loss of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structural integrity or be damaged in a way that could adversely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affect the criticality analysis. Increasing the spent fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage capacity to accommodate the storage of 2500 spent fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assemblies will not affect the spent fuel storage racks since the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> racks are specifically designed to safely store spent fuel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed TS change will not prevent the ability of the FPCC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system from performing its design function to adequately cool the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SFP. The FPCC system will continue to function normally and be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capable of maintaining the SFP temperature at or below 140  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The backup cooling and makeup systems (i.e., Residual Heat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Removal (RHR), Emergency Service Water (ESW), and Residual Heat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Removal Service Water (RHRSW) systems) will continue to function  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as designed to provide an alternate source of cooling and makeup  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water to ensure SFP cooling is maintained. The RHR system is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> still capable of maintaining the SFP temperature less than 140  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as described in LGS Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Increasing the spent fuel storage capacity in the Unit 1 SFP will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not increase the probability of a loss of fuel pool cooling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident or adversely affect the Refuel Floor ventilation system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The consequences of a Fuel Handling Accident as described in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LGS UFSAR are not increased since the number of fuel assemblies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stored in a SFP is not an input to the initial conditions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident evaluation. This accident evaluates the dropping of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spent fuel assembly and the fuel grapple assembly into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactor core during refueling operations. A drop height of 32  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feet for the spent fuel assembly and 47 feet for the fuel grapple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assembly are assumed and will produce the largest number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failed fuel rods. Since the maximum possible height a fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assembly can be dropped over the SFP does not exceed 32 feet, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences of a Fuel Handling Accident will not be increased by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasing the number of fuel storage cells.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The consequences of a loss of fuel pool cooling as described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 9.1.3.6 of the LGS UFSAR will not be increased. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> event described in the UFSAR assumes that the iodine in the fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from past refuelings is negligible, due to the long decay time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Iodine is the major contributor to thyroid dose. Since the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iodine in the fuel from past refuelings is negligible, due to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long decay time, increasing the spent fuel storage capacity will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not increase the dose due to the release of iodine in the SFP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water resulting from boiling and therefore, the consequences are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not increased.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

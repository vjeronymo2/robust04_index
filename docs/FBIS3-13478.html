In an interview with  the ASSOCIATED PRESS OF PAKISTAN in Islamabad today, he refuted  the Indian claim that the resolution has been withdrawn. The  resolution was presented, but no voting was held on it.  However, it is still there as a document. Regarding the visit  of Muslim ambassadors, he said Pakistan had a clear commitment  from the Indian Government in which a visit by Muslim  ambassadors to Kashmir was agreed upon as a part of the  understanding for not proceeding with a vote on the resolution.  Therefore, the Indian claim is incorrect in every respect.  Shaharyar Khan said that one of the two main objectives  envisaged by Pakistan by presenting the resolution at an UN  agency was to stop the oppression and violence against the  people of Kashmir and violation of their human rights. The  other was to draw the world attention to the Kashmir issue for  the first time in 30 years.    The foreign secretary said that it is already clear that  India is adopting a more transparent method in dealing with the  Kashmir situation as a result of the international pressure.  The group of International Committee for Red Cross, Amnesty  International, and the ambassadors based in Delhi has been  invited to visit Kashmir, and now the world community will  strongly react to Indian Government's atrocities and violence  against the Kashmiri people. Moreover, the world public opinion  is now focused on India and the foreign office of every country  considers the treatment of the Kashmiri people as an important  issue of the international agenda.</p>

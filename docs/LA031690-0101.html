			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAJOR PENSION FUNDS PRESS EXXON FOR MEETING  </P> <P> One observer is calling it "Larry &amp; Me."  </P> <P> Exxon Corp. Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl has already turned down one request for a  meeting with New York City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, who manages five  city pension plans that own Exxon stock, to discuss the company's environmental  record.  </P> <P> Now, Holtzman and officials for California and Massachusetts pension funds --  both large institutional shareholders of Exxon -- will be sending Rawl a second  letter seeking a meeting to discuss the company's actions since last year's oil  spill in Alaska and more recent spills in the Arthur Kill waterway between New  York and New Jersey.  </P> <P> Rawl's elusiveness led a Holtzman colleague to allude to the popular  documentary film, "Roger &amp; Me," in which General Motors Corp. Chairman  Roger B. Smith dodged meetings with filmmaker Michael Moore, who wanted to ask  him about the effect of GM's plant closures on Flint, Mich.  </P> <P> The letter will go out as soon as Monday, signed by Holtzman, California  Controller Gray Davis and Massachusetts pension fund Director Paul Quirk, Quirk  confirmed Thursday.  </P> <P> "It's not our intent to do anything more than to try to sort this out," Quirk  said Thursday. He said the pension officials were seeking "a way of dealing  with the concerns we have as shareholders."  </P> <P> Those concerns include losses that Exxon will incur from the spills. Total  costs for the Alaska spill are now in the range of $3 billion to $4 billion,  and the company could face future liability from civil suits and a federal  criminal indictment.  </P> <P> Holtzman, who is the custodian and asset manager of five New York City pension  systems that own more than 6 million Exxon common shares, declined to comment  on the new letter to Rawl. But, she said, "We're very concerned with the  apparently careless, negligent attitude with regard to the environment that  could negatively affect the value of our shares."  </P> <P> Analysts said Exxon's stock, trading at around $44.50 per share at the time of  the Exxon Valdez accident and closing at $46.875 Thursday, has not kept pace  with other oil industry stocks, which have appreciated as much as 30% to 40%  over the same period.  </P> <P> Bill Smith, a spokesman for Exxon, said he was not aware of any efforts to  reach Rawl and could not comment on the requests Thursday.  </P> <P> In a letter dated Jan. 12, Holtzman asked to meet with Rawl and Exxon officials  to discuss the company's progress in improving environmental safety. She posed  a number of pointed questions about the spills in Arthur Kill from a pipeline  to Exxon's Bayway Refinery, and requested detailed information about costs  related to litigation resulting from the various spills.  </P> <P> In a response dated Jan. 16, Exxon President Lee R. Raymond said it was  "premature" to meet with Holtzman, but he attempted to answer a number of her  questions. "We are dedicated to your interests in protecting the environment in  areas where we operate and, at the same time, providing superior financial  returns to our shareholders," he wrote.  </P> <P> But, he added, "Until our factual investigation (into the Arthur Kill spill) is  completed, it would be premature to contemplate a meeting."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Davis, who is a trustee of the California Public Employees'  Retirement System, called on Rawl to resign, blaming him for what he called  Exxon's lack of interest in environmental safety. Davis said he was speaking  for himself, not for CalPERS, which owns 8.24 million Exxon shares.  </P> <P> "If they were interested in environmental safety, it would be a reality," he  said in an interview Wednesday. "Clearly, the CEO is not interested, and I  think he should resign in shame."  </P> <P> Davis, who is up for reelection as controller, has been mentioned as a possible  Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in 1992.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] There has been a new episode in the continuing  farces of Baghdad rulers: Saddam Husayn fired Prime Minister  Ahmad Husayn and his government. In a dictatorial decree, he  appointed himself prime minister. Through this ploy, Saddam is  trying to blame Ahmad Husayn and his ministers for the  suffocating economic and social crises from which the Iraqi  masses are suffering.    But this farce means nothing to the Iraqi citizens; it can  never mislead the Iraqi people. As president, Saddam Husayn has  failed to find any solution to the problems of the Iraqis,  problems caused by his own wrong policies. How then can he, as  prime minister, save the Iraqis from their tragedies and  ordeals? Apart from this, the Iraqi citizen knows full well  that Saddam Husayn is the source of all power in Iraq: the  legislative, executive, and judicial. No power in Iraq can  implement a law, make a decision, or pass a ruling without  Saddam's approval. The law of force prevails in Iraq, and  Saddam is its source.    If Saddam enjoys absolute power to do whatever he wants--or,  indeed, if he is the sole source of power--then why did he want  to take the premiership for himself? Is it because Saddam  Husayn has a brain capable of saving the Iraqis from the plights  and tragedies that he himself created? We believe that there  are many reasons behind Saddam's decision to take the prime  ministry for himself. These reasons, we believe, have nothing to  do with the failure of this or that ministerial group to address  the economic situation. These reasons include the following:    1. The lack of confidence between Saddam Husayn and his  closest allies in the government.    2. The desire not to allow any government or party official  to remain in a post through which he may [words indistinct]. In  this context, we can mention Sa'dun Hammadi, Muhammad Hamzah  al-Zubaydi, and Ahmad Husayn. They all served as prime  ministers but were sacked by Saddam Husayn within less than four  years.    3. An attempt to delude the Iraqi people into thinking that  Saddam Husayn is not the sole reason behind the deterioration of  the economic and social conditions in Iraq.    4. The blunder and [word indistinct] in the top ranks of  authority and the need to remove from power the regime officials  who are not from the ruling family. This is probably the  strongest of all the reasons. Here, we must recall the  accusations leveled by 'Udayy Saddam Husayn against the regime's  ministers, ambassadors, and diplomats in one of his articles in  BABIL in March. The article was full of criticism injected with  threats against the ministers. 'Udayy accused the ministers and  the diplomats of negligence and incompetence. He branded the  ambassadors as brokers and traders in carpets and female  journalists. He underestimated the standing of people in most  of the regime's ministries. That (?article) was the first step  in removing many regime figures whom Saddam did not like to see  in power. At that time, we explained 'Udayy's threats as the  first step in a plan to remove many officials from sensitive  posts in the regime's institutions to allow the ruling family to  interfere in the most minute details in the life of the Iraqi  citizen.    Surely, if things continue like this, the regime's Council  of  Ministers, the Revolution Command Council, and all important  posts will be distributed among Saddam Husayn's relatives and  henchmen. At any rate, we think that this move is too late.  Saddam's attempts to save the dictatorial regime from collapse  are doomed. They will not negate the fact that the regime has  been turned into a defective body moaning under the yoke of its  deep wounds and drawing its last breath.</p>

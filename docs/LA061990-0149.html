			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PULL CHIP OFF MARKET, MOTOROLA ORDERED  </P> <P> A federal judge today ordered Motorola Inc. to pull a key computer chip off the  market, dealing a setback to the company in a legal battle over trade secrets  with former partner Hitachi Ltd.  </P> <P> The order will also prevent Hitachi from selling its own microprocessor in the  United States.  </P> <P> Motorola said it will immediately appeal the decision by U.S. District Judge  Lucius D. Bunton of Midland. Bunton's order was released in Austin, where  Motorola's MC68030 microprocessor is made.  </P> <P> A microprocessor is a computer chip that handles the processing functions in a  computer.  </P> <P> In a statement from its Schaumburg, Ill., headquarters, Motorola said it  expects a patent appeals court to stay Bunton's order. The company said it is  confident that it will continue to provide an uninterrupted supply of its  market-leading microprocessor to customers.  </P> <P> Bunton banned the sale of the chips March 29 and fined both companies, saying  they violated each other's patents.  </P> <P> But he stayed the order a day later after Motorola argued that the chip ban  could devastate outside computer makers that depend on Motorola microprocessors  to run their machines.  </P> <P> Today's order lifts the stay. The judge said the companies have been given  enough time to settle on their own.  </P> <P> "The parties have chosen not to forge a settlement in the interim, and this  court is not inclined to continue its indulgence," Bunton said.  </P> <P> Motorola contends that Bunton's order gives Hitachi unequal bargaining power in  any settlement negotiations because, as Bunton said in his order, Motorola's  processor is more "commercially viable" than Hitachi's.  </P> <P> Hitachi said it needed the injunction because Motorola could continue to design  around the MC68030, which would eliminate any incentive for Motorola to settle  the patent infringement dispute.  </P></p>

Foreign enterprises should be given the opportunity to acquire  Russian state enterprises, the environment minister said in an  interview with HANDELSBLATT. Although enterprises are currently  being privatized it does not take place in the way "that I  consider necessary."    For the reformist politician it is impossible to understand  why the Russian Government does not use the possibility to  mobilize foreign capital by selling state enterprises. In view  of the pronounced decline in production in Russian industry,  funds for investment are very scarce, Danilov-Danilyan said.    The country is not able by itself to modernize enterprises  and thus to reduce the burden on the environment. The minister  is convinced that Russian industry must be modernized to achieve  success in the area of ecology in Russia. Higher direct  investment by foreign enterprises might help to eliminate the  capital shortage.    The environment minister confirmed the figures contained in  a  report issued by the German Economic Research Institute, Berlin,  according to which the share of environmental investment in  total investment in Russia was 2 percent in 1992 and continues  to decrease. This decline can be ended only when industrial  production recovers, Danilov-Danilyan said. The government is  of the opinion that 1994 will be the last year of falling  production in the Russian Federation.    He said he did not understand the "inactivity of German  enterprises" regarding investment projects in Russia. Regarding  the major projects that involve billions of rubles for the  development and production of oil and natural gas, German  companies did "not stand out," and the Russians noticed a "lack  of initiative." The environment minister does not accept the  argument of difficult financing. "The Americans and Japanese  have managed to establish themselves on the Russian market."  The Germans should follow their example.    Still, as far as smaller projects are concerned, cooperation  does work. At the Terratec special fair for environmental  protection two contracts were signed on German-Russian  cooperation in the sphere of environmental protection. One  project is the development of a measuring network for the  continuous monitoring of the air quality in the Saratov area.  This is a first step to include Russia into the European  environmental data network. The partner to the contract is the  Committee for Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of  the Saratov area and Medium-Sensor GmbH in Berlin.    The second agreement has to do with the development of an  industry for the processing of secondary plastics in the Russian  Federation. A processing plant with a capacity of 1,000 tonnes  per month should be set up in the first phase. The partners to  the contract are the industrial and trading company Cooperation  and Development Ltd., Moscow, and the Ostimex Import und Export  Handelsgesellschaft mbH, Berlin.    Things are taking place on a regional level, too. The  district committee of Ekaterinburg (formerly Sverdlovsk) last  year bought two mobile environmental monitoring stations in  Germany. These stations were financed by the Russian ecological  funds. These come from payments from enterprises that pollute  the environment. The German-Russian project for the cleansing  of the Tula area is also being financed through local funds.    For Danilov-Danilyan, Germany is one of the leading  countries  in the area of environmental technology. However, even Russia  has very good environmental technologies. A series of  innovative achievements, which were originally developed in  armament enterprises, can be used also for environmental  protection. A plant for the incineration of toxic refuse was,  for example, developed on the basis of a rocket engine.  Temperatures of up to 3,500 degrees are reached in this  process. The environment minister is hoping that this year it  will be possible to finance the program "Conversion for  Environmental Protection," which was developed more than two  years ago. The program consists of several hundreds of projects  whose development has been concluded. The "real achievements"  in the area of conversion are not yet very impressive,  Danilov-Danilyan stated.</p>

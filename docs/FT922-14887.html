			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / ITC chief backs calls for fewer TV groups MR George Russell, chairman of the Independent Television Commission, last night backed the growing calls for fewer and larger ITV companies. He acknowledged that some ITV chairmen wanted a reduction in the number of ITV companies from 16 to no more than four or five in order to stave off foreign takeovers. 'Personally I'm unperturbed at the prospect of mergers,' Mr Russell said, although that would require an amendment to the rules of ownership in the 1990 Broadcasting Act. The commission would hold licensees to their obligations on regional programming whether there were mergers or not. Mr Russell, in the annual Fleming Memorial lecture, attacked the rules allowing European Community companies to take over ITV companies wholly while in most cases British companies were prevented from controlling broadcasters in other Community countries. From 1994, at least in theory, all 16 ITV licences could be held by European companies based outside the UK. Mr Russell said: 'That's only acceptable if British companies are given the same opportunities in Europe.' He also urged: Broadcasting of news in the UK should be run on more businesslike lines if its potential is to be fulfilled. A single regulatory body should be set up to cover all broadcasting, including the BBC, as a way of cutting over-regulation and government interference.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Business and the Environment: Down and out, but still on the freeway - Urban air pollution / Louise Kehoe takes a drive to Los Angeles WELCOME to 'Smog City', the place with the dirtiest air and more cars per capita than any other city in the US. The yellowish grime that hangs over California's largest metropolis for much of the year is grim testimony to the fact that even the strictest air-quality regulations cannot resolve the conflict between nature and the car. To be without a car in Los Angeles is to be down and out. Even public housing 'projects' for the poor have car parks. While cycling and walking may be popular forms of exercise, they are no way to get around this sprawling asphalt jungle, where a 100-mile commute to work is nothing out of the ordinary. Smog is the price that Los Angelenos pay for their automobile-centred lifestyle. Climate and geography combine to exacerbate the problem. For about 10 months of the year Los Angeles enjoys balmy sunshine. The city's urban sprawl is centred in a natural basin that prevents its atmospheric effluent from dissipating. Los Angeles may have the most severe air-pollution in the US, but nowhere else has the problem been attacked more vigorously. South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) regulators, with responsibility for Los Angeles and neighbouring Orange and Riverside counties, have set the pace by instituting stringent controls over atmospheric emissions by industry and individual residents. Controls that are only beginning to take effect in many parts of the US and elsewhere have long been standard in California. Catalytic converters, which reduce car exhaust emissions have been mandatory in the state for almost 20 years. In one of its most unpopular moves, the SCAQMD last year banned the use of lighter fluid in garden barbecues. There are signs that the assault is beginning to pay off. According to state statistics, Los Angeles had less low-level ozone pollution in 1991 than at any time since measuring began 16 years ago. Analysis of last year's smog season shows that the Southern California basin had a record low 129 days in which lung-damaging ozone exceeded the federal standard of 0.12 parts per million. Maintaining the trend towards cleaner air will, however, require increasingly drastic and expensive compromises. But weaning Californians from the private sanctum of their automobiles may be impossible. According to a recent study conducted by the California Institute of Energy Efficiencies, most drivers would prefer to switch to alternative-fueled cars rather than use car pools or mass transit. Los Angeles air-quality regulators have launched an ambitious goal to replace approximately 17 per cent of conventional petrol-burning cars in the region, or more than 1m automobiles, with electric vehicles by the year 2010. The city has also embarked upon plans to build what could become one of the most extensive light rail, mass transit systems in the US. While the pattern of pollution, with smog hanging over freeway corridors, makes it all too obvious to Californians that the automobile is the prime culprit, industry is also being required to clean up its act. After two years of studying the pros and cons, SCAQMD recently voted to move ahead on a revolutionary 'smog exchange' plan that would replace current regulations on industrial air pollution with a trading market enabling companies to buy or sell the right to emit pollutants. The SCAQMD believes that the market system will provide incentives to eliminate air pollution faster than its current regulatory system, while also saving industry hundreds of millions of dollars. Implementation of the system awaits final approval, but if the go-ahead is given as expected later this month, trading by 2,000 industrial polluters could begin in 1994. These industrial facilities are said to be responsible for 85 per cent of the region's industrial hydrocarbon emissions. Under the proposed system, each company would initially be issued a number of smog exchange shares, based on past emissions. A single share would be worth a pound of pollutant per month. Over the first 10 years, the 'pollution' value of each share would decline, thus forcing a clean-up. In exchange for their participation in the market, businesses would no longer be subject to air pollution rules that specify certain equipment or methods to reduce pollutants. Companies could meet their emissions targets in whatever way they chose. Those that found ways to reduce their emissions beyond the clean-up target could sell their credits to another business that was unable to meet its reduction target. Los Angeles' efforts to overcome its severe smog problems, combined with the city's concentration of industrial and environmental interest groups, have made it a test-bed for environmental regulation with influence throughout the US and even further afield. The series will conclude next week in Bangkok.</p>

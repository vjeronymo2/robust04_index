			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Development Securities cuts deficit to Pounds 2.6m DEVELOPMENT Securities, formerly Clayform Properties, yesterday announced pre-tax losses down by Pounds 9.7m to Pounds 2.6m for the six months to June 30. Turnover was Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 35.7m), of which Pounds 12.1m (Pounds 26.5m) came from discontinued operations. Losses per share were reduced to 7.8p (35.1p). Mr Michael Wigley, chairman, said the results reflec-ted the successful continua-tion of the debt-reduction policy. In June the company appointed Mr Martin Landau - a property entrepreneur - to the board, and the following month raised Pounds 27.1m through a placing and open offer. To reflect the new phase in the group's affairs, Mr Wigley said, the company then changed its name to Development Securities. In addition to the placing, in March the company raised Pounds 1m through the sale of its 77 per cent stake in Dunloe House, and in April Stead &amp; Simpson was sold for a nominal sum, resulting in a further reduction of Pounds 3m in group borrowings. Since the period end some further disposals had been completed and opportunities were being sought to improve the quality of the portfolio, Mr Wigley said.</p>

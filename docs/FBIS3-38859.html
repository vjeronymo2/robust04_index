			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to the Hungarian foreign minister [Geza  Jeszenszky], as a result of the Partnership for Peace program  signed with NATO, Hungary's security has strengthened.  Jeszenszky talked about this when he signed the document in  Brussels.    However, the head of Hungarian diplomacy emphasized that the  Partnership for Peace program could not substitute for full NATO  membership. Speaking about the practical forms of cooperation,  Jeszenszky said that joint planning and military exercises could  be discussed. Moreover, it would be good to involve experts  from the North Atlantic alliance in the Hungarian Army's  modernization program. Jeszenszky, however, said that Hungary  did not wish to participate in peacekeeping with large units.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 24 May (NA) -- The Criminal Court  has upheld the dismissal of former de facto President Jorge  Rafael Videla in a case filed by the Interior Ministry for  allegedly approving a crime.    Following Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf's instructions,  Alicia Pierini, the Interior Ministry under secretary for human  rights, pressed charges following remarks he made during an  amity dinner with retired military officers.    The former military officer noted that "he should have been  given an award for his part in the struggle against subversion."  Videla described himself as "a scapegoat of that struggle."  [passage omitted]    The dismissal ruling mentions that Videla confirmed making  the remarks mentioned in the charges, but, according to the  judges, he did not maliciously seek to have his remarks  published by newspapers or retold outside the group attending  the dinner.</p>

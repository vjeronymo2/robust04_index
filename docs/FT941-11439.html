			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Film institute's budgeting rapped The British Film Institute overspent by Pounds 108,000 at its London Film Festival last year because of poor budgetary control, says a report released by the National Audit Office today. It warns that audiences are perilously low at the National Film Theatre and the Museum of the Moving Image, both in London.

Visitor figures for the Museum of the Moving Image have fallen from 536,000 in 1989-90 to 368,000 in 1992-93. Audience levels are now at about half the level needed to break even. The audit office urged the institute to monitor its marketing strategy closely. Mr Stevenson said: 'A recent visitor survey said the Museum of the Moving Image was the most popular attraction in London so we obviously have a good product.'</p>

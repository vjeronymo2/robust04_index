			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 7 April carries in its  regular 8-minute newscast two reports on the current situation  in Gorazde and Bihac.    Gorazde correspondent Enes Musovic reports that "after  yesterday's extremely dramatic day, the aggressor's artillery  fire and infantry attacks abated somewhat overnight. However,  information from the farthest points of Gorazde's outskirts  confirms that fierce fighting for the still free Gorazde is yet  to come. The chetniks have been regrouping their forces all  night in the areas of Peljin, Potkozara, Priselje, Trebinjaca,  Postaja, and Rogatica. The aggressor is continuously bringing  in fresh manpower and deadly weaponry. Over 350 mortars and  howitzers, 46 tanks, and a supporting tank battalion already  encircle Gorazde, while the aggressor, undisturbed, in full view  of the international community, continues to kill and torture  the civilian population in Gorazde, destroy residential and  industrial areas, torch (?schools), destroy bridges."    Reporting from Bihac, correspondent Mirza Sadikovic says  that  "today marks the second month of the Serbian aggressor's  fiercest offensive at the Bihac Commune. The offensive attacks,  which began last night, continue this morning. Karadzic's  terrorists used howitzers and tanks to shell Bihac [words  indistinct]. They also intensified their artillery attacks at  the defense lines on Grabez and the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau."    "The attacks of the paramilitary forces of the so-called  Kladusa autonomy at the outskirts of Cazin have been going on  all night and have continued this morning. The autonomists are  attacking Hadzici and the wider areas of (?Krivaja) and  (?Tajici) with 60-mm and 80-mm mortars, armor-piercing weapons,  and antiaircraft weapons, while infantry provocations have been  reported on all the other demarcation lines. It is evident that  the chetniks and the autonomists continue to coordinate their  attacks [words indistinct] at the wider area of (?Osmaka) on the  Buzim part of the front."</p>

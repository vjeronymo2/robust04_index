			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (What It Means For You): Personal bands to be unfrozen - Income tax Personal allowances are to be unfrozen for the first time in two years and age-related allowances are to be increased above the rate of inflation, Scheherazade Daneshkhu writes. Restrictions announced previously will still apply, however. These measures will take place from April 6 1995: Personal allowances will be indexed. The single person's allowance will therefore rise from Pounds 3,445 to Pounds 3,525. Age-related allowances will increase above the rate of inflation. The personal allowance for those aged 65-74 will rise from Pounds 4,200 to Pounds 4,630, those aged 75 and over will see a rise from Pounds 4,370 to Pounds 4,800. The married couple's age allowance will rise for those aged 65 to 74 from Pounds 2,665 to Pounds 2,995. It will increase for those aged 75 and over from Pounds 2,705 to Pounds 3,035. These measures were announced in the last Budget. The income limit for age-related allowances will increase from Pounds 14,200 to Pounds 14,600. The lower-rate income tax band of 20 per cent will be extended from the first Pounds 3,000 of income to Pounds 3,200 - a tax saving of just Pounds 10 a year. The threshold for higher-rate taxpayers will ris from Pounds 23,700 to Pounds 24,300. The rates of income tax are unchanged. On CGT and IHT the annual capital gains tax exemption is to increase from its current Pounds 5,800 to Pounds 6,000 and the threshold for inheritance tax moves up from Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 154,000. Increases in restricted allowances will not, however, compensate for income tax increases which were announced in the November 1993 Budget. Relief on the married couple's allowance will be restricted to 15 per cent of Pounds 1,720 from the current 20 per cent, so its tax value will fall from Pounds 344 to Pounds 258. This restriction affects the widow's bereavement allowance and the additional allowance in respect of children. Mortgage interest tax relief will be restricted from 20 per cent to 15 per cent. Individuals making maintenance payments receive a deduction from their income of Pounds 1,720. In the current year relief is given at 20 per cent but from April 6 1995, it will be restricted to 15 per cent.</p>

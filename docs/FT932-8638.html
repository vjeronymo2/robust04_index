			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Retail sales growth boosts activity in other sectors STEADY growth by retailers is stimulating a pick-up in activity among wholesalers and manufacturers, a Confederation of British Industry survey shows today. The results indicate that the UK recovery is becoming better established. The CBI's monthly survey of the distributive trades says retailers in April increased year-on-year sales volumes for the fourth month running. Wholesalers stepped up orders with suppliers last month by the greatest amount for more than five years, suggesting that manufacturers are starting to share the benefits of recent increases in consumer spending. For the distributive trades as a whole - retailers, wholesalers and car dealers - the year-on-year increase in sales volumes last month was the highest registered for four years. This month is also expected to be a good one by many in the sector. Mr Sudhir Junankar, head of CBI forecasts, said the survey - covering 490 businesses and 15,000 sales outlets - showed a 'definite pattern' of stronger retail activity, boosting sales in other parts of the supply chain. Damping any impressions that Britain may be about to see a strong upturn from the recession, the CBI said sales trends in retailing, which accounts for about a quarter of gross domestic product, had failed to accelerate in recent months. Sales volumes in many parts of the distributive sector were still below levels considered normal. The monthly survey, taken between April 20 and May 5, shows that last month a balance of 17 per cent of retailers reported a year-on-year rise in sales volumes. The balance is the proportion of shops registering an increase in sales less those reporting a fall. It continued the trend of year-on-year sales increases first reported in January, but the balance was less than the 25 per cent registered in March. Wholesalers reported sales strongly ahead in April, compared with the corresponding month last year. For the first time for more than seven years, wholesalers think their stocks are inadequate to meet demand from retail customers. Among car dealers, sales rose in April compared with the same month last year, although by a smaller amount than earlier this year. The improvement in sales has been mainly reported by the largest stores, confirming the impression that consumers are shopping for bargains at outlets more likely to be offering discounts. Mail order companies have generally experienced strong sales growth. Wholesalers selling office equipment and computers have done particularly well. Signs of truck sales recovery, Page 7</p>

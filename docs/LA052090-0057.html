			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD'S OBSTACLES TO MOVIES ABOUT AIDS  </P> <P> If all studio executives feel as Ricardo Mestres (president of Disney's  Hollywood Pictures) does about AIDS, it's no wonder that major studios aren't  making movies on the subject ("Fear of AIDS Movies," by Elaine Dutka, May 13).  He says "because AIDS is so utterly hopeless, there's no catharsis after the  suffering."  </P> <P> True, AIDS has brought with it much fear, pain and grief. But that's only part  of the story.  </P> <P> I've seen people giving freely of their time and energy to those in need, and  the incredible satisfaction that these exchanges bring. I've seen young men  embraced by their long distanced families and strained relationships healed.  I've witnessed those facing death open up to their spirituality and being  rewarded with peace and comfort.  </P> <P> The story of AIDS is one of contrasts -- between pain and peace, despair and  hope, fear and love. But most of all, I think it's a love story, for the love  I've shared with those dealing with AIDS is moving and beautiful. And I think  that's a story that people need to hear.  </P> <P> MICHAEL MICHETTI  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

Weights and dimensions are ``frozen'' at the values shown here, which were in effect on June 1, 1991 (Alaska, July 6, 1991). All vehicles are listed by configuration type.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Trucks Over 80,000 Pounds on the Interstate System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the State-by-State descriptions, CMV combinations which can also be LCV's are identified with the letters ``LCV'' following the type of combination vehicle. The maximum allowable gross vehicle weight is given in this appendix (in thousands of pounds indicated by a ``K''), as well as information summarizing the operational conditions, routes, and legal citations. The term ``Interstate System'' as used herein refers to the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Trucks Over STAA Lengths on the National Network  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Listed for each State by combination type is either:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The maximum cargo-carrying length (shown in feet); or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. A notation that such vehicle is not allowed (indicated by a ``NO'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CMV's are categorized as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. A CMV combination consisting of a truck tractor and two trailing units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. A CMV combination consisting of a truck tractor and three trailing units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. CMV combinations with two or more cargo-carrying units not included in descriptions 1 or 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the following table the top number is the maximum cargo-carrying length measured in feet from the front of the first cargo unit to the rear of the last cargo unit. This distance is not to include length exclusive devices which have been approved by the Secretary or by any State. Devices excluded from length determination shall only include items whose function is related to the safe and efficient operation of the semitrailer or trailer. No device excluded from length determination shall be designed or used for carrying cargo. The number below the length measurement is the maximum gross weight in thousands of pounds that the type of vehicle can carry when operating as an LCV on the Interstate System. For every State where there is a length or weight number in the table that follows, additional information is provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

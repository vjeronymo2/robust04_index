			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pulp industry not yet out of the woods - Producers are still battered by over-supply and weak demand WOOD PULP producers have seen many lights at the end of their industry's tunnel over the past three years. But instead of growing brighter, the lights have each time faded away into the distance. After so many false starts those producers still brave enough to make predictions now acknowledge that a solid upturn is unlikely for at least another six months. 'I don't think there's a lot of optimism for the balance of this year,' says Mr John Sim, vice-president for pulp marketing at Canadian Pacific Forest Products in Montreal. Prices of northern softwood pulp are languishing around USDollars 460-480 a tonne in North America, before the discounts of Dollars 40-50 a tonne that have become standard practice in the industry. Mr John Johnson, forest products analyst at Richardson Greenshields in Vancouver, recently lowered his 1993 forecast from an average price of Dollars 490 to Dollars 460. He has also cut his 1994 prediction from Dollars 590 to Dollars 550. The pulp industry is being battered by both over-supply and weak demand. Several projects, which were planned before the severity of the downturn became apparent, are now on the point of being commissioned. A CDollars 1.3bn (Pounds 675m) hardwood pulp mill, jointly owned by Mitsubishi Trading and Kanzaki Paper of Japan and Vancouver-based Crestbrook Forest Industries, is set to come on stream in northern Alberta on September 1. The mill will initially produce 750 tonnes a day, half its rated capacity. The US, Chinese and Venezuelan owners of the Celgar bleached northern kraft pulp mill in south-east British Columbia are also putting the finishing touches to a project, which will more than double capacity to more than 1,200 tonnes a day. Even bigger projects are on the drawing boards in Brazil and Indonesia, awaiting the financing that could materialise once the market shows signs of life. The projects in Indonesia could add 1.5m tonnes a year, or 7 per cent, to world chemical market pulp capacity. While acknowledging that 'any new pulp mill could depress the market', Mr Keith Fujieda, president of MC Forest Products, a Mitsubishi subsidiary, says that 'we can reasonably sell our product (from the new Alberta mill)'. Mr Fujieda says the mill will ship mainly to customers in Japan, Europe, the US and possibly Korea. On the demand side, producers have been frustrated to find improved conditions in one market being offset by a deterioration in others. Paper consumption in Germany and Japan has weakened markedly in recent months. According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, Canadian mills' shipments to Europe sank to 155,000 tonnes in May from 184,000 tonnes a year earlier. Weak offshore markets have encouraged export-oriented mills in the US and Canada to divert shipments to the more buoyant domestic market, thereby holding down North American prices. Thus, Canadian mills' shipments to the US climbed to 176,000 tonnes in May, from 174,000 tonnes a year earlier and 155,000 in May 1991. Despite the gloom, market forces are starting to tighten up the slack between supply and demand. Simpson Timber in the US and CP Forest are among the North American producers that have permanently shut down some older, high-cost mills. Many other companies have announced temporary production cuts. In Canada, the operating rate has slid from an average of 93 per cent in the first five months of 1992 to 85 per cent in January-May 1993. Latest estimates suggest that the industry is now operating at less than three-quarters of capacity. If the pressure on prices lasts much longer, more sweeping rationalisation is likely. Record lumber prices, which enabled many forestry companies to subsidise loss-making pulp operations, have come down markedly in recent months. Mr Bruce Kirk, analyst at SG Warburg in New York, says that the most likely casualties of the coming shake-out are the older, inefficient mills owned by industry giants such as Stora of Sweden, International Paper of the US and the big eastern Canadian producers. Mills in high-currency countries, such as Japan, are also vulnerable. These mills rely on imported fibre and many do not meet the latest environmental standards. 'If the Japanese currency wasn't so high, they'd be losing their shirts; they're already losing both sleeves,' Mr Kirk says. Least affected by further cuts are likely to be mills in British Columbia, whose feedstock consists largely of chips from lumber manufacturers. Some of these mills use no wood at all from raw logs. The production cuts are having an effect. Canadian producers, who account for more than a quarter of world market-pulp output, have lowered their stocks from 43 days' supply in March to 37 days in May - though this is still well above the 21 days held at this time last year. It is not yet clear whether the decline in stocks is due to production cuts or to paper-makers starting to rebuild depleted inventories in anticipation of rising prices. Pulp producers face another uncertainty when demand for paper products does eventually improve. In previous upturns rising paper sales were matched by a corresponding rise in demand for pulp. But an ever-growing proportion of paper mills' raw material now comes from recycled material. The pulp industry may thus find that not only has the recession been longer than anyone expected, but that the recovery will be painfully slow.</p>

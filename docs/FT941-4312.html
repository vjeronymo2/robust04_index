			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: CSC heads for stock market Capital Shopping Centres, the retail property arm of Mr Donald Gordon's TransAtlantic group, is to raise at least Pounds 209m from a flotation - valuing the company at more than Pounds 830m. It will become the sixth largest listed UK property company. The flotation will give investors the opportunity of buying into the first specialist shopping centre company on the stock market, but at the issue price they will have to pay a 13 per cent premium to its latest asset valuation. Following the flotation, CSC will have investments in seven regional shopping centres valued at Pounds 748.5m, and net debt of only Pounds 11m, leaving it well placed for further investments. CSC is offering 91m new shares at 230p through a placement and public offer, but lead sponsor Robert Fleming has the option of placing a further 9m shares. This would leave CSC in a net cash position, and boost market capitalisation to Pounds 850m. TransAtlantic has been issued 270m CSC shares priced at 200p, representing between 73 and 75 per cent of the company (and an Pounds 81m paper profit at the issue price) as part payment for the properties. TransAtlantic receives Pounds 108.5m of the flotation proceeds through repayment of an inter-company loan, and Pounds 100m of convertible bonds, which would represent 11 per cent of CSC's enlarged share capital. CSC's only wholly owned centre is the Lakeside in Thurrock, the largest out-of-town centre in southern England, valued at Pounds 420m. Its three southern centres - including the Harlequin in Watford and The Glades in Bromley - account for 85 per cent of CSC's assets and 80 per cent of current rental income. CSC made profits before interest and tax of Pounds 24.4m in 1993. It doesn't give a profits forecast, but it has undertaken to pay a final 1994 dividend of 5p. Had it been listed for the full year a dividend of 6.5p would have been paid, representing a yield of 3.5 per cent. The offer closes on March 23, and dealings will begin on March 30. COMMENT There is no denying the attractions of the only pure UK retail property play, but Mr Donald Gordon, the canny South African entrepreneur, appears to have left little in the CSC price for the stags. With the government set to limit new out-of-town centres, CSC's portfolio is defensive. It offers upside from a pick-up in retailing, through turnover-linked leases, which accounted for 11 per cent of gross rent last year. These attractions should see the issue fully subscribed, but given the premium to NAV, stagging profits could be limited.</p>

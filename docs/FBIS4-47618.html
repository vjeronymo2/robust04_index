			<p>PRC      Premier's Central Asian Tour Promotes Expanded Ties                                SUMMARY     PRC Premier Li Peng's recent official visits to Mongolia and to  the Republics of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and  Kazakhstan have served to underscore China's deepening ties with  its neighbors in Central Asia.  At the same time, Beijing used  the visit to reassure those neighbors and Russia of its peaceful  intentions in the region.  Beijing may also hope that growing  ties with these countries may help to limit the reemergence of  Russian influence.                               END SUMMARY     Li Peng's 18-28 April tour of the four Central Asian republics  was highlighted by a further expansion of China's bilateral  economic relations with Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and  Kazakhstan.  The 18-20 April stop in Uzbekistan, for example, was  capped by the signing of four bilateral accords, including an  agreement on a Chinese loan to the Uzbekistan Government and a  pact on civil aviation (Xinhua, 19 April).  Three agreements--one  covering a 50 million yuan PRC loan to the Turkmenistan  Government, a protocol on regular consultations between the  foreign ministries of the two countries, and notes on a Chinese  grant of goods--were signed during Li's 20-22 April stay in  Turkmenistan (Xinhua, ITAR-TASS, 22 April).  The signing of five  intergovernmental agreements, including an accord on PRC loans to  Kyrgyzstan and one on cultural cooperation, marked Li's 22-25  April stay in Bishkek (Xinhua, 24 April), while three accords  were signed during his 25-28 April visit to Kazakhstan.  Most  notable among the economic documents signed in Kazakhstan was a  "summary" of talks on developing railway transportation (Xinhua,  28 April).     China's economic ties with the four Central Asian republics were  also given a boost by the inclusion in the official Chinese  Government delegation--" for the first time" according to a 13  April Xinhua report--of a "delegation of leading Chinese business  executives."  The delegation, which was headed by Zheng Hongyi,  president of the China Council for the Promotion of International  Trade (CCPIT), and made up of executives from the China National  Construction Corporation, China National Petroleum Corporation,  China National Textile Import and Export Corporation, and an iron  and steel industrial and trade group, reportedly signed a number  of contracts and letters of intent throughout the trip.  In  Kyrgyzstan, for example, Xinhua reported that the CCPIT signed an  accord with the Kyrgyzstan Chamber of Industry and Commerce on  "developing cooperative ties," while representatives from the  Textile Import and Export Corporation signed a contract to buy  30,000 tons of chemical fertilizer (24 April).  Siniilarly in  Ashgabat, China's National Petroleum Corporation signed a letter  of intent with the Ministry of Oil and Gas of Turkmenistan on  joint cooperation in developing the two countries' oil and gas  sectors, while a Chinese trade and industry group signed a letter  of intent with the Turkmenistan "Kuvvat" state power technology  corporation to build an iron and steel works to process scrap  metal and an aluminum production works (ITAR-TASS, 22 April).     Caution on Economic Ties     Although Chinese reporting indicates that Li and his Central  Asian counterparts reaffirmed their desire to expand economic  ties, Li's remarks to Kazakhstani entrepreneurs on 26 April  suggests that Beijing will take a cautious approach to developing  closer relations (Xinhua, 26,27 April).  Outlining China's  guidelines for "developing economic cooperation and trade" with  Central Asia, Li said that such cooperative efforts should be  based not only on "equality" but also on "mutual benefit."  He  stressed that "both sides" must benefit from the development of  bilateral ties and that the "principle of exchanges at equal  value" must be followed.  He also pointed out that any joint  ventures must be evaluated on the basis of "market prospect and  market demand" and that enterprises must focus on "taking  advantage" of local resources to enable them to bring in "good  economic returns with competitive products."     Li also used the occasion of his 26 April speech to warn the  Central Asian republics that China will not fill the resource  void in their economies left by the breakup of the former Soviet  Union.  He pointed out that as a "developing" country itself  China can only provide a "very small amount" of economic  assistance as a "symbol of its friendship."     Resolving Border Issues     In addition to deepening economic ties with Central Asia, Li's  visit showed new progress in resolving China's outstanding border  problems with Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.  Fulfilling a pledge  made during Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev's October  1993 visit to China, Li and Nazarbayev signed a border agreement  on 26 April.  According to a Xinhua report, Li described the new  agreement as a "historic document" which "defines" the Sino-  Kazakhstani border in a "legal form" (26 April).  With the  signing of the agreement Kazakhstan becomes the first of the four  former Soviet republics--including Russia, Tajikistan, and  Kyrgyzstan--to resolve its border differences with Beijing (ITAR-  TASS, 27 April).     Beijing also appears to have made some progress in overcoming its  border differences with Kyrgyzstan during Li's visit.  According  to a 23 April Xinhua account of their talks that day, Li and  Kyrgyzstan President Askar Akayev "unanimously" agreed on the  need to "expeditiously" turn "previously concluded" agreements  into a "legal" document.  While noting that "some" issues remain,  the two leaders reportedly said that "friendly negotiations" will  continue, expressing the belief that the border issue will be  resolved in the "not-too-distant future."     Reassurances on China's Regional Role     Chinese media reporting on Li's four-nation tour indicates that  the PRC premier also used his visit to reassure the four Central  Asian republics and Russia about Beijing's intentions in the  region.  Laying out four principles for Sino-Central Asian  relations in a speech to the Uzbekistan parliament on 19 April,  Li reiterated China's standard foreign policy line underscoring  China's desire for a "stable and peaceful" environment and  renouncing any "hegemonistic" intent (Xinhua, 19 April; Renmin  Ribao, 20 April).  China, he asserted, "seeks no self-interest or  sphere of influence in the world, including this region," and  will "always" maintain "equal and friendly" relations with its  neighbors.  He went on to affirm that China will "respect" the  "independent choice" of the Central Asian peoples and will "never  interfere" in their internal affairs.     In his speech to the Uzbekistan parliament, Li also took  particular pains to reassure Moscow of Beijing's peaceful  intentions in the region.  Pointing to the need for "regional  stability," Li said that China's relations with the Central Asian  republics are "not directed against any third country."  Indicating that Beijing sees a continued role for Moscow in the  region, Li went on to say that China is "willing" to see all the  countries in the region live "in harmony" with each other.  Returning to these themes during his visit to Kazakhstan, Li told  the group of Kazakhstani entrepreneurs that China "seeks no  sphere of economic or political influence" in the region and is  willing to participate in "equal and fair competition" with other  countries desiring to invest and trade there.  Underscoring  Beijing's peaceful intentions a day later at a press conference  in Almaty, Li said that China has "no interest" in filling the  "so-called vacuum" left by the breakup of the former Soviet Union  (Xinhua, 27 April).     Nuclear and Ethnic Minority Issues     Li also used his stay in Almaty to address the sensitive issues  of Kazakhstani concerns about China's nuclear testing program and  China's concern over unrest among its Muslim minorities.  Stating  China's longstanding position on nuclear testing at his press  conference on 27 April, Li pointed out that China has the  "smallest" number of nuclear weapons of the nuclear states and  has pledged not to be the first to use such weapons.  He went on  to reiterate Beijing's support for a "complete prohibition and  thorough destruction of nuclear weapons" and for the realization  of a "complete nuclear test ban in such a context" (Xinhua, ITAR-  TASS, 27 April).  In return, Li appears to have received  Nazarbayev's reassurances that Almaty will not allow its  minorities, "elements of 'East Turkistan' to undertake activities  against China from Kazakhstan to the detriment of Sino-  Kazakhstani relations" (Xinhua, ITAR-TASS, 27 April).     Consolidating Relations With Mongolia     Reflecting the deepening ties between the two countries, Beijing  and Ulaanbaatar used Li's 28-29 April visit--the first by a  Chinese head of government since 1960--to put their bilateral  relationship on a new footing, signing a treaty of "friendship  and cooperation" to replace the treaty of "friendship and mutual  assistance" signed in 1960.  The treaty, Li said, will provide a  "new political basis" for the future development of relations and  will be the "basic principle" for "standardizing" the handling of  bilateral ties (Xinhua, 29 April).  According to the text carried  by Xinhua, the treaty calls for the development of  "goodneighborly and cooperative" relations on the basis of the  five principles of peaceful coexistence, regular bilateral  consultations, and the "steady development of equal and  reciprocal cooperation on a long-term basis" in a number of  areas, including trade, culture, education, science and  technology, and environmental protection (29 April).  Reflecting  the changed world situation, the new treaty contains no reference  to "proletarian internationalism" as a basis for Sino-Mongolian  relations and no longer calls for relations of "mutual  assistance" between the two countries.     At the same time, Chinese concerns about Russian intentions were  evident in the treaty.  Suggesting that Beijing is trying to  guard against the possible reemergence of Russian influence, the  treaty  said that "neither party shall join any military or  political alliances targeted against the other or sign with any  third country any treaties that infringe on the other side's  sovereignty and security" or permit a "third country" to use its  territory to "hurt the other side's sovereignty and security."     As he had during his previous stops, Li offered assurances to  Mongolian Premier Puntsagiyn Jasray about Beijing's peaceful  intentions in their talks on 29 April.  According to a Xinhua  report that day, Li told Jasray that in developing relations with  Mongolia, China will "respect Mongolia's independence,  sovereignty, and territorial integrity" as well as the Mongolian  people's "choice of their own path of development."  Li went on  to express China's "appreciation and support" for Mongolia's  determination to become a nuclear-free zone and the PRC's  "willingness" to see Mongolia develop "friendly relations" with  other countries.     Like the other stops on his Central Asian tour, Li's visit to  Mongolia was capped by the signing of a number of economic  agreements.  In addition to an accord on cultural, economic, and  technological cooperation, Xinhua on 29 April reported that the  two sides signed agreements on the "protection and utilization"  of water in the border areas, on cooperation in the quarantine of  animals and veterinary work, on guaranteeing the quality of  imports and exports, and on the provision of Chinese aid to  Mongolia.     Prospects     Driven by its desire for a stable international environment in  which to pursue its modernization drive, Beijing is likely to  continue to carefully nurture its relations with Uzbekistan,  Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia.  Judging by  reporting on the visit, Beijing will soon resolve its border  differences with Kyrgyzstan.  Moreover, as bilateral economic  relations between China and each of the five countries grow each  country will have an increasing stake in preserving those ties  and minimizing any friction.  China may also hope that by  strengthening trade ties and bilateral relations in general with  these countries, it can broaden Beijing's influence in the region  at Russia's expense.

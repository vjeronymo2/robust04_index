			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to a survey conducted in December by  MAINICHI SHIMBUN with 100 division directors [kacho] in the  central government's ministries and agencies, a majority of the  officials supported the amendment to Article 9 of the  Constitution. While 43 percent of the respondents said Article  9 "should remain as it currently is," 46 percent said the  "amendment is necessary" and 5 percent said "positive efforts  should be made to amend it."    More than half of those polled in the Defense Agency, the  Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry  of Construction, and the Ministry of Health and Welfare said  they support the amendment. But there was a wide range of  views, including those of moderates in the Ministry of Finance,  saying "the Peace Constitution needs to be maintained, but  neither must we make its amendment taboo." Those in the  Ministry of Home Affairs said: "It is necessary to prepare a  system through which the nation can positively participate in  international cooperation." Some in the Science and Technology  Agency felt "it is necessary to review the Constitution if Japan  is to carry out its role in building a new world order in the  post-cold war era, a role befitting its national power. But  defenders of the Constitution in the Ministry of Transport said:  "Article 9 may not be fitting to the current situation, but it  should be left intact as an expression of our ideals."    The bureaucrats' positive views on international  contributions were evident in their answers to questions  regarding Japan's participation in peacekeeping operations  [PKO]. Fifty-five percent said: "We should refrain from  participating in exercises of force, but if we do we should  participate in them positively." Thirty-one percent said: "We  should be positive about making international contributions,  including participation in peacekeeping forces."    Meanwhile, only 9 percent said Japan should "rethink" the  PKO, and no one said Japan should "stop the PKO immediately."</p>

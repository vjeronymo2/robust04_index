			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: United completes Boeing talks UNITED Airlines, one of the three large US carriers, said yesterday that it had completed negotiations with the Seattle-based Boeing company over reducing deliveries of new aircraft, although talks with engine manufacturers were continuing. The talks have been closely watched because United is a launch customer for Boeing's new 777 wide-body jet, and there have been fears that these orders might be affected. United declined to comment on what reductions had been agreed, beyond repeating that the cutbacks would be 'significant'. But Mr Julius Maldutis, airline analyst at Salomon Brothers, told clients yesterday that United would probably reduce orders by 29 aircraft next year, and by 28 in 1995. United is scheduled to meet analysts today. A Boeing spokesman would not give details of the negotiations but said the results had been 'fully factored' into the reduced rate of production it announced in January. Meanwhile, American Airlines said that it planned to ground 25 McDonnell Douglas DC10 aircraft between June and the end of 1993 - about half its DC10 fleet. The Dallas-based airline estimates that this will reduce its capacity in the domestic marketplace by around 3 per cent in 1993 and by about 6 per cent on an annualised basis. In the wake of the extremely difficult domestic airline market condition, the carrier has talked recently about reducing some of its less profitable operations in the the US. There has also been speculation for many months that American, one of the big three US carriers, may eventually reduce the number of domestic hubs which it operates. American stressed yesterday that it would continue to operate its fleet of newer Airbuses.</p>

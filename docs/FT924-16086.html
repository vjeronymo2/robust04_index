			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Warning over electricity coal deal REGIONAL electricity companies complained yesterday that they were being pressured to take extra electricity to help make the new contracts between the generators and British Coal succeed. Yorkshire Electricity, one of the companies taking a tough stand in the negotiations between the generators and the distribution companies, said: 'We are determined to protect the interests of our shareholders and customers. Negotiations are complex and continuing.' It was willing to take its full share of the new electricity on offer, based on its share of the market, but it would not buy additional electricity if other companies were unable to take up their full amounts. Several of the 12 regional companies in England and Wales have contracted to buy electricity from independent power producers or Nuclear Electric, although the government is trying to get some of these contracts cancelled. The regional companies are also refusing to take the risk that Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, may disapprove of the new contracts. They are insisting on prior approval by Prof Littlechild or an opt-out clause. Because they have similar concerns, the regional companies have appointed central negotiators to speed up the talks. The team is headed by Mr Jim Keohane, who is in charge of power purchasing at East Midlands Electricity. The companies intend to reassure the competition authorities the arrangements are not intended to be anti-competitive. The contracts will cover electricity generated by the new five-year contracts agreed between the power generators and British Coal.</p>

			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRIMED FOR NEWS  </P> <P> I agree with Don Petersen of Chino (Viewers' Views, Aug. 5); KCAI's Prime 9  News is awful.  </P> <P> There are so many mistakes, pauses and just plain stupidity that at times it is  difficult to imagine that Jerry Dunphy would be a part of such a disaster. And  more important, the former team of Wendy Gordon, Tom Lawrence and Scott St.  James certainly could have been integrated into the new format.  </P> <P> I, too, have switched to Channel 5's "News at 10" for consistency and, most of  all, credibility.  </P> <P> Carol A. Ross, Lomita  </P></p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Yeltsin says coal strike agreement is near MR BORIS YELTSIN, the Russian leader, said yesterday he thought an agreement to end the Russian miners' strike was close. The key issue in ending the strike is the terms under which the mines will be transferred from Soviet to Russian government control. The terms were still being thrashed out in the Kuzbas coalfield in Siberia last night. The miners have decided to continue their strike until the agreement to transfer is concluded. In another Russian coalfield, Vorkuta, where all the mines had returned to work, the strike committee said the pits had decided to resume the strike because the terms of transfer of the Vorkuta coal associations to Russian jurisdiction had not been defined. Views were mixed in the Kuzbas field as Mr Yeltsin continued his talks. Mr Alexander Aslanidi, one of the miners' leaders, said: 'Yeltsin is being well received.' However, Mr Alexander Smirnov of the Novokuznets committee in the Kuzbas said: 'Our committee will raise their own proposals.' Some pits in the area have already moved to Russian control, while others have gone further and transformed themselves to enterprises leased to their workers. As Mr Yeltsin negotiated, the newspaper Izvestia published an exchange of May Day telegrams between the Russian leader and President Mikhail Gorbachev on the signing of the recent joint statement aimed at ending the strikes and supporting anti-crisis measures. Mr Yeltsin expressed 'confidence that the path of reconciliation now being pursued by the centre and Russia . . . will bring co-ordinated actions to lead the country out of the crisis.' Mr Gorbachev said he was convinced that the 'constructive co-operation which has been given new life . . . will allow the return of life in our country to a normal pattern.' The agreement is vague on most points, though purported leaks in recent days point to Mr Gorbachev conceding that a new union treaty would be framed by the republics themselves, and possibly even promising to hold an election for the union presidency later this year. A demonstration of how vague the statement is came when it was also endorsed yesterday by Mr Yuri Blokhin, co-chairman of the hardline Soyuz group which had been calling for Mr Gorbachev's resignation, or at least for a special congress of peoples' deputies to hold him to account for the economic crisis. Mr Blokhin said: 'We are glad our ideas are reflected in this document, such as observance of the constitutional order, introduction of a special regime in basic industries and improvement of food supplies.' Mr Yeltsin, for his part, has defined the 'special regime' as a way of improving productivity.</p>

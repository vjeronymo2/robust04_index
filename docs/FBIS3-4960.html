Those who do not consider the bilateral relations to be good  increased to 64 percent, from 42 percent in December last year,  the ASAHI said.    In the survey, 16 percent, down from the previous 26  percent,  said the bilateral relations will head in a good direction,  while 23 percent predicted relations would head in a bad  direction.    As for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's refusal to accept  the U.S. demand for numerical targets to measure the degree of  openness of the Japanese market, voiced during a summit meeting  with U.S. President Bill Clinton last month, 20 percent said the  action was only natural, 57 percent said it was unavoidable, and  12 percent said it was not good.    The ASAHI conducted the survey on February 27 and 28,  polling  3,000 people aged 20 and older, of whom 2,318 people responded.</p>

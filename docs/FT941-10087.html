			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Fresh bid revealed for Channel 5 Three big media organisations - MAI, Time Warner and Pearson - yesterday announced that they had formed a consortium to bid for a national Channel 5 television licence if one is advertised. The consortium would offer national programming and a series of local services for leading UK cities. It would resemble the US television system with a national network serving a host of regional affiliates. MAI is the controlling shareholder in Meridian Broadcasting, the ITV company for the south of England, and recently made an agreed bid for Anglia Television. Time Warner is the largest media group in the world and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, also owns Thames Television, the ITV company that lost its franchise to Carlton. The consortium is the most weighty so far to announce its interest in Channel 5, which could reach around three-quarters of the UK population. In December 1992, the Independent Television Commission rejected the only bid for the Channel 5 licence - put together by Thames (not then owned by Pearson), Time Warner and Pearson. The ITC did not think the business plan sufficiently robust and decided that the shareholders were not sufficiently committed. For some time, the ITC has been looking to see whether the franchise should be readvertised or the frequencies reserved to develop a host of digital television channels in this country. The ITC will take its decision 'shortly'. The likeliest outcome is that Channel 5 will be re-advertised, but as part of a co-ordinated plan to develop digital television gradually. The ITC has been trying to find ways to reduce the number of video recorders that would have to be re-tuned for Channel 5 to go ahead. Extensive re-tuning because of the interference that would be caused by the Channel 5 signal was one of the problems with the original proposal. Lord Hollick, chief executive of MAI, said yesterday: 'This is a golden opportunity to bring in a new distinctive channel offering both national and city-based programmes.' It would offer extra choice at no cost to viewers and extra choice for advertisers, particularly local advertisers, he added. At the moment Pearson, as a company owning a national newspaper and an independent television production company, could only take a 5 per cent stake. The government has, however, announced a review of cross-media ownership rules.</p>

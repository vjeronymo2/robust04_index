			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Technology: Safer HIV testing Testing for HIV, the virus that causes Aids, can be a hazardous business. At least 155 health workers are reported to have been infected by the virus through needlestick injuries while taking blood from HIV-positive patients. The true number is probably higher, given poor training standards in many developing countries. However, a number of companies are developing a method of testing for HIV using saliva rather than blood. At the Berlin Aids conference this week, Saliva Diagnostics Systems, a Washington State-based group, revealed a saliva collection technique. A sterile cotton pad is placed in the mouth and left there for five minutes. This is then placed into a collection device for later analysis. The saliva stays stable for up to 21 days at 37`C and unlike blood does not require refrigeration. The device is sold or under evaluation in more than 70 countries. About 200,000 have been sold in Thailand. The company claims there is no risk to either patient or health worker collecting saliva samples. This is because although saliva contains HIV-antibodies, it contains little, if any, active virus. Trials have shown that although there are lower concentrations of antibody in saliva than blood, the testing techniques allow scientists to identify nearly all HIV-positive samples. Dr Carol Major, head of HIV surveillance at the Ontario ministry of health, said occasional errors meant the system was not fail-proof, but it was ideally suited for developing countries which could not afford widespread blood testing. Collecting saliva samples is quicker and requires less training than traditional blood collection. Such devices can also be used to test for other diseases, as well as substances such as cocaine. Other companies developing saliva test systems include Orgenics of Yavneh, Israel and Trinity Biotech, an Irish company.</p>

The decline comes as the approval rating of President  Francois Mitterrand, Balladur's socialist rival, is rising.    A poll for the JOURNAL DU DIMANCHE newspaper, to be  published  Sunday [13 March], said 45 percent of voters expressed support  for Balladur, down from 47 percent in February. Forty-seven  percent said they were dissatisfied, up from 43 percent last  month.    For Mitterrand, 44 percent said they approved of his  performance, up from 41 percent in February. However, 48  percent of voters expressed dissatisfaction with the president,  down from 50 percent.    The telephone poll was conducted between March 3-11 among a  sample of 1,888 registered voters.    It comes ahead of the 20 and 27 March local elections which  will test the popularity of Balladur's conservative coalition  government.    Balladur, who enjoyed a long honeymoon in public opinion for  his presidential style as prime minister, has recently suffered  a sharp fall in popularity. It comes in the wake of  demonstrations by fishermen angry over cheap imports and young  people protesting a government proposal to let businesses hire  them for less than the minimum wage as a way to fight France's  nagging unemployment problem.</p>

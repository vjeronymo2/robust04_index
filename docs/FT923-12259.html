			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Smith aides seek to ensure unity at the top: Labour leader has free hand to tackle union block votes - Beckett trails rivals in 'party asset' opinion poll A FRESH attempt to weld Labour's notoriously faction-ridden leadership into a coherent team begins today when Mr John Smith's senior aides hold their first planning session in the leader of the opposition's office at Westminster. The prime aim of Mr Murray Elder, the leader's new chief of staff, is to maximise co-ordination between the Walworth Road party headquarters, the parliamentary Labour party and Mr Smith's inner office in the Commons. Under the leadership of Mr Neil Kinnock, officials and MPs frequently complained of a 'bunker mentality' in the opposition leader's Westminster offices. That on occasions reportedly caused policy and strategy development to be duplicated or triplicated as several groups 'second-guessed' each other's work. In a further move on strategy Mr Robin Cook, leadership campaign manager for Mr Smith, said on BBC radio that Labour would use the first year of the new leadership to re-evaluate its goals, rather than revise policy. Premature policy reviews after the 1987 election defeat were a 'mistake' that would not happen again, he said. The party's national executive committee is due to meet on Wednesday to begin planning for an 'aims and values' document, scheduled to be debated at the October conference. Mr Elder, who was until last week general secretary of the Scottish Labour party, is determined to draw together the three power centres under a central command. As political co-ordinator, Mr Elder will work alongside Mr David Ward, who was until Friday Mr Smith's research officer and who will take charge of policy development. Mr Alan Haworth, now formally confirmed as the parliamentary party secretary, will be the third of the triumvirate, keeping open channels to MPs. Evidence of the new determination to mesh the leader of the opposition's office with party headquarters came in the announcement that Mr David Hill, the communications director, is to double as Mr Smith's chief press liaison aide. Mr Dan Corry, head of the widely admired economic directorate that supported the shadow Treasury team, is also due to be drafted in to the opposition leader's inner office. One of Labour's trickier pre-election difficulties arose earlier this year when Mr Kinnock hinted at a private dinner with journalists at a London restaurant that the proposed lifting of the ceiling on national insurance contributions could be phased in. That was immediately ruled out by Mr Smith. Insiders attributed the proposal to advice from Mr John (now Lord) Eatwell, Mr Kinnock's personal economics adviser, in conflict with the views of his shadow chancellor. The changes envisaged by Mr Elder are aimed at eliminating such incidents.</p>

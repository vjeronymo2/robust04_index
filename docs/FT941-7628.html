			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Clinton &amp; Co looks for business - Administration is fighting for more foreign orders AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications giant, insists that it is just one of several companies vying for a contract to be awarded next month to expand Saudi Arabia's telecoms system. However, it has one clear advantage: the commitment of the Clinton administration to mobilise the resources of the federal government to help US businesses compete aggressively for large overseas contracts. Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, went twice to Saudi Arabia in pursuit of last week's Dollars 6bn aerospace deal for Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. He also has made it clear that the administration will do 'everything possible' to help AT&amp;T's bid succeed. 'The Saudis are adding 1.5bn new lines. That's Dollars 4bn worth of business. The question is will NEC, Siemens or AT&amp;T get it?' said Mr Brown. Indicative of the administration's aim to capture large chunks of the world's infrastructure business is its plan to establish a commerce department advocacy centre. It will be along the lines of the 'war rooms' set up in the Clinton presidential campaign and the fight to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement. The centre will co-ordinate all US government support on behalf of US companies and mobilise resources and support for nearly 100 important government procurement projects abroad. It will devise the same kind of intense intergovernmental strategy for economic ends as the government does for political and security objectives. Mr Jeffrey Garten, commerce department undersecretary for trade, said government advocacy would go beyond the usual representations by ambassadors or visiting senior officials to making strenuous efforts 'involving everything from financing to foreign policy pressure'. Mr Garten is now in Asia in support of US telecommunications, aerospace and energy companies and 'forming effective working relationships with businesses on the ground'. He is seeking 'new ways to pursue commercial partnerships' there, targeting particularly Indonesia and China, where 'hundreds of billions of dollars of new construction and rebuilding contracts are being placed up for bidding'. Mr Brown, his aides say, has already helped Motorola win a Dollars 100m cellular telephone contract in Kuwait. He has his sights on other deals, including telecommunications in China and fighter aircraft in Malaysia. The Commerce Department is already developing strategic plans for each of the 10 'big emerging markets' on which it has decided to focus its energies  -Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, India, Indonesia, Turkey, Poland, South Korea, South Africa and the Chinese Economic Area (including mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong). These markets are expected to provide 44 per cent of the world's new trade opportunities over the next 20 years. In line with that strategy, Mr Brown is planning next year to visit Asia twice, and Latin America, South Africa and Russia. An intensive effort to expand US trade and investment in Mexico is already under way with the department's 'Export Mexico' campaign, which aims to assist small and medium-sized companies into the market.</p>

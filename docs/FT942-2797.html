			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Smith New Court profits jump to Pounds 95m Smith New Court, the equities marketmaker and broker, has reported a surge in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 95.2m, from Pounds 38.7m, reflecting gains in almost every area of the firm's business. The shares closed 4p higher at 373p, bucking the market trend. The dividend was increased to 10p per share from 6p. For the year to April, return on capital was 47.8 per cent, more than double the 20 per cent rate of return the London Stock Exchange calculated the average UK securities firm earned in 1993. Fully-diluted earnings per share were 70.2p against 34.3p. 'We are building products our clients want,' said Mr Michael Marks, chief executive, in explaining the firm's success in its niche markets. Despite volatile trading conditions in the last quarter, profits in the second half nearly doubled from the Pounds 31.1m recorded in the first half. The firm does not provide details of the profitability of each of its geographic regions. However, international income accounted for 57 per cent of the total against 43 per cent from UK activities. This was a big shift from the business mix prevailing at the time of Big Bang in 1986 when domestic activities accounted for 80 per cent. Mr Marks said that profits from the firm's US-based Carl Marks and Co subsidiary, which specialises in selling international shares to US clients, had benefited from the installation of a new system allowing regional stockbrokers to obtain share research electronically. 'They pay us for it by their order flow,' he said. Also, the US division benefited from the general trend among domestic pension fund investors to increase their exposure to non-US securities. Smith New Court said it has cut its dependence on marketmaking as a source of profitability. Last year marketmaking accounted for 48 per cent of profits with the remainder coming from commissions and fees. At the time of Big Bang, almost all income came from marketmaking. Smith New Court did not provide details of its expenses, which are expected to show substantial increases in profit-related pay when the annual report is released later this month. Expenses were also increased by taking on an extra 100 staff, mostly outside the UK. The firm has opened offices in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Lima in Peru, and has applied to open a joint venture in Shenzhen, China, with a domestic partner.</p>

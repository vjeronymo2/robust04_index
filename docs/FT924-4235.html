			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Letter: Self-regulation requires clear differentiation Sir, Recent articles and letters in the FT clearly indicate that a bandwagon to end self-regulation of the securities industry is gathering speed. As a lawyer, I would not get involved in the political debate. However, I would note that the question of whether self-regulation should continue is different from the question of who finances the regulatory system. Similarly, even the regulators in a self-regulatory system can be given powers to investigate and prosecute insider dealing and securities fraud. If it is indeed proposed to have self-regulation for some sectors and statutory regulation for others - as suggested by Mr Yassukovich, a former regulator (Letters, November 10), and Lord Alexander - it is in my view important to insure that what are called private clients are kept on the self-regulation side of the line along with the wholesale markets (albeit with more detailed rules), rather than regarded as part of the retail sector. Private clients are the typical client base of stockbrokers, merchant banks and the very important UK and overseas private banking sector. Those institutions are not the same as the high-street investment advisers and insurance company tied agents, and their regulators and conduct of business rules should similarly be different. Private clients are in particular high net worth individuals. However, retail market clients are also individuals. It is very difficult to differentiate between them and, in my view, the dividing line should be drawn on the basis of the product concerned. The distinction should be between securities, derivatives and in-house funds on the one hand and what are referred to as packaged products, namely life policies, authorised unit trusts and Securities and Investments Board-approved mutual funds, on the other. Packaged products already have their own regime; for example, and importantly, it is only packaged products which are subject to the polarisation rules which distinguish so firmly between tied agents and independent advisers. This differentiation has the added advantage that it is merely separating out what is already an existing self-contained regime. Changes to self-regulatory organisation (SRO) rules to help prevent Maxwell-type abuses can be required by the government even under the present system; the rule books have to be written on the basis of statutory guidelines and SROs must include rules that the SIB insists on. Under the present system of self-regulation within a statutory framework these changes can be brought in quickly. If the rules are wrong, there is no need to substitute statutory regulation merely to get them right. Charles Abrams, S J Berwin &amp; Co, 222 Grays Inn Road, London WC1X 8HB</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Company News: Buoyant pharmaceutical results help prop Akzo AKZO, the Dutch chemicals group, posted a 5 per cent decline in net profit before extraordinary items in 1991, with buoyant results in pharmaceuticals helping to offset a sharp fall in the profitability of the fibres sector. Net profit on normal business operations before extraordinaries eased to Fl 691m (Dollars 373.5m) from Fl 729m in 1990, a result which the company described yesterday as 'reasonably satisfactory' given continued recession in the US and a downturn in economic conditions in Europe and Japan. Net extraordinary charges of Fl 111m, which mainly represent the costs of Akzo's planned reorganisation and streamlining, pushed overall net profit down to Fl 580m, a decline of 13 per cent compared with 1990, when extraordinary charges totalled Fl 64m. Akzo repeated the statement made earlier this month that it would maintain its 1991 dividend at Fl 6.50 despite the high costs of its restructuring programme. Mr Aarnout Loudon, company chairman, said it was impossible to predict results for the current year because of uncertainties about the world economy, but added that 'the proposal to pay an unchanged dividend expresses a measure of confidence in the performance of the business in 1992'. Operating profit fell by Fl 105m to Fl 1.16bn, but this decline was largely offset by a Fl 91m reduction in financing charges, enabling after-tax earnings on consolidated operations to remain unchanged at Fl 615m. But a steep fall in earnings at Century Enka, a 40 per cent-owned fibres joint venture in India, cut the profit contribution from non-consolidated companies to Fl 64m from Fl 103m. The pharmaceuticals division, which is the smallest of Akzo's four in terms of sales, made the single biggest contribution to earnings, with operating profit rising to Fl 514m from Fl 429m. Operating results in fibres, however, were more than halved to Fl 102m from Fl 218m.</p>

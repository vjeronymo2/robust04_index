			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Leading Article: The prize in Ulster It is still not clear that the ceasefire announced yesterday by the Irish Republican Army is permanent, a necessary condition for political talks involving Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. But the substance of the announcement seems unambiguous. There is a widely-held feeling on all sides in Northern Ireland that a new phase has begun, a turning away from the violence that has brought misery to nationalists and unionists alike. That alone is cause for rejoicing. There are few parallels that can be drawn between Ulster and long-running conflicts in South Africa and the Middle East. But events in these other places show that, when all sides are committed to finding a solution, there is a momentum in the peace process that sweeps away many of the real or imagined obstacles. That this point appears to have been reached in Northern Ireland is a tribute to effective co-operation between the UK and Irish governments. Mr John Major deserves credit for placing a solution in Ulster on his list of priorities. He has made clear that Britain has no strategic interest in Northern Ireland apart from protecting the right of its people to determine their future. He has also taken risks, most notably in conducting secret exchanges with Sinn Fein leaders. Those risks appear to have paid off, thanks to his cool determination under fire. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish Taoiseach, has also been prepared to take risks. In last December's Downing Street Declaration, he acknowledged the right of the people of Northern Ireland to remain in the UK unless they decided otherwise. He also undertook to amend the claims in the Irish constitution to the north - essential in reassuring unionists. The peace process will not be smooth. There will be those among both the republican and the 'loyalist' communities who will try to disrupt it. There may be a breakaway from the IRA, with diehards seeking to continue the violence. The process will have to survive whatever 'spectaculars' are thrown up at a time when trust may still be in short supply. There is also the fear of betrayal among the unionist majority that must be constantly and convincingly assuaged. It was their opposition that derailed two previous attempts at constitutional settlements involving the Irish Republic. The main Unionist party, led by Mr James Molyneaux, has sensibly accepted the assurances of the Downing Street Declaration on Northern Ireland's right to self-determination. But the Reverend Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists seem to be flirting with the idea that any peace must involve unacceptable concessions to Dublin. Now, therefore, is not a time for complacency but for renewed efforts to maintain the momentum. Mr John Hume, leader of the moderate nationalists, advises throwing away the formal timetable for bringing Sinn Fein to the conference table. This advice should be politely turned down. The quarantine period of three months after a permanent ceasefire is the least that will be acceptable to the unionists. But there is scope to provide immediate benefits to all the people of Northern Ireland that will carry forward the peace process. One priority must be to scale down the military presence to the minimum level compatible with protecting all sections from maverick terrorists. Another is to lift the absurd ban on broadcasting the voices of Sinn Fein members which has done so much harm to the UK's reputation abroad. A peace process involves a dialogue, and a dialogue is impossible if one side cannot be heard. Finally, amendments to articles 2 and 3 of the Irish constitution to remove the unqualified claims to the north are promised as part of a final settlement. Bringing forward the changes would bolster unionist confidence. The ceasefire demands further risks on all sides to win the bigger prize of lasting peace in Ireland.</p>

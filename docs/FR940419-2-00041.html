			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The priority areas identified in this announcement are derived from legislative mandates as well as Departmental goals and initiatives. The priorities reflect the state of current knowledge as well as emerging issues which have come to ACYF's attention by several means including consultation with advocates, policymakers, and practitioners in the field.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The priorities seek to focus attention on and to encourage demonstration efforts to obtain new knowledge and improvements in service delivery for the solution of particular problems and to promote the dissemination and utilization of the knowledge and model practices developed under these priorities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A.

Typically, they relate to project design, evaluation, and community involvement. This section also asks for specific information on the proposed project. Inclusion and discussion of these items in the applicant's proposal is important since they will be used by the reviewers in evaluating the proposal against the evaluation criteria. Project products, continuation of the project effort after the Federal support ceases, and dissemination/utilization activities, if appropriate, should also be addressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each priority area is composed of the following sections:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eligible Applicants <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : This section specifies the type of organization which is eligible to apply under the particular priority area.

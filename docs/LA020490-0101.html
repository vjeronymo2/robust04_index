			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: DESIGN;  </P> <P> STILL LIFES WITH BLOSSOMS  </P> <P> 'I LEARNED ALL THE traditional ways of creating flower arrangements," Chris  Slack says, "but I never wanted to do them like anyone else." No chance of  that.  </P> <P> Slack doesn't create flower arrangements but rather natural still-life  sculptures, with a magnificent bloom or spray of orchids as the focal point.  "The Package" is a giant banana leaf folded to resemble a large green pocket  book. Inside is an orchid, or perhaps chocolate truffles or champagne. "The  Flower Wall" seemingly holds a bloom afloat in midair. Roses in "The Bamboo  Log" look as pretty dried as they do fresh. For those who want to learn how to  create such untraditional arrangements, Slack also teaches classes.  </P> <P> Chris Slack Flower Artist, 1346 N. Formosa Ave., Los Angeles, (213) 851-6961.

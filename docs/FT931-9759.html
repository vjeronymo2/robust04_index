			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Southern belle puts on fresh make-up - The chairman of Delta explains the recent dramatic changes at the airline to Paul Betts NEVER in the highly cyclical history of civil aviation have times been quite so bad, said Mr Ronald Allen, chairman of Delta Air Lines, the third biggest US carrier. 'We can't wait for the economy to turn around: we must re-engineer our airline and reduce our costs,' he added during a brief visit to London. The last few months have seen dramatic changes at the Atlanta-based airline, long regarded as the 'Southern belle' of the US industry because of its conservative and profitable track record. Delta is still 'a good, strong airline', said Mr Allen, but 'we are not immune to the kind of pressures that are facing this industry'. The carrier has incurred only four annual losses in its history: in 1947, 1983 and in its last two fiscal years ended June 1991 and June 1992. But its recent losses have been even bigger than those of its two big US rivals: American Airlines and United Airlines. After a net loss of Dollars 324.4m in the year to June 1991, Delta's deficit rose to a record Dollars 506.3m for the year to June 1992. In its current year, it has so far lost Dollars 233m. Mr Allen's response has been to launch what he calls a 'profit improvement plan' to save Dollars 375m by the end of this June and as much as Dollars 750m by the end of June 1995. This includes a consolidation of existing activities; rescheduling and reallocation of flights; deferring deliveries of more than Dollars 6bn worth of new aircraft ordered by the airline, which already counts a fleet of some 560 airliners; and a 5 per cent pay cut for its 75,000 employees. The company also cut its quarterly dividend last December and has shed 5,000 jobs during the past 12 months through early retirements, freezing recruitment and reducing the number of temporary workers. 'Although we reduced the dividend from 30 cents a share to a nickel (5 cents), we are one of the few carriers still paying a dividend,' Mr Allen emphasised, adding that he was encouraged to see the cost reductions starting to feed into the airline's financial performance. 'The results of the December quarter were disappointing but better than last year and almost all the improvement was due to cost reduction,' he explained. Delta's problems have been compounded by an unfortunate sequence of events. It started when the now-defunct Eastern Airlines, operating under US Chapter 11 bankruptcy rules, decided to rebuild three years ago a hub at Atlanta, Delta's home base. 'We found ourselves competing against a bankrupt airline which was cutting fares in an effort to generate cash flow,' Mr Allen said. When Iraq invaded Kuwait the following year, Delta, like the rest of the industry, went into a tailspin. 'Our fuel bill alone doubled,' Mr Allen said. Recession and the impact of the Gulf crisis pushed more US carriers into Chapter 11. 'At the peak of the crisis, almost 30 per cent of US traffic was controlled by bankrupt airlines which were not paying their bills: that situation still persists today with about 20 per cent of the our market controlled by bankrupt airlines,' Mr Allen explained. In the middle of all this came Delta's decision to acquire Pan American's European routes for Dollars 506m. Although the timing was unfortunate, Mr Allen claimed he had no regrets about the purchase. 'It was a very important deal for us strategically and tactically: it was a once in a lifetime opportunity,' he said. To compete on the important transatlantic market, Delta needed to strengthen its presence in New York and the north-east of the US. Mr Allen said his airline needed to increase its presence in this market in order to avoid losing business on both transatlantic and domestic US routes. But absorbing the Pan Am assets proved more difficult than expected. 'You have to accept some difficulties when you are buying assets from a bankrupt company,' Mr Allen acknowledged. One example was the old Pan Am terminal at New York's JFK airport. 'The problem was that the roof leaked. We had to fix that first before we could upgrade the interior, but by this summer our JFK terminal should be a pretty good show case,' he said. Although the Pan Am route acquisition made Delta the biggest airline serving the north Atlantic market, it has struggled to establish a strong identity in the European market. For this reason it has just appointed a new vice-president for Europe - Mr Michael Medlicott, former chief executive of the British Tourist Authority. Delta is also banking on its trilateral alliance with Swissair and Singapore Airlines to strengthen its global operations both in the European and the Asia-Pacific markets. But Mr Allen stressed that his airline's cross-equity holdings in Swissair and Singapore Airlines differed from the recent spate of alliances with other US carriers. 'Most of the current alliances formed with US airlines are bail-outs of financially troubled US carriers which are looking for money,' Mr Allen said. Delta, together with American and United, has led the campaign against British Airways' equity investment in USAir, the sixth largest US carrier. The big three US carriers successfully lobbied the Bush administration last winter to block BA's original proposal to acquire a 44 per cent stake in USAir for Dollars 750m. They are now renewing their efforts with the Clinton administration to torpedo BA's revised deal with USAir, initially involving a Dollars 300m investment by BA for a 19.9 per cent stake in the Pittsburg-based carrier. 'The latest BA deal is only a warmed-up version of the original one and their intent is the same,' Mr Allen claimed. Together with the other two big US carriers, Delta has asked the administration to declare a moratorium on all foreign investment in US airlines until the US government clearly defines a new international aviation policy. 'The new administration has a wonderful opportunity to redefine the rules for everyone: we favour open skies and we want to compete in an open market place,' Mr Allen said. In other words, the US should only allow BA to establish a strong foothold into the US market through its partnership with USAir if, in return, the other US carriers are given greater access into the UK market, and especially into London's Heathrow airport.</p>

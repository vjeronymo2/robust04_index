			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'JUST THE BEGINNING': CANCER PATIENT GETS DIPLOMA AT HOSPITAL  </P> <P> The auditorium at UCI Medical Center is not normally the setting for a  commencement, but Buena Park High School students gathered there Thursday,  along with school and hospital officials, to honor a young man who has held on  to his dreams despite a life-threatening illness.  </P> <P> Hendryck Mejia, who sported a green cap and gown in keeping with the occasion,  was the star attraction in the special ceremony -- the lone graduate.  </P> <P> About 150 friends and relatives watched as the usually cheerful senior strolled  down the aisle to a stage where he added a pair of green-mirrored eyeshades to  his outfit and received his high school diploma.  </P> <P> The auditorium, decorated with streamers cascading down from dozens of  balloons, took on the festive mood of a rite of passage. And though there was  no band -- only a record player -- to provide the strains of "Pomp and  Circumstance," the anticipation of a graduate moving on to new challenges was  in the air.  </P> <P> "This is just the beginning," the 18-year-old graduate shouted to well-wishers  with the same optimism that has helped him weather a 6-year battle with  leukemia.  </P> <P> "Wipe those tears from your eyes," he told them as they showered him with hugs,  kisses and gifts after the 20-minute ceremony.  </P> <P> Despite his struggles with cancer -- or maybe even because of them -- Mejia  hopes to become a physician and someday find a cure for the disease that may  claim his life.  </P> <P> Officials with the medical center in Orange presented him with a white lab coat  and an honorary degree in medicine on Thursday as a "head start."  </P> <P> The special ceremony was arranged by hospital and school officials because  Mejia will be undergoing an intense round of chemotherapy today and is not  expected to regain his strength by June 15, the official graduation date for  his high school.  </P> <P> Principal George Giokaris said Mejia had already met all graduation  requirements and that Thursday's ceremony was the school's response to "an  extremely special circumstance."  </P> <P> At the commencement, Giokaris, like others, praised Mejia for his strength and  the lessons he had taught others.  </P> <P> "You've taught us to nurture friendships and to make sure each interaction is  meaningful," the principal said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASSE RECORDINGS?  </P> <P> KFAC-FM's change from classical music to rock and the parceling out of its  record library may be a lot of things, but it is not comparable to the burning  of Alexandria (as Arthur C. O'Bryne wrote in Saturday Letters, Sept. 2). In the  year 415, Christians began the greatest book burning in history by torching the  Alexandrian library, in which was stored virtually the accumulated science and  literature of the Western world. We have little idea what masterpieces were  lost forever.  </P> <P> If the older recordings of KFAC are never heard again, I don't know what kind  of loss that would be, if a loss at all. Recordings that I once thought  definitive now sound frustratingly old. The Budapest Quartet is technically  sloppy. David Oistrakh may have been a great musician but his sound is thin and  weak. Rubinstein just plays too fast, and the recording quality on his RCA  records is dull and muddy. Heifetz sounds ridiculous when he uses chamber works  as technical vehicles. Even the great orchestral recordings by Szell and Reiner  don't have the transparency and brightness of some of today's CDs.  </P> <P> MATTHEW OKADA, Pasadena  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Antonio Polito: "Less Tactics, More </F> Goals..."]    [Text] So an election in the fall is a possibility. Or, at  least, this was not ruled out by Silvio Berlusconi, who at the  Confcommercio [General Confederation of Italian Merchants and  Shopkeepers] conference yesterday replied with a significant "no  comment" to a journalist who asked him explicitly about it.  Late yesterday evening his spokesman denied that his silence  constituted an expression of assent. But the proper  interpretation lies in the axiom on which the prime minister  earlier centered his political argument -- that is, that the  present electoral law prevents him from governing. The  conclusion is that he needs a new electoral law before he can  govern.    And an electoral law is a pressing necessity only if another  election is imminent. In any case, this newspaper has already  revealed this desire for an election on Sunday. Today Pilo  himself -- the high priest of opinion polls -- recounted to LA  REPUBBLICA the long hours spent at [Berlusconi's residence]  Arcore evaluating the figures applying to Berlusconi's "magic  moment."    It is very likely that we are right: If an election were to  take place now, especially with a single-round system with no  proportional quota, Forza Italia would swallow [League  Secretary] Bossi whole and half of [National Alliance leader]  Fini, and would undermine the Popular Party a little more. So  an election in November would benefit Berlusconi. But, if we  may be permitted to ask, would it benefit the country?    The first uncertainty that arises concerns the desirability  of starting such a debate, which certainly does not constitute  evidence of the solidity of the majority, in the midst of a  currency crisis in which, in our case, the credibility and  reliability of the government are at stake. Perhaps in order to  reassure the markets it would have been more advisable to adopt  a resolute stance in defense of the treasury minister and his  desire to keep public spending under control, even if it means  introducing an additional economic package during the course of  the year, the unpopularity of which is very easy to predict.    The second uncertainty concerns the need for another general  election. Usually they are justified -- and the president can  only call them for this sole reason -- in the presence of a  parliament that is incapable of promulgating laws, without a  majority, and unable to provide an alternative. But this does  not seem to be the situation, even though Berlusconi has had,  and may still have, problems in the Senate. In sincere and even  somewhat disarming terms, the leader of the left-wing opposition  in the Senate pointed out that hitherto he has had no  opportunity to stand "either with or against the government's  proposals: We seek them but do not find them." There is some  truth in this: The government was sworn in 1 May, and since  then not a single measure has been turned down by the  opposition. The only upheavals have occurred within the  majority itself -- over the INPS [National Social Security  Institute] and the RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation].    The third uncertainty concerns the political legitimacy of  another election so soon after a historic election conducted  under a new electoral system, which raised so many hopes in the  majority of Italians, who brought Berlusconi to the Palazzo  Chigi [office of the prime minister]. We do not deny that  Bossi's bluster may be annoying for the prime minister and -- we  fear for the League -- for the voters, too. But so far there  has been no more than that -- a great deal of skirmishing, with  no substance. For that matter, even in the most radical  first-past-the-post system, such as Britain's, poor Mr. Major  has to deal with the fringes of his parliamentary base (and they  are all Conservatives there; the single party of the Right  already exists.) And even in the United States, which elects  its head of government directly, Bill Clinton has to earn the  vote of each individual Congress member or senator, day after  day. Democracies -- including those that emphasize the right of  the executive to govern -- are a constant exercise in consensus,  both in the country as a whole and in parliament. If only, at  least, a new election were not to serve solely to increase what  Galli della Loggia in yesterday's CORRIERE DELLA SERA described  as "the plebiscitary-charismatic legitimization of the  parliamentary majority from above, its exclusive appointment by  royal investiture."    The government is faced with many things that need to be  done, and that need to be done at once. Both what we could call  the more traditional things, such as reorganizing the public  accounts, deciding how and when to introduce an additional  economic package, how and when to impose additional income tax  in order to fill the gap created by the ruling on pensions,  whether to compensate with an increase in the price of  cigarettes for the reimbursement of the 85,000 lire medical tax.  And also what we could call more innovative things, comprised  in the government's program and based on the economic liberalism  which Italy, tired of the Christian Democratic regime, has so  clearly shown that it appreciates -- from the million new jobs  to the reduction of fiscal pressure. Well, let it do them  before airing the possibility of another election.    In order to bring his ministers, who too often issue  conflicting messages, into line, Berlusconi needs not another  election, but simply Article 95 of the Constitution: "The prime  minister directs the government's general policy and is  responsible for it." In other words, this is his job. If,  then, Bossi abandons his lion's roars in favor of parliamentary  ambushes, or if what remains of the opposition is able to  obstruct the path to the country's recovery and renewal, then  the prime minister will be fully entitled to ask the president  to call another election. But if that happens, we will at least  know why we have been summoned to vote again.    Unfortunately we have no idea what Pilo thinks about it, but  the impression is that the Italian people are now hungrier for  government than they are for the arguments of political  scientists about how they are to be governed. It is rather like  in [soccer coach] Sacchi's Italy: We would all welcome rather  fewer strategic lessons about how to play without a ball and  prefer to see a few more balls in the adversary's goal.</p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> DOUGLAS' DELTA II LAUNCHES AIR FORCE NAVIGATION SATELLITE  </P> <P> A Delta II rocket blasted off Monday and put a $65-million Air Force navigation  satellite into orbit, marking McDonnell Douglas' eighth commercial rocket  launch of 1989.  </P> <P> The Delta II is built by McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. in Huntington  Beach. McDonnell Douglas is building 18 of the Delta II rockets for the Air  Force, at a cost of about $50 million each, to launch Navstar navigation  satellites designed to pinpoint within 50 feet the location of military troops  and vehicles anywhere in the world.  </P> <P> A McDonnell Douglas spokeswoman said the company has executed more commercial  launches this year than its competition. McDonnell Douglas' main competitors in  the commercial rocket business are General Dynamics, Martin Marietta and the  European consortium Arianespace.  </P> <P> The Navstar launch was the fifth of 18 satellites that the Air Force plans to  place into orbit by the mid-1990s as part of a worldwide navigation system. The  satellites are built by Rockwell International's Satellite and Space  Electronics Division in Seal Beach.  </P> <P> The Delta launch was originally scheduled Sunday but was canceled because of a  scratched helium regulator that would have prevented the rocket's second-stage  engine from igniting. Technicians fixed the problem Sunday night by installing  a relief valve in the helium system, which is used to pressurize the  second-stage fuel tanks.  </P></p>

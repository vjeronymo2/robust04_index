			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 22 (XINHUA) -- Qinghe County in north  China's Hebei Province is now processing and dealing in more  than 4,000 tons of cashmere annually, which accounts for two  thirds of the country's total or half of the world's total.    The county has become the country's largest base for  production of cashmere.    Every year, it exports over 3,000 tons of cashmere to more  than 20 countries and regions, such as Japan, Italy, Britain,  Germany and the United States. Many foreign businessmen  commented that the world's cashmere is mainly in China and  China's cashmere is mainly in Qinghe.    The county started to develop the industry of cashmere in  1984. After ten years of efforts, 18 out of the total 20  townships of the county have established the industry of  cashmere.    There are now more than 100 industrial enterprises of  cashmere in the county with over 7,500 wool-carding machines and  40,000 employees. Among them were three Sino-foreign joint  ventures.    Helped by the research institute of the Tianjin Textile  College, enterprises of cashmere in Qinghe County managed to  developed a series of unique technology for processing cashmere,  which raises the rate of extracted cashmere by 20 percent and  reduces the rate of length-damaged cashmere by 12 percent  compared with that of its imported technology and equipment.    The county has established perennial business relations with  over 30 domestic foreign trade enterprises and more than 100  overseas cashmere firms across the world.</p>

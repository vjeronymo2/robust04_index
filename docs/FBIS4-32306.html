			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Luiza Kowalska: "Defense Issues; KOK Is Holding </F> a Session Today; Defense Minister and BBN Chief Have Differing  Views"]    [Text] The National Defense Committee [KOK] is to  make a decision today on what to do about the chief of the  General Staff: to subordinate him to the president or to the  defense minister? In the meantime, Henryk Goryszewski, the new  chief of the presidential National Security Office [BBN], says  that the president is the boss of the chief of the General Staff  even now. "That is against the legal system in force," responds  the defense minister.    During a previous KOK session, Lech Walesa did not succeed  in  convincing all of its members to make the chief of the General  Staff subordinated to the president of the country. Debate on  the topic was postponed until today.    KOK's composition includes: the president; the prime  minister; Sejm and Senate speakers; chiefs of the Foreign  Affairs Ministry, the Internal Affairs Ministry, and the  National Defense Ministry [MON]; the finance minister; teh chief  of the General Staff; the chief of the President's Office; and a  secretary. Some of the officials (among them, the MON chief and  the Sejm speaker) want the chief of the General Staff to be  subordinated to the defense minister.    MON will today again present the draft of a law describing  presidential powers, as well as those of the defense minister  and the chief of the General Staff. However, the draft does not  include so-called safety valves that used to provide for  sanctions in case, for instance, the chief of the General Staff  were to exceed his powers. During the previous KOK session, it  was precisely the "safety valves" that aroused many reservations  on the part of the Belweder.    The Small Constitution provides only that "the president, in  consultation with the defense minister, appoints the chief of  the General Staff." Details are defined in a statute. There  has not been any doubt so far that, according to the legal  system in force, the chief of the General Staff is subordinated  to the minister.    In yesterday's edition of POLSKA ZBROJNA, however, Henryk  Goryszewski (BBN chief and a KOK secretary for a few days now),  said that, according to the Constitution, the chief of the  General Staff is subordinated directly to the president, even  now. "This does not mean, of course, that the head of the  General Staff is separated from the minister by a wall; however,  he is also not subordinated to the president through the head of  the National Defense Ministry," Goryszewski explained.    "That is contrary to the legal system in effect," comments  MON Chairman Piotr Kolodziejczyk, who also made the reservation  that he has not yet read Henryk Goryszewski's statement.</p>

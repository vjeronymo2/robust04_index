			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Running faster just to stand still - Quality assurance schemes may soon become necessary for survival / Farmer's Viewpoint WHEN COMMODITY prices fall and production costs continue to rise producers of those commodities have to respond. The two most positive options are to attempt to cut costs and/or to seek to increase receipts. The third, giving up the struggle and getting out of the business, is being chosen by about 100 UK farmers each week, either voluntarily or because they have been declared bankrupt. I am told that this is the operation of market forces. Having been a subsidised farmer all my life, I am not really supposed to understand these things. But I am learning fast. The Ministry of Agriculture's own records show that on average UK farm incomes have fallen in real terms by 50 per cent during the last decade. Furthermore, it has been calculated by the National Farmers' Union that the effect of the recently agreed reform of the European Community's common agricultural policy will be to reduce those incomes by a further 16 per cent over the next three years. To survive till now has already meant severe cost-cutting for most farmers and this is beginning to show in such things as the advancing age of tractors and the increasing breadth of untrimmed hedges. Those who seek to continue farming, against the apparent odds, will need to reduce expenditure still further. Last year alone, 6,000 farm workers lost their jobs on farms and the manpower exodus seems set to continue. While all this has been going on, however, the leading thinkers of the various sectors of the industry have been attempting to find ways of increasing income from commodities sold. It is called better marketing, another concept that is supposed to be foreign to most farmers. In simple terms, they have sought to identify the qualities consumers most desire in their food and to produce to those criteria. Chief arbiters in most of this have been the big supermarkets, which now claim to retail something between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of all the food consumed in Britain. The 'intelligence' the multiples are feeding back to producers is that the average consumer is now becoming concerned about the environmental and welfare implications of the way their food is produced, as well as the long-standing and vital need to be sure of its absolute safety for themselves and their families. I am bound to say that, while I am not surprised that the supermarkets put esoteric qualities forward as priorities, I have some doubt as to their total accuracy. Some months ago, I decided to do an unauthorised straw poll in my local superstore on why people chose particular types of eggs. On the shelves were free-range eggs, laid by hens which had access to open grassland, which were the most expensive; barn eggs, produced by hens kept inside on deep litter, which were less expensive; and so-called fresh eggs, clearly indicating that they had been produced by hens in battery cages, which were the cheapest. Frankly, I was amazed at the apathy of the shoppers. Some obviously did not look at the labels or the prices, merely picking up whatever came most easily to hand. Others thought fresh eggs must be best, because the rest did not have 'fresh' written on the packets. But most, when asked which eggs they would choose, simply said: 'The cheapest'. Only two ladies out of the two dozen or so that I questioned mentioned anything about battery cages and welfare. My conclusion from this highly unscientific survey is that it is possible that the supermarkets themselves, out of concern for their own public images, dictate the criteria for production standards far more than their trusting customers. Nevertheless, in the search for a better price for their beef cattle, their lambs, their pigs and their poultry products, groups of farmers, seeking to steal a march on their more traditional neighbours, have, over the last year or two, been developing quality assurance schemes. These involve producing animals to specified standards, which they perceive coincide with consumer demand. They include welfare, feed ingredients and slaughter conditions that are usually better than the law requires. In return the producers hope to earn a small premium for their stock. There are now so many such schemes - each supplying its particular niche market, but still, in total, only representing a minority of farmers - that the whole situation is becoming confused. Pleas are already being made by buyers to try to bring about some harmonisation of the standards. Indeed, to my certain knowledge, the pig industry is attempting to achieve just that, and I suspect that those who produce other classes of livestock may feel the need to do something similar. If they succeed, however, they will, of course, erode the premiums being paid for individual schemes. It seems inevitable to me that, as such quality assurance schemes spread across the industry, the standards they set will tend become the norm rather than the exception. And once supermarket buyers discover that they can readily acquire the quality and the standards they have set, they will be unwilling to pay premium prices. Only by by making the standards more difficult to achieve will those who began the quality race be able to maintain their price premium. It has to be recognised, moreover, that standards may be tightened anyway, to satisfy the fickle and changing demands of supermarkets and consumers. That is not likely to prove profitable for producers because most new restrictions placed on production methods will either add to costs or reduce efficiency. The whole quality assurance business is a treadmill that may become more onerous as time passes. But that is no reason for a farmer not to get involved in such a scheme. Not if he hopes to survive in business, that is. For I predict that, before very long, farmers who do not comply with some recognised assurance scheme will have difficulty in selling their stock at all. And if they are able to get rid of it, the price they get will be at a discount to that which is quality-assured. In short, those farmers who survive will have to run faster to stand still. The rest, who are unable to stand the pace, will probably swell the 100 a week who are already getting out of the business.</p>

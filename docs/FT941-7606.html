			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / CBI hits at paybill for public sector The government's failure to control public-sector pay is one of the main reasons for the current tax increases, according to the Confederation of British Industry. Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said yesterday: 'During the recession total government paybills have risen from 13 per cent to 14.2 per cent of national output. That is a good part of the reason we now face large tax increases.' He was introducing a CBI paper urging the public sector to copy the private-sector shift to decentralised bargaining and pay flexibility. 'During the 1980s a big gap opened up between public and private sector in pay determination,' he said. The paper says that the annual increase in paybills in private-sector manufacturing and services fell close to zero last year compared with a rise of nearly 4 per cent in the public sector. The CBI says that freezing the public-sector paybill, as the government intends to do each year until 1997, will lead to job losses. This will not increase unemployment provided the private sector expands to absorb the public-sector jobs. The CBI intervention comes just a few weeks before pay determination is decentralised for about 300,000 civil servants in civil service agencies. However most of the big agencies - such as the benefits agency - are expected to stick to the national pay rates for the immediate future. The CBI said service-sector earnings rose more slowly than settlements for the first time in living memory. This 'negative earnings drift' was the result of lower overtime and bonus payments. Service-sector settlements at 2.6 per cent in the third quarter of last year compared with an earnings increase of 2.25 per cent.</p>

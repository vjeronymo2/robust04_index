			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Dunkel to quit Gatt post - World trade body's members look for leadership change MR Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, intends to step aside at the end of June when the six-month extension of his mandate granted last year expires. Sources close to Mr Dunkel, who was appointed in 1980, said yesterday that he neither wanted nor expected to be asked for a second extension. There had been suggestions Mr Dunkel might be requested to stay a further six months to oversee completion of the six-year Uruguay Round of global trade negotiations, already two years overdue. The new US administration has said it wants to finish the Round by the end of 1993. But there seems to be growing consensus among Gatt members that new blood is needed, not only to help move the Uruguay Round negotiations but also to provide fresh leadership for the 106-nation organisation. Mr Dunkel's American deputy, Mr Charles Carlisle, has made clear his wish to step down this summer, and the second deputy post, traditionally held by a third world national, has been vacant since 1991. Gatt members, who appoint the director-general and deputies, have already begun the lengthy process of political horsetrading to achieve regional and economic balance between the top jobs. But, with Gatt's future dependent on the outcome of the Uruguay Round, they do not yet know if they are seeking a political heavyweight to run a powerful world trade organisation or a capable administrator to operate a contractual trade agreement. Mr Peter Sutherland, former EC competition commissioner, who is Irish, is seen as a possible successor to Mr Dunkel, a Swiss. Other names floated include Mr Brian Mulroney, the ousted Canadian prime minister, Britain's Lord Lawson, and Mexico's President Carlos Salinas. Mr Warren Lavorel, currently chief US negotiator for the Uruguay Round, has been tipped to succeed Mr Carlisle.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Sims Food Pounds 1.3m in the red - Livestock prices and sterling devaluation blamed for turnround High livestock prices together with the devaluation of sterling pushed Sims Food Group, the meat processor and supplier, Pounds 1.3m into the red at the pre-tax level during the six months to September 30. That compared with previous profits of Pounds 2.5m. Sales were 3.2 per cent higher at Pounds 148.9m, including Pounds 8.2m from acquisitions. Sims, which has seen its shares fall from 182p in June to last night's 102p, cut its dividend by a third to 2p. Mr John Stone, chairman, said the group's dire predictions about the state of trading had proved 'all too accurate'. Livestock prices had increased by between 18 and 30 per cent during the first half, while Sims was only able to raise its prices to retail customers by between 12 and 14 per cent. However, Mr David Brady, finance director, said the situation had improved substantially since September. A restructuring, for which Pounds 6.6m had been provided last year, had been completed resulting in a significant reduction in costs and capital employed in the business. Sims also intended shortly to sell its stake in TS&amp;W, a meat importing business, to management for a cash payment of about Pounds 4m. The retail division, which had incurred substantial losses in the first six months, had returned to profitability in the second half due to the restructuring. The strongest performance came from the manufacturing division, which increased organic sales by 21 per cent. Mr Brady said the acquisition of Oakland Fast Foods in July had exceeded expectations and Sims intended to focus its investment in this division in the future. Losses per share of 3p compared with previous earnings of 5.3p. The group reported net debt of Pounds 21m, leaving borrowings representing roughly 70 per cent of shareholders' funds.</p>

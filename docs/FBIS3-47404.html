			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 12 (KCNA) -- The U.S.  imperialists on January 9 staged a provocative electronic  warfare exercise against the northern half of Korea in the sky  above South Korea with an overseas-based "EA-6" [expansion  unknown] electronic jamming plane, according to military sources.    That day, a Pacific-based electronic jamming plane of the  U.S. Seventh fleet, flying above Suwon, Hoengsong and Chunchon  of South Korea, jammed the areas. Synchronising with this, an  "EH-60" [expansion unknown] electronic jamming plane based in  South Korea created electronic jamming in the areas near the  Demilitarized Zone along the Military Demarcation Line with the  skies above Paju and Pochon as an operational theatre. In the  wake of this, formations of Japan-based VTOL [vertical takeoff  and landing] assault planes and pursuit-assault planes staged a  drill of an intensive surprise attack on targets in the areas  under electronic jamming.    This reckless war game reveals the bellicose nature of the  U.S. imperialists as warmaniacs.</p>

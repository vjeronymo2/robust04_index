			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Japan lifts apple ban Japan has given approval to US apple farmers' pest control measures which had for long prevented US apple exports, the centre of a long trade dispute between the two countries, reports Emiko Terazono from Tokyo. Japanese agricultural officials said they hoped an agreement on procedural matters with the US would be reached by the end of this month and the first US apple imports would start in September. The decision follows recent criticism from the US government over Japan's unfair trade practices. Japan officially liberalised its apple market in 1971, but kept foreign apples out through strict quarantine rules about pests and diseases.</p>

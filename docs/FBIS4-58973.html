			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report from Washington] </F>   [Text] Informed U.S. sources have stated that the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP] has communicated to the U.S.  Administration its desire to deal with this administration in  the future and to coordinate policies with it vis-a-vis the Gulf  and Middle East affairs in return for supporting YSP efforts to  secede and restore its pre-unity status. The YSP also expressed  its readiness to grant all oil prospecting concessions to U.S.  companies.    The oral message conveyed by special envoy of 'Ali Salim  al-Bid to a U.S. official said the YSP does not oppose U.S.  interests and fully understands the U.S. policy in the region,  particularly the two issues of peace with Israel and the siege  on Iraq.    The YSP told the U.S. Administration it will use its Air  Force in its battle with Sanaa and asked the administration not  to misinterpret this step because it is part of the secessionist  attempt which requires a military battle after which all  attempts at reconciliation or pressure on the southerners to  abandon their secessionist plan will subside.    In the past, the YSP has received large sums of foreign  financial aid.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Earlier this morning government troops launched  intensified land, air, and sea strikes against the Abu Sayyaf  group in the village of Lumbahan in Patikul, Sulu.    This was announced today by Jericho Kagawan, Philippine  National Police [PNP] director for operations. He explained  that the operation was a result of the group's continued refusal  to stop their illegal activities.    The group is behind the series of kidnap-for-ransom cases in  different parts of Mindanao. Negotiations were conducted with  the group on stopping these activities, but they fell on deaf  ears.    According to Kagawan, three Marine battalions supported by  the PNP are currently sweeping down on the areas where the  bandits are hiding.</p>

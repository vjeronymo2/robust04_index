			<p>BFN     [Text] Miyazaki, June 18 KYODO -- Yohei Kono, president of  the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), on  Saturday [18 June] criticized Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's  remarks that Japan has the capability to produce nuclear weapons.    "Such remarks may create misunderstanding in the  international community," Kono told the party's prefectural  chapter meeting in Miyazaki, southern Japan.    Hata told reporters Friday it is "certainly the case that  Japan has the capability to possess nuclear weapons but has not  made them."    The prime minister said Japan has abstained from doing so in  line with its obligations as a nonnuclear power under the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.    "How could the prime minister make such comments when every  nation is making efforts to resolve (the issue of) North korea's  suspected nuclear weapons development program?" Kono said.    He also said A-bomb victims and other concerned people in  the  only atomic-bombed nation have a severe perception about nuclear  weapons.    Hata made the comment in connection with a remark he  reportedly made in a House of Councillors budget committee  meeting earlier Friday.    It is believed to be the first time for the Japanese  Government to directly acknowledge such potential, either in the  Diet or publicly.</p>

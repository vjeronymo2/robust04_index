			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Activity rises in financial services BUSINESS IN the financial services sector strengthened during the last three months with insurance brokers, securities traders and fund managers enjoying the sharpest increases in activity, Emma Tucker writes. A survey by the Confederation of British Industry and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the chartered accountants, found that increases in profitability had led to a rise in optimism for the third successive quarter. About 300 companies took part in the survey. Only life insurers and venture capitalIsts reported declines in business volume, although business levels remained below normal for banks and building societies. A survey from the Finance and Leasing Association today shows that leasing rose by 26 per cent in the three months to May, compared with the same three months a year ago, and that hire purchase was up 8 per cent.

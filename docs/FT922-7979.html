			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Raglan in restructuring discussions Raglan Property Trust is in preliminary discussions with another party which might or might not lead to a restructuring of the company. This would not involve an offer for the share capital. Directors are shortly to call an EGM because, based on management accounts, they believe the net assets of the company have fallen below Pounds 880,000, or 0.5p per share, and were at less than half of the called-up share capital.</p>

The HRC said in a report it  recorded 361 incidents of politically-motivated violence in  February as compared to 509 incidents in January. "The February  death toll of 245 is significantly down from the January figure  of 328 and reconfirms the strong downward trend in political  violence. February recorded the seventh successive month of  decline in political violence as measured by death toll," the  report said. It said the average daily death toll dipped below  nine this month and seemed headed back to the level of six per  day which was prevalent at the same time last year.    The HRC said 70 of the dead in February were African  National  Congress [ANC] supporters and 31 supporters of the Inkatha  Freedom Party. The victims included 12 African National  Congress supporters massacred at Masunkazane in Richmond in  Natal, and 15 ANC activists massacred at Mahlele in Creighton,  also in Natal.    The HRC said 20 women, 25 children, nine commuters and six  members of the security forces were among those killed in  February.    It said Natal now firmly occupied the violence centre-stage  with 66 per cent of the national toll in February. Nonetheless  the provisional figure of 161 deaths in February in Natal was  still a little lower than any figure during the past eight  months. "Peace initiatives in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand,  Vereeniging] region are succeeding in returning violence levels  to the manageable proportions of a year ago. The PWV region  seems now to be well on its way to being stabilised, but sub  regions which are still unsettled are West Rand, Alexandra, Vaal  and of course the East Rand which accounted for 62 per cent of  PWV deaths in February."</p>

Mishakov; UDC 621.373.826] </F>   [Abstract] The rate of sedimentation as a function of  geometrical parameters, such as the beam diameter and distance  between the beam axis and substrate, was examined for the  conditions of laser-chemical deposition of silicon from a  mixture of monosilane with argon under the effect of continuous  CO[.sup]2[/] laser. Procedures are described for measurements  of the deposition rate. To minimize the edge effect of the  heater measurements, depending on the distance between the beam  and the substrate the measurements were made at the same beam  section. The chemical kinetics in this case is primarily  determined by the gas temperature, therefore, to a great extent,  the problem of the rate and the deposition conditions can be  solved by examining the distribution of gas temperature in the  reactor volume, depending on the parameters of the experiment.  The direct measurements of the gas temperature near the laser  beam were compared with the results of numerical computations of  the temperature fields in the cavity, produce by an electric  heater of the substrate as well as by the gas absorption of the  laser radiation. Based on the experimental results and data in  the literature, it can be concluded that a developed  photoabsorption convection is being developed under the examined  conditions, which significantly changes the temperature field in  the cavity. It is apparent that for construction of an adequate  theoretical model of laser-chemical deposition, the convection  must be taken into the account under the examined conditions.

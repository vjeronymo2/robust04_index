			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Airport shops Long opening hours and the presence of a 'captive audience' are turning airport shops into real money spinners, says a report published last week. The report, Airport Retailing in the UK, by the Corporate Intelligence Group predicts that UK airport shops are heading for sales of more than Pounds 600m in 1994 - a 50 per cent increase on the 1990 figure despite the recession. Sales by the end of the decade could be worth Pounds 1bn a year, boosted by sales at shops run by high-street names such as Boots, WH Smith and Lillywhites.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Senators back community banks The Clinton administration has completed the first item on its banking legislation agenda with a Senate vote to pass the Community Development Act, which will set up a Dollars 382m (Pounds 246.4m) fund to spur the creation of local development banks and partnerships in economically distressed communities, writes George Graham. But a more far-reaching bill to allow banks to open branches outside their home states, overturning decades of US banking tradition, remains blocked in the Senate. Although its supporters believe they will easily win a vote on the measure, which passed the House of Representatives last month, the debate on healthcare reform has pushed it off until at least September. The Community Development Act was a significant component of President Bill Clinton's economic programme, and administration officials say it should improve access to credit for communities which have found it difficult to obtain financing. Mr Frank Newman, a Treasury undersecretary, said he hoped within a year not only to establish the fund but to make the first investments. The fund may offer equity, loans or grants to community development banks, as well as providing credits to traditional banks which increase community lending.</p>

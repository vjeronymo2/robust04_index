			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / People: Welcome mat for Jones at ABPI Trevor Jones, former director of research, development and medical in the UK at Wellcome, has resigned. He is leaving the board to become director general of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. The move should add considerable weight to what has been a lacklustre association with a poor reputation for promoting the cause of the British drugs industry. Jones is a scientific heavy-weight and fine communicator. 'The UK's pharmaceuticals industry has much to do. But if we can get it right, this country will remain the best place to do pharmaceuticals research,' Jones says. His departure from Wellcome represents the end of a debate at the top of the organisation about how best to manage international pharmaceuticals development. The company has been struggling with two large development organisations: one in the UK where Jones was in charge and one in the US where David Barry was vice-president research and development. Barry has recently become director of medical affairs for the whole company. 'It was clear that we had to have a single focus. John Robb (chief executive and chairman), looked at the two approaches and decided to go for David's. It was a difficult decision, but I'm not at all bitter. Wellcome has a super R&amp;D portfolio which I hope David will be able to make grow.' Jones says the main difference between them had been over whether to use clinical groups - in effect a team approach - or whether to give greater importance to a central leader. 'There wasn't an argument between us. We both agreed development had to be done internationally,' he said.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (11): Honeymoons can be wonderful  -Consultant's Critique ON a honeymoon, partners think they know each other perfectly and are usually blissfully happy. Talking to Hambros and CHP together, it seemed like they had just got married. Hambros had had eyes only for CHP in their selection process and never strayed even to look at the prices that others might charge. The middle of a large development is often like this. Everyone is nice to each other. Delivery dates look miles away and any slippage can be easily allowed for. Whether it remains so pleasant is a matter of time. I suspect that things will be slightly more strained in six to 12 months. If it succeeds, it is a win-win deal. Hambros gets a cheaper system and CHP gets a product ready to sell to others. This sort of partnership can work extremely well as long as both parties feel they are being treated properly. I feel it is too early to really judge this site. Gantt charts look impressive, but everything works on paper.</p>

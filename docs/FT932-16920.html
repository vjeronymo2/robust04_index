			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: MIM buys exploration venture stake for ADollars 43m MIM, the Australian metals and coal producer, has acquired 30 per cent of Mount Fort Constantine, a copper and gold mining exploration venture, for up to ADollars 43m (USDollars 30m). Mr Norman Fussell, managing director, said the company had bought the stake from Hunter Resources, a small Australian mining group. The other 70 per cent is owned by Western Mining, another leading Australian mining group. The Mount Fort Constantine joint venture, which operates in north-west Queensland, includes the highly-rated Ernest Henry copper-gold deposit, which is subject to legal proceed-ings. If Ernest Henry is ultimately included in the MIM deal, the purchase price will be ADollars 43. If not, MIM will grant Hunter Resources a 2 per cent gross royalty in mineral production as settlement. Mr Fussell said MIM regards Ernest Henry as among Australia's most prospective copper-gold areas.</p>

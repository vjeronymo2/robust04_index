			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Background:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The goal of this priority area is to provide support for the inclusion of ``family violence prevention'' in a comprehensive approach which considers environmental and cultural factors in plans for intervention and violence prevention strategies in minority communities. Historical Black Colleges and Universities in their relationships with minority communities and their residents offer an opportunity for the exchange and development of innovative ideas and approaches to the prevention of violence in general. This effort will make it possible to capture, consider and utilize the ideas for violence prevention that exist in the minority communities, particularly in response to the problems of racism and poverty. The utilization of HBCUs in this effort will make available the considerable expertise, experience, and resources to be found in these institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Family violence prevention activities encompass a wide range of activities that include the teaching of conflict resolution skills, the implementation of intervention strategies, and the development of informational materials on available resources and services. Family violence prevention may be viewed as the sum of activities which are guides to acceptable behavior. For example, activities that may be a part of the family violence prevention equation provide parenting skills and techniques, emphasize self-esteem for our youth, stress the importance of higher education as a conduit to a better lifestyle, and identify the means of avoiding negative health consequences such as AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Family violence prevention needs to be considered as a part of an overall violence prevention strategy. With this particular perspective the Administration for Children and Families is interested in applications that address:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Overall strategies for violence prevention activities that focus on educational and training efforts, outreach activities and supportive services, and the role and impact of community institutions;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cooperative networks and collaborative approaches within the minority communities for the prevention of anti-social and violent behavior and that facilitate the implementation of family violence preventive efforts;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Intervention approaches concerned with building upon family values within minority families;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institutional intervention strategies utilizing resources such as alumni, fraternities and sororities, the African American religious community, and volunteers from the community in general; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The identification of data gathering, informational and research activities that are needed to identify, support, and implement the long-term strategic interventions to reduce ``Black on Black'' crime in general and family violence in the African American community in particular.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Minimum Requirements for Project Design:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to successfully complete under this priority area, the applicant should:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Prepare and submit an application that clearly reflects how the applicant will coordinate with other community organizations, agencies, institutions, and individuals active in the field of family violence prevention;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Describe, as a major element, the significant prevention efforts that are a part of the educational and training, outreach, and supportive service strategies; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Describe, as an element of the plan, the proposed approach to a public information/community awareness strategy and identify the specific audience, community(s), and target group(s) on which the efforts will be focused.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Describe, as an element of the plan, the intended strategies for test marketing the development plans and give assurances that effectiveness criteria will be implemented prior to finalizing the plan;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Include as critical elements in the plan:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The development and use of non-traditional sources as information providers and in outreach efforts;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The specific interventions to be modeled and their responsiveness and sensitivity to the general violence in the African American community;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A set of achievable objectives and the evaluation components that are to be used to measure the degree of success in achieving the objectives as well as the assessment of the programs impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Project Duration:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The length of the project should not exceed 17 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal Share of the Project:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The maximum Federal share of the project is not to exceed $40,000 for the 17-month project period. Applications for lesser amounts also will be considered under this priority area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> JOHN DENVER SURVIVES AIR CRASH  </P> <P> John Denver's 1931 Waco biplane, caught by a gust of wind, crashed on landing  at the Holbrook Airport, but the singer walked away unhurt, police said today.  </P> <P> Denver's vintage airplane sustained "extensive damage" in the crash Thursday,  but the entertainer did not need medical treatment, Police Chief Lester James  said.  </P> <P> Denver was alone in the plane and trying to land at Holbrook Airport for  refueling on a flight from Carefree, Ariz., to Santa Fe, N.M.  </P> <P> "When he attempted to set down, a gust of wind apparently blowing from the west  caught the aircraft," James said. "It bounced a couple of times. His indication  to us was that he tried to fly out of it, but the engine stalled and the  aircraft went down. It either cart-wheeled or flipped over."  </P></p>

			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Tuskar Resources recommends offer The board of Tuskar Resources, the Irish exploration company, yesterday recommended acceptance of an all-share offer for the company made last March by Australian exploration company Coplex. Tuskar's main assets are its exploration licences in the Rubiales and Piriri oil fields in Colombia. It sold a 54% stake in these to Coplex last month, in order to finance the completion of a drilling programme, under the terms of the licence arrangements. The Coplex bid is a one-for-twelve share-swap offer which values Tuskar at IPounds 4.67m.</p>

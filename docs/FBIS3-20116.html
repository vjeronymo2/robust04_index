			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Palermo, Italy, March 26 (AFP) -- The trial of Mafia  boss Toto Riina was suspended Saturday [26 March] after five  jurors refused to serve, sparking an immediate inquiry, judicial  officials said.    A criminal court session in the Ucciardone prison in this  Sicilian town was set to try Riina Saturday morning on charges  of arranging the murder of Gerlando Alberti, a former member of  the Mafia.    Riina and other suspected Mafia leaders are accused of  hiring  five men who tried to poison Alberti while he was serving a  sentence in Ucciardone. Alberti was able to alert prison guards  in time to save his life.    The prosecutor's office will question the jurors to  determine  the cause of their refusal.    It is not unusual for jurors in Italy to refuse to serve in  Mafia trials because of potential danger to themselves or their  families.</p>

			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: ANTIVIRAL DRUG CAN EASE HERPES PAIN, AVERT LESIONS  </P> <P> Question: When we got married 20 years ago, I had herpes. We were careful, but  10 years later my husband caught it.  </P> <P> My case has gradually improved to the point that I now have an outbreak only  every other year. But my husband suffers terribly with an episode at least once  a month.  </P> <P> Before he came down with genital herpes, we were extremely happy. Since then,  he has not touched me -- no kiss, no hug, no tender word. He has abandoned me  emotionally, spiritually, financially and physically. We have separate bedrooms  and bank accounts.  </P> <P> Herpes has been an unbelievable evil in our lives. Is there any hope for a  cure?  </P> <P> Answer: Although it is unfair, your husband seems to be blaming you for his  misery. Unfortunately, there is still no cure for herpes, but it may be  possible for him to control his outbreaks.  </P> <P> Zovirax (acyclovir) is an effective antiviral medication that can prevent  lesions when it is taken on a daily basis. These prescription pills have  revolutionized the treatment of genital herpes. They can also speed healing of  cold sores or fever blisters caused by herpes 1.  </P> <P> Your husband should discuss his problem with a dermatologist or urologist. In  addition, both of you would perhaps benefit from marital counseling to help  overcome the years of bitterness caused by a viral infection.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Q. Both my daughter and I have had problems with malodorous perspiration. The  odor is very difficult to launder out of clothing.  </P> <P> We found the solution in Prevention magazine, and want to pass it along. Zinc  gluconate, 20 mg., prevents smelly perspiration for us. Perhaps others will  benefit as well.  </P> <P> A. In Germany, zinc compounds are included in deodorants to prevent unpleasant  smells from sweat. We have been unable to locate any scientific studies  verifying that oral zinc supplements can have this effect. However, the dose of  zinc that you are taking is within a safe range, and as far as we know, is not  likely to cause any complications.  </P> <P> Foods that are rich in this mineral include whole grains, especially wheat  germ, seafood, brewer's yeast and meat.  </P></p>

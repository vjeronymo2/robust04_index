			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Raja'i al-Masri, by 'Adil Bishtawi, from </F> Amman; date not given--first five paragraphs are AL-HAYAH  introduction]    [Text] At the time of ongoing political negotiations for an  end to Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip,  several other parties are continuing their efforts to create  institutions capable of bringing about development and improving  the quality of life of inhabitants of the occupied territories  as well as of building the infrastructure and restoring  essential services after 26 years of negligence and destruction  that were at the core of Israeli occupation policies.    A number of Israeli institutions and Palestinian businessmen  have announced the founding of holding companies to help rebuild  the occupied motherland, even before agreement was reached in  Washington last September on the Declaration of Principles  between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.    There have been recurring press reports of "huge" projects  being planned to expend "billions of dollars" in the West Bank  and the Strip. A great many of those plans, however, did not  materialize and may never see the light of day.    Information available so far would indicate that the  Palestine Development and Investment Corporation (PDIC),  incorporated in Amman at the end of last month, has the  financial, managerial, and technical clout to do the difficult  job ahead. It would also seem that it has adopted a more  tangible strategy to deal with current conditions and possible  future developments.    AL-HAYAH had the following interview in Amman with Raja'i  al-Masri, the company's official spokesman.    [Bishtawi] Now that the Palestine Development and Investment  Corporation has been incorporated in Amman and its 16-member  Board of Directors elected, what remains to be done before  operations can begin in occupied Palestine?    [Al-Masri] The next step is to appoint a managing director  for the company after his job description is stated. The  company's administrative structure has already been defined and  a number of individuals have already been named to certain  positions. Legal counsel has already taken steps to establish  the company's regional headquarters in Amman as discussions  continue with regard to its main offices in Palestine. The final  location of the latter is yet to be determined, but they will be  initially located in the West Bank, in or close to Jerusalem.  Additional offices will be opened in Gaza City.    [Bishtawi] What are the broad investment strategies of  Palestine Development and Investment Corporation?    [Al-Masri] Conceptually, the company's activities will  primarily be a function of its nature as a funding company in  the sense that it will be a financing vehicle, even though it  may play a limited role in the transfer of technology. I am not  referring to pure or basic sciences; rather, to the transfer of  the technology of various types of systems. The company will  engage in constant contacts in an endeavor to foster world-wide  financing relations with private and other institutions such as  the European Community and the International Finance Agency. The  latter is a World Bank agency concerned with private sector  investments. Meanwhile, we continue to seek and identify others  with which we can open dialogue and cooperate and from whose  experiences we can benefit.    The company, after completing feasibility studies for the  projects it targets for investment, plans to invest initially  through companies operating in the West Bank and Gaza, including  al-Ruwwad Palestinian company, which is yet to be founded even  though it has been registered in Ramallah and several founders  culled from among West Bank businessmen. The parent company  (Palestine Development and Investment) will own 49 percent of  al-Ruwwad's estimated capital of $50 million. This is the  maximum investment ratio allowed under current laws in the  occupied territories. It is currently planned that local  Palestinian founders put up 25 percent of capital and offer the  remaining 26 percent to public subscription in the West Bank and  the Gaza Strip. The company's total investments in the interior  could be in the vicinity of $200 million.    [Bishtawi] There are expectations that the company may begin  operations in occupied Palestine within six months. What type of  project could the company undertake or invest in?    [Al-Masri] There are a number of essential projects that are  important both strategically and as investments. Preliminary  studies have already been made on one such project that focuses  primarily on the construction industry. It will be implemented  in several stages.    Certain projects involve the construction of fully  integrated  housing complexes outside the cities in order to help alleviate  stifling population densities. Each complex would comprise 1,000  housing units. There is a political dimension to this that must  be dealt with first, because it has to do with the land  privatization issue. It is common knowledge that land ownership  is in dispute, and the subject of Palestinian land is therefore  extremely sensitive and complex.    Other plans call for the construction of three- and  four-star  hotels in a number of Palestinian cities. A number of industrial  and productive projects aim at creating employment opportunities,    [Bishtawi] How will the company raise the capital to finance  all the aforementioned projects, which may cost $1 billion?    [Al-Masri] The company seeks to raise $200 million through a  private subscription. About half of that amount has already been  pledged. I don't foresee a problem in raising the entire amount  since the deadline for the private subscription has been  extended for three more months ending this coming 30 June. Since  the subscription is private, the minimum investment amount has  been set at $100,000 and the maximum at $1 million--the latter  being 1 percent of capitalization. That would guarantee that no  one party could gain control of the company and would ensure the  widest possible investor base by giving everyone an opportunity  to subscribe.    [Bishtawi] Why didn't the company hold a public subscription  as the Lebanese company Solidaire did? There are a large number  of Palestinian investors who are able and willing to finance  this vital project.    [Al-Masri] I believe it is because the maximum investment  amount was set at $1 million. There is a considerable number of  Arab and Palestinian investors abroad who are able to subscribe  such an amount. Another reason is that the intention was to  raise needed capital as rapidly as possible in order to coincide  with the opening of the West Bank and Gaza to investments.  Furthermore, the legal structure of the parent company and its  possible subsidiaries provides for the future broadening of the  subscription base in order to enable the largest possible number  of Arabs and Palestinians to contribute to the development of  Palestinian lands.    [Bishtawi] Does the strategy of establishing a holding  company to engage in private sector investments mean that the  political leadership has given its support or has acquiesced to  the fact that the Palestinian economy will be open, private, and  free-market-driven rather than be government directed or  controlled?    [Al-Masri] There is considerable dependence on the private  sector in the effort towards development and social and economic  revival in Palestinian lands. The private sector accounts for 85  percent of Palestinian economic activity, according to World  Bank figures based on the finest field studies. The public  sector played no major role during the 26 years of Israeli  occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, during which the private  sector had to contend with extremely difficult conditions and  cope with impossible regulations, oppressive martial law, and  other factors that helped instill in it the spirit of individual  enterprise, initiative, and awareness. The free-market concept  is therefore taking hold as a tradition. We must build upon  something positive and that economic convention is positive  without a doubt.    [Bishtawi] Am I to understand then that there has been  stated  or unstated prior agreement with the Palestinian political  leadership to abstain from government controls and refrain from  the partial or full nationalization of future projects and  institutions in Palestinian lands?    [Al-Masri] It is not my place to verbalize the viewpoint of  the political leadership. However, the political leadership has  been consulted and it gave its blessing. The company's  orientation has been stated in its articles of incorporation and  it varies considerably from those of many other Arab companies  founded in the past 20 or 30 years. The articles emphasize that  the company will engage in medium- to long-term investments and  that its stock will not be traded during the first few months or  even the first few years. The articles also call for adding  capital gradually over four years. The objective is not quick  profit as proved by the fact that it was not made easy to trade  the company stock early on. It can be said, generally speaking,  that some company activities will fall under the development  plans instituted by the political leadership, including those  plans contained in studies prepared by concerned organizations  such as the World Bank and others. It should not be forgotten  that sound investments mean projects that are feasible and  profitable.    [Bishtawi] The plan to establish the Palestine Development  and Investment Corporation is based on two basic assumptions.  The first is that peace is inevitable and that it will at least  allow for industrial and commercial activity. The second is that  relations between Jordan and Palestine are predetermined and  known?    [Al-Masri] It goes without saying that the huge investment  and economic capabilities of all Arabs and Palestinians outside  Palestine should be enlisted to seize all opportunities for  capital to contribute, with a reasonable degree of efficacy and  freedom, in correcting the grave imbalances, deviations, and  distortions that afflict the economic structure of Palestinian  lands as a result of the Israeli occupation. Despite the  complexity and fluctuations of political conditions, and despite  the diversity and disparity of the many visions for the future,  this recruitment of capital would lay the ground work for social  and economic development in order to create jobs, raise incomes,  improve expertise, and develop the skills of the overwhelming  majority of our working people in the Palestinian lands. That  goes hand in hand with realizing for investors worthwhile  returns on capital. Success in that endeavor is supposed to  anchor the people to the Palestinian lands. Furthermore, it is  immensely important for the Palestinian economy to refrain from  close ties with and almost total subservience to the Israeli  economy. Opportunities should be created to facilitate the  restoration of wider economic exchange and the launching of  joint ventures between Palestinian lands and the sister Arab  states.    [Bishtawi] Were you asked by the Jordanian Government to  defer the incorporation of the company, for instance until the  relationship between Jordan and the Palestinian entity takes its  final shape or until a propensity emerges for certain projects  and not others?    [Al-Masri] The Jordanian Government has not intervened in  the  slightest at any stage of founding the company. At the inaugural  celebration held at the Amman Chamber of Industry and addressed  by PLO representative Ahmad Quray' (Abu-'Ala'), Jordan announced  in the person of Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of information,  that it would extend all possible assistance to guarantee  company success and enable it to realize its objectives. It was  clear by his statement that Jordan would not interfere with the  Palestine Development and Investment Corporation. We must at  this point emphasize the unity of the two peoples and the  similitude of their interests.    [Bishtawi] Even though the situation has eased somewhat,  there remains a great deal of ambiguity, for instance about the  nature of the administrative institutions with which the  Palestine Development and Investment Corporation and similar  establishments would deal in the West Bank and Gaza?    [Al-Masri] This is true but the objective at the moment is  to  attempt to mobilize human and financial resources in order to  have manpower and financing ready and waiting when the situation  becomes clearer. I can say that the company endeavors to skirt  the many deficiencies of the present by wielding the weight it  has achieved thanks to the caliber of its investors. It is a  given that the vagueness and uncertainty that characterize this  period in time would tend to discourage individual private  capital from investing in Palestinian lands. That prompted the  creation of the company in order to undertake that important  wide-scale assemblage of investors from among leading  institutions and distinguished senior businessmen, thereby  assigning private sector contributions a leading and innovating  role. The Palestine Development and Investment Corporation, as  it now stands, has the necessary clout that--coupled with  efficient management and the adoption of modern advancement  systems--would enable it to be doubly effective in achieving  targeted objectives within a reasonable time frame.    [Bishtawi] Palestine Development and Investments Company is  not the first firm founded for the development of Palestine and  for undertaking projects in the West Bank and Gaza. Are you  coordinating with other companies in order to avoid duplication  and competition for the limited number of projects?    [Al-Masri] There is no coordination per se. The company will  be primarily active in strategic projects. We will not be  involved in small projects except to offer support. There are  industrial projects undertaken either by individuals or by a  small group of businessmen, and these need financial, technical,  managerial, and marketing support. It is in those areas that  support can be offered, but not for the purpose of control or  full or even substantial ownership. The company will therefore  specialize primarily in the implementation of strategic and  medium-range projects that would be untenable for individual  investors.    [Bishtawi] In which currencies will the company deal?    [Al-Masri] The company's capital is in U.S. dollars but  investments will be denominated on the basis of capital invested  into local companies in the domestic currency. But there will  companies like al-Ruwwad which chose to put its capital (50  million) in U.S. dollars.    [Bishtawi] Have you considered, for instance, hedging  contracts that would protect the company against sharp  fluctuations to which investments in local currencies may be  exposed?    [Al-Masri] This is something for the future into which we  have not yet looked. It will be considered on a case-by-case  basis as it comes up. The reason is that in most of the  investments being considered, capital will not be recouped for a  period of perhaps three to five years before distributions of  profits are made. They will therefore be self-stabilizing and  hedging would be short termed.    [Bishtawi] The premise underlying all this, as we understand  it, is that Israel will withdraw from the West Bank and the  Strip or you would not have considered the establishment of this  company; and that there will be stability, otherwise there will  be no development since it is a function of stability. Are these  and other developments a consideration in the company's  operating strategies, or would you be able to halt operations at  any stage that suffers a specific setback and go back to the  planning board?    [Al-Masri] The laws under which the company was incorporated  as well as its articles of incorporation give it enough  flexibility. I reiterate that political developments are beyond  our control, but indications of a peaceful solution do exist.    [Bishtawi] As an international expert in economic and  financial affairs, would you advise the Arab or Palestinian  venture capitalist in the diaspora to invest in a company like  Palestine Development and Investment Corporation?    [Al-Masri] Palestinians primarily, and Arabs to a lesser  degree, are invited at this time to assume the long-delayed role  that is incumbent upon them to play. We all agree that we are  currently passing through a period of uncertainty. The path is  not clearly marked, and the difficulties are numerous. But it is  this type of situation that generates deeper commitment and a  more urgent call for involvement. Our people in the lands of  Palestine have the ability and determination to dust off  backwardness and bring about an ever-increasing development that  is sustainable through our own potential and abilities once  occupation ends and artificial legislative and legal  restrictions are lifted, and heavy-handed political domination  is removed. Perhaps our greatest asset, without giving in to  narrow chauvinism, is the human resources in Palestinian lands,  be they resolute businessmen or stone-throwing children, as  borne out by recent World Bank studies. All this will inevitably  generate numerous worthwhile economic and investment  opportunities, and it stands to reason that Palestinian and Arab  investors should share in their rewards.    [Bishtawi] Some international experts expect peace in the  Middle East to create conditions that would transform the region  into one of the most prosperous areas of the world. How do you  see this?    [Al-Masri] That is our target and hope. I am a resident of  the West who has traveled extensively in Asia over the past  three years. I have dealt with the so-called economic tigers  (such as Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea), and I have always  felt deeply anguished. We should never give in to negativism,  because the world is moving at a tremendous pace, and the gap  between us and the developed world is widening rapidly. We have  no alternative but to build, but we must have available to us  certain markets and a certain degree of integration in order to  play an effective role in developing the economy, raise the  standard of living, and catch up somewhat with world  development. The company, by virtue of its stated purpose, is  attempting to play such a role, but this would depend on the  political will. The presence of political will, along with  awareness and education, is of the essence. All this is a  function of people's convictions, customs, and habits, as well  as of existing laws and of the need for economic liberalization.  There is no other way.    [Bishtawi] How do you describe Raja'i al-Masri?    [Al-Masri] Raja'i al-Masri is a Palestinian who was born in  1948 in Nablus on the West Bank. He graduated from Wisconsin  University in the United States with a degree in electrical  engineering. I hold an MBA from a university in France and am a  CFA international fellow [as published]. I held positions with  the Banque de Paris, an investment bank in Paris, as well as  with the Royal Bank of Canada and with Procter and Gamble. I  presently live in Montreal, Canada, with my Lebanese wife and  three sons. I am fluent in French and English and I know some  German.  <H5>  The Board of Directors </H5>   The Palestine Development and Investment Corporation has on  its board of directors a number of well-known institutions such  as the Arab Bank, Cairo-Amman Bank, the Housing Bank,  Dar-al-Handassah Company represented in the person of Dr. Kamal  al-Sha'ir, al-Masirah Investment Company, and al-Sa'id Company.

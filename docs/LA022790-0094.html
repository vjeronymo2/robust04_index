			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> GERMANS TO BUY MANSION THAT WAS HUB FOR EXILES FLEEING NAZIS  </P> <P> A Pacific Palisades mansion that was a gathering place for intellectuals who  fled Hitler's Germany is being bought by a West German foundation for use as a  research center for European-American relations and German exile literature.  </P> <P> The decision by USC, which inherited the house in 1987, to sell it for $1.9  million is a victory for the German foundation and for preservationists who two  years ago opposed a plan by the university to sell the property and move its  prized 36,000-volume library to the university's Exposition Park campus.  </P> <P> The Germans -- with the support of West German President Richard von  Weizsaecker and former Chancellor Willy Brandt -- wanted to keep the house and  library intact as a monument to German writers and artists who fled Nazi  persecution and settled in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Under the agreement signed in December, USC will allow approximately 22,000  volumes to be kept at the mansion on a long-term loan. The remaining books --  all rare first editions or volumes printed before AD 1500 -- will be kept in a  temporary storage facility near the campus until they can be moved into a  permanent wing to be built in Doheny Memorial Library in the next several  years, said George Abdo, USC executive assistant to the president.  </P> <P> The Spanish-style house, featuring a sweeping view of the Pacific from a bluff  above Sunset Boulevard, was bought by the late German novelist and playwright  Lion Feuchtwanger in 1943 and served as a hub for the German exile community in  Los Angeles and other European notables. Among its regular visitors were Thomas  Mann, Charlie Chaplin, Bertolt Brecht, Aldous Huxley, Arnold Schoenberg and  Bruno Walter.  </P> <P> "For them, the Villa Aurora was a productive and important meeting place during  the exile period," said Lothar C. Poll, spokesman for the group that is buying  the house and publisher of the West Berlin Tagesspiegel, the city's main daily  newspaper. "It was a kind of 'Weimar on the Pacific.' "  </P> <P> At least twice a year, members of the exile community would gather at the house  to hear Feuchtwanger read from manuscripts of his latest plays or novels,  according to USC professor Harold von Hofe, senior fellow of the new research  center, called the Villa Aurora Institute. After discussions, the group would  adjourn downstairs for herring salad followed by apple strudel, recalled Hilde  Waldo, Feuchtwanger's personal secretary.  </P> <P> The house was built in 1927 by the Los Angeles Times as a showcase of the  latest in home design.  </P> <P> Feuchtwanger's widow, Marta, left the mansion and library to USC upon her death  in 1987, but her will gave the university the option of selling the house and  using the proceeds to build a Lion Feuchtwanger Memorial Library on campus. The  house's library would have been moved to the new library, in that case.  </P> <P> In addition to buying the house, the German foundation, called the Circle of  Friends and Supporters of the Villa Aurora, has agreed to pay an estimated $2  million to upgrade the house's interior and shore up its crumbling foundation.  The group also will be responsible for raising funds to run the Villa Aurora  Institute.  </P> <P> Von Hofe said the West German Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, and the  West Berlin senate, as well as private donors, contributed funds to the  preservation effort.  </P> <P> Details of the institute have yet to be worked out, but university officials  said the main focus will be European-American relations, a topic they say will  become increasingly critical as political events in Europe continue to unfold.  </P> <P> Among speakers already lined up for institute-sponsored lectures in the summer  and fall are Brandt and West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper, said Daniel M. Evans,  attorney for the Friends of Villa Aurora, the California counterpart of the  German group. The lectures will probably be given at USC or at other facilities  that can hold large audiences, Evans said.  </P> <P> The house will also serve as a center for research into German exile  literature, including studies of works by Feuchtwanger, Mann, Alfred Doeblin  and other German writers who produced many of their best-known works in Los  Angeles. The exile studies center will be closely tied to the existing  Feuchtwanger Institute for Exile Studies on the USC campus, said Von Hofe, who  also heads the campus institute.  </P> <P> Von Hofe said the research center will necessarily operate on a small scale --  the house does not comfortably hold more than about 50 people, he said, and  parking on the narrow and winding road that leads up to it is minimal.  </P> <P> Moreover, plans for the institute must first be presented to neighbors at a  public hearing chaired by a city zoning administrator, who will decide whether  to recommend a conditional use permit for the center, said Claire Rogger,  deputy to City Councilman Marvin Braude.  </P> <P> The agreement caps two years of long-distance negotiations between USC and the  German foundation. USC initially rejected the Germans' preservation proposal,  but several weeks later said it would reconsider it, if the group came up with  $15 million to pay for the new Feuchtwanger library on campus, repair the house  and establish an endowment to run a research center at the mansion, which the  university would continue to own.  </P> <P> The Germans said they would agree to such a plan only if half the money could  be raised from American donors, a proposal that ultimately fell through because  the U.S. fund-raising effort failed, Von Hofe said. However, the Germans'  fund-raising campaign was more successful, and USC changed its position and  agreed to sell the house.  </P> <P> Final terms of the agreement were worked out last fall, Von Hofe said, and a  board of trustees of the Villa Aurora Institute will be chosen soon after  escrow closes in the next few months.  </P></p>

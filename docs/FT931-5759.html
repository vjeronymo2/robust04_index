			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / In search of niches for household appliances: Andrew Baxter on the aftermath to merger mania in the European white goods market A decade of mergers and rationalisation has changed the face of the European white goods industry that produces washing machines, fridges, dishwashers, cookers and ovens. In 1970, 400 companies had 80 per cent of the European market, but by 1980, the number had fallen to 150, and 10 years later was whittled down to just 15. Perhaps six or eight producers will soon have 80 per cent of the market, says Mr Vittorio Merloni, chairman of Merloni Elettrodomestici, best known for its Ariston and Indesit brands. Whatever happens, the sharpest concentration in the industry has passed. Judging by the mood of the remaining smaller companies at last month's Domotechnica appliance fair in Cologne, they are determined to keep it that way. The Dollars 15bn (Pounds 10.5bn) European white goods market may never resemble its US counterpart, which is dominated by four domestic groups. The conventional view has always been that the leading companies - Electrolux with 20 to 25 per cent of the market, the Bosch Siemens joint venture (15 to 19 per cent), Whirlpool Europe (11 to 15 per cent) and Merloni (about 10 per cent) will squeeze the minnows further in the 1990s. The big companies were formed in the merger mania of the 1980s, and in anticipation of the single market. The process has now slowed - the only big acquisition last year saw Elettrofinanziaria (Elfi), the Italian electronics concern, buy France's Thomson Electromenager to put it on an equal footing with Merloni. Last year the big companies increased their market shares marginally. Their pan-European brands are now in place and are backed up by synergies in manufacturing and component purchasing. But the smaller companies have strategies to help them prosper. For one thing, the single market is not as homogeneous as was predicted five years ago and big regional differences remain, particularly in cookers. Fast-growing producers from countries close to the European markets - such as Arcelik, the Turkish supplier - are exporting value-for-money machines. Even Zagreb-based Koncar Elektroindustrie is trying to increase exports to offset the contraction of its home market - once Yugoslavia, now Croatia. Some smaller producers operate independently within a larger umbrella company. Blomberg, Germany's smallest white goods producer, has prospered as a mainly domestic supplier, but is also part of the Elfi group. After a decade of strong sales growth, the market has gone off the boil. Sales for the seven main types of machines, excluding microwaves, reached 42.6m units in 1991, slipped to 42.3m last year and are expected to edge downwards again this year. Even the microwave market - dominated by Japanese and Korean suppliers  - has cooled off, with sales last year of 7.3m units compared with a 1988 peak of 7.84m. Short-term factors such as the collapse of the UK housing market have played their part. But there are more deep-seated problems for producers: the white goods market is relatively mature, apart from dishwashers and microwaves; consumers tend to run their machines until they fall apart; and ecological pressures on the industry - notably for the removal of CFCs from refrigerators - are pushing up development costs. The current market picture across Europe looks mixed. The UK market fell 20 per cent from 1988 to 1991, but declined only slightly last year. There is cautious optimism as signs of life return to the housing sector. The Spanish and French markets also fell last year, by about 2 per cent and 3 per cent respectively, while the Italian market was more or less stable. The one bright spot in Europe over the past three years has been Germany, where unit sales, excluding microwaves, have grown by an average 8 per cent a year. Reunification has spurred a growing demand for large appliances in the new German states. And in western Germany, energy-saving features have prompted increasing replacement purchases. But the outlook is different this year in Germany - the ZVEI appliances and electronics association says the subdued mood, price increases and the fear of unemployment are likely to cause a decline in demand for appliances. Mr Leif Johansson, Electrolux president, sees three scenarios for the European market in 1993. The best case, he says, would see quick reductions in interest rates as Germany realises it is in recession: the worst case envisages continuing unemployment and higher than expected interest rates, along with new disappointments on the Maastricht treaty. The most realistic scenario is in between, suggesting a fall of about 3 per cent in the white goods market. Whatever happens after 1993, producers have two paths to expanding in a mature market. The first is to take market share from each other. The second is to be well-positioned to exploit the remaining growth opportunities, such as the embryonic dishwasher market in eastern Germany. Whirlpool Europe's recent performance - a 6 per cent rise in sales to Dollars 2.4bn and record operating earnings, in spite of lower shipments - shows how the benefits of a global strategy help the large companies on both counts. But the smaller producers' cycle is still spinning.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 17 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serbs agreed  today to ease their siege of Gorazde and allow an international  buffer force to enter the Muslim enclave as a result of  negotiations with the United Nations, according to U.N.  Spokesman Major Dacre Holloway today.    The spokesman said that under the agreement, a 350-strong  U.N. force will go into Gorazde, home to 65,000 residents and  refugees, in Southeastern Bosnia.    Yasuhi Akashi, the chief U.N. representative for former  Yugoslavia, had been informed today of the Serb decision in  Pale, the stronghold of Bosnian Serbs, where Akashi and Bosnian  Serb leader Radovan Karadzic had been meeting in a bid to break  the deadlock over the enclave.    the serbs, besieging Gorazde for nearly two years, have  agreed to withdraw their weapons from within a three-kilometer  zone around the city, to be followed by talks on a more  permanent exclusion zone later, the U.N. spokesman said.    Meanwhile, Akashi is negotiating with Bosnian Serb leaders  on  a truce for the Muslim enclave and the release of some 200 U.N.  personnel.    According to the latest news reports, 19 Canadians -- 16  U.N.  soldiers and three military observers -- were released by  Bosnian Serb forces outside Sarajevo on Sunday, three days after  they were detained in retaliation for NATO air strikes.    Two NATO air strikes in the past two weeks, provoked by the  Serb siege of Gorazde, had heightened tension between the Serbs  and the U.N.    The agreement also provided for a multinational peacekeeping  battalion of British, French, Ukrainian, Egyptian and a small  Nordic medical unit to enforce the truce and restore calm in the  area, Holloway said.    It was unclear so far when the U.N. troops would move in.</p>

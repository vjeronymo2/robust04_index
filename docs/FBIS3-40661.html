			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Rao Told To Quit for Endorsing GATT </F> Accord"]    [Text] New Delhi -- An agitated Opposition on Thursday  brought the proceedings in both Houses of Parliament to a halt  and demanded Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's resignation for  `compromising' the national interest by endorsing a `highly  discriminatory' GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]  agreement.    Both Houses were drowned in the din and not much business  could be transacted as a vociferous Opposition demanded that the  Prime Minister himself clarify the Government's stand on the  `inequitious' Dunkel proposals incorporated in the GATT. After a  series of adjournments both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha were  adjourned for the day.    As soon as the Lok Sabha met members of the National  Front-Left Front combine rushed into the well called for the  resignation of Rao for `succumbing' to the US pressure in  accepting the GATT terms. They demanded suspension of the  question hour and the Prime Minister's presence in the House to  clarify the Government's position on the Dunkel proposals. "No  PM no House, Prime Minister hazir ho hazir ho" -- they kept  chanting in support of their demand for a statement from Rao.    In the Rajya Sabha similar sentiments were echoed with the  NF-LF members accusing the Government of "selling out" the  country. "The telephone call came from Washington" -- Jiban Roy  (CPI-M) [Communist Party of India-Marxist] kept shouting  pointing to the Congress benches. However, in the morning Deputy  Chairperson Najma Heptulla had succeeded in persuading the  members to wait for Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee's  statement on the conclusion of the GATT agreement at Geneva on  Wednesday. The question hour, therefore, passed off without  disturbances.    But in the Lok Sabha the Chair had to order the first  adjournment within half-an-hour. As soon as the House met, the  Opposition members began shouting, "Down with the US, Narasimha  Rao istifa do." Somnath Chatterjee (CPI-M) alleged that even  when Parliament was agitated over the consequences of the GATT  agreement, the Indian Indian representatives participating in  the negotiations in Geneva had welcomed it. The sole BJP  [Bharatiya Janata Party] member in the Lok Sabha, Jaswant Singh,  was also on his feet joining the other NF-LF block in  repudiating the Government stand on the issue. However, the  party continued its boycott of the Rajya Sabha.    When the Upper House met again in the afternoon, the  Opposition members trooped into the well demanding the Prime  Minister's presence. Pranab Mukherjee, who stood up to read out  his statement, was interrupted by the slogan-shouting members.  "We are not listening to your speech," Jaipal Reddy (JD) [Janata  Dal] told the Commerce Minister. The Minister's voice was lost  in the melee. With the NF-LF members shouting slogans from the  well, Deputy Chairperson Najma Heptulla irretedly remarked,  "Looks like you are standing on the roadside." Unable to pacify  the members she adjourned the Rajya Sabha for the day.    In the Lok Sabha while the Opposition allowed Mukherjee to  read out the prepared statement, they were opposed to initiating  the debate in the absence of the Prime Minister.    Mukherjee who was finally allowed to make a statement  presented the treaty on the GATT signed by Indian in Geneva as a  fait accompli for the country. "On the whole it is our  considered judgment that India has more to benefit from the  expansion of world trade through the Uruguay Round Agreement  rather than pursuing any alternative course of action," the  Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee told the Parliament in a  statement.    He sought to ally the Opposition fears in the areas of  subsidy, the public distribution system and patented drugs.</p>

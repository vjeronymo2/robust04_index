			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> CREW BREAKS SEWER LINE; BEACH SECTION CLOSED  </P> <P> A construction crew rebuilding a Laguna Beach hotel accidentally broke a sewer  line on Tuesday, causing thousands of gallons of raw sewage to flood into the  ocean north of Main Beach.  </P> <P> The north portion of Main Beach was closed after the 9:30 a.m. pipeline rupture  and will remain closed for at least a day, City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said.  </P> <P> Frank said the construction crew was working on the renovation of the Inn of  Laguna on North Coast Highway when it hit the line. He said it took until about  1 p.m. to stop the flow of sewage.  </P> <P> The spill was considerably smaller than one last May on the same beach. Then, a  1-mile stretch of shoreline from Main Beach to Cleo Street was closed for 2  days after 1 million gallons of raw sewage spewed into the ocean when a pump  station was knocked out by an electrical failure. That spill was one of the  largest in county history.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Litovkin, IZVESTIYA correspondent: "All </F> is Very, Very Quiet at the Rocket Cemetery"; the first paragraph  is anhic mapping, geoecological (geological-ecological) -- in  geological mapping, ecological-geographic -- in landscape  mapping, medical-ecological -- in medical geography mapping, and  socioecological -- in socioeconomic and historical mapping.    Broad groups of maps also are formed along such subject  lines as the limitations and conditions of economic and other  activity; ecologically engineering geology, engineering  geography and technical evaluations; complex natural-production  characteristics; characteristics of problem situations,  ecological measures and infrastructure, etc.    The spatial series of ecological maps covers all  hierarchical  levels -- global, continental and macroregional, national,  regional, local and detailed.They are being developed in the  entire rangeof cognitive aspects: inventory, evaluation and  prediction maps, maps of recommendations, as well as functional  directions (scientific reference, reference, instructional,  etc.). The multifaceted and multiaspect character of the  research and development work carried out in the field of  ecological mapping, their volumes, the frequently  spontaneous-initiative state of affairs advances to the  forefront the tasks of providing the necessary scientific base  for this work, as well as the well-known organizing principle.  This is necessary for ensuring the comparability and  up-to-datedness of maps and in the last analysis the possibility  of their use in scientific and jpractical (including  administrative) work, the possibility of generalization into  revNikolay Volneyko, an officer of the test site safety  division, in the regions of falling of rocket parts 1858 tons of  such pieces have been collected from the tundra. Specialists  from the Trans-RES Scientific-Production Center assisted the  rocket specialists. They have special equipment and resources  for this. The military has neither. Even the rental of a  helicopter today costs almost a million rubles an hour. The army  budget does not allow for such expenditures. It is true that  Trans-RES also has no resources for the delivery of the scrap  metal to metallurgical plants. It is necessary to lease barges,  to float them along the Koyda River to Arkhangelsk, where the  metal is reloaded onto the railroad and shipped to Cherepovets  or Magnitogorsk. Where to get such money for prepayment? And  then it is still unknown whether the costs will be recovered.  Today the prices are rock-bottom. Initially, especially during  the period of contention for parliamentary and local deputy  seats, the theme of pollution of the tundra by rocket wastes was  at the center of attention of all ecological movements and a  democratically oriented public. There was a demand for the  immediate clearing of reindeer pastures and rivers from the  "lethal metal" and enormous fines were imposed on the rocket  launchers, hailed into court. The soldiers cleared 318 000  hectares of tundra; how is another question. But there is no  longer any possibility for clearing the rocket cemeteries. To be  more exact, there is no money. For two or three months the test  site has not been receiving its money allowances and the city  has not been paid for electric power and heat; there is now no  fear of the court. And the deputies and ecologists also have  forgotten about them. Possibly for the same reason: however much  you ask for sweets, no one hands them over. But possibly other  concerns have appeared, a little more important. Two thousand  tons of aluminum lie in the Koyda cemetery; they do not rot,  they do not spoil -- such is the nature of metal. It awaits  until the country has the money for its evacuation. But the  tundra? It cannot bear it.</p>

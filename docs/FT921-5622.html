			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Noriega met CIA chief after he saw Castro THE Reagan administration's director of Central Intelligence, the late Mr William Casey, met Panama's General Manuel Antonio Noriega in 1984 less than a month after the general visited Cuba to meet President Fidel Castro. The hitherto unreported meeting was acknowledged by Mr Donald Winters, CIA station chief in Panama from June 1984 until the summer of 1986, testifying yesterday for the defence in Gen Noriega's drug trafficking trial in Miami. Mr Winters said yesterday the CIA had 'encouraged and appreciated' the assistance of Gen Noriega, particularly in passing on information about Cuba and President Castro. His testimony forms part of the defence effort to portray the general as a US ally. Mr Noriega's meeting with Mr Casey was one of at least four with CIA officials held immediately before and after his overnight visit to Havana on July 5 1984.</p>

			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION  DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST WEEK.  </P> <P> $10-Million Settlement for Gold Investors: The owner of two defunct gold  investment firms agreed to repay more than 250 investors $10 million to settle  two U.S. District Court suits accusing him of being unable to deliver on  contracts for thousands of ounces of gold. William M. Moreland of Weldon,  Calif., will pay back investors at a rate of $300,000 per month beginning in  April, said Marge Erickson, an assistant regional director of the Federal Trade  Commission.  </P> <P> Most of the refund stems from an FTC case against Moreland charging that he  sold gold contracts during 1986-88 that were unlikely ever to be delivered  through his two Beverly Hills units, Continental Trading International Ltd. and  Axiom III. Moreland neither admitted nor denied the allegations. (Filed August  8, 1989, Case No. CV89-4708)  </P></p>

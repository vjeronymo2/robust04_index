			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Wm Sindall passes preference WILLIAM SINDALL, the builder, reported increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 619,000 for the half year to June 30, against Pounds 417,000. Turnover was Pounds 24.6m compared with Pounds 22m. The loss eliminates distributable reserves and the company will not be able to pay the dividend on the 5.625 per cent convertible preference shares. However, the company said it was in the process of disposing of properties before the end of the year which would allow payment to be made. Operating profit was Pounds 91,000 (Pounds 580,000) and there were redundancy costs of Pounds 144,000 (Pounds 138,000). The pre-tax figure was helped by lower interest charges of Pounds 566,000 (Pounds 859,000). Losses per share increased to 11.59p (7.55p). Directors said rental income had held up well but other trading had been difficult. They added that there was no real sign of improvement in the construction sector in the immediate future. The arrangements with its bankers and other financial institutions to give the company a secure financial future were now being formalised.</p>

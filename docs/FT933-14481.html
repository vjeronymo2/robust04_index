			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Observer: Food for thought Wise old birds attending agms have all sorts of tips on what to look for apart from a copy of the chairman's speech. Did the great man smile, was his finance director wearing a colourful tie, or, heaven forbid, a beard? Little things count when checking a company's health. However, one of Observer's favourite ploys is to check out the grub. Take Aegis, the media-buying company. At its agm in May 1990 it served up champagne and canapes, before serving up bumper pre-tax profits for the following year. Its 1991 agm saw a diminished but none the less inviting spread of fancy biscuits, followed by mildly disappointing profits. But by 1992 only the plainer Rich Tea were on offer and sure enough it was a horrible year for Aegis - boardroom mayhem, collapsing share price, and a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.9m. What then are we to make of yesterday's agm, with its ginger and marzipan-coated Battenberg cakes? Probably no more than that the company is going through a sticky patch.</p>

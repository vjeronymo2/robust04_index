			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Lucas pension trustees attacked PENSIONERS of Lucas Industries are citing trust law in their battle to reverse a Pounds 150m payment from the scheme to the company. A group of 16 pensioners has served summonses on 10 trustees of the scheme, alleging that the trust barred any payments from the scheme to the company. Four of the trustees are employee representatives and the rest company officials. Mr Douglas Taylor, one of the pensioners in the group, said that Lucas Industries Pension Scheme operated under an unusual 'irrevocable trust' deed. The deed specifically barred not only direct payments to the company but any amendment which could have allowed such a payment. Furthermore, the deed provided that on winding up, any surplus should be used for the exclusive benefit of pensioners. The pensioners are not alleging that the company behaved improperly in connection with the scheme. Lucas Industries last year obtained permission from the Superannuation Funds Office of the Occupational Pensions Board to extract a portion of the surplus for itself. At the same time, a further Pounds 220m of surplus was to be used for enhanced benefits to scheme members and a further Pounds 250m of surplus was to be left in the scheme to pay for possible benefit increases mandated by law. Lucas Industries has made no contribution to its pension scheme since 1985 and will not do so for the foreseeable future, the company said. The pensioners say the trustees had no authority to ask the board to apportion the surplus.</p>

Public opinion  held that the three issues mentioned above have been unresolved  problems for years in the United States, as well as old problems  which Clinton had wished to solve but has not yet solved.    For a long period of time medical and health expense in the  United States has been increasing year after year, so has the  number of those not covered by medical insurance. In fiscal  1993, the nation's expense in this area exceeded $900 billion,  which accounted for 14.6 percent of the GDP, up from 9.6 percent  in 1981. Last September, Clinton proposed a reform plan to  Congress, suggesting insurance for the whole people with costs  to be shared by the state, enterprises, and individuals. Since  announcement of the plan, most people have expressed support for  its general goal, but responded differently to the concrete  measures. Some medical and health insurance companies and some  pharmaceutical factories are not happy with the possible loss of  income due to the reform; small enterprises which in the past  seldom or never provided insurance for their employees, have  expressed grievances against the government's demand that they  provide their employees with a large portion of insurance  premium. In Congress, the Republicans argued that the plan  allows too much government intervention, involves too much  money, and leads to a tax increase. Among the Democrats there  are also those who are opposed to the plan, and they say the  plan makes small enterprises pay a lot of expense to the extent  of affecting employment. Clinton pointed out in his State of  the Union address that no matter what kind of plan, it has to  guarantee insurance for the whole people, otherwise, he will  exercise a presidential veto on the adopted bill.    Clinton's intention in reforming the current social welfare  system is: Lightening the load of government and changing the  burden into a motive force. According to the current social  welfare system in the United States, apart from providing  low-income families with medical subsides and the aged and  disabled with medical care, the government also has to provide  $350-400 of relief money to the poor families which have  juvenile children, as well as food coupons of $70 to each of the  destitute every month. At present, some 5 million families in  the country are claiming relief money, and about 27 million  people are receiving food coupons. These two "contingents" are  still growing in strength, the government's expense has  increased year after year, and currently the annual expense on  relief money and food coupons has reached $45 billion. Clinton  thinks that this growing burden not only affects the effort to  cut the deficit, but is also harmful to economic development.    Clinton announced in his State of the Union address that in  the spring of this year, he will submit to Congress an overall  plan of reform of the social welfare system. According to  information, the plan mainly includes: Poor people who have  ability to work will only be provided with relief money for two  years; free training will be provided to those who have no job  skills or have low educational attainment; baby sitting  allowances will be provided to the women who have young  children; the government will allocate funds to open service  industries, to provide job opportunities to the above-mentioned  people; and efforts will be made to encourage private  enterprises to arrange jobs for the above-mentioned people. The  plan will enable 1.5 million to 2 million adults (mostly single  mothers who have juvenile children) to eventually part with  government relief. Most people think that Clinton's move is in  the right direction, but they are skeptical about a swift  solution of this difficult problem which has existed for years.    Crime, especially violent crime, is an old problem causing  the most terrible headache for those within and outside the  government in the United States. From 1980 to 1992, the number  of violent crimes in the United States increased 27 percent, and  the number of those serving their terms in prisons increased 180  percent. Last year, various kinds of violent incidents became  more frequent, and murders and kidnappings became numerous.  Clinton stressed repeatedly that the economic losses caused by  crime in the United States reached $425 billion a year, in  particular, crime increased medical expenses. Last year, the  Clinton administration was able to urge Congress to pass the  "Brady bill on control of firearms," and to allocate $50 million  to boost police strength in some parts of the country. But in  the face of violent crime, these two measures are obviously  ineffective. Therefore, he once again stressed in his State of  the Union address that it is necessary to pass more, tougher  anticrime measures. He asked Congress to pass a bill which will  make criminals have no guns in their hands, send those who  commit serious crimes three times to life imprisonment, build  more prisons, harshly punish drug-related crimes, and increase  the police by 100,000 men.    Public opinion holds that for Clinton to achieve the  above-mentioned goals, he will meet a great many difficulties.  For example, regarding the problem of gun control, so long as  selling and buying guns are not banned nationwide, it will be  very difficult to ensure that criminals have no guns in their  hands. In addition, "it takes more than one cold day for the  river to freeze three feet deep," when the root cause of crime  in the society is not removed, the measures to control crime are  only tackling the symptoms but not the root cause.    President Clinton has proposed these new measures to deal  with those old problems in the beginning of a new year. What  will be the result? People are waiting to see.</p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Cool reception for Gulf oil plan Little enthusiasm emerged yesterday for an offer by the six-member Gulf Co-operation Council to cut oil output if other producers, including those not affiliated to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, do likewise, writes Robert Corzine in London. The GCC, which includes Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, made its offer conditional on non-Opec producers taking part in a production cutback to prop up weak oil prices. Analysts said some smaller non-Opec producers might go along with such a strategy. However, one analyst said that it was 'virtually unimaginable' that two of the biggest non-Opec exporters, the UK and Norway, would abide by it.</p>

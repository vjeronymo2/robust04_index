			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by freelance journalist Yoshiko Sakurai: "The </F> Indiscretion of Senior SDPJ Members Who Attended the Party Held  in Celebration of Kim Il-song's Birthday and the Suspicion  Thrown on Them"]    [Text] The 13th of April was a beautiful spring day. On  that evening at Fujimi-cho in the Chiyoda Ward of Tokyo, many  people were seen riding up to the central building of the  pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in Japan.  This was because the General Association held a celebration two  days before Kim Il-song's birthday.    Many members of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]  attended. At least 17 SDPJ members were present, including  Takako Doi, the former SDPJ chairwoman and incumbent speaker of  the House of Representatives; Tomiichi Murayama, the incumbent  SDPJ chairman; Makoto Tanabe, also a former SDPJ chairman;  Hajime Fukada, director of the SDPJ Organization Bureau; and  Yuzuru Shimazaki.    It stands to reason that the SDPJ would send some members to  the party held in celebration of Kim Il-song's birthday because  of its friendly relations with the North Korean Workers' Party.    Nevertheless, when we look at the members who attended the  party, we see how singular the SDPJ is.    The international situation surrounding North Korea is  extremely tense. Even China, which is North Korea's last major  ally and which had previously shown its intention to veto any  resolution of the United Nations Security Council to impose  sanctions against North Korea, took a step backward. This year  it refrained from sending a delegation to Pyongyang to attend  festivities held in celebration of Kim Il-song's birthday. By  making such a decision, China has clearly indicated to North  Korea that neither China nor the international community can  accept North Korea's persistent refusal to accept complete  international inspections of its suspected nuclear sites.    The Japanese Government went one step further than China,  saying it will do "what it can within the constitutional  framework" if the UN Security Council decides to impose economic  sanctions against North Korea. In other words, the Japanese  Government has decided to present a firm front, basically in  accordance with the United Nations.    Despite such circumstances, the chairman of the largest  party  in the ruling coalition attended a celebration of Kim Il-song's  birthday on his own initiative. I do not appreciate this  conduct. The presence of Hajime Fukada and Yuzuru Shimazaki at  the party is somewhat understandable, since Fukada is known to  have been nicknamed "North Korean ambassador to Japan" by other  SDPJ members and Shimazaki is noted as an ardent admirer of Kim  Il-song--he once called the North Korean leader "the greatest  politician in the world." However, Tomiichi Murayama's position  is totally different from theirs because he is the party  chairman and simultaneously the leader of the largest coalition  member.    The same can be said of Takako Doi. As the speaker of the  House of Representatives, she represents the highest authority  on national rights. She also stands on top of the three powers  of administration, legislation, and judicature. Therefore,  every move she makes has great significance politically.    I was not just surprised at the news that Murayama and Doi  acted on their own in contradiction to the government's tough  stance toward North Korea; their behavior raises suspicion in my  mind.    It reminded me of the news report that the former Soviet  Union had been providing monetary aid to the SDPJ. This was  made public in April 1993. Following the collapse of the Soviet  Union, a considerable amount of information came out of the  Kremlin, mostly classified information that would have remained  secret forever had there been a continuation of one-party rule  by the Communist Party.    There were several secret documents which proved the SDPJ  had  received funds from the Soviet Union under the pretext of  financial aid to promote trade, tourism, and cultural exchange  between the two countries, and that the SDPJ had used the  illegal money as campaign funds. The following names were  clearly mentioned in the documents: Masashi Ishibashi, former  SDPJ chairman; Akira Iwai, former head of the General Council of  Trade Unions of Japan; and Kanji Kawasaki, a senior member of  the SDPJ. They all strongly denied involvement. However,  although it has been a full year since these facts were made  public, it seems they have not yet provided any information or  documents to prove their innocence. Therefore, the SDPJ still  lies under strong suspicion that it had financial dealings with  the former Soviet Union. In other words, the SDPJ had taken a  pro-Soviet line, while receiving financial support from the  communist country. Now the SDPJ takes a pro-Pyongyang policy.  Did the same factor which induced the SDPJ to adopt a  pro-Soviet line again come into play in the process? We can  hardly offer a negative answer to that question.    To be specific, the point at issue is the relationship  between the SDPJ and the General Association of Korean Residents  in Japan, which is the virtual North Korean mission to Japan.    There was always some talk that several SDPJ members have  received political funds from companies affiliated with the  General Association. I truly wish it were not true, but  unfortunately what happened once might happen twice. Moreover,  although the SDPJ claims to be in favor of a United  Nations-oriented diplomacy, it neglects the party platform when  dealing with matters related to North Korea. Contrary to the UN  will, the SDPJ has called for a soft stance towards North Korea.  Furthermore, amid the political turmoil caused by the tense  deadlock over whom to choose as successor to Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa, several senior members did not hesitate at  all to attend the party held in celebration of Kim Il-song's  birthday. All these moves cannot but provoke stronger suspicion  in my mind.</p>

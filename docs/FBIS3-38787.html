			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "ban": "Kanther Hopes For Change of Thinking </F> in FDP"]    [Text] Bonn, 4 Feb -- On Friday [4 February] FRG Interior  Minister Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) regretted that in  the course of negotiations in the coalition on a "Law on the  Fight Against Crime 94," the Free Democratic Party of Germany  [FDP] has not agreed to give security authorities the right to  monitor conversations in residences in the course of the  struggle against organized crime. On Friday Kanther said that  he hopes that the FDP will "change its mind." The matter is  important to him. Nevertheless, by presenting the article law,  the coalition has proved that it is able and willing to act.  Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (FDP) also paid  tribute to the package of laws, which will improve "the  instruments for combating crime while strictly adhering to  rule-of-law principles." The coalition is striving to adopt the  article law in the Bundestag before the summer recess. It will  be discussed together with a draft law of the Social Democratic  Party of Germany [SPD] group on internal security, which  facilitates -- under certain conditions -- the monitoring of  conversations in residences as well as, in case of sufficient  suspicion, the seizure of illegal assets. Kanther rejected this  SPD proposal as a violation of the Basic Law's guarantee of  property. Deputy SPD Bundestag Group Chairwoman Fuchs  criticized the coalition draft by saying that the "coalition,  completely divided by internal quarrels" no longer has the  strength to really combat organized crime.    A number of different legal amendments on internal security  have been brought together in the coalition's article law. The  Federal Intelligence Office is to be given additional tasks; it  is to be permitted to pass on to the criminal prosecution  authorities information found abroad and obtained by "strategic"  telephone monitoring. The regulation on turning state's  evidence, which has so far been limited to terrorism, is to be  extended to crimes committed within the framework of organized  crime. The statutory punishment for bodily injury is to be  raised. The use of signs of unconstitutional organizations --  such as symbols reminiscent of national socialist signs -- will  be punishable by law. The penal regulations against inciting  people and inciting racial hatred will be made stricter.  Collection of profits is to be made easier in case of  extortions of protection money. Criminal liability for money  laundering is to be applied to additional crimes (property  crimes, document crimes, and bribery). More attention is to be  paid to the so-called perpetrator-victim settlement. Various  detailed regulations in the law of criminal procedure are to  accelerate criminal procedures; these include better  preconditions for imposing detention pending trial as well as  using the reason of danger of repetition to keep someone  detained. Penal regulations against foreign drug dealers are  tightened in order to be able to expel them from the country.  By amending the Industrial Code private security companies are  to be checked more thoroughly than has been the case thus far.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regeneration of primarily dead lodgepole pine stands is proposed on approximately 1520 acres, regeneration of wind damaged stands on approximately 115 acres, maintenance and minor intermittent reconditioning of approximately 55 miles of existing roads, construction of approximately 5 miles of temporary roads, rehabilitation of 13 miles of roads, placement of large woody debris intermittently in 39 miles of streamcourses, native shrub planting on approximately 55 acres and sediment removal at 15 sites in Sheppard, Griffin and Squaw Meadows Creeks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The decision to be made is what, if anything, should be done in the Sheppard-Griffin area to: (a) Accelerate regeneration of primarily dead lodgepole pine stands and wind damaged mixed conifer stands, (b) rehabilitate sediment sources that are primarily roads not needed for long-term management, (c) stabilize stream channels by placement of large woody debris and planting native shrubs to reduce the erosive power of streamflow during peak flows, and (d) improve fisheries habitat by sediment removal from pools.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The LRMP for the Flathead National Forest provides the overall guidance for management activities in the potentially affected area through its goals, objectives, standards and guidelines, and management area direction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most areas of proposed management activities for the Sheppard-Griffin project are within Management Area (MA) 15. Some activity is also planned in MA 17. Management Area 15 consists of lands where timber management with roads is economical and feasible. The management goal is to manage these lands for the long-term growth and production of commercially valuable wood products, as well as provide for soil and water protection, wildlife habitat, and roaded recreation opportunities. Management Area 17 includes adjacent forested riparian lands. The primary goal is to protect and maintain this riparian zone, including fish and wildlife habitat, while maintaining a sustained yield of timber. The proposal is designed to meet the Forest Plan standards and guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public participation has occurred at various times during the analysis. Initially, scoping was done separately for the Sheppard project and the Griffin project, in November of 1991, and May of 1992, respectively. Since that time, the two projects have been combined into one analysis based on similarities in purpose, issues and close proximity. Two additional periods of time are identified for the receipt of comments on the analysis. One period will be during the 45 days after this notice is published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and another during the 45-day review and comment period of the Draft EIS. Scoping at the local level has already commenced. If comments have been submitted, there is no need for additional comment. No public meetings are scheduled at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on public scoping the following issues have been identified:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) There is concern how the vegetation restoration may affect wildlife, particularly big game species such as elk, deer and moose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Road construction and management are a concern because of the potential impact to water quality, wildlife and fisheries habitat and recreation use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Harvest methods used in vegetative restoration are a concern to many people, especially in regard to fragmentation of a forested landscape.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) There is a concern that vegetative restoration may result in further adverse effects on watershed and fisheries values.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

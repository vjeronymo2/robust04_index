			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Prices in the main primary markets have often tended to ease this week. South Africa provides an exception but most Australian and New Zealand wool sold at lower prices at auctions there. Finer merinos, which led the overall wool price recovery, have eased more sharply than broader categories. Clearances were also lower at some Australian sales, and nearly a third of the Freemantle offering was withdrawn at grower reserves at the final week of the sale there. Beyond raw wool auctions the major barrier of price resistances at the retail end remains. There is little business coming through and company chairmen continue to stress the difficulty in passing on the considerable wool price rises in an anti-inflationary environment. Australia's Eastern states market indicator closed at 774c/kg, down from 792c/kg a week before.</p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Cable and Wireless to unveil telecoms project in China Cable and Wireless of the UK will today announce a large telecoms development project in China which could lead to the opening up of the world's largest telecoms growth market to foreign operators. The deal will involve Hongkong Telecom, of which C&amp;W owns a majority stake, in a joint venture with Chinese partners to expand the country's telecoms services. Until now, China has maintained a state monopoly over telecoms services, although western telecoms equipment suppliers have long been established in the Chinese market. A leading Hong Kong analyst said the agreement would involve either a substantial loan from Hongkong Telecom tied to an operating agreement, or a leasing arrangement, either of which might in time be convertible into an equity holding. 'This is a watershed, which could lead within months to a far wider opening up of Chinese telecoms to overseas operators,' he said. The Cable &amp; Wireless board met in Shanghai on Monday, when the agreement was finalised. The agreement follows months of intensive contacts between C&amp;W and China's ministry of posts and telecommunications, during which the ministry nominated C&amp;W as its 'preferred partner' for future operations. China has ambitious plans to increase its number of phone lines from about 30m to at least 110m within the next decade. But the ministry is believed to be finding it increasingly difficult to secure supplier finance for telecoms expansion, which has obliged the government to move faster than expected on joint ventures with foreign network operators. The last significant step in the erosion of the state telecoms monopoly took place in July, when the state council allowed ministries other than posts and telecoms to operate telecoms networks. Three other ministries - railways, electronic industries and electrical power - launched a new telecoms network backed by leading domestic groups, which has called on US operators for technical advice. Earlier this year the operating and regulatory divisions of the MPT were separated, making it easier for new operators to establish themselves. Lord Young, C&amp;W chairman, held talks in Beijing in March with telecoms officials and with Mr Jiang Zemin, China's president. He predicted then that C&amp;W's first Chinese joint ventures could be agreed by the end of the year.</p>

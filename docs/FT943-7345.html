			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Canada tussles with US over timber refund The US Commerce Department has ordered an end to collection of duty on imports of Canadian softwood lumber, but it has yet to agree to return an estimated Dollars 450m-Dollars 500m in duties which a bilateral dispute settlement panel said had been wrongfully collected. A US-Canadian appeals panel last month upheld an earlier finding that Canada's timber pricing and log export policies were not being subsidised. This reversed a finding from the US Commerce Department, which had led to the collection of countervailing duties. Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, last week said the Commerce Department had 'just the other day' ceased collecting duties and was 'in the process of evaluating what our future course will be'. A lawyer for the US timber industry said the binational panels which reviewed the US subsidy ruling had no legal authority to require repayment of duties. Mr Roy MacLaren, Canada's trade minister, has demanded refund of the duties promptly and with interest. A number of US senators - including the majority leader, Mr George Mitchell, and Mr Max Baucus, chairman of the trade sub-committee - want the duties withheld until Canada agrees to change its timber pricing system. In a letter to Mr Brown, the senators said the issue of subsidised lumber had mistakenly become part of the Canada Free Trade Agreement. 'Canada exploited this oversight, and the panel process has repeatedly misinterpreted US law,' they said. 'As the US dissenters in the subsidies cases noted, the three Canadian members that directed the Department of Commerce to find that these subsidies were not actionable under US law exceeded their jurisdiction and usurped Congress's right to make US law.' However, they say, a long-term solution may now be possible because the Canadian provinces have essentially admitted that 'enormous subsidies exist'. Withholding the duties could bring the parties to the negotiating table. The Canadian embassy said US officials might need authorisation from Congress before paying money back.</p>

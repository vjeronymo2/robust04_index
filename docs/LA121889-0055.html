			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SANTA CLAUS FLIES IN TOYS ON A BITTERSWEET MISSION  </P> <P> Santa Claus flew into Acton on Sunday afternoon, but via a helicopter instead  of a sleigh.  </P> <P> Actually, the helicopter was piloted by Bob Garland, 36, outfitted in a Santa  Claus suit. He surprised about 50 children, and undoubtedly a few adults, when  he landed at the Robin's Nest trailer park with a big bag of presents.  </P> <P> Garland's wife, Perri, 30, said the couple staged the giveaway to help them  cope with the loss of their 5-year-old son, Ryan, who was killed in a horseback  riding accident in October. The Garlands, who live in the trailer park, operate  a small helicopter service.  </P> <P> Garland said that her husband and Ryan talked several months ago about  delivering presents to the youngster's friends by helicopter.  </P> <P> "Ryan used to ride around with Bob in the helicopter all the time," Garland  said, "and he always wanted to see Santa Claus in a helicopter."  </P> <P> After Ryan was killed, the Garlands decided to abandon their plan.  </P> <P> "We just sat around and got very depressed," said Perri Garland. "But then we  thought, 'Wait a minute. Let's do it for Ryan.' That's the biggest reason we  did it."  </P> <P> The couple's neighbors helped organize the event. On Sunday, Bob Garland went  to Van Nuys Airport and rented a helicopter.  </P> <P> About 2:15 p.m., Garland's helicopter appeared above the Robin's Nest trailer  park.  </P> <P> "Parents ran outside and shouted to their children, 'Look, Santa's here,' "  Perri Garland said. "Some of the kids said, 'Wait a minute, Santa's supposed to  have a sleigh and reindeer.' They just got real excited."  </P> <P> After landing, her husband stayed about two hours handing out presents and  candy to the children, who ranged in age from 3 to 12, Garland said.  </P> <P> A helicopter crew from a radio station spotted her husband flying in the area,  followed him to the trailer park and joined in the fun, she said.  </P> <P> Garland and her husband, who also have a 2-year-old daughter, Aron, had not  called the media because they did not want publicity. However, she understood  why the radio crew investigated the sighting.  </P> <P> "It's not every day you see Santa flying across the sky," she said.  </P></p>

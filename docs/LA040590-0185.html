			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> ORANGE;  </P> <P> FOSTER PARENTS WARN AGAINST ACCUSATIONS  </P> <P> A group of local foster parents voiced concern Wednesday that accusations of  abusive behavior by staff at the Orangewood Children's Home will discourage  volunteers and worsen what is already a severe shortage of foster families.  </P> <P> "We need foster homes badly," said Cherri Olson, a Fountain Valley foster  mother and member of the County Foster Care Advisory Board. "Many lay people  who are interested in becoming foster parents and believe they will have to  deal with an agency that won't respond to their concerns will decide not to  have anything to do with it."  </P> <P> Orangewood, the county's shelter for abused, neglected and abandoned children,  is being investigated by the County Juvenile Justice Commission and the grand  jury over allegations that children have been physically, mentally and verbally  mistreated there.  </P> <P> Orangewood officials say the allegations are unfounded.  </P> <P> Most of the children who are taken into protective custody spend some time at  Orangewood before being placed with foster families. Olson said that the foster  parents she has spoken to dismiss allegations of mistreatment.  </P> <P> There are about 600 licensed foster parents in the county but more than 2,600  children in protective custody.  </P> <P> "I feel any negative publicity that affects the dependency system often has a  deleterious effect on recruitment," said Barbara Labitzke, foster home  development coordinator for the county and executive director of the Southern  Area Fostercare Effort, which coordinates foster care in an eight-county  region.  </P> <P> Several foster parents rallied to the defense of Orangewood in a letter to  local media.  </P> <P> "We feel that (Orangewood) ranks with the very best programs and facilities  nationwide," stated the letter signed by 17 foster parents.  </P> <P> The foster parents also questioned the motives and conduct of Dorothy Moore,  the Newport Beach woman who first leveled charges of mistreatment.  </P> <P> The investigations came after Moore, a legal secretary who became a foster  parent in January, befriended two homeless children and had them placed in  Orangewood when their parents allegedly abandoned them. Moore said the children  told her that they and other children were harshly treated.  </P> <P> Two former counselors at Orangewood -- one of whom was fired after  disagreements over how to handle the children -- later came forward to support  Moore's charges.  </P> <P> Foster parent Olson, who learned of the allegations as a member of the Foster  Care Advisory Board, said that social service officials "leaned over backwards"  to verify Moore's complaints, but found no wrongdoing. She said that Moore's  persistence has not only damaged Orangewood's reputation but also some foster  parents' trust in the system.  </P> <P> Moore, responding to the foster parents Wednesday, however, said her concerns  have nothing to do with them.  </P> <P> "My complaint is with the administrators at Orangewood and how children are  treated there," she said. "I think there are many good people out there who  will still want to come forward and care for children, that's what it's all  about." CARLA RIVERA  </P></p>

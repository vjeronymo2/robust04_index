			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL DRUG STING NETS 11 ARRESTS  </P> <P> El Cajon police arrested 11 people Tuesday in an investigation of drugs sales  to high school students.  </P> <P> The arrests come three months after an undercover officer enrolled as a senior  at El Cajon Valley High School, said Lt. Bob Lein, of the El Cajon Police  Department.  </P> <P> Officer Tina Lawrence bought small quantities of marijuana, methamphetamine and  LSD from several students and adults.  </P> <P> Six juveniles and five adults were arrested Tuesday and authorities expect to  arrest another juvenile who moved to Los Angeles shortly after the undercover  operation began. Police also expect to arrest two other adults in the El Cajon  area.  </P> <P> The five arrested adults, from El Cajon, were being held in County Jail, Lein  said. They are: Nathan H. Badgett, 18, a student at El Cajon Valley High  School; Darrell Alan Bair, 20, and Paul Jason Bair, 19; Raymond Christopher  Cuero, 20; and Frank Lawrence Pena, 21. Paul Jason Bair was arrested at the  Target store where he works and the other adults were arrested in their homes.  </P> <P> In addition to Badgett, four other students were arrested at El Cajon Valley  High School and another at Chaparral High School, Lein said.  </P> <P> The adults and the juveniles were booked on suspicion of possessing and  offering for sale small amounts of the drugs, Lein said. Bail for the adults  ranged from $3,000 to $10,000.  </P> <P> Lawrence, the undercover officer, made 14 buys and spent about $1,000 during  the investigation, Lein said. "The target of the investigation is drugs for  personal use. Enough drugs for a weekend," he said.  </P> <P> Officers also served five search warrants to residences in El Cajon. Lein said  the "supply chain (of drugs) was traced to an apartment in the Allied Gardens  area of San Diego." Investigators were serving a search warrant at that  apartment late Tuesday.  </P></p>

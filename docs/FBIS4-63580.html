			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's partnership with NATO is a thing of reality  despite much propaganda noise about it, the Foreign Minister's  political adviser Galina Sidorova told Russian reporters in  Moscow on Monday.    She said British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd's visit to  missile carrying cruiser Admiral Nakhimov at Severomorsk on  Monday must be seen as one more gesture towards partnership.    Sidorova described the Russian-British partnership to this  end as being significant in a sense. "We have no differences,  let alone, slightest misunderstanding with Britons. This is  also indicated by Britain's position on Russia's cooperation  with the G-7 countries and the Bosnian conflict as well as  identical approaches to key international issues the two  countries share", she said.

"Britain appears to proceed from the  principle of not doing harm", she said.</p>

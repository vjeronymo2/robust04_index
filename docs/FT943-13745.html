			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Important role for currency in share rally - London Currency factors have now turned very positive for the UK equities, and are playing an important role in the market recovery, according to analysts at several securities houses known to have the ear of continental European fund managers. Earnings ratios on UK stocks are now the lowest of any major market, points out SG Warburg, which puts 'sustainable' p/e ratios in the UK market at 15.15 times, compared with 16.78 in Germany and 16.21 in France. The investment bank says that London also offers the best relative cheapness to its mid-cycle p/e - the ratio generated if the net sales margin returns to its average of the last cycle. The dollar's rally has enabled investors to turn their attention back to the fundamental attractions of economic recovery in Europe. But it is the relative weakness of sterling against the D-Mark that has triggered the sudden recovery in UK share prices. The current DM/Pounds rate, now down to the lows of last year when the UK currency was still in the final throes of its exit from the ERM, offers overseas funds entry to UK equities on favourable terms. Many European investors are believed to have exited the UK market at around FT-SE 3,500 at the beginning of this year, taking their timing from the DM/Pounds rate rather than market judgment. The fall in the rate since then gives overseas buyers of UK stocks an effective discount of some 300 Footsie points over the average UK fund manager, according to Strauss Turnbull. From the view of market prospects, the weighting in favour of overseas investment activity is all the stronger because, according to most London houses, UK institutions are close to fully invested and the prolonged period of anxiety over the dollar and the bond markets has left market-makers with flat trading books. Hence the powerful squeeze on prices at present, with shares responding very strongly to the sudden recovery in stock index futures which are now routinely at a substantial premium to the underling cash market, in sharp contrast to the discounts to which unwary traders had become accustomed. The most healthy signal from the marketplace has been the revival in retail, or genuine customer business in equities. The total of around Pounds 6.8bn for the past five trading sessions is the best the market has seen since the skids went under the bond markets. The bid for Wm Low from Tesco is seen as a welcome indication of the weight of corporate activity likely to surface as companies with highly-rated paper move in on bid targets. Such activity is associated with a return of investment confidence in the stock market.</p>

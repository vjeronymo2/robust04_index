			<p>BFN     [Text] In its daily briefing in Brussels the Army spoke to  the press, so, Annie Nameus, you have some extra details on the  confused situation in Rwanda:    [Nameus] First, about the evacuation of Belgian nationals:  troops have been to the south, in the direction of Nyamata,  bringing back the Belgians who wanted to come, but some decided  to stay, because the situation appears a little calmer in the  south. This convoy is now back in Kigali. It didn't meet many  obstacles, just a few roadblocks.    Another convoy also went out today, 20 km to the west of  Kigali, and, in the northwest, some 20 people, mostly Belgians,  were taken from Ruhengeri to Gisenyi, where they arrived in the  middle of the afternoon, under escort by soldiers involved in  military technical cooperation.    I should also report that there are about 30 people at  Kigali  airport; they arrived after the last C-130s had left. The  evacuation of Belgian nationals from Kigali is not yet over, and  no final date for the evacuation has yet been fixed.    It is now the second commando battalion that is responsible  for the town of Kigali. They are now being called the second  commando battalion and no longer UN peacekeeping troops. These  troops are, so to say, putting on their green berets again under  their blue helmets.    The airport and the interior of the country are now the  responsibility of the intervention units.</p>

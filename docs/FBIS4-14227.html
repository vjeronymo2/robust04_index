			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, 27 Apr (MENA)--The joint military committee  entrusted to control the situation and prevent friction between  Yemeni forces regrets the 'Imran Camp incident between military  units from north and south Yemen that occurred north of Sanaa  this afternoon.    In a statement this evening, the committee said it will  continue its mission to maintain the cease-fire and will work to  restore reassurance to the personnel in the camp.    The committee urged the forces in 'Imran Camp to demonstrate  patience and self-restraint, and it called on the Yemeni Armed  Forces not to heed those who try to ignite sedition among the  sons of the unified homeland.    The committee discussed the circumstances of the clashes  that  took place in the camp while it was visiting at noon today. It  did not blame one side or the other.    The committee said it visited the camp accompanied by the  two  commanders of the two brigades (one from the north and one from  the south) and noticed that everybody was in a state of high  tension and that the engines of the tanks and military vehicles  of both sides were in a state of readiness.    It was agreed that the engines be stopped and that everyone  would go to lunch, the committee said. During this, it added,  three gunshots from an unidentified source were heard. This was  followed by heavy machine-gun fire and later by fire from tanks  and all types of weapons coming from all directions.    The statement said the committee managed with extreme  difficulty to leave the camp by going in different directions.</p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Observer: Stick tock The extra angst visible on the faces of Zurich citizens this week is not only the result of worry about possible isolation from the rest of Europe. More likely the cause is ice-layers - both the public and the city's clocks have been suffering from the current cold snap. Probably no city in the world has as many clocks; every side of every church spire and every large intersection is so equipped. Moreover, the city's public transport authority broadcasts the time to all trams and buses at irregular intervals. In the past few days, with temperatures remaining below freezing, some clocks have fared poorly. The minute hand at Fraumunster cathedral, for example, has a hard time climbing up to the hour. Some two-faced clocks show different times on each side. It is all a bit odd considering that Zurich winters are often very cold and the Swiss are supposed to be expert clock-makers. Perhaps they should seek help from the Japanese.</p>

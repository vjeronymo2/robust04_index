			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Barry Parker] </F>   [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, 5 May  (AFP)--Palestinian officials admitted Thursday [5 May] they were  having "difficulties" launching self-rule, but fended off  Israelis accusations off being ill-prepared.    PLO spokesman Sufyan Abu-Zayda told AFP there were  "technical" problems, a day after the signing of an agreement to  launch autonomy in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho.    "We are not a government, we are an organization with our  forces spread around the world," he told AFP.    "We have to expect that there will be difficulties, serious  difficulties because this conflict has been going on for so many  years," said PLO official Rashid Abu-Shibak, founder of the  armed group the Black Panthers.    West Bank military administration spokeswoman Colonel Elise  Shazar said the occupiers were "ready to transfer power at any  time.    "But we are waiting for the Palestinians to knock on the  door  and present the list of names of the future heads for various  sectors," she said.    "Since the Palestinians have asked for a delay to get  organized, the administration is waiting and continues, while  waiting, to be responsible for everything as usual."    The military administration would operate until the  withdrawal was completed.    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has already turned on the PLO  for its apparent lack of readiness in a devastating outburst.    "They're not ready to take things over," he said Wednesday  after PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat at first refused to initial part  of the autonomy deal, causing chaos at the lavish ceremony.    'Arafat finally appended his reservations to the size of the  Jericho enclave.    "We could finish our withdrawal in 10 days, the problem is  that Yasir 'Arafat has asked for four weeks," Rabin revealed.    Palestinian negotiators were "more concerned about symbolic  issues than purely practical problems".    Rabin urged the PLO to focus on the "economic woes" of Gaza.  With more than half the working population unemployed and with  little prospect of finding a job in the near future, the size of  the task cannot be under-estimated.    The PLO, whose offices have just one telephone line working  in Gaza City, had announced that 1,000 policemen would enter  Gaza on Thursday.    But the arrival has now been put back to an imprecise  "middle  of next week".    From Cairo, PLO security chief Jibril Rajub told Israel  radio: "There are logistical problems in the deployment of the  Palestinian police. It will begin in a few days and will no  doubt extend over a few weeks."    "We have to coordinate our efforts with Israel and a liaison  committee will try to harmonize the deployment and the transfer  of responsibilities."    The liaison committee met on the strip on Thursday with the  aim of agreeing a timetable for the security transfer.    Israel has set a "representation" at the Erez crossing point  into the strip to assist the new authorities and later to act as  a contact point, for example if a Palestinian wants hospital  treatment in Tel Aviv.    PLO spokesman Abu-Zayda tried to explain the slow pace.    "We don't want the police to come before everything is ready  for their deployment. We don't want to put them in camps like  jails," he said.    "We need a week to prepare things, to find places for them  to  live. The agreement gives us three weeks."    However, divisions among the Palestinian ranks cannot have  helped.    No Palestinian figure from the territories attended the  Cairo  ceremony.    Neither West Bank Fatah chief Faysal al-Husayni, nor ex-PLO  spokeswoman Hanan 'Ashrawi, nor ex-head of the delegation to  bilateral negotiations Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi.    "After a 27-year pregnancy, we have given birth to a  premature son, in weak health and who may not survive," said  al-Husayni.    Such prognostics were not heard publicly on the Gaza Strip  among those charged with running autonomy.    "We are ready to set up the authority in 24 hours," claimed  Abu-Shibak, who returned to Gaza in early April after escaping  abroad to avoid arrest in 1990.    No one mentioned whether 'Arafat was using time as a weapon  to try to gain more concessions from Israel over the size of  Jericho and the release of prisoners, hundreds more of whom were  expected to be freed Thursday after an initial 250 following the  signing.    Hasan Abu-Libdah, deputy director of the PLO-appointed  Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Construction,  described the problems as "Palestinian insufficiency".    "We are not ready to receive authority," he said, pointing  out that under occupation Palestinians had never had to take  decisions.    "Environment questions, for example, are totally new to us,"  said Abu-Libdah who is also in charge of 36 technical committees  the Palestinians set up after the Madrid conference launched the  peace process in October 1991.    "What we need is to Palestinize the programmes in every  sphere. It's not a matter of being a week late, it might take  three or six months before we are really ready," he said    Palestinian sources added: "They are only ready in the field  of health.    "It's the only field we have experience in and have a full  programme ready.    "As for the rest, education, tourism or whatever nothing  else  is completed.    "For direct taxation nothing has been done. We need three  months' work with the Israelis on tax matters.    "Autonomy grants authority to the Palestinians for indirect  tax, social welfare, education, health and tourism."</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Kohl close to deal on 'solidarity pact' MEMBERS of Germany's ruling coalition claimed yesterday to have made 'huge progress' in finalising proposals for the planned 'solidarity pact' between the government, opposition, employers and trade unions, intended to finance the soaring cost of unification. Final plans will be presented to the parliamentary parties in the coalition next Tuesday, but they then have to be agreed with trade unions and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) opposition, which remain decidedly sceptical. The government parties, including Mr Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the minority Free Democrats (FDP), remain determined to cut back in some areas of social spending. These cuts are fiercely opposed by the SPD. They have also agreed on other savings measures, including a ceiling of 3 per cent on public sector pay - and 2 per cent for civil servants - according to today's issue of Handelsblatt, the German business daily. Other measures include taxation of life insurance policies, and to raise taxation on insurances from 10 to 12 per cent. Overall, they are looking to cut back public expenditure in the west by some DM12bn (Pounds 4.9bn). Firm evidence of a reduction in the state deficit, as well as restraint from the trade unions, is demanded by the Bundesbank as a precondition for any early relaxation in its high interest rate policy. The most tangible sign of progress in recent days, as the pace of negotiations for the pact has stepped up dramatically, has been the agreement of the German banking sector to increase loans to east German enterprises by DM1bn (Pounds 400m), on top of a similar commitment from the insurance industry. The banks' agreement was made on Monday, in talks with Mr Horst Kohler, the state secretary for finance. However, it now has to be worked out in detail with the Treuhand privatisation agency in eastern Germany. The money is intended to provide credit for Treuhand enterprises which have not yet been privatised, but which are considered 'capable of being restructured'. An agreement on saving such eastern 'core' enterprises is likely to be a key part of the solidarity pact, in exchange for which the trade unions are supposed to promise real restraint in their wage demands. At the same time, the central government and the 11 western Lander are supposed to agree on drastic savings in their budgets, in order to provide adequate finance for the bankrupt eastern Lander. An inconclusive round of talks was held by Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, with a committee of finance ministers from the Lander last weekend, and further talks are expected on Sunday.</p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Big players join the power game - Companies in the news / Booming recs could be targets Even at the start of this extraordinary week for the 12 regional electrical companies (recs), the sector's shareholders had plenty to which they could look forward. First, there are generous interim dividends - between 15 and 47 per cent higher than last year - which the companies have been promising in the present financial results season. They should arrive soon. Then, there is the likely flotation next year of the National Grid, a move which seems certain to lift further the value of the share prices of the recs which own it. But all of this became relatively insignificant when, at 1.53 on Wednesday afternoon, the Swiss Bank Corporation said Trafalgar House, the conglomerate it advises, was considering a takeover offer for Northern Electric. It was the confirmation the City wanted for theories that the sector was ripe for significant structural change, through takeovers and mergers, following the expiry on March 31 of the government's bid-blocking 'golden share' in the recs. Takeover fever took hold. Shares in all recs rose an average 5 per cent on Wednesday alone and the 12 companies finished the week with a combined market value of Pounds 17.3bn. That compares with Pounds 5.2bn when they were floated just four years ago. But any shareholder tempted to take profits by selling is likely to be told by his financial advisers to think long and hard. Many analysts have felt that the first bid for any of the companies would flush out other potential suitors, whether for Northern or its peers - and that could do nothing but boost share prices. Indeed, if Trafalgar does decide to bid for Northern - and all the signs are that it will - then it will have to pay a large premium, even on yesterday's bid-related Northern share price of 985p, to ensure victory. It is true that Trafalgar's unusual circumstances provide it with more reason that most to bid for a rec. Over the past three years, it has lost nearly Pounds 400m before tax. The losses, and unrelieved advance corporation tax, could shelter a large part of Northern's profits from the Inland Revenue. In addition, a bid could enable Hongkong Land - the property arm of Jardine Matheson which owns 25 per cent of Trafalgar - to channel money from Hong Kong into the UK and increase its stake in Trafalgar. Trafalgar is unlikely to be the only company eyeing the recs and the results season will have whetted appetites further. Aided by what is regarded widely as a slack regulatory regime, imposed at privatisation, the companies have increased underlying profits in the half-year by at least 20 per cent in most cases. From April, though, a tougher regulatory regime will force them to cut prices in the distribution businesses - their main profit-earners - by between 11 and 17 per cent, and there will be real reductions of about 2 per cent in future years. This will stop profit growth next year for some recs, but the upward path is likely to resume in 1996-97. Most of the companies are cash-rich and, in spite of the regulatory changes, will continue to generate more during the next five years. This has enabled them to buy back shares or announce large one-off dividends, as Yorkshire Electricity did yesterday. Indeed, such are their resources that many analysts believe all of them will be able to increase dividends by 8 per cent real a year until the end of the century. The other main attraction of the recs, both for investors and potential predators, is their holding in the National Grid. Given to the companies by the government at privatisation four years ago, the Grid is now worth more than Pounds 4bn. The recs plan to float it on the stock exchange next May or June, almost certainly by a de-merger through which shareholders would be issued with new shares in the Grid. Many analysts think the Grid's full value is not reflected fully even at yesterday's inflated share prices. Nigel Hawkins, utilities specialist at Hoare Govett, says all rec shares are trading at discounts to their true value when the Grid is included. He believes there is upside of at least Pounds 1 in Norweb, London and Swalec. Kevin Lapwood, of Smith New Court, says the whole sector is a buy with Swalec, London, East Midlands and Norweb among his favourites. He cites the Grid value as a factor but is also impressed by the prospects opened up by the potential Trafalgar bid. 'The recs have no option now but to get value out to the shareholders,' he says. 'They were already cutting costs, but now they have to work to someone else's agenda.' Some stockbrokers are more cautious. 'The dividend growth might be strong but that is because companies are winding down cover from earnings, not because profit prospects are good,' said one, who believes also that sentiment will change as an election nears. A Labour government would almost certainly tighten regulation of utilities.</p>

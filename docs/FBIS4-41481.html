			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Manki Ponomarev: "United States Spares No </F> Expense on Spying"]    [Text] Washington is spending the truly astronomical sum  of $28 billion in the current fiscal year on the needs of the  intelligence agencies in spite of the fact that, as the  Americans themselves testify, with the collapse of the Soviet  Union "the majority of objectives and missions which the  intelligence agencies had to perform during the Cold War have  disappeared."    The so-called "intelligence community" of the United States  is reminiscent of a gigantic octopus. It comprises agencies  like the CIA with a budget of $3 billion, the National  Reconnaissance Office [natsionalnoye razvedyvatelnoye  upravleniye] which is responsible for satellite intelligence and  receives $7 billion annually, the National Security Agency which  gathers information by electronic means and spends $4 billion,  the Pentagon's Operational Agency for Tactical Intelligence  [operatsionnoye upravleniye takticheskoy razvedki] with a budget  of $12 billion, and the Department of Defense Defense  Intelligence Agency whose annual expenditure comes to $600  million.    Today, even in Washington people are beginning to realize  that such expenditure on spying activities cannot be justified.  The U.S. National Security Council has set about studying how  best to define the intelligence community's role in the present  circumstances. THE WASHINGTON POST wrote that the main purpose  of their ongoing investigation is "first to identify the threats  which the United States will encounter in the next 10-20 years,  and second to determine the manpower and resources available to  neutralize them."    The study of U.S. intelligence activities is still far from  being completed. But it is already clear that the individual  changes which have recently been implemented in the major U.S.  intelligence agencies are cosmetic in nature and do not provide  for fundamental change. Their previous structure remains  unchanged, though the problems they solve and the volume of  their work have changed significantly. Even certain former  high-ranking CIA staffers now openly admit that it is essential  to fundamentally reform the intelligence agencies and to limit  their role.    Each state, of course, strives to possess the fullest  possible information about what is happening in the world, what  threats they might expect, and from where these threats might  come. Such information is gathered in various ways, including  intelligence sources. But it is one thing when some country  comes up against major potential dangers, as was the case during  the period of global confrontation along an East-West axis. It  is a completely different matter when it is only a question of  conflicts at a regional level, like, for example, those the  United States has come up against in Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia.    Thus, you get the impression that the wind of change blowing  across the world has not affected the U.S. intelligence  community. It continues to act in accordance with past  standards. Naturally, the billions of dollars are not being  spent on spying against the Cocos Islands or Transkei. But the  question naturally arises: Against whom then?</p>

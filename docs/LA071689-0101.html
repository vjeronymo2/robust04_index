			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COVERAGE OF THE ABORTION ISSUE IN TUSTIN  </P> <P> Your (July 9) article regarding the rescue in Tustin was clearly biased against  Operation Rescue. You, and many others, persist in calling Operation Rescue  militant. According to Webster, "militant" means "engaged in warfare" or  "aggressively active." Neither is true of Operation Rescue. Singing, praying,  sitting and going limp cannot be construed as aggressive by any stretch of the  definition.  </P> <P> You also called the demonstration "boisterous" and said the two sides "taunted  one another." Having participated in two rescues myself, I find this hard to  believe. Operation Rescue strongly recommends that rescuers be quiet and  prayerful (as evidenced by your own photos). I have never seen one of them be  otherwise. On the other hand, I have been pushed, taunted and verbally abused  by megaphone-shouting "pro-choice advocates."  </P> <P> This type of news reporting is blatantly prejudiced. Please be objective.  </P> <P> BARBARA DELANO  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

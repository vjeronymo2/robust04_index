The conference is attended by representatives of the Belarus  Ministry of Health and the five largest cities of this state in  charge of health-care organizations, blood donation, and  epidemiology. [passage omitted]    In Belarus there have been 102 recorded cases of  HIV-positive  people, including seven children. Of those 102, 10 are already  suffering from AIDS. Seventy percent of all cases are located  in Minsk. According to Polish doctors, Belarus is at the stage  of the AIDS epidemic where Poland was six to seven years ago.    According to the State Institute of Hygiene, there were  2,935  recorded cases of HIV-positive people by the end of February  [1994]. Of those, 175 persons contracted AIDS, and 98 have  already died. These are only estimates. Dr. Krzysztof  Dziubinski, adviser to the minister of health, maintains that a  growing trend can be observed.    As far as diphtheria is concerned, there were 120 cases  recorded in Belarus last year, while there were only 10 in  Poland. Last year, Belarus purchased Polish antidiphtheria  vaccine. It is going to test it and use it in preventive  treatment.</p>

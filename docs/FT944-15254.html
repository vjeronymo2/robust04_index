			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Scantronic raises Pounds 2.8m Scantronic Holdings, the security components company, is raising a total of Pounds 2.8m net in new equity and borrowings following agreement from its shareholders at an extraordinary meeting. About Pounds 1.2m is being raised through a placing and open offer of 16.1m new ordinary shares at 10p each while a further Pounds 1.6m will be provided by additional bank facilities. The proceeds would provide sufficient working capital for the group's current needs, the directors said. They also announced that there would be pre-tax losses of about Pounds 2.4m for the half year to September 30 after an exceptional Pounds 1.7m reflecting the costs of the revised bank facilities and recent reorganisation of the group's operations. Profits last time were Pounds 1.4m restated. Losses per share are expected at 7.71p (1.4p earnings). The directors do not expect to make any dividend payments, including preference dividends, for this year.</p>

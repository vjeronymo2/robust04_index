			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> FLORIDA OFFICIALS PLEDGE IMMIGRANT AID  </P> <P> Florida lawmakers met with hundreds of Nicaraguan immigrants living at a  stadium in Miami to pledge support, but they warned that funds to help them  find jobs and homes "don't come easily." Newly elected Republicans Sen. Connie  Mack and Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. and Mayor Xavier Suarez visited the Bobby Maduro  Miami Stadium to examine the problems facing the growing number of Nicaraguan  arrivals. A total of 263 Nicaraguans are living at the stadium. Shaw vowed to  help "so that Miami won't have to take on alone the financial burden of these  new refugee arrivals." Miami officials have said that the latest wave of  Nicaraguans will overburden schools and hospitals. The Central Americans began  arriving from South Texas last week, after a federal judge in Texas ruled that  the federal government could not keep them there while their applications for  political asylum were being processed.  </P></p>

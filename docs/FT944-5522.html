			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Japan sees strong signs of recovery Japan's economy is showing the first strong signs of recovery after a rise in consumer spending and a surprise pick-up in corporate investment. According to figures released yesterday, gross domestic product grew at an annualised rate of 3.7 per cent in the three months to September this year. The government's Economic Planning Agency said that GDP rose by 0.9 per cent from the previous quarter, putting Japan on track for a 'full-scale recovery' this financial year. However, most private sector economists expect a weak upturn, with a rise in GDP this calendar year of 0.6 per cent. The figures also show that growth is sucking in imports and driving down the current account surplus; a help for hard-pressed Japanese exporters who are keen to see a fall in the yen. The government said the current account surplus fell to Dollars 8.9bn (Pounds 5.4bn) in October, down 19.3 per cent against the same month last year, the third consecutive monthly fall. The deficit on the long-term capital account nearly doubled from Dollars 7.8bn in September to Dollars 14.1bn in October, a sign that previously cautious Japanese investors have started to place their cash abroad again. Imports rose by 4.4 per cent, encouraged by the strength of private demand, and exports rose only 0.7 per cent. Consumption was up 4.6 per cent. The GDP total was in line with analysts' average forecasts, but some of its components surprised. Corporate investment, for example, rose 1.8 per cent for the first time since the third quarter of 1991. That is taken as a sign that a record fall in capital spending may have touched bottom. Taken with the increase in company profits shown in the recent interim results season, the rise in investment reinforces the sense of corporate recovery, said Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo. The agency also upgraded its results for the second three months, from the initially estimated 0.4 per cent quarter-on-quarter fall, to a 0.2 per cent rise. There was potentially worrying news with the first fall in the GDP deflator, a broad measure of domestic prices, for seven years. It fell an annualised 0.5 per cent in the third quarter, which could show deflation has domestic causes as well as being a function of the cheap import prices caused by the yen's strength.

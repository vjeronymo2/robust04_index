			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Major Steps To Liberalize Trade Are </F> Imminent"]    [Text] China this week will announce major steps to  liberalize its trade to help pave the way for its return to  GATT, the world trade body, said a senior government official.    China will ensure "maximum possible flexibility on tariff  and  non-tariff measures as well as other issues of interest to GATT  parties, while maintaining a balance of rights and obligations  in GATT," said the official, Long Yongtu.    Long is in charge of GATT affairs for the Ministry of  Foreign  Trade and Economic Cooperation (Moftec).    Long made the remarks in an interview with BUSINESS WEEKLY  on  the eve of the 16th session of the GATT Working Party on China,  to be held from March 15-18 in Geneva.    Long, who is general secretary of the Chinese delegation,  which left for Geneva on Saturday, said details of the  "significant measures" would be announced then.    "Some of the measures will be bound to specific  implementation timetables," Long said.    "And," he added, "we will make new commitments to foreign  exchange reforms."    These impending measures should better position China for  resuming contracting party status in the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT), economists said.    The United States and the European Union (EU) have  complained  that China's proposed concessions to the Uruguay Round of GATT  trade negotiations are not enough.    But the U.S. and EU agree that China could be allowed a  transitional period to revise its proposals after it rejoins  GATT. Analysts said the new measures by China on liberalizing  trade can be significant steps in that direction.    Long's delegation to Geneva, which is led by Moftec  Vice-Minister Gu Yongjiang, is the largest of any sent by China  to Geneva.    Yu Xiaosong, Vice-Minister of the State Economic and Trade  Commission which masterminds the nation's industrial policies,  is vice-chairman of the mission.    Long pointed out that the Geneva session on China's re-entry  into GATT is the first following the conclusion of the Uruguay  Round of trade talks.    "It is high time for China to rejoin GATT," Long said.    His opinion is based on three reasons.    Firstly, China's economic reforms in the past 15 years,  particularly those adopted this year, have substantially pushed  the country's economy onto a market-based track.    "Even the U.S. and EU have acknowledged the remarkable  progress China has made," Long said.    U.S. Assistant Trade Representative Dorothy Dwoskin and EU  Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan visited China last month and  gained an appreciation of China's economic reforms.    Secondly, China has accepted the notion of a transitional  period for it to meet GATT's requirements.    Thirdly, China's resumption of its GATT status would be the  prerequisite for becoming a founding member of the World Trade  Organization (WTO), which is to replace GATT next year as the  primary international free-trade body.    "Without the participation of China as a founding member,  WTO  will be incomplete and its universality will be weakened," Long  said.    If China, the world's 11th largest trading nation, should be  kept outside WTO it would be a setback for the international  trade system, he added.    Long reaffirmed that China would not seek to reduce its  obligations for maintaining world trade once it rejoins Gatt.    "We will not dilute our commitment to GATT or the WTO by  resorting to treatment as a developing nation," he said.    GATT rules, as well as preliminary regulations drawn up by  the WTO, stipulate different treatment for developing and  developed nations on certain issues. "We are only insisting on  being treated as a developing nation when there are different  stipulations for the two categories," he explained.</p>

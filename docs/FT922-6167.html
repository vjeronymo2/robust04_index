			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Book Review: Cards up their sleeves VENDETTA: American Express and the smearing of Edmond Safra By Bryan Burrough HarperCollins Dollars 25 hardback, 477 pages HOUSE OF CARDS: Inside the Troubled Empire of American Express By Jon Friedman &amp; John Meehan GP Putnam &amp; Sons Dollars 24.95, 262 pages During the 1980s few US companies enjoyed such rapid profits growth and success as American Express. And few company chairmen were as lionised as Jim Robinson, the soft-spoken and courtly Atlanta banker's son who moved effortlessly between Wall Street and Washington. After being named chairman in 1977 Mr Robinson appeared to be constructing a financial services supermarket as he steered American Express from one acquisition to another. To the company's traditional charge card and travellers cheque products were added an array of sister businesses that ranged from stockbroking and investment banking (Shearson Loeb Rhoades, Lehman Brothers, E F Hutton) to private and commercial banking (Mr Edmond Safra's Trade Development Bank) to the cable television business (Warner Amex Cable). The good times for American Express coincided with the rise of the free-spending yuppies in the 1980s. Consumer spending kept rising - and with it the number of holders of the Amex green card, the gold card, and even the platinum card - until the company had some 36m cardholders worldwide. But American Express began facing a far harsher environment at the end of the decade. In retrospect, its once grand strategy now seemed more an ad hoc series of opportunistic acquisitions that had produced an unwieldy conglomerate. Its purchase of E F Hutton in late 1987, for example, came shortly after the Wall Street crash and led to heavy 1990 losses at Shearson Lehman Hutton. The new Optima card, a downmarket venture in the credit card sector, was by Amex's own admission poorly managed. By 1991 Optima was mired in credit losses. By early 1992 - after a year in which Optima accounted for more than 50 per cent of the Dollars 697m rise in credit loss provisions in the card division - Amex admitted its need to strengthen its capital base. Worse still, the core business of cards had been affected not only by the Optima losses but by rising numbers of retailers who were steering customers away from the Amex card and protesting the company's high fee structure. For Mr Robinson it must all seem like a bad dream. Critics say his 1980s diversification strategy has begun to disintegrate: the cable business was disposed of in 1985, just before it turned profitable. In 1984, a year after the purchase of Trade Development Bank, Mr Safra had broken with Amex (TDB itself was sold in 1990). And in 1989 Mr Robinson had to make a humbling public apology and a donation of Dollars 8m to Mr Safra's favourite charities when it emerged that persons employed by Amex had engaged in a smear campaign against Mr Safra. Now, as Mr Robinson and American Express are coming in for criticism over the company's business strategy in US media and financial circles, two new books add to the controversy. Yet neither provides enough analysis to answer the key question: what really went wrong? The first to be published is a chronologically ordered narrative called House of Cards. The book tries to present itself as an expose of Mr Robinson, who is dismissed as a power-hungry lightweight. However, the book is superficial and at times gratuitously salacious. This is a shame because House of Cards might have been - had it contained a bit more analysis - a more authoritative look at a fascinating company that lately has seemed to be somewhat adrift. Vendetta is another story. This is a well written and heavily detailed account of the way in which some distinctly unsalubrious operatives were deployed in the late 1980s by an aide to Mr Robinson to investigate Mr Safra. Vendetta recounts how they ended up smearing the secretive Swiss-based banker, thus costing Amex an enormous amount in terms of image and reputation. Vendetta has brought Bryan Burrough, author of the best-selling Barbarians at the Gate, a Dollars 50m libel suit from the former aide to Mr Robinson who eventually resigned because the Safra affair occurred 'on my watch'. The libel suit, however, does not concern the book, but rather an article published by Burrough in The Wall Street Journal. The book's great strength is as a colourful yarn that chronicles some questionable behaviour committed in the name of an otherwise reputable US corporation. Its weakness is that it hints at Mr Robinson's direct involvement in the Safra affair, but never quite manages to make the charge stick. The real value of both books is less in their revelations than in their underscoring of the problems that have caused Mr Robinson and Amex to come under such scrutiny. Mr Robinson may yet put things right, but for now the company's image - perhaps its most precious asset - looks somewhat tarnished.</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Dubai plans Arabic TV service EMIRATES Dubai Television plans to launch next month what it says is the world's first 24-hour Arabic satellite television service. EDTV, already available in the Middle East, hopes to reach 14m more Arabs living in Europe and North and Central America. The service will be carried on the Eutelsat II satellite in Europe and on Galaxy satellite on the other side of the Atlantic, where it will be available from Canada to Venezuela. The exporting of a television service from Dubai is the latest sign of the growing internationalising of the television market. Next spring BBC World Service Television is to launch a news service in Arabic for the Middle East. EDTV plans a December 6 launch. EDTV, which will use programmes, presenters, and technical staff drawn from all over the Middle East, plans to broadcast 70 per cent in Arabic and 30 per cent in English.</p>

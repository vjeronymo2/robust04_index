			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the latest statistics issued by the  provincial statistics bureau, from January to May this year, our  province's accumulated total industrial production exceeded  193.8 billion yuan, an increase of 23.2 percent over the same  period last year. During the first five months of this year,  although industrial enterprises in our province encountered  numerous difficulties in production and operations, statistics  show that industrial production in our province is still  advancing along a favorable path. Production and sales rates of  our industrial enterprises increased each month. Their  production and sales rate in May reached 95.8 percent, and the  sales volume of their products on both domestic and  international markets rose gradually.    As a result of this year's implementation of the policy of  unifying foreign exchange rates, the enthusiasm of enterprises  and relevant departments has been aroused. This has enabled the  increased output value of export products to exceed growth in  total industrial output value for the first time, and the margin  of the increase was 8.4 percentage points.    At present, an electronics products structure has been  formed  in our province, mainly consisting of electric appliances, such  as air conditioners and hi-fi equipment. The extensive  application of high technology is gradually changing low  efficiency.</p>

			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Allied-Lyons Yesterday's surge in Allied-Lyons' share price - up 13 per cent at one point, before closing up 4 per cent - shows the remarkable persistence of bid speculation about the company. The latest rumour, concerning Seagram this time, was no more obviously substantial than usual. But the market evidently has the stubborn conviction at the back of its mind that Allied deserves to be broken up. It is not immediately obvious why. Granted, Allied's return on capital is much lower than GrandMet's - though not Guinness's - despite the fact that it does not capitalise its brands. But in the most clearly comparable area of wines and spirits margins it does not do too badly, with 20 per cent last year compared to GrandMet's 19 per cent and Guinness's 31 per cent. It has also done well enough in share price terms, outperforming the market by 140 per cent in the past 10 years and 35 per cent in the past five. Here perhaps lies the snag. Despite the provisional welcome extended to the new management, the market does not value Allied as highly on fundamental grounds as it does GrandMet. Yet Allied is on 15 times current year earnings, GrandMet on 13. In terms of its own logic, therefore, the market had better be right about a bid arriving sooner or later.</p>

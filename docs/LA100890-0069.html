			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NIBBLES AND BITS  </P> <P> The Orange County Airport Commission has recommended that the curator of John  Wayne Airport's first exhibit, Community Arts Inc. of San Francisco, be hired  for another three months at up to $30,000 to organize a second exhibit, an  airport official says. The commission has also asked the Airport Arts  Commission to report back within 45 days on the possibility of hiring local  firms and artists to put together the art program's two remaining exhibits.  </P> <P> It additionally requested information on ways to reduce the program's $125,000  first-year budget. The art commission had recommended that Community Arts  Inc.'s contract be extended for the remainder of the fiscal year for $98,500,  but some local artists complained that Orange County professionals were being  overlooked. The Orange County Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote on the  contract extension Tuesday.  </P></p>

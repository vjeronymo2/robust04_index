			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Survey of Taiwan (1): An island in search of its identity - Taiwan has much to gain from developing an economically rational relationship with the Chinese mainland. Closer contacts must be properly managed and conducted in tandem with further liberalisation on Taiwan TAIWAN is an island in search of its identity. In the process of rediscovering its past and trying to define what makes itself special, Taiwan faces the future full of uncertainty. In one sense this is nothing new for the people of Taiwan. They have lived with the threat of invasion from communist China ever since the creation of the People's Republic in 1949, four years after the Kuomingtang (KMT, Nationalist) government took control of the island from a defeated Japan. But what makes the uncertainty of today different is the confusion within government, business, and society more generally about where the nation's future lies and what Taiwan's proper role in the world should be. Taiwan has come to a crossroads and is unsure which way to go. Taiwan's search for identity - the result of the political liberalisation which has occurred over the past 10 years - has produced a flowering in letters and the arts. Modern Taiwanese painters are blending western technique with an oriental sensibility to produce work of great originality. The Taiwanese are also delving deeper into their recent past - no longer off-limits for academic and popular research - and the culture of the indigenous people who have lived on the island since well before permanent Chinese settlement. This awakening in Taiwan has thrown more starkly into relief the divisions within Taiwanese society about the way forward. That future used to be fairly simple: as part of a united China, some day. But no longer; the island's cultural development and its rapid democratisation have produced among the people a reaction against reunification with the mainland, and active pockets of proselytes for independence who dream of a Republic of Taiwan. Perhaps the soul searching presently under way is the inevitable consequence of an authoritarian government releasing the constraints on participation in public life and lifting the prohibitions on private expression. But unlike much of Latin America or South Africa, which went through a similar process of political and social change in the 1980s, Taiwan is not a pariah state ready for international rehabilitation. It is recognised by a diminishing number of states in the international community. Less than 100 miles to the west of the island lie 1.2bn Chinese people ruled by a government which wants what it regards as its territory back. If the indecision within the Taiwanese mind were confined to Taipei's chattering classes then it would be of little consequence, but it is not. The government is deeply divided over policy towards the mainland. Many of its own current and former supporters believe that the KMT government's real agenda is not reunification - as it proclaims - but independence. The latest piece of evidence is Taiwan's abortive attempt last month to have its status reconsidered by the United Nations General Assembly. Businessmen - many of whom value the new-found freedoms that democratisation has brought - are convinced that closer economic ties with the Chinese mainland are not only inevitable, but desirable if Taiwan is to prosper. The government's prohibition of direct trade and communications links with the mainland - the absence of which cost Taiwanese business dearly and enriches Hong Kong greatly - cannot, however, go on indefinitely. In mid-1997, Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty and what was once an indirect trade route with the mainland becomes a direct one. In spite of itself, the government soon will have to face up to reality. The conundrum posed by the mainland - especially its recent opening to the outside world and the urgency with which the government on Taiwan has to deal with it - was summed up, but not faced, by a paper published this July by Taiwan's Council for Economic Planning and Development, (CEPD). 'The high degree of complementarity in economic conditions on the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, as well as special factors such as geographical proximity, blood affinity, and cultural background, have resulted in a rapid increase in economic and trade contacts between Taiwan and mainland China,' it noted. 'In the long-term, the further integration of the two economies is a trend that would be difficult to stop. The important question for Taiwan, therefore, is how to face up to the situation across the Taiwan Straits, grasp the initiative, strive for mutually beneficial development and secure Taiwan's position of economic leadership.' Fine sentiments, but unfortunately few solutions. The CEPD, which is part of Taiwan's cabinet, did not depart from the government's mainland policy. All it could do was urge a relaxation of some restrictions, such as those which apply to imports of semi-manufactures from the mainland, not a fundamental reappraisal of the policy. This is the fatal flaw in the CEPD's economic revitalisation programme, a plan which aims to increase the economy's competitiveness through deregulation and opening it further to international economic forces to create on Taiwan an Asia-Pacific regional operations zone. In outline, the plan attempts to cure the problems inherited from the explosive growth of the 1980s in asset prices by bearing down on rising labour and land costs. Looking forward, it seeks to raise the economy's level of technological sophistication, free access to international capital markets, and develop sea and air communications so that Taiwan can become a regional hub for trade. But realising the government's hope of remaking Taiwan anew may prove to be the most difficult feat to pull off for the island's hitherto impressively successful planners. Without direct access to mainland China the willingness of international business to locate on Taiwan would appear limited. 'What the government cannot bring itself to do is take a pragmatic approach and find a more effective way to deal with the situation,' says one local businessman, articulating the prevailing view. 'I do not agree that greater contacts will lead to dependency. Taiwan's businessmen are not stupid; none want to be dependent on China. In any event, the investment on the mainland cannot be stopped. It is like water; you cannot stop it flowing, so you'd better direct it. 'The question is how to prolong the process as long as we can so as to ensure that when unification comes it is not a problem for us.' Taiwan has much to gain by developing an economically rational relationship with the mainland. But it has much to lose as well. The struggle for political rights, to which the KMT-led government was forced to respond in the mid-1980s, was hard won. Taiwan, along with South Korea, is giving the lie to the assertion that Asians cannot govern themselves through free institutions but have to be ruled by an iron and unforgiving hand, lest they run amok. Multi-party democracy - still rough around the edges - is taking root on Taiwan, giving voice to popular demands for a cleaner environment and better social services and welfare. Given Beijing's attitude toward Hong Kong's democratic aspirations, Taiwan has much to fear from a closer embrace with the Chinese communists. But of the many things which distinguish Taiwan from Hong Kong three stand out. Taiwan is able to feed itself; it is able to govern itself; and it has an independent military deterrent. Closer contact with the mainland, if properly managed, and conducted in tandem with further liberalisation on Taiwan, ought not be a difficult trick to pull off. All it needs is the political will.</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: 8.3% dividend increase from South West Water South West Water yesterday announced a better-than-expected dividend increase, despite reporting flat pre-tax profits for the first half. The 8.3 per cent increase in the dividend from 8.4p to 9.1p compares with expectations of about 6 per cent. This helped the shares resist the worst of a 2 per cent decline in the sector, fuelled by fears of a general election. South West fell by just over 1 per cent, from 486p to 481p. ed South West announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 50.6m for the six months to September 30, against Pounds 50.3m last time. Sales were 14 per cent ahead at Pounds 143m, while earnings per share fell by 0.5 per cent to 38.2p. The pre-tax figure was depressed by a Pounds 3.5m rationalisation charge and a Pounds 7.8m increase in interest payments to Pounds 12.6m. The return was also hit by charges of Pounds 300,000 to cover the costs of South West's appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission over the price limits set by the industry regulator for the five years between 1995 and 2000. Mr Ken Hill, finance director, would not specify how much the appeal was likely to cost South West, but said a further charge was expected in the second half. A decision on the appeal is expected in March. The regulated business returned pre-tax profits 4 per cent lower at Pounds 49m because of the rationalisation costs. About 140 jobs had been cut, leaving 2,100 employees in the utility operation. Mr Hill said that, excluding the additional treatment works, costs had been held at levels similar to last year's. South West's non-core division, which includes waste haulage, construction and environmental businesses, returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.6m, against a loss of Pounds 700,000 last time. COMMENT South West has come out with the lowest dividend increase so far in the sector's reporting season and, given the uncertainties it faces, this is no great surprise. The MMC appeal is expected to cast a shadow over the shares for another six months. The company also faces flat to minimal earnings growth over the next few years. So, to provide meaningul dividend growth, its cover will have to be eroded more quickly than that of its peers. This would not be a problem, except that its peers will be increasing their earnings while trimming dividend cover. Forecasts are for about Pounds 96m this year. In the shorter term, the stock will be buoyed by its substantial yield of more than 7 per cent. However, there may be others where yields are almost as attractive but prospects for growth are better.</p>

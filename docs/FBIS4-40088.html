			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS correspondents Vladimir Abrosimov and Lyudmila </F> Yermakova]    [Text] Sofia June 13 TASS -- "Russia and Bulgaria are now  free sovereign states and one would not like any encroachments  upon their freedom and sovereignty. Interparliamentary  exchanges promote precisely the establishment of closer  political relations between the two countries," Russian  Federation Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko told journalists  here on Monday, informing them of some aspects of talks with  Alexander Iordanov, chairman of the People's Assembly. The  development of economic cooperation was one of the main subjects  during the exchange of views, Shumeyko said.    Much attention during the dialogue was devoted to  legislative  support for the development of economic cooperation, Yuriy  Algunov, press secretary of the Federation Council speaker, told  ITAR-TASS. The Bulgarian side showed great interest in the  experience which is being gained within the framework of the  interparliamentary assembly of CIS countries, Algunov said.    This was also confirmed by the Bulgarian parliament chief  who  at the same time expressed an opinion that the time apparently  comes to change over "from official visits to the level of  working contacts between individual commissions of the two  parliaments."    Participants in the meeting positively assessed the  establishment of permanent exchanges of information on the  activities of Russia's Federal Assembly and Bulgaria's People's  Assembly.    The fact that Shumeyko invited Iordanov to visit Moscow at a  date of his convenience is an earnest of future constructive  contacts between them. A similar invitation to Iordanov was  also extended earlier by State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin who  visited here at the beginning of the year.    At the close of the meeting in the Bulgarian parliament, the  Russian delegation was received by Professor Lyuben Berov,  chairman of the Council of Ministers. On the same day, the  guests laid a wreath at the unknown soldier's tomb -- a memorial  complex in downtown Sofia in commemoration of Bulgarians who had  perished on the battlefields.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK needs restructured welfare system, not lower benefit levels Sir, Joe Rogaly ('Hand-up, not hand-out', June 7) is right to say that 'any promise of full employment would be hollow without some reform of the welfare system'. He is wrong to conclude that this means settling for less welfare if we want more people in jobs. A Commission on Social Justice report to be published next week shows it is the structure and administration of benefits, rather than their level, which affects employment. And the existing benefits system in the UK needs reform in order to make work pay. This does not imply promoting a downwards competition between wages and benefits at the bottom of the labour market. It does, however, imply tackling the outdated notions of a 'family wage' inherent in the current benefits structure and easing the transition from out-of-work to in-work benefits. There is not a sterile choice between more or less welfare and more or less labour market regulation. The real challenge is to shape regulation and welfare to fit today's world.

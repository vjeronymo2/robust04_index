			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Utilities in active session Water and electricity sectors continued to be buoyed and buffeted in equal measure by recent results and regulatory moves. South Wales Electricity, the latest to report figures, saw profits come in at the top end of market forecasts and its dividend fully meet expectations. The shares moved forward on the news and sustained the gain through the session, closing 6 up at 635p. Some of the other 'recs' trailed back with the market, continuing to nurse a hangover from British Gas, which fell heavily on Wednesday after reacting negatively to the industry regulator's latest move on pricing. Gas shares slid a further 3 to 268 1/2 p. Elsewhere among the recs, East Midland bounced 13 to 592p, Manweb declined 7 to 683p and Midlands edged up 3 to 582p. Water stocks were largely dull, with dealers reporting a few large sellers in the wake of results from Thames on Wed-nesday. The company reported large provisions for its non-core businesses and it was fear that other water companies may make similar moves which provoked some selling. In contrast, analysts pronounced themselves pleased with results from Southern, which produced a good dividend increase and an upbeat trading statement. But the sector weakness meant Southern's initial rise was turned into a 5 deficit at 513p by the close. Thames eased 2 to 468p in another heavy turnover of 4m.</p>

Due to the fact that  the Black Sea Fleet has issued no official communique on this  accident, various rumors have started to circulate. To avoid  this, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry Press Service reports that  as has become known, Admiral Baltin was wounded at his summer  house as a result of careless handling of his gun.</p>

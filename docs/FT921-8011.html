			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Hong Kong (4): The Chinese way of working - Business and Social Etiquette: few people are as cosmopolitan and tolerant as the Hong Kong Chinese, yet beneath the western veneer you have a Chinese city that has very Chinese ways of working and playing, explains David Dodwell. AS the taxi turned away from Kaitak airport and into the tightly packed night-time streets of Kowloon  - an orgy of dubious tenement blocks and garish neon  - it was impossible to ignore the tin containers scattered along the pavements and on the street corners with flames leaping out of them. Families were feeding paper money to the hungry ghosts. Scratch Hong Kong's colonial and expatriate veneer and you have a Chinese city that has very Chinese ways of working and playing. Its taipans may be cosmopolitan enough to forgive a visiting barbarian his ignorance of these ways, but without some knowledge, it will prove hard to share the moral high ground. A visiting business-person can get a long way with scant knowledge of hungry ghosts. At the most fundamental level, most Chinese business people are highly conservative. This means they dress conservatively, are uncomfortable with body contact, and prefer a polite distance. They can be appalled by the robust bonhomie typical of some American businessmen  - all shoulder hugs and first name terms. Dressing conservatively means suit and tie for a man, even in the soporific humidity of Hong Kong's summer months. It is not only for reasons of etiquette that Chinese prefer to keep their distance. Put bluntly, they find that many westerners smell. It's all to do with being hairy, and open-pored. Lots of showers and deodorants will be more than usually important  - and not only in torrid summer. For a woman, crisp neutral elegance is safer than anything flamboyant. Both white and royal blue are funeral colours among Chinese, so are best avoided. There is a strong undercurrent of chauvinism among Chinese men which is disguised by taboos on body contact, discrete body language, and the presence of many Chinese women at the very highest levels of business, government and industry. Behind a tendency to be dismissive of women is a respect for those who apply a sharp, no-nonsense intelligence in their work. So a visiting woman executive can earn respect, but should be under no illusions that she will have more to prove than a male to win the confidence of a Hong Kong client. A lack of promptness will go down badly. Hong Kong works as a highly efficient place, where the value of time is calculated carefully. The physical compactness of the city means that many meetings can be crowded into a day, from power breakfasts to after-dinner discussions. Just because a meeting is over lunch, or dinner, or in a nightclub should not blind a visitor to the fact the agenda is strictly business. One US-educated Chinese businessman confided: 'I find it excruciating to have a client chatting to me about his wife, her breast cancer, his daughter's divorce, and other very personal details. It's so embarrassing. A Chinese would never bring his personal life into a business meeting." The result of this is that Chinese appear to many westerners to lack polished edges. They tend to 'get straight down to business,' rather than banter at the beginning of a meeting, and shuffle rather stiffly through the pleasantries. 'If you think a Chinese businessman is unpolished, you may not be wrong,' one Chinese executive notes: 'Some have little in the way of formal education, and have got to where they have got by hard work and two bare hands.' This is less likely to be the case among younger Chinese. Those who arrived in Hong Kong as refugees from China during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s have, where possible, made sure their children have had the educations they never had chance to obtain. As a result, the universities of Vancouver, San Francisco and London are awash with diligent and successful Chinese students. Many have returned to run their own, or family companies, or to swell the ranks of Hong Kong's professional classes. The point to remember is that money, and business acumen counts for more than a PhD. The result is a surprisingly meritocratic respect for anyone who has acquired wealth, whether or not it is underpinned by impressive academic success. At the same time, it is often sensible to draw a discrete veil around the question of someone's origins, or how his wealth was first amassed. Linked with a powerful sense of personal dignity is the Chinese concept of 'face'. In fact, much more is made of face than is necessary, since westerners have their own very similar concepts of giving or losing face. At a practical level, it usually means more than treating people with respect and politeness. In Hong Kong it may mean that difficult or confrontational issues would if possible be dealt with by junior staff: it is thought unseemly for taipans to exchange harsh words unless it is absolutely necessary. 'Face' might also mean that someone whose grasp of English is uncertain will pretend to understand even if he does not. It is important to remember that one's counterpart is doing business in his or her second language. By talking simply, avoiding idiomatic English, and encouraging one's counterpart to summarise as a way of confirming understanding, later embarrassment can be avoided. Even among sophisticated, cosmopolitan young business people in Hong Kong (and it is worth noting that Hong Kong is an extremely young society, with many large companies run by people in their twenties and thirties), 'Chineseness' shows through in an all-pervasive regard for superstition. Even those converted to Christianity show a healthy respect for the pantheon of Taoist deities that populate the lives of the majority. Belief in natural harmony  - the balance of the polar forces of yin and yang  - and of energy forces flowing through the environment  - understood as the forces of fengshui, or wind and water - reside deep in Chinese minds. So does ancestor worship, belief in auspicious and inauspicious dates, and superstition linked through word play and puns with lucky and unlucky numbers, colours and words. For a westerner, it is often enough to be a knowing observer on these subconscious forces in every Chinese life. Sometimes, however, a more active awareness may be called for. A telephone number with lots of '4s' in it, or a hotel room on the 44th floor, would be seen as singularly inauspicious. The number four in Chinese sounds much the same as the word for death. By contrast, the numbers 3, 8 and 9 are full of good luck: the first sounds like the word for life, the second for wealth, and the third for long life. This may sound far-fetched, but it is bemusing to stand in the Central mass transit railway station at rush hour and watch how reluctant passengers are to exit through turnstile number 44. Gifts for a client also need to be carefully chosen. A bell or a watch or clock are unlikely to be welcome, since they suggest death is not far away. In the unlikely event that shoes are being considered for a gift, forget it: they augur that the recipient is going to walk out of your life. Belief in fengshui is pervasive, and keeps a large number of geomancers and fortune tellers in considerable wealth. The imposing Bank of China headquarters caused consternation when it was completed in 1988: its mirror walls reflected angry spirits into many surrounding buildings. A tree had to be planted in the Governor's garden nearby to prevent evil spirits being reflected into his house (given the governor's recent untimely resignation, one might wonder whether the tree was wholly effective). There was much consternation during the early 1980s, when the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai banking corporation headquarters was being rebuilt. Their site in Queen's Road, Central, is at a particularly auspicious junction of positive natural forces, and the dispersal of staff to temporary offices around the city was seen as terrible for the bank, and for the territory as a whole. Worse still, the two bronze guardian lions at the entrance to the bank had to be kept in storage, laying the territory exposed to any number of unauspicious forces. No wonder, then, that Hong Kong went through one of the most turbulent periods of its history during the early 1980s, with currency crises, bank collapses, and two years of tempestuous negotiation between Britain and China over its future beyond 1997. It was not just conservative Chinese who sighed a relief when the new headquarters were completed, and the lions back on guard. At a more mundane level, fengshui dictates how a room or office should be furnished. Many a Columbia educated Chinese graduate has been discovered realigning desks and chairs in his or her office, putting mirrors up, or placing a fish tank in a particular position, after advice from a geomancer. even if they are sceptical about fengshui, pragmatism tells them it is best to hedge bets. The forces of yin (the female or cooling principle) and yang (the male, or heating principle) also play a subtle part in Chinese lives, and should always be kept in balance. For a visitor, they come into play most clearly around the dining table, where 'heating' foods like red meat should always be counterbalanced by 'cooling' foods like fish or vegetables. Guinness or brandy are yang, while gin or white wine are yin. Fried foods are yang; poached are yin. It is not just chopsticks one has to wrestle with at the dining table. In fact, it is probably at the dining table that the tables are turned on Chinese who regard westerners as uncouth or barbarian: Chinese table manners can be shocking to western sensibilities. They may burp and belch; they may slurp soup or tea with great gusto; they may spit shell and other inedibles onto the tablecloth by the plate. They may conduct elaborate explorations with toothpicks. After a chinese meal, a tablecloth is as likely as not to look like a battlefield. No offence is meant by any of this. Also, do not be discomfited if the host serves you personally. It is seen as natural politeness, and need not be reciprocated. You should try not to use personal chopsticks in the central serving bowls - this is seen as unhygienic. Also, do not be surprised if a host draws proceedings quickly to a close once the final course has been consumed. It is not a Chinese habit to dally at the table after eating  - perhaps not surprising, giving the mess it may be in. After making such a meal of the idiosyncracies of Chinese culture, it is perhaps worth re-emphasising that few people are as cosmopolitan as Hong Kong Chinese. They are highly tolerant of different cultural habits, and will tend not to take offence if you are ignorant of theirs. Many are so westernised that their sensibilities are very similar to our own. Few could be easier to do business with.</p>

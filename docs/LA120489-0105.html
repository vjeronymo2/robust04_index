			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> NO PRE-YULE MCMARTIN VERDICTS, JUDGE ASSURES WORRIED JURORS  </P> <P> The judge in the marathon McMartin preschool molestation trial responded to the  worries of deliberating jurors today by agreeing to withhold verdicts until the  panelists return from Christmas vacation.  </P> <P> Three jurors told Superior Court Judge William Pounders they feared that  friends, neighbors and co-workers might put pressure on them about their  decisions if some of the verdicts were to be announced before they leave Dec.  15 for a two-week recess.  </P> <P> The jurors are considering 65 separate charges against Raymond Buckey, 31, and  his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, who are accused of molesting children at  their family owned preschool in Manhattan Beach.  </P> <P> The judge originally planned to announce the verdicts piecemeal, figuring it  could take months before all of the decisions are submitted.  </P> <P> His plan was motivated by the fact that no verdict is final until it is  announced in court, and with no alternate jurors remaining, a loss of even one  of the 12 deliberating jurors before the finale could invalidate the verdicts  that had been reached.  </P></p>

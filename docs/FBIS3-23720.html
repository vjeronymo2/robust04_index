			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Niksdorf, parliament secretary of SLOVO </F> KYRGYZSTANA: "At a Session of the Zhogorku Kenesh of the Kyrgyz  Republic the Government Was Confirmed. Two Vacancies Remain"]    [Text] The main event of the session's work yesterday  turned out to be the confirmation of the composition of the  Government. But this came at the end of yesterday's session. And  beginning in the morning the usual lawmaking work took place.    After the war, when the soccer players of the Moscow  "Dynamo"  team completed a triumphal tour of Great Britain, the operetta  "The Eleven Unknown", the libretto for which was created on the  basis of motifs from this trip, enjoyed great success. I was  reminded of the already forgotten operetta yesterday morning  when the speaker, M. Sherimkulov, remarked jokingly that all the  same the list of the "unknown" 11 parliamentarians, who do not  want to receive their hard-earned "deputy allowances," should be  made public.    Yes, however strange, but there turned out to be people in  the Zhogorku Kenesh, who voted against raising the salary of  deputies. That question was not on the agenda, but here the  parliamentarians turned out to be insistent and yesterday began  precisely with it. Now the people's deputies, by way of  compensation for expenses connected with deputy activity, will  receive a sum in the amount of l.5 times the minimum wage every  month. It was proposed to carry out the recalculation beginning  of December 1993. However, here, too, the deputies insisted that  they be paid "on the new plan" retroactive to June. In general,  decrees with a retroactive date are not adopted, but here a  vitally important problem was discerned.    The speaker put the question to a vote. The indicator board  illuminated the numbers: 265--"for", 11--"against",  1--abstained. It was precisely then that M. Sherimkulov  permitted himself the joking remark.    Not without reason do they say: Charity begins at home. Not  for a single proposal did our deputies vote so unanimously as  for this.    And then, when they continued the discussion of a draft law  on the election of deputies, interest in voting fell among  many--somewhere between 230 and 235 deputies took part in it.    Perhaps not all should be paid at 1.5 times the wage, but  only the most active ones? But then we get the obvious  egalitarianism, which is quite in the spirit of the laws of the  time of stagnation. Meanwhile some orators have complained that  many of their colleagues almost do not appear at evening  sessions. Precisely for this reason it is impossible to adopt a  number of important decisions. Now I understood why the deputies  put the question of their own wages in first place on Friday.    Yesterday the deputies, of course, impatiently awaited the  question of the composition of the Government. But, first of  all, they included on the agenda another question--about its  structure. Why, as is well known, a new broom sweeps in a new  way, and Premier A. Dzhumagulov, speaking on behalf of the  President, told about the innovations.    The most important ones: The Ministry of Economics and  Finance [Minekonomfinans] is being divided once again into the  Ministry of Finance and the State Committee for Economics. The  Ministry of Finance will now include the tax and customs  inspectorates, as well as the State Agency for Securities. This  will make it possible to concentrate monetary policy in the same  hands and to improve matters with budget fund receipts.    The State Committee for Economics will be engaged in  analysis  and forecasting, moreover not only long-term, but also  short-term. Its functions will also include tasks of the  structural reorganization of the economy, as well as problems of  prices and anti-monopoly policy. Speaking about today's Ministry  of Economics and Finance, the prime minister remarked bitterly:  "We lost in it essentially the second half--economics."    The government, A. Dzhumagulov continued, must provide  enormous support to small and medium-sized business and attract  entrepreneurs to the priority programs. It is necessary also to  bring together into one tight knot the questions of the  production and sale of products. For this reason, the new  structure combines into one two present-day  ministries--industry, as well as trade and material resources.  The Ministry of Power Engineering is being abolished, and the  oil, coal, and gas industries will be included in a single  Ministry of Industry.    A Ministry of Agriculture and Food is being created. Its new  tasks are evident already from the very name. The main thing is  not only to increase agricultural crops and to develop animal  husbandry, but also to put products on the table for people.    A number of government organizations are increasing their  status. The State Agency for Statistics, as in the good old  times, will be the State Committee for Statistics, but will  operate already in a new way. The State Inspectorate for  Architecture and Technical Control of Construction has also been  transformed into the State Committee [for Architecture and  Technical Control of Construction] and will carry out  coordination work in the sphere of construction, as well as a  unified town-planning policy. The State Committee for Defense  Affairs has been transformed into the Ministry of Defense. Some  departments, inluding the aviation department, are being brought  into the Ministry of Transportation. Those are the main changes.    As the prime minister said, in the near future 16-20 percent  of the administrative personnel will have to be cut.    Then the prime minister answered numerous questions from the  deputies. They came forward also with a proposal concerning the  structure of the Government. However, through the electronic  voting procedure the President's proposals were approved.    During the declared hour-long intermission of the plenary  session, the permanent commissions of the parliament discussed  the proposed candidates for members of the government. But the  intermission dragged out for another hour. Only at 18:10 did A.  Dzhumagulov step up to the rostrum, who one by one gave the  names of the members of the Government, and the people's  deputies expressed their attitude to the proposed candidates  through their vote.    The following were approved by the Parliament:    A. MATUBRAIMOV -- first vice-premier of the Government.    O. IBRAIMOV -- vice-premier.    Dzh. AMANBAYEV -- vice-premier.    A. IORDAN -- vice-premier and minister of industry, material  resources and trade.    E. OMURALIYEV -- vice-premier and chairman of the State  Property Fund.    Ya. FISHER -- vice-premier, chairman of the State Commission  for Emergency Situations and Civil Defense.    Confirmed as ministers: finance -- K. SHAKIROV; internal  affairs -- A. SUTALINOV; transportation -- S. ABLESOV; education  -- A. KAKEYEV; water management -- M. ZULPUYEV; health care --  N. KASIYEV; communications --E. BEKTENOV; labor and social  questions -- Z. KHAKIMOV; justice -- M. CHOLPONBAYEV; defense --  M. SUBANOV; culture -- Ch. BAZARBAYEV.    Confirmed as chairmen of state committees: for economics --  A. MURALIYEV; architecture and construction -- I. KADYRBEKOV;  geology --Sh. TEKENOV; national security -- A. BAKAYEV;  environmental protection -- I. MURATALIN; training of skilled  workers and entrepreneurs -- I. KASENDEYEV; physical culture and  sport --K. OSMONALIYEV; science and new technology -- K.  ZHUMALIYEV; tourism - A. MOISEYEV; statistics --Dzh. AKINEYEV.    E. Karabayev, who was proposed for the post of ministers of  foreign affairs, did not get the necessary number of votes. The  permanent commission of the parliament also did not agree with  the candidacy of B. TALGARBEKOV for the post of minister of  agriculture and food, and the speaker did not start the call for  a vote "in order not to traumatize the individual." It seems, he  acted, as always, wisely -- to act in the heat of the moment is  not worth it, and tomorrow it may be possible to come to a  general agreement.    A. Sharshenaliyev was confirmed as procurator general of the  Kyrgyz Republic.    In closing the session, M. Sherimkulov emphasized that the  parliament will work amicably with the new membership of the  Government. One may be so bold as to say, he declared, that no  black cat will cross our path.    Today the session is continuing its work.</p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LOAN SOUGHT FOR OLYMPIC CENTER SNAGS;  </P> <P> FINANCES: A STATE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE WANTS MORE INFORMATION ON $15-MILLION  LOAN FOR TRAINING CENTER IN CHULA VISTA THAT LACKS COLLATERAL.  </P> <P> Bothered by the unusual absence of collateral, members of a key legislative  budget committee Thursday balked at approving a $15-million unsecured loan to a  San Diego-based foundation hoping to build a year-round Olympic training center  in Chula Vista.  </P> <P> And, while the six-member budget conference committee requested more  information about the proposed transaction, some members of the panel predicted  that questions about the collateral could imperil the loan request.  </P> <P> "Certainly, it is not something that can easily be passed," Assemblywoman  Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) said during a break in the budget discussions.  "It falls in the area of being in trouble."  </P> <P> Added Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim), also a member of the conference committee:  "If there's no collateral, there should be no deal. Any deal without collateral  is a bad deal."  </P> <P> The state loan is to be paid in $5-million installments over the next three  years to the San Diego National Sports Training Foundation, a nonprofit group  founded by former San Diego City Councilwoman Gloria McColl and developer Ernie  Hahn. Amid much fanfare last weekend, the foundation broke ground for a  proposed $60-million, state-of-the-art training center supporters say will be a  tourist magnet on the western shore of Lower Otay Lake Reservoir in Chula  Vista.  </P> <P> The loan was mandated last year by a controversial law that provided for the  $15 million to be paid back to the state's general fund through the sale of  specialized Olympic training-center license plates.  </P> <P> Nagging doubts about the reliability of those sales caused Gov. George  Deukmejian to require the foundation to guarantee the loan as an extra  precaution before he signed the bill requiring the loan.  </P> <P> The Times revealed last week that the final terms of the loan, as negotiated by  the Department of Commerce and approved last week, fail to require the  foundation to  </P> <P> set aside assets or financial reserves to back up its written promise to pay  off the balance of the loan in 20 years.  </P> <P> And a high-ranking Commerce Department administrator acknowledged to The Times  that the "very unusual" arrangement could mean that the state would be out its  money if the foundation changes its mind or folds before the loan comes due in  20 years.  </P> <P> Hahn and foundation executive vice president David Neilsen both have maintained  that the group is committed to making sure the state is repaid. Chances that  the nonprofit foundation will default are "very, very remote," said Hahn.  </P> <P> However, legislators on the six-person budget conference committee expressed  doubts Thursday about the propriety of the loan and gave indications that it  might not pass muster, especially during a time when lawmakers are scrambling  to cut social programs to make up for a projected $3.6-billion shortfall in  next year's budget.  </P> <P> The panel, consisting of three members each from the Assembly and Senate, is  charged with the crucial task of working out the differences in budget  proposals between the two chambers of the Legislature.  </P> <P> When the subject of the Olympic training center loan came up, both Waters and  Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), chairman of the powerful  Assembly Ways and Means Committee, voiced opposition and held the item over for  further explanation about the lack of collateral.  </P> <P> Although it is a procedural step, the move by the two Assembly members bodes  ill for the loan. Since there are only six members on the panel, rejection by  any two members from either the Assembly or the Senate spells almost certain  doom for any budget proposal.  </P> <P> "I think this bears more discussion," Waters said during the break. "I think it  looks suspicious. Not good.  </P> <P> "If they don't have collateral, it would be outrageous to lend them money," she  said. "No financial institution would operate this way. I don't know why they  aren't getting private financing. It is a private, nonprofit organization."  </P> <P> Neilsen said Thursday he didn't know how the foundation would respond to the  questions about the loan by legislators. "It's still to be discussed further in  conference committee and we're hoping for the best," he said.  </P></p>

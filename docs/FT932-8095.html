			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Smith rejects electoral reform: Party leader backs manifesto commitment to referendum MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday rejected a change in the way MPs are elected, but said a referendum on elections to the House of Commons should be a Labour manifesto commitment at the next general election. In a separate move, he reduced the prospect of a damaging, perhaps unsuccessful, confrontation with the trade unions at the autumn conference over their links with the party, by proposing that individual union members should receive full party membership at a reduced rate. Another change would allow new members to take part in the selection of candidates. This would enable Mr Smith to present the plans both as one-member, one-vote for the selection of parliamentary candidates and as involving union members in the process. He also urged a substantial reduction in ordinary subscriptions as part of the campaign to increase membership. The statements came at a meeting of Labour's ruling national executive committee, which discussed the Plant committee report on constitutional changes. The report recommends that elections to the House of Commons should be on the basis of a supplementary vote system, through which second preference votes can be brought into play if no candidate achieves more than half the first preferences. Mr Smith's comments contained comfort both for reformers, who believe the referendum will keep up momentum for change, and for those who want to keep the first-past-the-post system. Almost all on both sides of the argument can agree that a possible change in the voting system should be decided by the electors rather than the elected. Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, accused Mr Smith of fudging the question of union links, and passing the buck on electoral change. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said that his admission that democratic change was on the agenda was 'a small step forward'. Labour's electoral reformers such as Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, said that it was now up to them to persuade Mr Smith and others, but the party leader's words suggested that his opinion was firm. 'As the Plant Committee acknowledges, there is no intrinsically superior electoral system and I see no reason why we should make a change unless the alternative is clearly preferable,' he said. He emphasised his resistance to any system more likely to produce coalition government. Mr Smith's plans for internal reforms appeared to be succeeding in their aim of assembling a consensus in support of the principle of one-member, one-vote in candidate selection. Mr John Prescott, a shadow cabinet member and a critic of the original plans, said yesterday's proposals endorsed the more active involvement of the unions in the party's decision-making.</p>

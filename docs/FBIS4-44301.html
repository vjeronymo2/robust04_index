			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "a.s.": "China's Premier Li Peng To Visit </F> Vienna -- Protests, While Industry Is Hoping"]    [Excerpts] Vienna -- The visit by Chinese Premier Li Peng,  starting on Wednesday [29 June], is meeting with increasing  protests in Austria that seem to be having some effect: Li Peng  has canceled a severely criticized visit to Vienna's town hall  and the signing of the Golden Book owing to his "tight  schedule." Greens Spokesman Peter Pilz, and also the Viennese  organization of the Austrian People's Party [OeVP] headed by  Bernhard Goerg, had protested the planned signing of the Golden  Book, announcing that they would boycott this act.    The Liberal Forum considers contact necessary, but says that  "especially polite gestures" are inappropriate for the one  responsible for the massacre in Tiananmen Square. Pilz called  the guest a "mass murderer of the worst kind."    Several human rights organizations have announced that they  will hold vigils and demonstrations. A vigil in front of the  Federal Chancellery has, however, been banned by the  authorities. [passage omitted]    Austria's industry is confident that Li Peng's five-day  visit  will result in orders from China. Besides ministers and state  secretaries, the 270-strong delegation accompanying Li Peng will  include 150 businessmen. Prior to the visit, the Chinese said  that there is great demand for hydraulic power (turbines) and an  interest in steel and railroad systems. A railroad agreement is  to be signed. In addition to Vienna, the Chinese delegation  will visit Linz (the nationalized Voest Alpine works) and  Salzburg.    According to the Chinese Embassy, trade with China increased  from 1.5 billion schillings in 1980 to 11.5 billion last year  (imports: 7.8 billion).    The return visit to Chancellor Vranitzky's trip to China is  the first visit to Austria by a Chinese premier.</p>

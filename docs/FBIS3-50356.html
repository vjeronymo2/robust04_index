The NSSS, which  had originally invited Zhirinovskiy to Slovenia, announced that  he would put forward new proposals for the settlement of the  crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Slovene Foreign Ministry  today denied, in a statement for HINA, reports that Liberal  Democratic Party Leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will meet Slovene  Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle during his visit to Slovenia.  The Foreign Ministry said that Zhirinovskiy's visit to  Ljubljana is private and that no meetings with any official  bodies are scheduled.</p>

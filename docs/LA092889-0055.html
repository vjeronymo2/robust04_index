			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR BOOKSHELF: HOW TO CONQUER CLUTTER BY STEPHANIE CULP (WRITER'S DIGEST  BOOKS: PAPER, $10.95).  </P> <P> America's cornucopia of plenty too often results in useless plethora, giving  rise to a book such as Stephanie Culp's creative and humorous guide.  </P> <P> Author of a previous work on ways to create order from chaos, Culp draws on her  experiences as the owner of The Organization, a business that tidies up  people's lives. She begins by describing some of her clients. One had a "fright  room"; another rented storage units for life's overflow, while Hilda's house  became so cluttered someone called the health department.  </P> <P> Among 10 important commandments are: Never procrastinate; "bequeath," while  alive and well, that jewelry, china and bibelots to those who will enjoy them;  and this above all: learn to keep everything in its place.  </P> <P> Moving swiftly through the house -- from attic to basement, assessing contents  of storage areas, drawers and closets -- Culp shows what to jettison and what  to keep. Display antiques and collections, rather than storing them. Prune the  contents of your closets frequently (When you return to Size 8, styles will  have changed); but learn to shop for clothes by choosing coordinates and  classics. Get rid of trendy kitchen appliances and gadgets (Whatever happened  to the crock pot and the yogurt or pasta maker?), and purge your mail of all  but essentials.  </P> <P> Some will find it impossible to throw out books, college papers and texts,  despite their taking up immense space, but most will agree that keeping love  letters "makes you feel young and special."  </P> <P> This guide to shaping up by shipping it out would make a fine gift for  professional pack rats, nostalgia buffs or folks whose possessions have gotten  way out of control.

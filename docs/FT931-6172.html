			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / OECD urges reform of Danish benefits A 'SUSTAINABLE and significant reduction' in Denmark's unemployment rate, currently running at 11.7 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis, cannot be achieved without reforms of the unemployment benefit system, according to the OECD's annual report on the Danish economy. A benefit rate of 90 per cent of wages for those at the lower end of the wage scale is too generous and reduces the incentive to seek work, while the benefit period - up to nine years - is too long, says the report. Changing the system is politically difficult, but 'the pay-off in tackling the problems of high income support and of enforcement would be large in terms of fewer people out of work, higher potential output, and improved public finances,' it says. The report is optimistic about Danish growth potential. Policies which have produced an inflation rate of only about 1.5 per cent and a balance of payments surplus close to 3 per cent of gross domestic product have laid the foundations for the country 'to resume a sustainable path of further growth,' it says. But it warns against further relaxation of fiscal policy, which was loosened considerably by the budget for 1993. The OECD forecasts a 2.1 per cent GDP growth rate for Denmark in 1993, which is slightly higher than the latest Danish government forecast and reflects a higher OECD forecast for export growth.</p>

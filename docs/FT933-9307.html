			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Japan urges beef import cuts to aid farmers JAPAN'S agriculture ministry is trying to stem a sharp fall in domestic beef prices by curbing imports of beef, prompting concerns among leading beef exporting countries including the US and Australia. The ministry has asked domestic meat traders to cut back on excessive purchases of foreign beef, and to import in an 'orderly' manner. While a ministry official said that the request was not 'administrative guidance' (an unwritten directive from bureaucrats), a US official criticised the action as inappropriate, with influences other than market forces affecting prices. 'The move goes against the principle of the (1988 beef and citrus) agreement,' he said. The action comes as the new prime minister Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, who is calling for more transparency in government dealings, takes office. It indicates that the old ways of the country's bureaucrats will die hard. The Japanese beef market was opened in 1988 under strong pressure from the US, with quotas abolished in 1991. Imports for the year to last March surged 29 per cent from the previous year's level, to 423,000 tonnes. The tariff cut at the begining of April from 60 per cent to 50 per cent further boosted import growth by a year-on-year 30 per cent during the April to June quarter. Agriculture ministry officials say wholesale beef prices have fallen by as much as 60 per cent since the market was opened. The recent fall in consumer confidence has prompted a shift from expensive Japanese beef to cheaper imports, and the higher yen has further lowered the price of foreign beef. Although Mr Hosokawa has stressed the shift to a consumer-oriented market from the supplier-focused tradition, Japanese beef producers have considerable political clout and have been pressuring politicians, particularly during the recent election campaign. The ministry official said import restrictions could not be ruled out, if a further decline in prices threatened the welfare of Japanese beef producers. However, US and Australian officials insisted that Japan had no grounds for imposing import restraints, as the agreements on beef included safeguard measures to implement restrictions only if the import level climbed to 680,000 tonnes.</p>

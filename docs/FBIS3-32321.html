Once again, the group demands the  return of Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power in Haiti and denounces  the situation prevailing at the Senate of the Republic. Firmin  Jean-Louis is the Senate president and cannot be dismissed  arbitrarily, according to the group calling for a return to  order at the Senate.    [Begin unidentified spokesman recording, in Creole] We in  the  Fort-Saint-Clair Group feel very indignant at the national  conference that the Committee of Actions for National  Reconciliation wants to hold on 6 and 7 February. We are also  opposed to all demonstrations scheduled for 4 February by the  macoute sector that never works in the interest of the people in  a country where human rights are not protected and where the  criminals who staged the coup d'etat are using violence. This is  why we in the Fort St. Clair group say first that the United  States should stop stalling for time while speaking of the  Governors Island and the New York pacts. We unreservedly support  a demonstration to be held on 6 and 7 February by the masses and  all worthy military so democracy can be established in Haiti  with President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in power.

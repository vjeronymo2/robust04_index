At the beginning of his joint news conference with Austrian  President Thomas Klestil following one hour of talks, Mubarak  remarked that Egypt and Austria maintain close cooperation. He  said Egypt looks forward to further cooperation between the two  friendly states.    In his statement, President Mubarak welcomed the Austrian  president, noting that the two countries have similar views on  several issues. He referred to the role played by former  Chancellor Bruno Kreisky in backing the Middle East peace  efforts.    In his statement, the Austrian president thanked Mubarak for  inviting him to visit Egypt. He affirmed that Austria plays an  important role in pushing the Middle East peace process ahead by  participating in the working groups stemming from the  multilaterals.    President Klestil noted that Austria was among the first  states to recognize the PLO as the sole legitimate  representative of the Palestinian people. He stressed that his  country will continue to develop its relations with Egypt and  Arab states within the framework of the policy established by  Chancellor Kreisky and former President Kurt Waldheim.    He remarked that inviting Yasir 'Arafat to dine with them  last night was a fine gesture by President Mubarak. He said he  hoped he would have the chance to meet Israeli Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres in Cairo this evening.    President Mubarak was asked about the Bosnian crisis and  recent developments there and whether the West has been hesitant  about taking any measure. He said: All I can say is that  events in the former Yugoslavia and the onslaught against the  Bosnian people are primarily the responsibility of the European  Community.    Mubarak added that he had expressed this view often. He  emphasized the need for everyone to work collectively to stop  violence against Muslims in this part of the world, because if  the issue is left unresolved, it will be a time bomb threatening  all Europe.    Touching on the same issue, the Austrian president said: We  discussed the former Yugoslavia and expressed our fear that this  problem might be an example that could be repeated elsewhere if  the world accepts the imposition of military force.    Touching on violence in Egypt, President Mubarak remarked  that extremism is not exclusive to Egypt, but exists worldwide.  He added that the media in Europe and elsewhere are blowing the  little events in Egypt out of proportion.    The president said these incidents are under control. We are  not afraid; we face things very firmly because they are a  handful of criminals with no link with Islam. There is no  relation whatsoever between what is happening and Islam, he  stated.    The president added: A look at the world map will show us  that terrorism occurs every day and everywhere. But the media  focus on events in Egypt as if such incidents are limited to  Egypt, which is not true.    In the context, the Austrian president affirmed that  terrorism exists everywhere. He referred to terrorist assaults  in his country lately.    President Mubarak was asked about the progress achieved in  the Middle East peace talks and whether a breakthrough is  foreseeable, particularly between 'Arafat and Peres. He said:  This is a 50-year old problem; it is not easy to solve overnight.    He hoped the ongoing talks between the Palestinian  delegation  led by 'Arafat and the Israeli delegation led by Peres would  achieve results by the end of the week. He said negotiations  are the only way to reach an agreement.    President Mubarak hopes 1994 will be the year the Middle  East  problem is solved.    Asked about developing bilateral ties with Egypt,  particularly in the economic field, the Austrian president  replied that his accompanying delegation includes  representatives from and leaders of industrial firms, such as  the president of Siemens Communications. He referred to the  signing of an agreement today to complete the development,  improvement, and modernization of the telephone communications  network. He explained that today's agreement complements one  signed during the time of late President Anwar al-Sadat and  former Chancellor Bruno Kreisky.    Touching on tourism as a primary source of economic  development, the Austrian president said his country will  continue to encourage Austrian tourism in Egypt and will not  restrict it. He remarked that the small, isolated incidents  that occur once in a while will not affect this tourism.    The Austrian president noted that Austrian and Egyptian  universities are cooperating in scientific research and student  exchange. He also noted close cultural exchanges.    President Mubarak was asked about news agency reports of  warnings by the so-called Islamic Group to commit terrorist acts  against tourists and foreigners. He replied: We provide the  necessary protection to everyone on Egyptian soil, Egyptians and  foreigners alike.    The president said anyone could fax papers to a news agency,  reference to the al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah statement sent to AFP  on 7 February, warning foreigners to leave Egypt, but he  affirmed that the security bodies are taking all the necessary  measures to confront this and taking precautions against every  possibility.    Asked about developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Austrian  president said he shares Egypt's view that the problem is "a big  tragedy." He stressed that the world must face up to this  problem or tragedy and refuse to partition a UN member state or  wipe it off the world map by military force just to satisfy  ethnic ambition. He remarked that Egypt and Austria hope this  problem will be solved.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work (3): Advance details of the next issue - The review will look at users' experiences in the areas of computer aided design and computer aided manufacturing, (CAD/CAM). The 'hot topic' will be document and image processing / Winter 1992 SPECIALIST writers will examine developments in the following areas: CAD/CAM: Computers have become an essential part, if not the main tool, in the designer's toolkit. The earliest computer aided design systems demonstrated the benefits of being able to view a design in 3D before it was built. Such models are now an integrated part of the manufacturing process. Software At Work seeks sites which have linked their CAD systems to other elements in the manufacturing cycle, for spin-off benefits in production, documentation, and quality control. Online Database: This has become an essential reference tool for those who need instant, accurate information. The problem is usually not a lack of information, but too much of it, so software for text retrieval and selective searches has to work hand-in-hand with the database. Software At Work seeks users who have integrated external online databases with their in-house systems. Hot topic: document and image processing: desktop publishing technology is now used enthusiastically by many companies outside the province of typesetting and publishing. Now document and image processing are following in becoming affordable technology for any organisation with the problem of archiving paperwork. Looking further ahead, topics will include: In the March 1993 issue: Project management systems. Electronic data interchange, (EDI). Rapid development systems, (Unix and mid-range systems). In the June 1993 issue: Desktop publishing. Facilities management. Electronic funds transfer and point of sale systems. In the September 1993 issue: City and dealing room systems. Geographical information systems, (GIS). In the December 1993 issue: Integrated accounting systems. Disaster recovery (software/data).

			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (1): Contrasts on every corner - First impressions / Tom Burns finds that contradictions colour Barcelona CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS was the most famous traveller to reach Barcelona. The statue that honours him at the harbour sums up the city's contradictory nature. On his return from his first voyage to the New World, Columbus went straight to Barcelona where his patrons King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella had temporarily established their travelling court. But while Columbus - who presented the monarchs with slaves and parrots but not much gold - announced that he had opened up the westward route to the Indies, the harbour front statue to the discoverer has him looking in the opposite direction, pointing east with his right arm towards his Italian homeland. Barcelona should probably not have a monument to Columbus at all. His discovery shifted the whole direction of Spanish policy towards the Atlantic and away from the Mediterranean. Barcelona itself was closed off from the New World riches by the monopoly established in Seville. Barcelona's contrasts are manifested in the emotional swings of its inhabitants as they move between seny and rauxa. The Catalan word seny has no Castilian Spanish equivalent and it means a mixture of business acumen and commercial cunning. Rauxa, another wholly Catalan term, means boisterous anarchy. Barcelona has the most sober entrepreneurs in Spain but also the most zany and outrageous experimental theatre. La Vanguardia, the city's long-established quality newspaper, mixes excellent reporting and thoughtful analysis with columns of luridly explicit small advertisements informing the reader on who to 'contact', how to 'relax' and what can be roughly expected in terms of cost and benefit. The city's ability to be all things to all people extends to its political institutions. Barcelona's municipal council is controlled by the socialist party while the Catalan home rule government, which has its seat in the city, is dominated by local nationalists whose ideological bent is decidedly conservative. The city hall and the Generalitat, the home rule government headquarters, occupy opposite ends of the Sant Jaume square in the heart of old Barcelona and eye each other suspiciously, the former from its the neo-classical facade, the latter from its renaissance front. On important occasions, such as the Olympics, politicians of both camps and institutions bury their differences but at other times, petty squabbling is the norm. Ever since elections started to be held again in Spain's post-Franco democracy, Barcelona's residents have voted for the socialists in municipal polls, for the nationalists in the local government ones and have had both parties running neck and neck in general elections. This entrenched dual track voting pattern could be an example of a checks-and balances seny but it could just as easily be demonstration of the rauxa syndrome that wants to keep everything confused. The present day traveller to Barcelona will find contradictions on every corner and in every restaurant. The local cuisine is adept at placing opposites, such as lobster and chicken, in the same stew pot and accompanying delicate fish grills with sauces - romescu and allioli - that are calculated to blow the roof off a normal mouth. From corner to corner, Barcelona architecturally embraces the modernist fantasy of a Gaudi and the functionalism of a Mies van der Rohe, tight slums that could be Naples and a grid street system punctured by solidly bourgeois octagonal blocks with a Parisian feel to them. The city's pace can be as fast as the traffic whizzing along its ring-roads and as indolent as the crowds who amble along Las Ramblas. Barcelona's contradictory character emerges in the tension between the narrow Catalan provincialism that dominates so much of its city life and the bravado of its European gateway claims. Its past has had it alternatively squashed by Madrid and Castile, only to pick itself up again. Typically, Catalonia's national day commemorates an 18th century defeat  - one of the several occasions when its local privileges and national identity were trampled on. Now the city is riding triumphantly high. Astonishingly, after all the building that went on before the Olympics, when the city was turned inside out, building is still going on, although now it is mostly shopping precincts that are going up rather than sports stadiums. And yet there are doubts. The city council says it can cope with its massive debts but the markets may need a certain amount of convincing. Huge inflows of direct foreign investment appeared in the late 1980s but the likes of Volkswagen and Nissan are having second thoughts. Barcelona's see-saw history suggests that it will emerge from whatever troubles lie ahead. Certainly its infrastructure is now magnificently equipped to withstand a recession. If not a single peseta was spent on the city for the rest of the century, it would still look good in the year 2000. The business visitor should take Barcelona's duality with an open mind. There will be plenty of seny in the daytime and endless opportunity for rauxa after hours.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "bog, mh, rk": "Coalition Does Not Rule Out </F> Another Debate on Signpost Law"]    [Excerpt] Bratislava--[passage omitted] Vojtech Bugar,  chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH],  said yesterday that he had informed the coalition parties about  the view of ethnic Hungarian representatives that the coalition  has not yet fulfilled its promise to set up an independent  department for ethnic minorities' schools within the framework  of the Ministry of Education and Science. "Not only has this  not happened in the past three months, but last week we gained  access to a ministry paper about the ministry's structure, which  does not foresee such a department even in the future," Vojtech  Bugar stressed. As transpired from Bugar's words, Prime  Minister Jozef Moravcik was not aware of this matter. The  Hungarian parties will receive the coalition's explanation on 8  June.</p>

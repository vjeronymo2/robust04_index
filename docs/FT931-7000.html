			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / The ICI Demerger: Exceptionals leave ICI Pounds 384m in red BATTERED BY the long recession and reorganisation costs, Imperial Chemical Industries, yesterday reported a Pounds 384m pre-tax loss for the year to December 31, following exceptional charges of Pounds 949m. Pre-tax profits before exceptional items fell 28 per cent from Pounds 789m to Pounds 565m as demand and prices softened for many products. The results were prepared according to the new FRS 3 accounting standard. The pre-tax profits, which compare with Pounds 843m in 1991, were achieved on a turnover of Pounds 12.1bn (Pounds 12.5bn). The board maintained the full-year dividend at 55p with a second interim of 34p, although it was paid from reserves. The exceptional charge was to cover restructuring activities, including disposals, closures, write-downs of certain asset values, a re-assessment of environmental liabilities and demerger costs. Rationalisation costs were Pounds 516m, including Pounds 313m for employee-related costs, principally severance, and Pounds 160m for asset write downs and provisions. A further provision of Pounds 148m was made for environmental costs, particularly for cleaning up soil and groundwater in the US. Loss on sale and closure of operations provisions were Pounds 191m. Reorganisation costs for the demerger, including professional fees, product registration and labelling costs, amounted to Pounds 75m. Lower selling prices and disposals accounted respectively for 1 per cent and 3 per cent of the fall in sales. Favourable exchange rates increased sales by 1 per cent. UK turnover fell Pounds 350m, equivalent to 14 per cent of sales. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman said the results reflected difficult trading conditions throughout 1992. He added that the recession in the UK, which had now lasted three years, had been one of the deepest since the 1930s. 'Signs of recovery from recession are patchy, but lower interest rates, a more competitive pound, low UK inflation and some indications of the US markets picking up plus the major restructuring efforts should ensure a better year ahead for ICI and Zeneca.' On a pro forma basis reflecting the pending split, trading profits before exceptional items at the newly-formed Zeneca, which includes ICI's drugs, agrochemicals and seeds, and specialities businesses, fell from Pounds 682m to Pounds 587m. Sales increased from Pounds 3.93bn to Pounds 3.98bn. Pharmaceuticals trading profits fell from Pounds 536m to Pounds 488m on turnover of Pounds 1.61bn (Pounds 1.55bn). Sir Denys said this was mainly due to the effects of generic competition against Tenormin, Zeneca's heart drug, the US patents for which recently expired. Sales had fallen by between 40 and 50 per cent instead of the expected 30 to 35 per cent. Agrochemicals and seeds trading profits dropped from Pounds 145m to Pounds 85m on turnover of Pounds 1.29bn (Pounds 1.32bn). The results were affected by intense price competition in the US and reduced volumes in Europe. Sales in eastern Europe had fallen about 30 per cent last year, while the reform of the common agricultural policy had also had an impact. Mr David Barnes, Zeneca chief executive, warned the worst of the impact of the CAP reforms were yet to come, with a possible 3 to 5 per cent fall in the European market this year. Specialities operating profits fell from Pounds 29m to Pounds 26m on sales of Pounds 936m (Pounds 916m). Mr Barnes said the colours business had had a difficult year. Zeneca's results included losses of Pounds 12m (loss of Pounds 28m) on sales of Pounds 148m (Pounds 142m) under the heading of trading and miscellaneous. The new ICI's trading profits fell from Pounds 324m to Pounds 148m on turnover fell from Pounds 9.43bn to Pounds 8.89bn. A breakdown of trading profits showed the paints division fell from Pounds 119m to Pounds 115m on turnover unchanged at Pounds 1.58bn, while explosives rose to Pounds 59m (Pounds 56m) on Pounds 549m (Pounds 556m), and regional businesses were Pounds 8m (Pounds 18m) on Pounds 1.35bn (Pounds 1.39bn). However, there were losses at materials of Pounds 25m (Pounds 13m) on Pounds 1.86bn (Pounds 2.01bn) and industrial chemicals of Pounds 17m (Pounds 144m profits) on Pounds 3.55bn (Pounds 3.88bn). Earnings per share before exceptional items fell from 69.2p to 48.8p, or losses of 79.9p (76.4p earnings) after exceptionals. Debt rose to Pounds 2.3bn, for gearing of 53.5 per cent, from Pounds 1.58bn a year earlier. Sir Denys blamed the recession, slower than expected asset disposals and the impact of the exceptional charge.</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Blackwood Hodge acquisition boosts BM THE BENEFITS of buying Blackwood Hodge, the international distributor of earth-moving equipment, showed through in BM Group's results for the six months to December 31. The company also announced it had taken a controlling stake in British Building and Engineering Appliances. Pre-tax profit at the construction equipment distributor and engineer advanced by 28 per cent to Pounds 17.3m (Pounds 13.5m) on turnover of Pounds 229.3m (Pounds 148.8m). Interest costs rose by nearly Pounds 2m to Pounds 5.68m. Blackwood, which was incurring losses before the takeover, was included for six months instead of about seven weeks. Mr Carl Young, finance director, said that 50 per cent of the group's first-half sales and Pounds 4.5m of profit could be attributed to it. The picture was, however, complicated by the sale of BM products, such as Mustang skid steer loaders and Benford dumpers, through the Blackwood network. The UK's share of group turnover had fallen to 35 per cent. It would rise to about 50 per cent with the inclusion of Thomas Robinson, the engineering group acquired three weeks ago in a Pounds 41m all-share deal. Mr Roger Shute, chairman, said that in North America, Mustang had increased its US sales by 55 per cent. Canada was showing signs of recovery. Net debt stood at about Pounds 88m at the end of December. After the Pounds 60m rights issue accompanying the Robinson deal, gearing had fallen below 45 per cent. Diluted earnings rose to 13.3p (11.3p). The interim dividend goes up to 2.1p (1.6p). BM intends to inject its UK building products activities - approaching Pounds 50m of annual turnover - into BB and EA, where it has paid Pounds 2.5m for a 58 per cent family stake, taking its holding to 83.7 per cent. It has to extend its 355p a share offer to other shareholders, but only plans to retain 75 per cent. COMMENT When BM bought the struggling Blackwood Hodge, there was concern that it would be dragged down by it. The reverse has happened, partly because of the admirable ruthlessness applied to Blackwood's costs and partly because of the scope provided by acquisition accounting for shoving the write-offs below the line. Blackwood could not afford to attack its languishing UK operation because of unrelieved ACT, BM has done it and can tap tax losses. The commercial synergy has proved just as strong, with a new world of outlets opened up to BM's manufactured goods. Thomas Robinson, more of a ragbag, may take longer to bear fruit. For the full year, a repeat of last year's second-half performance, plus further savings, should see pre-tax profit rise to between Pounds 40m and Pounds 45m (Pounds 34.1m), a prospective p/e of 13 on yesterday's close of 405p. As a certain amount has to be taken on trust - there was, for instance, no divisional breakdown - this seems high enough until a new wave of analysts has been convinced of BM's, and not just Mr Shute's, merits.</p>

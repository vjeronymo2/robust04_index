			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SERVICES CUT, NO TALKS SET IN HAWAII HOTEL STRIKE  </P> <P> A strike at 11 major Hawaii hotels is expected to drag on for at least a week,  and replacement workers are being flown to the islands to make beds and meals  for thousands of tourists.  </P> <P> "We're prepared to operate for weeks if need be," said William Crawford,  executive director of the Council of Hawaii Hotels.  </P> <P> Contract talks between the council and the Hotel Employees and Restaurant  Employees Union broke off Saturday.  </P> <P> "I saved all year for this vacation, and I want my bed made," said Cindy  Parisi, 23, who is paying $275 a night at the Hilton Hawaiian Village.  </P> <P> Room service was suspended at most hotels, some restaurants were closed and  supervisors scrambled to check in guests and clean rooms Sunday.  </P> <P> Federal mediator Frank Schoeppel predicted Sunday it would be "at least a week"  before any new talks are scheduled.  </P> <P> About 7,500 workers are on strike in the dispute over a wage and benefit  package. The walkout affects 9,300 rooms in Waikiki and at three hotels on  other islands, about 16% of the state's total hotel inventory. It is the first  major strike in 24 years in Waikiki.  </P> <P> The hotels involved in the strike on Oahu are the Hawaiian Village, the Hyatt  Regency Waikiki, the Ilikai, the Kahala Hilton, the Sheraton Waikiki, the  Sheraton Moana Surfrider, the Princess Kaiulani and the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.  On the neighbor islands, the Sheraton Kauai, Sheraton Maui and Kona Hilton are  also struck.  </P> <P> Management said it offered a 7% annual increase in wages and benefits, but the  union said the offer was worth only 5.5%. The union is asking for a 10% hike.  </P></p>

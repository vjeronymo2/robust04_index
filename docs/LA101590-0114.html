			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOLLAR DIVES AGAINST YEN ON JAPAN EXCHANGE  </P> <P> The dollar dived against the Japanese yen in Tokyo today as investors became  more pessimistic about the U.S. economy, traders said.  </P> <P> The dollar closed at 128.15 yen, down 1.15 yen from Friday's close of 129.30  yen.  </P> <P> It opened at 128.55 yen and ranged between 127.95 and 128.72.  </P> <P> The dollar's closing was its lowest since 127.63 yen on March 6, 1989.  </P> <P> "The dollar has become less attractive because of growing pessimism over the  U.S. economic performance," a Mitsubishi Bank dealer said.  </P> <P> "The dollar will quickly fall further once it breaks the 128-yen line, which is  a resistance point," said Mamoru Tabata, a dealer with the Mitsui Taiyo Kobe  Bank.  </P> <P> Bank of Japan Gov. Yasushi Mieno told a news conference, however, that the  market sees little possibility of the dollar plunging.  </P> <P> Mieno also said there had been unavoidable stock price declines reflecting a  correction of the "bubble effect" of asset prices.  </P> <P> The Tokyo market's leading index has declined this year from a record high  exceeding 38,900 points at the end of 1989.  </P> <P> But on the stock exchange today, the 225-issue Nikkei stock average surged  719.04 points, or 3.21%, closing at 23,109.20. The index fell 195.47 points  Friday.  </P> <P> Traders said the yen's strength, stability in bond prices and relative calm in  the Persian Gulf region contributed to today's surge in the Nikkei.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] After the conclusion of discussions on the Voice of  Resistance of the Black Cockerel yesterday, negotiators from the  government and the National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] are now discussing the swearing in of UNITA  deputies in Parliament.    It is known that UNITA deputies who are presently in  Parliament face the risk of losing their seats to new elements  trusted by that organization. This stand does not agree,  however, with the law in force in the country. The mediators  have presented a proposal which does not differ much from the  government's views. It now remains to be seen what arguments  the UNITA representatives will present on 6 June.    Angola Radio Nacional learned that mediator Alioune Blondin  Beye has been holding contacts with UNITA men with a view to  finding in advance an effective stance [words indistinct]. In  brief, it was a day without substantial changes in the peace  talks, despite appeals from the international community to speed  up the process in order to end the war in the country and reduce  the suffering of the people, particularly the less privileged.</p>

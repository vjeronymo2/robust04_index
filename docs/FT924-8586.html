			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD held under pressure on the London bullion market, but futures were trading at lifetime lows on Comex at midday. The New York market was depressed by perceptions that inflation had been tamed and a widespread belief that global economies would remain in the doldrums. London dealers said the market had been battered by apparently programmed sales of central bank gold in roughly 50,000 ounce lots over the past two months and now by panic hedging from producers - even at current low price levels. London COCOA futures hit a new high in early trading before turning tail to end around Pounds 8 a tonne lower in near months after a reasonably busy day. 'I think the market's just a bit tired. It's run-up a lot in the last week and it needs a bit of consolidation,' one dealer said. By midday New York's arabica COFFEE market had recovered on news that German statistician FO Licht expects world production to fall to 93.32m bags in 1992-93, compared with 101.99m bags last year.

			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais takes firmer hold in Milan CREDIT LYONNAIS, the big French bank, has strengthened its position in Italy by reinforcing its hold on Banca Lombarda, a small 23-branch Milanese bank. Credit Lyonnais, which already owns 30 per cent of the bank, is buying 49 per cent of Geinvest, a holding company which owns 26.2 per cent of the holding company controlling Banca Lombarda. The latest acquisition may represent a further step in a strategy to develop the Credit Lyonnais presence in Italy. The French bank is already one of the biggest foreign players in Italian retail banking because of its controlling stake in Credito Bergamasco, a big Bergamo-based regional bank, in which it now owns 58 per cent of the shares. Although Credito Bergamasco, which is highly profitable, has been expanding rapidly in northern Italy, it remains poorly represented in the Milan area - where Banca Lombarda is strongest. A spokesman for Credit Lyonnais, which has not revealed the price of its latest purchase, declined to comment on whether it aimed to gain full control of Banca Lombarda eventually. Banca Lombarda, which is controlled by a group of long-established Milanese families, had a loan book of L654bn (Dollars 424m) last year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a military source, the U.S.  imperialists and the South Korean puppets on 30 March again  staged a joint air war exercise for Northward aggression.    This war exercise, which included ground force support, air  strikes, long-distance airlifts, and surprise attacks was  carried out in the skies above Pyongchang, Yangpyong, Oeyon  islet, and Muju as the operational stage.    F-16 nuclear-loaded fighter bombers, pursuit-assault planes,  electronic jamming planes, which were mobilized from overseas  bases, and more than 380 various military airplanes from the  U.S. Air Force in South Korea and from the puppet Air Force,  were mobilized.    This war exercise, staged frantically under the support of a  EA-6 electronic jamming airplane, was a dangerous playing with  fire designed to promote actual combat capabilities for  cooperative surprise attack [hyopdong kisuptagyok siljon  nungryok] for a Northward aggression, together with airplane  wings deployed in U.S. bases in Japan and the Pacific, and  airplanes from the 7th U.S. Air Force based in South Korea and  from the puppet Air Force.    KC-135 refueling airplanes, which flew in South Korea from  overseas bases timed to coincide with this war exercise,  refueled scores of airplanes that ran amok with air war  exercises by making shuttle flights between Taehuksan Island and  Kyongyolbi Yolto.    C-141 and C-130 transport planes airlifted large aggressor  Armed Forces from U.S. bases in the Pacific to the U.S. air base  in South Korea. The airlifted troops and lethal weapons were  deployed in operational zones.    In the meantime, the South Korean puppets frantically ran  amok with exercises of a Northward war of aggression on the  ground, in the sea, and in the air, under the U.S. imperialists'  instigation.    On 30 March, the South Korean puppets deployed hundreds of  armed hooligans and scores of armored vehicles in the area  adjacent to the Demilitarized Zone [DMZ] near Konan-ri, Piari,  Yanggu county, South Korean Kangwon Province in the eastern  sector of the front. In addition, they mobilized and deployed  large-caliber artillery units in Hoengsan-ri, Yonchon County,  Kyonggi Province in the western sector of the front.    That day, the puppet 105-mm artillery unit, occupying fire  positions in Mayong-ri, Chorwon County in South Korean Kangwon  Province and in Hapsu-ri, Yonchon County, Kyonggi Province,  fired about 70 artillery shells at an area near the DMZ by the  Military Demarcation Line. The armed hooligans of the puppet  Army, occupying combat positions in Chungsa-ri, Yonchon County,  indiscriminately fired some 800 bullets from large-caliber  machine guns, thus displaying war hysterics.    About 10 transport planes of the puppet Army, which flew in  the air above Uijongbu, Kyonggi Province that day, created a  bloodthirsty war atmosphere by dropping commando troops one  after another, and the wings of armored helicopters and  transport helicopters, which were mobilized in the air above  Paju, Pochon, and Yonchon in Kyonggi Province, ran amok with  airlifting war supplies to commando operations.    Fighter-bombers, pursuit-assault planes, and observation  planes of the puppet Army, which were mobilized in the air above  the sea off Kunsan, also ran wild with marine attacks and  landing support.    The military airplanes, which participated in various air  war  exercises staged in the air above South Korea against the  Northern half of the republic on 30 March, alone numbered as  many as some 600 planes.    The war maneuvers of the U.S. imperialists and the South  Korean puppets, which are becoming more grave with each passing  day, clearly demonstrate how recklessly the rascals are running  amok to crush our Republic with armed forces.</p>

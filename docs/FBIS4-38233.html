			<p>BFN     [Text] Security organs have thwarted a terrorist scheme  planned abroad to carry out sabotage activities against some  installations and assassinate a number of personalities in  Egypt. The execution of this plan was entrusted to some  terrorists who were trained in foreign countries. The State  Security Investigations' Bureau succeeded in arresting some  members who were attempting to infiltrate through an Egyptian  port. It seized all their documents and files, as well as the  passports the defendants used in their travels to numerous  countries.    A ranking security source told AL-AHRAM correspondent Ahmad  Musa that confessions by the terrorist group revealed that their  leadership, which has fled abroad, dispatched them inside the  country after the successful security blows dealt to terrorist  leaders 'Awad Siyam and Tal'at Yasin Hammam. The members of  this group were asked to convey very detailed instructions to  the terrorist leaders' aides inside, as well as to transfer  funds. These funds were to be used to carry out terrorist  operations to make the terrorist presence in the arena known.</p>

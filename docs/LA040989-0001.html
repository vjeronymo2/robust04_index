			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> Hayley Mills reprises her dual roles as twins in Part 1 of Parent Trap III (NBC  Sunday at 7 p.m.), a new romantic comedy airing in two parts on "The Magical  World of Disney." (In the original 1961 "Parent Trap," Mills also played  identical twins.)  </P> <P> The lush, elegant Vincente Minnelli-Lerner &amp; Loewe musical Gigi airs on  Channel 13 Sunday at 8 p.m. with Leslie Caron, Louis Jourdan and Maurice  Chevalier.  </P> <P> Lee Remick, Marlee Matlin and Michael O'Keefe star in Bridge to Silence (CBS  Sunday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie about a hearing-impaired woman (Matlin, on  the cover with Remick) who must rebuild her shattered life after a tragic  accident.  </P> <P> Debbie Reynolds and Jerry Orbach join Raymond Burr and Barbara Hale in Perry  Mason: The Case of the Musical Murder (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.), another new TV  movie about a young stage manager (Jim Metzler) accused of murdering the  director (Dwight Schultz) of a Broadway-bound musical in which Reynolds plays  the leading lady.  </P> <P> Romancing the Stone (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is the delightful 1984 comedy in  which a dowdy author of best-selling romances is plunged into adventures beyond  her wildest imaginings -- with Michael Douglas as her breezy, rugged leading  man. Director Robert Zemeckis and writer Diane Thomas have pulled off an  amusing reworking of genre conventions.  </P> <P> The Goodbye Girl (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) is quintessential Neil Simon:  slick, sentimental, well turned out and entertaining. In this diverting 1977  comedy directed by Herbert Ross, Marsha Mason plays a Broadway dancer whose  male friends have a chronic tendency to bid her farewell -- until her latest ex  sublets his portion to struggling actor Richard Dreyfuss (who won an Oscar for  his comic portrayal), with whom she immediately clashes. You can take it from  there.  </P> <P> Resurrection (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a captivating, unjustly  neglected 1980 film dealing with the possibility of healing by love, which is  not precisely the same thing as healing by faith. Ellen Burstyn plays a woman  who recovers from a near-fatal auto accident and is transformed by strange new  powers, including the power to heal. Written by Lewis John Carlino and directed  by Daniel Petrie, the film also features Sam Shepard and Eva Le Galliene, who  are as impressive as Burstyn.  </P> <P> Whoopi Goldberg stars as a pool-hustling mother in the romantic comedy Kiss  Shot (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie that co-stars Dorian Harewood,  Dennis Franz and Tasha Scott.  </P> <P> Hardbodies (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), whose title refers to the "scores  of sexy girls" who hang out at the local beaches, is a crass, hard-boiled,  voyeuristic 1984 movie ostensibly geared to the teen market. Sorrells Pickard,  Gary Wood and Michael Rapport star as three middle-aged men who rent a beach  house to surf, sun and score; the result is a muddled and infantile male  fantasy.  </P> <P> The Return of the Shaggy Dog, Part 1 (ABC Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a 1987 TV  movie sequel to the 1959 Disney hit. This time villains steal a magic ring  which has the power to turn a young attorney into a big dog. The film concludes  next Thursday.  </P> <P> The Alamo (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is the ponderous 1960 Western epic in  which John Wayne directed as well as starred. The attack on the fortress is  impressive but it takes a long while to get to it.  </P> <P> The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m.) is a  tragicomic meditation on the Baker Street duo, in which Billy Wilder shrewdly  fills in the spots that Conan Doyle left blank: Holmes' failures, his sex life  and the motives for his cocaine habit. Robert Stephens is Sherlock, Colin  Blakely is Watson, and the movie is one of Wilder's least cynical and most  romantic, a sadly elegant celebration of gaslit sleuthery. All this comes  through even though the 1970 film, a prime candidate for restoration, was cut  from its roadshow length prior to release.  </P> <P> Edgar Ulmer's 1945 film noir classic Detour (Channel 28 Friday at 11:30 p.m.)  is a perfect late-night show, one of the most relentlessly intense  psychological thrillers ever filmed. Tom Neal and Ann Savage star.  </P> <P> Not to be missed: Kevin Brownlow and David Gill's "The Unknown Chaplin"  (Channel 28 Saturday at 9 p.m.), a three-hour study which allows us to see how  the master painstakingly developed his gags.  </P> <P> Tarzan in Manhattan (CBS Saturday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie in which the  Edgar Rice Burroughs character searches New York for hunters who kidnaped  Cheetah.  </P></p>

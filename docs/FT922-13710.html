			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Firms make plans for summer lull in work ACCOUNTANCY firms are gearing up for a substantial lull in work during the summer with a variety of tactics to keep their employees occupied. Some are placing extra emphasis on staff taking all their holidays during the late summer, when the volume of audit work is traditionally lowest. Others are seconding them to other departments or giving them projects for their firms' internal use. Managers have been pincered by two effects of the recession: a decline in some areas of business activity, and - because there are fewer jobs elsewhere - reluctance by younger staff to leave. With most companies' financial year-ends in December and March, audit staff will be kept busy into June. Many of the more junior accountants are likely to be at a loose end for the subsequent three or four months. Mr Paul Woodrow, public relations manager at Robson Rhodes, said: 'There has been a vacuum in work for auditors during the summer since Noah was a boy.' But he agreed that some areas of work had been lower this year than in the past. Mr Richard Owen, national director of personnel at Touche Ross, said that while audit work might be heading for a lull, insolvency work was 'insanely busy'. KPMG Peat Marwick took what the firm describes as 'the most definitive solution' to the problem of spare capacity last month when it made more than 300 audit staff redundant. Meanwhile Price Waterhouse has given senior personnel discretion to allow their staff to take unpaid leave, lifting a rule that no employee can take more than two weeks a year of unpaid leave in lieu of overtime. Other firms point out that the late summer is the period when students should be spending the most time training and studying for their accountancy exams.</p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / French budget aims to reflate economy THE French government yesterday unveiled its 1994 budget plan to give the recession-hit economy a modest boost, using tax cuts and incentives to encourage investment and consumption and privatisation proceeds to reduce the budget deficit. But Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, admitted the government had reduced its estimate of recovery in consumer spending next year to 0.7 per cent, even though he insisted that France's economic situation 'is not getting any worse'. The government is sticking to its forecast that the economy will recover from an estimated 0.8 per cent drop in gross domestic product this year to grow by a real 1.4 per cent in 1994. But this improvement would be largely due to a pick-up in foreign demand for French goods, he said. The chief measures outlined by Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the budget minister, call for: An increase in overall spending in 1994 of 1.1 per cent, below the predicted inflation rate of 2.2 per cent. Higher increases are targeted towards classic conservative priorities, including defence and police, but also for fighting unemployment. A reduction in the budget deficit to bring it down from an estimated FFr317bn (Pounds 36.1bn) this year to FFr300bn next year. The government is counting on getting FFr55bn from the sale of state companies next year, up from its planned gains from privatisation of FFr43bn this year. Some FFr19bn in tax cuts, mainly to provide relief for the middle classes. They form the centre-right government's main political constituency and bear the brunt of a steeply progressive income tax that is paid by only half of French households. The top tax rate would stay at 56.8 per cent, but tax brackets would be simplified and reduced from 13 to seven. Fiscal reforms aimed at shifting French savings towards housing, consumption and longer-term deposits. The Association of French Banks welcomed the move as 'a step towards a more logical savings system', but was disappointed that some measures would not take effect until 1995. More immediate will be the impact of removal of capital gains tax on Sicav money funds which are withdrawn for investment in housing. Economists said this would revive the depressed housing sector. The budget package evoked little enthusiasm, even from government supporters. The UDF described it as 'the least worse outcome that is possible in very difficult circumstances'. The Socialist opposition denounced the tax cuts as 'bluff' because they hid larger tax increases which the government had consolidated into its new budget. Many economists believe that the tax cuts and incentives alone are too modest to pull the economy out of recession.  ----------------------------------------------------------           French economy: forecasts for 93/94  ----------------------------------------------------------                                          1993    1994 Budget deficit (FFrbn)                   318     300 GDP (% change)                            -0.8     1.4 Consumption (% change)                                 0.4     0.7 Investment (% change)                                -8.2     0.8 Exports (% change)                        -0.7     4.6 Imports (% change)                        -0.7     4.2 Trade Balance (FFr bn)                    39      46  ---------------------------------------------------------- Source: Ministries of Economy and Budget  ----------------------------------------------------------</p>

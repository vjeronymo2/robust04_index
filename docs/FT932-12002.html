			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / The Lloyd's Business Plan: Staffing and costs to fall steeply THE MARKET'S costs are scheduled to fall 22 per cent from Pounds 885m in 1991 to Pounds 665m by 1995, and it is expected that 2,500 of the 12,000 currently employed in the market will lose their jobs over the next two to three years, Richard Lapper writes. Greater efficiency will be achieved by a new central management style and tougher, more independent regulation of the market, and by action in four specific areas - improving and streamlining business practices; reducing agency and underwriting fees; changing the way members' agents operate; and cutting the corporation's central costs. The market is to move from an environment of 'consensus-based decision-making by committees to one where the central management team will take decisions after consultation, implement these decisions and be held accountable to the market board for results', the plan says. Significant improvements in central management information, including looking at introducing a one-year or two-year accounting cycle - compared with the current three-year system - are to be introduced. Lloyd's regulators will in future work more independently from the market. They will monitor the professionalism of underwriters and agents, and weed out incompetence. The aim is create a regulatory structure 'that replicates the operation of external regulation', the plan says. Business processes are to be streamlined, with improvements in the way policies are drafted and claims handled. Senior managers will have much better information and the move to electronic trading will be speeded up, generating estimated savings of Pounds 20m. Although face-to-face trading (between underwriters and brokers) will be kept 'where appropriate', all underwriters will be have to do much of their business electronically by the end of 1995. All business placed at Lloyd's must be 'supported by a full electronic version of the contract by 1 January 1996'. Fees paid by Names to managing agents will be reduced from 0.5 per cent of stamp capacity to 0.4 per cent, saving Names Pounds 15m, and new controls on the management of run-off companies will shave a further Pounds 25m from the market's costs. Syndicates and agencies face tough disclosure requirements. Expenses will be rigorously monitored and a new unit set up to identify businesses that are longer economically viable. 'As 'economic viability' is a condition of registration under current regulation, agents that are no longer viable will be closed down or encouraged to merge with stronger groups,' the plan says. Syndicate and agent costs have risen by a compound 20 per cent a year for the past 10 years, and there has been no slowdown in their growth since 1990, with 1991 costs up 24 per cent. Members' agents (which handle the affairs of Names) are to stripped of many of their functions. Administrative tasks, such as handling Names' deposits and tax affairs, will be transferred to a central services unit owned by Lloyd's, yielding savings estimated at Pounds 20m. members' agents will in future concentrate instead on advising Names and assessing the performance of syndicates. A reduction in costs of some Pounds 37m at the corporation was announced earlier this year, with staffing cut from 2,200 to 1,600 by the end of the year.</p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Management: Social engineer who doesn't mind mugs - Lucy Kellaway meets the dapper Gavin Laird in Peckham The Victorian facade can be seen from a long way down the Peckham Road, incongruous among south London's council estates and video shops. The Amalgamated Engineering Union's purpose-built headquarters is now restored to its former red brick splendour, with a bright green lawn and flower beds leading up to its front door. Yet Gavin Laird, the no-nonsense general secretary, has shunned the grand old Victorian rooms. His office is an undistinguished L-shaped space in a new block at the back. From the room itself, and from his account of what he does there, you would not guess you were visiting a trade union chief. Rather, you might think the dapper and direct Scot was the boss of a medium-sized company  - one committed to efficiency and to cost-cutting. Indeed, this sparring partner of British engineering companies is modernising his organisation in exactly the same way that they are struggling to update theirs. The aim is to make his unwieldy machine with its 1,400 branches and 19th century ethos operate more smoothly. Since he became general secretary, he has cut the headquarters staff from more than 300 to less than 100. 'In 1982 there was not a single word processor in the building. Now there is not a single typewriter,' says Laird. If every time he said 'members' you heard 'shareholders', you would be impressed at how accountable this boss feels. 'Mine must be an office that the members can feel proud of,' he says. 'After all, it is their property.' The room is more than respectable, but with its mass produced furniture and functional lights, members need not feel their money has been spent too freely. When the building was refurbished five years ago, Laird insisted that his office was done last. 'I was ashamed that a trade union had its staff working in such Dickensian conditions. You should have seen the toilets]' These days he positively recommends a visit to the ladies'  - which turn out to be tiled, with basins and cubicles: so unremarkable that you wonder what they must have been like before. In his own room, Laird has let the builders have free run with the decor, but seems happy with the institutional result, and the little signs telling smokers to empty their ashtrays after them. 'I'm not fussed', he says. However, there are a few things in the room he is fussed about. The first are his pictures. Facing his desk is a Lowry-esque painting of a Glasgow tenement, which reminds him of the place he was born. There is the picture of a grim-faced worker with his tools, painted by a joiner at the Swan Hunter shipyard, and a whole collection of sentimental pastels that he bought from a street artist in Jerusalem. Another prized item is his desk, which Laird uses as further evidence of how he supports his members. The clumping, metal-framed bit of furniture was made by the men at Vickers  - at a competitive price, he adds hastily. Above all, there is his music. In the cabinet behind his desk is a sleek CD player  - 'Bang and Olufsen' he announces proudly. 'Listen', he says, putting on a piece of Mozart, leaning back in his chair and sighing. This is a ritual he goes through every morning at 7am, when he starts his day. Laird works hard and is happy to let you know he is in the office for some 12 hours a day and takes work home in the evenings and at weekends. Outside sit his secretary and PA, of whom he is both complimentary and demanding. A tray of coffee is brought in, but Laird objects: 'I'm getting a cup] I never have a cup, I'd have preferred a mug'. Evidently this is no joke. A few minutes later his PA returns bearing a mug of coffee. When not making coffee, the secretary and PA spend their time sorting through the several hundred letters Laird receives every day, bringing in the bundles that need his attention. 'Let's look' he says, turning to one of the seven plastic trays on his desk. 'This is a letter of complaint from a district where we are closing an office and they don't like it . . . A consultant wants to give us something for nothing  - which would cost us a fortune . . . A trade union wants to see me about redundancies . . . Leicester Business School would like to know our views on industrial relations . . .' He skims through the pile efficiently. Despite his insistence on bringing the old organisation up to date, Laird himself relies on more old fashioned methods. He used to have a computer in his room but says he was 'too stupid to be able to use it'. Much of his time is spent a long way from his office. Seven weeks a year he is at conferences, and at least once a month he visits a factory, the further from London the better. But his primary job is back in Peckham where he is struggling with the curious target of making himself redundant. 'My aim is to make this organisation systematic, so that the day I get knocked down by a bus, it does not matter.'</p>

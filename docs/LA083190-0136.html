			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SOLOMON: SANDWICHES AND DIET  </P> <P> Question: From time to time, you have written about a variety of different  foods, including fast food, Mexican and Chinese food. What about submarine  sandwiches? Can they be part of a normal diet, or are they more like cake, to  be eaten once in a while but not to be made a regular part of a diet?  </P> <P> Answer: Today's submarine sandwich is not the same as it was when first  introduced. Not only are different kinds of rolls and breads being used, but  the ingredients that make up the sandwiches are different.  </P> <P> Traditionally, the submarine sandwich contained Italian meats and cheese. Today  the fillings include a variety of salads such as seafood, tuna and chicken, as  well as ham, turkey and roast beef. Moreover, a "submarine sandwich" can even  be made with a pita pocket, which can be filled with a variety of fresh  vegetables.  </P> <P> In evaluating the nutritional value of a submarine sandwich, we can consider  the bread, lettuce, tomatoes, onions and peppers as acceptable components of a  diet. The diet remains acceptable with the addition of such meats as turkey and  roast beef. The sandwich only begins to pose a problem if you add high-fat  cheeses and other high-fat, high-calorie items. Fish is usually considered a  good choice as a filling, but not when it contains a large amount of  mayonnaise, which adds both calories and fat.  </P> <P> If you have a medical question, write to Dr. Solomon, P.O. Box 36184,  Baltimore, Md. 21285-6184. He cannot give personal replies but will answer as  many questions as possible in his column.  </P></p>

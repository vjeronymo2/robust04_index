			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: BA and USAir seek May start for agreement on 'code-sharing' BRITISH Airways and USAir, the sixth-largest US carrier in which the UK airline has invested Dollars 300m, are seeking to begin their 'code-sharing' arrangement in May. They would focus initially on connecting internal US flights operated by USAir and international services provided by BA at Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Implementation of the agreement is dependant on approval from the US Department of Transportation, which has yet to decide how to deal with the revised BA-USAir tie-up. The 'big three' US carriers, which oppose the deal, have accused BA of timing its revised USAir transaction to fall within 'the unsettled initial hours of a new administration' and have urged the DoT to withhold authorisation until it 'has had time to develop a coherent approach to foreign investment'. The UK carrier announced its investment in USAir, which buys a potential 19.9 per cent voting interest, in January, less than one month after a more extensive Dollars 750m investment plan was rejected by US authorities. However, BA and USAir seem determined to keep up the pressure. In an application to begin code-sharing filed with the DoT yesterday, USAir said the airlines wanted to begin phasing in a 'seamless service' on May 1, between Syracuse, Rochester and Cleveland, and the Philadelphia gateway. In June and July, they planned to add certain flights from Cincinnati, Columbus, Dayton, Indianapolis and Nashville to Pittsburgh. USAir noted that other international code-sharing arrangements - which allow flights where different sectors are operated by different carriers to carry the airline designator code for both airlines, and hence to be marketed as a 'seamless' through service - are in already in force. It also argued that the proposed USAir/BA code-sharing services were authorised when the air services bilateral agreement between the US and the UK was revised in 1991. Delta, one of the US carriers that opposes the BA-USAir tie-up, has asked the DoT to reverse the anti-trust immunity granted to KLM and Northwest Airlines last month.</p>

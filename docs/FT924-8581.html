			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dealers move focus to Gatt THE DOLLAR slipped by more than  1/2 pfennig against the D-Mark in Europe on profit-taking yesterday, after failing to sustain a break through DM1.60, writes James Blitz. The US currency rose by more than 5 pfennigs last week, and speculative players appeared to be cashing in on those movements. Yesterday the dollar closed in London at DM1.5885. Later in New York, however, it performed strongly, ending at DM1.6041. Otherwise, the market's attention was firmly fixed on sterling, which fell to a five-year low against the dollar in late European trading. Dealers sold the pound in the belief that base rates could be lowered by as much as 2 per cent when the UK chancellor makes his autumn statement this week. Sterling lost some 1 1/2 cents to close at Dollars 1.5210 in London, and continued to drop in New York, finishing at Dollars 1.5105. The last time the pound was seen at this low level was on January 15, 1987. Yesterday, sterling dropped 3 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark, ending at DM2.4150. The market continues to be moved by a strong belief that Germany will ease short-term credit policy in the new year, pushing the dollar upwards. The possible break-up of the Gatt talks is also being cited as a reason why the dollar may be boosted in the short-term. A full-scale trade war between the US and Europe, if it is allowed to happen, would be detrimental to the entire world economy in the long run. But Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America in London, points out that the relative insulation of the US economy on matters of trade makes the Gatt crisis a positive factor for the dollar. In the US economy, for example, only 10 per cent of Gross National Product is made up of imports and exports. In France's case, the figure is 20 to 25 per cent. Mr Hawkins further commented: 'If tariffs are levied against, say, the French wine industry, this could have a knock-on effect for the economy and the French franc.' For the moment the market is waiting on developments in Europe and the US. Indeed, the French franc yesterday was firmer against the D-Mark after the Bank of France decided not to cut its money market intervention rate, contrary to market expectations. It finished at FFr3.3810 per D-Mark, after a previous close of FFr3.3820. Ms Joanne Perez, an economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris, said yesterday that the French authorities could probably afford to reduce rates again without risking any downside on the currency. 'A cut in rates would confirm that France is part of the hard core of the exchange rate mechanism, and would be interpreted as a show of strength,' she said. However, she believes it is unlikely that the French authorities will cut rates to below the German level, in spite of public pressure to do so.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mogadishu, Jan 18 (AFP) -- UN forces on Tuesday [18  January] released eight aides of Somali warlord Mohamed Farah  Aidid, including his right hand man and chief financier Osman  Hassan Ali 'Ato'.    Minutes after being freed, Osman addressed a rally of about  2,000 cheering supporters who welcomed him with garlands of  purple bougainvillaea flowers. "Without you we would never have  succeeded," Osman, known as 'Ato,' or the slim man told the  crowd.    He did not mention General Aidid's demand for UN  peacekeepers  to quit Somalia in what was essentially a non-political speech,  but promised to address supporters again on Thursday.    Osman, 44, was arrested four months ago on suspicion of  involvement in the killings of US and UN peacekeepers before the  world body dropped its hunt for Aidid amd suspended a warrant  for his arrest in November. Osman was held for a time on an  island off southern Somalia with two other senior Aidid aides,  Mohamed Hassan Awale, the warlord's advisor on international  affairs, and Omar Salad Elmi, Aidid's former representative in  Ethiopia.    The latter were arrested during an October 3 firefight in  which Aidid militiamen killed 18 Americans. The three were  later moved to the central town of Baidoa. They were flown to  Mogadishu and handed over to officials of the International  Committee of the Red Cross on Tuesday along with five other  lower level Aidid aides who had been detained in the capital.    An international law expert who investigated the case  against  the eight detainees, Enoch Dumbuntshena of Zimbabwe recommended  their release after a four day visit to Somalia earlier this  month, UN officials said.    An international commission is still investigating  allegations that Aidid masterminded the killings of foreign  soldiers.    More than 80 peacekeepers have died since the United Nations  took over command of the multi-national military intervention  force in Somalia from the United States in May, most in clashes  with Aidid's militiamen.    "We're happy the detainees have been released and we hope  that all those will work together for peace with a spirit of  reconciliation," UN spokesman George Bennett said. Asked  whether the decision to release the detainees was political or  judicial, Bennett said it was "humanitarian" gesture.    As the eight were being released they met the Imam of Hirab,  Omar Mohamoud, a revered Islamic leader who brokered a peace  treaty signed by the clans of Aidid and his enemy, self-styled  interim president Ali Mahdi Mohamed on Sunday.    In a statement from Geneva confirming the releases of the  eight, the ICRC recalled that it had in October last year played  a role in bringing about the release of a US helicopter pilot  and a Nigerian soldier held by Aidid supporters.    ICRC officials have visited 206 prisoners in UNOSOM hands  during the past eight months, the statement said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA proposes that the current system continue after January  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1, 1996, and that companies be permitted to produce or import  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances explicitly for uses that result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transformation or destruction with the same requirements as under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current regulation. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Therefore, such producers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importers will continue to receive an IRS certification of intent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to transform or a destruction verification from the second- or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party transformers or destroyers. The producers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importers will also continue to submit these certificates or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verifications to EPA along with their quarterly reports (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section C.7. Recordkeeping and Reporting).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Controlled substances produced for export to be transformed or destroyed are discussed in section C.3. ``Administrative Changes to Production Allowance Requirements for Exports that are Transformed or Destroyed.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Production or importation of controlled substances intended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for emissive use but subsequently transformed or destroyed.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the current regulation a person who transforms or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destroys a controlled substance that was produced or imported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with expended allowances may petition the Agency for ``additional''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption and production allowances. The person who transforms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or destroys a controlled substance that was produced or imported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with expended allowances is essentially requesting a ``refund'' of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the allowances originally used in the production or importation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the substance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes that, after the phaseout begins on January 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1996, companies will no longer be able to request additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production allowances or consumption allowances for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transformation or destruction of controlled substances which were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced or imported for emissive uses (other than for methyl  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bromide). The Agency proposes the elimination of the specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions that grant additional production and consumption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowances, beginning January 1, 1996, for all class I controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances, except methyl bromide, in anticipation of the post-phaseout elimination of production and consumption allowances for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those substances. Thus, a person who expends allowances to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produce or import a class I substance, other than methyl bromide,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and then transforms or destroys that substance after January 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1996, will not be granted additional production or consumption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowances. However, a person who expends allowances and then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transforms or destroys methyl bromide after January 1, 1996,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would still be able to petition the Agency for additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production and consumption allowances until January 1, 2001, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the current regulation. In this respect, a person who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transforms or destroys methyl bromide that was produced or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imported for an intended emissive use may continue to follow the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing regulation as described under &sect;82.9 and &sect;82.10.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): New unit trusts will qualify for Peps Oeics - open-ended investment companies - the new type of unit trusts scheduled to materialise in the UK next summer, will be able to qualify for Peps on the same terms as authorised unit trusts, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. Regulations will also be brought in to allow some European institutions to market Peps in the UK. Under the EU's Investment Services Directive, due to come into force in 1996, brokers in an EU country will have access to the markets of other member countries. Oeics will issue shares instead of units and will have a single pricing structure instead of the unit trust dual system of bid and offer prices (buying and selling prices). Their formation will enable UK-based fund management companies to market their funds in Europe. Rules will also be made allowing existing unit trusts to convert into an Oeic.</p>

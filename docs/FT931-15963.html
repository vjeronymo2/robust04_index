			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Roche The bullish trading statement from Roche will doubtless come as a relief to the faint-hearted. Having seen the shares rise 60 per cent last year, the market might be forgiven a touch of vertigo. Earnings rose by an unexpectedly strong 50 per cent in 1991. The shares have been running fast simply to maintain the rating. The nagging concern has been that Roche might equally surprise on the way down. Despite last year's placing of depositary receipts in the US, the quality of financial disclosure remains distinctively Swiss. Yesterday's sales figures are some reassurance. But the full-year results announcement next month is unlikely to include much segmental information. That family interests hold the majority of the voting shares is another risk for minority shareholders. While Roche continues to deliver earnings growth comfortably above 20 per cent, though, investors may be willing to take a lot on trust. Roche's pipeline of new drugs looks more promising than most. Its position in over-the-counter products - bolstered by the purchase of Sanatogen in the UK from Fisons last month - is also strong. If Roche can squeeze something more from Genentech and the struggling diagnostics business, a multiple of perhaps 15 times this year's forecast earnings on the non-voting shares looks undemanding.</p>

			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-MANPOWER CHIEF TO HEAD PARENT FIRM  </P> <P> Mitchell Fromstein, ousted last month as head of the employment group Manpower  Inc. by its British parent Blue Arrow PLC, emerged victorious in a coup Friday  to become the new chief executive of the entire group.  </P> <P> The board of Blue Arrow announced that Fromstein would take over from Tony  Berry as chief executive.  </P> <P> In the board room struggle, Fromstein, 62, was forced to resign last month as  head of Milwaukee-based Manpower, a giant temporary recruitment agency he  helped build.  </P> <P> But that led to a campaign by U.S. holders of Manpower agency franchises to  have him reinstated. The group approved a resolution of "no confidence" in the  replacement management brought in by London-based Blue Arrow.  </P> <P> Berry, 46, a schoolboy boxer who became one of Britain's most dashing  entrepreneurs, remains chairman of the board but is no longer chief executive.  </P> <P> Some financial analysts said Berry's ouster was due partly to a poor  stock-price performance after Blue Arrow's 1987 takeover of Manpower, and to  controversy over the flop of a $685-million (387-million pound) stock flotation  to help finance the $1.34-billion deal.  </P> <P> Friday's board statement said the decision to move Fromstein to Blue Arrow to  replace Berry as chief executive resulted from differences between directors on  management style.  </P> <P> The Manpower franchise holders said in a statement from Chicago that they were  pleased with the change in management. The group said although it was never its  goal to replace Berry with any specific individual, "we welcome the news that  Mitchell Fromstein will assume leadership of the company."  </P> <P> They said the appointment is clearly in "the best long-term interest of  Manpower, its employees, customers and franchisees as well as Blue Arrow and  its shareholders."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Growth Under Berry  </P> <P> Financial analysts said Berry had felt that Fromstein was interfering with his  plans to integrate and rationalize the group. But Fromstein had given Manpower  eight years of solid profits growth and two-thirds of group profits came from  operations that Fromstein controlled, analysts said.  </P> <P> "I think this must be seen as a great relief in that it clears the air," said  Mark Shephard of brokers Phillips &amp; Drew. "There had been intense  speculation as to what is going on, a lot of unpleasant rumors of bids,  breakouts, buyouts and so on."  </P> <P> Roger Hardman of brokers James Capel said: "Berry's staying on as non-executive  chairman means that everybody knows where they stand. Fromstein is certainly in  the driving seat and a management buyout is no longer a possibility."  </P> <P> Under Berry, Blue Arrow enjoyed spectacular growth, with profits rising from  about $725,000 (410,000 pounds) in 1984 to almost $55 million (30 million  pounds) in 1986.  </P> <P> It made a series of British takeovers, and then moved onto the global stage in  1987 to win Manpower. But the stock issue to help pay for that deal coincided  with the October, 1987, stock market crash.  </P> <P> The Department of Trade and Industry is investigating Blue Arrow's former  investment bank adviser, County Natwest, over an alleged stock-price support  operation following the failure of the stock flotation.  </P> <P> Berry has said he did not know of County Natwest's actions at the time.  </P> <P> Berry's share holding in Blue Arrow amounts to about 2% of the company and is  worth an estimated $22.5 million (12.7 million pounds) at the current market  price.  </P> <P> Blue Arrow is this month expected to announce its results for the year to  October, 1988.  </P></p>

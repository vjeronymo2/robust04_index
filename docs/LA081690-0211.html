			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RACE ACROSS AMERICA NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> RAPOSO EARNS REPLAY OF SAVANNAH CELEBRATION  </P> <P> It was Nancy Raposo's turn for a Savannah-style welcome Wednesday night.  </P> <P> Raposo of Newport, R.I., pedaled into Rousakis Plaza at 7:06 p.m. (PDT) to win  the women's division of the Race Across America in 10 days, 10 hours and 6  minutes.  </P> <P> A crowd of curious passersby, several TV crews and newspaper reporters were on  hand to watch Raposo finish the 2,922-mile race from Irvine to Savannah. It was  a scene similar, though a bit smaller, to that which Bob Fourney, the men's  winner, experienced early Tuesday morning.  </P> <P> Raposo, 33, was one of two veterans in the field of six women riders. In 1988,  she finished third. This year, Raposo was the first woman and 16th finisher  overall.  </P> <P> Cheryl Marek of Seattle, the other RAAM veteran, passed time station No. 43 at  Tuskegee, Ala., at 7 p.m. (PDT), in second place. Michelle Grainger of  Portland, Ore., was in Uniontown, Ala., at 5:58 p.m.  </P> <P> Marek had 365.4 miles left to ride and Grainger 488.9.  </P> <P> Jim Penseyres of San Juan Capistrano had fewer than 100 miles left to ride at 9  p.m. (PDT). He passed Reidsville, Ga., 82.6 miles from Savannah, at 7:02 p.m.  </P> <P> He is in 17th place. Because he'll finish more than 48 hours behind Fourney,  Penseyres will be considered an unofficial finisher.  </P> <P> Wednesday's finishers with finishing times (EDT): Al Muldoon of St. Joseph,  Mich., 1:05 a.m. in fourth place; Darrell Bowles (Tempe, Ariz.), 8:14 a.m.;  Rick Kent (Houston), 9:17 a.m.; David Kees (Auburn, Calif.), 10:15 a.m.; Mike  White (Cincinnati), 12:50 p.m.; Todd Mumbauer (Butte, Mont.), 1:22 p.m.; Tom  Seabourne (Mt. Pleasant, Tex.), 3:30 p.m.; David Meridith (Downers Grove,  Ill.), 4:01 p.m.; David Tysen (Ludlow, Vt.), 5:30 p.m. Phillippe Vetterli  (Birmendorf, Switzerland), 7:18 p.m; Les Drake (Carpenteria, Calif.), 9:12  p.m.; Terry Wilson (Indianapolis), 9:37 p.m.  </P></p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / ICI to sell fibres unit to Du Pont IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the British chemicals group, plans today to announce the sale of its fibres operations to Du Pont of the US. It is calling press conferences in London and Teesside to announce the deal. If ICI sells Du Pont its entire fibres operations, the deal would have to be cleared by the European Commission. The combined operations would have 55 per cent of the European market for staple fibres, used in carpets and clothing, and more than 30 per cent of the filament market. Analysts estimate the businesses, which had a turnover of about Pounds 675m in 1990, the last year the company published their results independently, could be worth as much as Pounds 350m. The operations are, however, unprofitable. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, has said in the past that he no longer saw fibres as one of its core businesses. He said he planned to develop businesses which operated on a global basis or were highly profitable. The fibres operations meet neither criterion. Their sales are concentrated in Europe and the businesses do not have a sustained record of profitability. ICI is facing chronic overcapacity and keen competition from Asia, problems shared by all European and North American fibres manufacturers, said Mr Stuart Wamsley, editor of Focus on Chemicals, an industry newsletter. Other fibres groups have already reacted to the poor market. In 1990, Courtaulds, the UK specialty chemicals group, set up two joint ventures for its acrylic fibres operations and acetate yarn business. Last month Rhone-Poulenc of France and Snia of Italy merged their staple fibre and polyamide carpet yarn operations. ICI appeared to have turned its fibres operations around during the late 1980s by exiting the polyester business and concentrating on nylon. In 1988 its operations peaked with trading profits of Pounds 53m. However, profits halved the following year. Fibres contributed to the materials division's losses of Pounds 14m during the final quarter of last year. ICI has already undertaken rationalisation at the fibres businesses. About 1,000 jobs were shed in 1991 and a further 800 are scheduled for this year. The operation's Harrogate headquarters has been closed and a 20-staff headquarters set up in Brussels. However, in February Sir Denys said rationalisation at the fibres operations had not created margins strong enough to produce satisfactory results. To compete internationally against manufacturers in the Far East, Asia, ICI would probably have to invest large sums in modern plant, believe analysts. Further rationalisation of the European fibres industry appears inevitable, warns Mr Wamsley. 'There may be further mergers or take-overs in the man-made fibres industry, but none will mean anything unless capacity is taken out,' he said.</p>

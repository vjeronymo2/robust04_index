			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> U.S. Capitol police are investigating syndicated columnist Jack Anderson for  smuggling a pistol into the U.S. Capitol to demonstrate security lapses at the  tightly guarded building, congressional authorities said. Anderson displayed  the unloaded handgun, and a bullet, on May 24 when he interviewed Senate  Republican leader Bob Dole in the Capitol for a television special on  terrorism, said Dole spokesman Walt Riker. Riker said Anderson claimed to have  walked through a metal detector with the 9-millimeter Austrian-made pistol on  his way to Dole's office.  </P></p>

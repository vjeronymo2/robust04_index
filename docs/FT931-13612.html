			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Alcan Australia reports third consecutive deficit ALCAN Australia, a 73 per cent owned subsidiary of Alcan Aluminium of Canada, yesterday announced its third consecutive annual loss and forecast further difficulties in the current year. The board said it would pass the dividend for the second consecutive year. Alcan said it made a net loss of ADollars 15.5m (USDollars 10.6m) for the 12 months to the end of December, compared with a loss of ADollars 28.9m in the previous year. Revenue was down from ADollars 590m to ADollars 576m despite a 3.7 per cent rise in sales volume. The group made a pre-tax profit of ADollars 1.2m, compared with a loss of ADollars 29.2m in the previous year. It said the improvement reflected efficiency improvements and cost-cutting. However, the return to profit was offset by a loss of ADollars 17m on currency translations caused by the effect on the group's US dollar loans of a fall in the value of the Australian dollar to 68.88 US cents from 74.77 cents. Alcan said no improvement in aluminium prices was expected in the short term. 'We expect 1993 to be a difficult year, but intend to make further progress in improving costs and competitiveness,' the board said.</p>

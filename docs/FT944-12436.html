			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (8): Bringing a legend to life - Coming soon / The 'Gone With The Wind' theme park There is little in Atlanta that would call to mind the legendary Tara plantation of Gone With the Wind. Historians are fond of noting that the sprawling, becolumned southern mansions of the type made famous by Hollywood never existed this far inland. Even the ramshackle house where Margaret Mitchell penned her famous book has been destroyed by fire. Tourists, take heart: after years of residing only in the pages of Ms Mitchell's novel and on the silver screen, Tara - and its sister plantation, Twelve Oaks - will at last have a home in Atlanta - or at least close to Atlanta. A California company has announced plans to build a 'Gone With the Wind Country' theme park near the tiny village of Villa Rica, about 32 miles west of the city. Scheduled to open in the spring of 1996, a few months before the summer Olympics, the Dollars 50m park will be aimed at a mature audience interested in how the film was produced. Developers hope the main attractions - replicas of the Tara and Twelve Oaks film sets - will draw 850,000 a year of the more than 16m tourists who visit Atlanta annually. The park, expected to employ between 150 and 300 people in its first year, will feature horseback riding, a Dollars 10m golf course, a Dollars 35m hotel and a Dollars 17m condominium development, bringing the overall cost of the complex to more than Dollars 100m by 1997. The citizens of Villa Rica, a community of 4,000 on Atlanta's 'forgotten' west side, already are seeing dollar signs. The town describes itself in tourist literature as a 'City of Gold', and with the construction of Gone With the Wind Country in their back yard, residents believe they may finally have struck the mother lode - 'property values are already going up,' says Jeane Williams of the Villa Rica city council. Her concern is whether the town is ready to cope with the increased traffic and congestion the 1,200-acre park will bring to this rural community, which until now had largely escaped development. Neal McCreary, a Villa Rica property agent, says that Ms Williams has nothing to fear except the loss of some of Villa Rica's small-town charm. 'All the revenue the park will generate doesn't represent any strain on our infrastructure,' he says. 'The park itself will not put one additional child in our schools. That's a good type of revenue to have coming in.' Andy Henshaw, city manager at the city hall, predicts that the park will double tax revenues to the town within three to four years - 'everyone is elated that we're getting the Gone With the Wind theme park. The city council has been supportive, and most of the citizens can't wait until it's built.' The city's business community is also eagerly awaiting the development of the park - 'this is a dead town,' says Grady Vickery, manager of Dangar's Feed &amp; Seed. 'There's nothing here to attract people. An attraction like (Gone With the Wind Country) isn't going to hurt anything.' He expects the park to give an immediate lift to local hotels and restaurants, and hopes that he can cash in, too - 'it's Tara, right? They might have to have something like hogs on that farm. Those animals have got to eat.' Whether Gone With the Wind County will share its riches with the likes of Mr Vickery, remains to be seen, but Mr Henshaw believes the park will turn Villa Rica into a land of opportunity - 'a lot of our citizens are under-employed to some degree,' he says. 'What we hope to do is provide good-paying jobs so they can support their families.' The cost to the city for the park and the opportunities it may bring is estimated at Dollars 316,000 for extension of water and sewer services. Acquisition of right of way for new roads may add to that figure. County, state and federal governments are pitching in for a highway overpass in an incentive package valued at more than Dollars 3m. Snags in the highway overpass construction deal have already delayed ground-breaking on the park by about a year, according to local newspaper reports. But park developer Mark Driscoll says the project remains on schedule for a 1996 opening, the year the of the centennial Olympics. And Mr Driscoll hopes Gone With the Wind Country will be able to capitalise on the allure of a state that is already second in the South in terms of tourism, (behind Florida) and fourth in the country in convention attendance. Mr Driscoll is a former employee of Landmark Entertainment Group, which has designed and produced theme parks for MCA/Universal Studios, Busch Entertainment, Caesars Palace and Six Flags. He formed Georgia Holdings with Gary Goddard, Landmark's chief executive, and began searching the Atlanta metro area for a home for Tara in 1992. Turner Home Entertainment, which owns rights to the film, has licensed Mr Driscoll to develop a park using Gone With the Wind as a theme. It is a theme that vividly defines the American South in the minds of many people across the world, including many Southerners. But privately, some local residents of Villa Rica worry that the park's portrayal of an era rooted in slavery might lead to racial tensions. For his part, Mr Driscoll has promised to feature the contributions of African Americans to Southern culture through such facilities as music (the blues) and food, (barbecues).</p>

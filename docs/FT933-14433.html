			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: Puma slips to DM12.6m loss, omits dividend PUMA, the troubled German-based sports goods manufacturer, suffered a DM12.6m (Dollars 7.2m) loss in 1992, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn. The company recorded a small profit in 1991 after five consecutive years of losses. It confirmed that there would be no 1992 dividend. Group sales for 1992 fell from DM577.1m to DM512.9m. Including licensed sales, worldwide sales for the Puma label were DM1.17bn last year, down from DM1.29bn in 1991. Mr Jochen Zeitz, the group's chief executive, said that the company had suffered from the decline in the price of sportswear and high marketing costs.</p>

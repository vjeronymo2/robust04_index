			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Van den Broek Wants European Union </F> Security Council"]    [Text] EU Commissioner Van den Broek yesterday [24 May]  called for the formation of a "permanent top level European  Union (EU) Security Council".    The commissioner for external political relations said "this  Security Council should supply planning and analysis at an EU  level. This would then form the basis for the decisions taken by  ministers in foreign and security policy fields." "The Council  should supply means to deal with crisis situations which  threaten the EU," Van den Broek said.    Van den Broek made his proposal at a seminar about the  future  of the EU's joint foreign and security policies. The seminar  was organized by the Clingendael Netherlands Institute for  International Relations.    "An adequate planning and analysis mechanism is," Van den  Broek stressed, "a requirement for foreign policies which not  only react, but also anticipate." The absence of such a  mechanism is in his view one of the causes of the EU policies'  failure in the former Yugoslavia. Another cause is too many  "declarations which promise more than can be realized," the  commissioner said.    Van den Broek also proposed a more effective working method  for the so-called "troika." At present, the "troika" comprises  the foreign ministers of the past, present, and future  presidencies of the Council of Ministers.    The commissioner said that "the troika can become more  effective if it comprises the ministers of a large and a small  EU country and a representative of the European Commission."  "Such a set-up can be achieved by a change in the  classification of the EU member states," according to Van den  Broek.</p>

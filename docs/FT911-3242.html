			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Rules on takeovers attacked - Trade and Industry SIR JOHN Clark, former chief executive of Plessey the UK electronics group, yesterday attacked UK takeover regulations, arguing bidders should be required to exercise due diligence and that shareholders' interests should not be the sole determinant of a bid. 'I do not believe self-regulation is working or can work,' he said, addressing the trade and industry select committee on government takeover and merger policy. 'There should be criteria that can overrule the perceived best interests of shareholders,' he said. Sir John argued that due diligence performed by companies in bid situations should include establishing genuine synergy and mutual benefit, showing that employee benefits can be enhanced and illustrating that extra monies would be available for R&amp;D and marketing. Referring to Plessey's Pounds 2bn takeover by GEC and Siemens in 1989, Sir John said that 35 fund managers 'who did not know one end of a factory from another' were the sole arbiters of the company's demise. He described it as 'utterly absurd' that ownership of UK companies was largely concentrated among 'a handful of institutions.' This 'cannot be perceived to be in the public interest,' he said. He agreed that a central registry of undertakings given by prospective buyers during the course of bids should be established. Cadbury Schweppes, the UK confectionery and soft drinks group, told the same committee that it supports lowering the bid threshold for mandatory bids to 20 per cent from 29.9 per cent at present.</p>

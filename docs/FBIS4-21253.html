			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Former Social Defense Under Secretary Gonzalo  Torrico, Colonel Enrique Fernandez [former commander of the  Special Antinarcotics Force, FELCN, in La Paz], and General Luis  Anez [former FELCN commander] testified today before the  Constitutional Committee of the Chamber of Deputies. We have a  report from Amalia Pando on the testimony of Gonzalo Torrico.  [begin recording]    Torrico, in progress: ...as far as I can remember  about Isaac Chavarria, I did not get any information. I don't  exactly remember how many prosecutors I had.    Pando: Gonzalo Torrico, who headed the struggle  against drug trafficking during the four years of [former  President] Jaime Paz Zamora's administration, has showed his  memory is not as good as that of former dictator Luis Garcia  Meza. Torrico, who was an ADN [National Democratic Action]  senator in 1988 when another ADN senator published the  narcophoto showing Paz Zamora with alleged drug trafficker Isaac  Chavarria. He said he never told President Paz Zamora or  Interior Minister Guillermo Capobianco that Isaac Chavarria, who  was shown in the picture with Paz Zamora, was the most wanted  drug trafficker in Bolivia at that time.    Torrico: Mr. President, I have clearly stated that  the reception of the drug reports was not an exclusive privilege  of the Social Defense Under Secretariat or the Interior  Ministry: The reports went to both organizations. My  relationship with the president was via the interior minister.  When I met with the minister we did not talk about specific  issues, we talked about overall policies.    Deputy Juan del Granado: Did you not consider it  necessary to tell the interior minister about this case in  particular? Did you ever think of doing that? This is what I  want to know.    Torrico: No, because that kind of relationship did  not exist.    del Granado: Thank you.    Pando: Between 1989 and 1991 Chavarria rose in the  ranking of the most wanted drug traffickers. He first appeared  on a list of the 28 most wanted traffickers, which was the first  list Gonzalo Torrico saw. Some months later Chavarria rose to  ninth place.    Unidentified deputy: Then a list of the nine most  wanted drug traffickers was publicly released. Not only was the  list released, it is explained how it was established. The  report says: As a result of thorough intelligence analysis and a  comparison study of the people suspected by the FELCN, the  Social Defense Under Secretariat -- which was your organization  Mr. Torrico -- and the DEA, a list of nine drug traffickers  considered the national kingpins was compiled. This list shows  Isaac Chavarria in first place.    Pando: In November 1991, the list was reduced to  just the three most wanted drug traffickers. The deadline for  repented drug traffickers to surrender had passed and the FELCN  commander in Santa Cruz said that just three kingpins did not  take advantage of the repentance law. The most important of the  three was Isaac Chavarria. Despite all this evidence, Gonzalo  Torrico never concerned himself with Chavarria's arrest.    Torrico: I remember, let me reiterate, I remember  Chavarria's name just as a remember the name Techo de Paja from  the reports. But when I saw a list, I had no interest in any  particular name because that was not my job. I already clearly  pointed out that there was a specialized organization to do that.    Pando: It was also established that in 1990 an  ex-member of the FELCN, Retamozo, was murdered after formally  accusing Isaac Chavarria.    Unidentified deputy: The prosecutor was the  official who interrogated Eduardo Adolfo Retamozo Rosas on 26  September 1990. Retamozo, a former FELCN official, was then  released, then he was arrested, and then murdered. The case of  Eduardo Adolfo Retamozo was well known. The interrogation was  handled by a prosecutor who worked for you, or who was assigned  to the Social Defense Under Secretariat. Did this prosecutor --  who worked for you -- not inform you in detail, at least after  Retamozo was shot dead, about his testimony.    Torrico: Mr. President, prosecutors were not  obliged to report to me directly or through their coordinators  of these events.    Pando: According to Torrico, he knew Isaac  Chavarria was a wanted drug trafficker. He did not order his  arrest because that is the task of the FELCN intelligence. He  did not warn the president because it was not his duty and  because the reports from the FELCN with the list of the most  wanted drug traffickers were also sent to Minister Capobianco.  Let us recall that, before this committee, Capobianco has  denied being informed about links between Chavarria and drug  trafficking. In the last part of his testimony, Torrico  clarified that he did not work for the DEA or receive money from  the U.S. Embassy. He also reiterated that no one ever asked him  to protect Chavarria, neither Jaime Paz Zamora or Guillermo  Capobianco. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV CAMPAIGNS  </P> <P> We read with interest the letter (Sept. 20) by Gainer R. Lewis regarding  campaign ads. His ideas regarding the role of the broadcasters and television  political commercials should be further explored.  </P> <P> On our latest trip to New Zealand in August, 1987, we experienced politics New  Zealand style. Every evening on television after the 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. news  program, each political party presented its views for approximately two  minutes.  </P> <P> The parties' presentations were shown consecutively so that the voter could  contrast and compare candidates and issues.  </P> <P> Even though the political information was presented for only two weeks prior to  the election, we, as visitors, felt that we had gained enough understanding of  the candidates and issues to have made an intelligent and informed decision.  </P> <P> WALLIS PEREIRA  </P> <P> ESTHER PEREIRA  </P> <P> Pine Mountain Club, Calif.  </P></p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Underground achieves 75% service in spite of strike London Underground ran three-quarters of its train services yesterday during the 24-hour strike by members of the RMT union. The union said last night that it was unable to estimate how many of its 7,500 members at London Underground had responded to the strike call. London Underground was able to staff most of its services. Only one of London's 270 Tube stations had to be closed and that reopened at lunchtime. The worst effect may have been in low passenger volumes and lost revenue because many people who normally travel by Tube made alternative arrangements. Underground managers were unable to give passenger figures. On an average day there are about 2.5m passenger journeys on the Tube system. The greatest disruption occurred during rush hours. In off-peak hours, the Underground said, it managed to run nine out of 10 trains. The union executive is to meet on Monday to decide on further action. It has asked for more talks at the Acas conciliation service, but London Underground refuses to increase its offer of a 2.5 per cent rise. The union has asked for a 4 per cent rise. Five other unions representing Tube workers have accepted the 2.5 per cent deal.</p>

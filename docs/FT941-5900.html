			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Minister warns unions of curb on pay rises A government minister told the Trades Union Conference yesterday that future pay rises for the 5.8m public-sector workers would have to be funded from efficiency savings and not increases in government funding. Defending the government's three-year public-sector pay bill freeze Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, explained to delegates at a TUC public services conference in London that there was 'no formal limit on pay settlements' in the public sector. Mr Dorrell, the first Tory minister in many years to address a TUC conference, received a cool reception from delegates. Mr Dorrell said there was a 'continuing role' for the existing five pay-review bodies in the public services but he added that future pay awards would have 'to take account of wider management considerations', such as the spread of performance pay and local wage determination. However the unions are likely to find it hard to convince workers to oppose the government's public-sector wage policy. Nearly two in every five workers are unaware that the government has any public-sector pay policy, a survey commissioned by the TUC reported yesterday. Only 31 per cent knew there was a 1.5 per cent pay limit last year and 20 per cent that the government had introduced a pay-bill freeze. A total of 85 per cent of the survey sample had not heard of any union campaign against the government's public-pay policy. The Post Office is continuing to face stiff resistance from the Treasury in its efforts to win commercial freedom in its business activities. The government is agreeing to lift existing financial restrictions that all its investment programmes must be funded from its own profits. But at yesterday's conference Mr Dorrell, in reply to Mr Alan Johnson, leader of the UCW postal union, rejected a proposal on the use of public money. 'I am not in favour of seeing the Post Office using taxpayer's money in the form of public capital to compete openly with taxpayers in other industries,' he said. Mr Dorrell added: 'If we are being told that the Treasury should no longer take an interest in the Post Office's use of public capital, then that is not going to be the position.' Mr Johnson said: 'This is very depressing.' If the Post Office could not work with private companies it would mean European postal companies would pick up business. Observer, Page 19</p>

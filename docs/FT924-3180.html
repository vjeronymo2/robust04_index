			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Deutsche Bank Deutsche Bank may still be ahead of the game in spite of its 5 per cent fall in operating profits at the 10-month stage. True, this stands in sharp contrast to profits growth elsewhere in the sector and was sufficient to send shares lower yesterday. But the impact of Deutsche's aggressive expansion into east Germany is starting to fall away. Interest margins are being squeezed as savers in the east switch into higher-yielding accounts. Costs are also coming back under control now the task of building a branch network is drawing to a close. Next year's figures should be less clouded. Given the slide of west German industry into recession since the summer, the market may by then be more concerned with asset quality than operating profits. By lending more in the interbank market rather than to its industrial and commercial customers, Deutsche is already sacrificing lending margins in favour of asset quality. By UK standards, the 1,000 job cuts next year promised by Deutsche's Mr Hilmar Kopper hardly amount to digging in for the long haul. Judged against the rosy optimism on the economy expressed by Commerzbank last week, though, Deutsche is more alive to the risks of recession.</p>

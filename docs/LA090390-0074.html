			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEST HALTS FIGHT BEFORE IT STARTS  </P> <P> Umpire Joe West figured the best way not to be part of a fight was to stop one  from breaking out.  </P> <P> West, ordered by National League president Bill White not to get involved in  any fights, halted Eric Davis from getting at Greg Maddux, after the Chicago  pitcher had plunked the Cincinnati outfielder.  </P> <P> In the fourth inning, Maddux hit Davis with a fastball that appeared to get  away from the right-hander.  </P> <P> "No, I wasn't throwing at him," Maddux said. "I always try to work him with  fastballs inside. That was an inside fastball."  </P> <P> Davis took a couple of steps toward the mound before his path was blocked by  catcher Joe Girardi and West.  </P> <P> Earlier, Cincinnati starter Jose Rijo threw a pitch which Maddux had to duck  under to avoid.  </P> <P> "I'm not supposed to comment on this at all," West said. "But major league  baseball has told (umpires) not to stop (players) from fighting. That comes  from Richie Phillips (head of the umpires union). We're supposed to just let  them fight.  </P> <P> "But I don't want to see a fight any more than anyone else. It was just  instinct."  </P> <P> West escorted Davis to halfway to first base.  </P> <P> Maddux was fined $200 and West issued a warning to both dugouts.  </P></p>

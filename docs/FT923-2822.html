			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Italians awarded Dollars 1.7bn Iran gas field contract SAIPEM, the engineering services subsidiary of ENI, the Italian state oil concern, and the private-sector Tecnologie Progetti Lavori (TPL), have been awarded a Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 890m) contract by the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) to develop the Gulf offshore South Pars gas field. The field, in the centre of the Gulf, abuts Qatar's North Dome gas field. The contract envisages developing 20 offshore wells, a gathering system for gas and condensates, six offshore platforms and 200km of underwater pipes. A gas treatment and condensate plant will be built on land. Work is set to start at once, with completion in 1996 and planned output of 1bn cu ft of gas a day and 50,000 b/d of condensates. Sub-contractors are Mitsubishi of Japan and Machinoexport of Russia. The deal confirms the leading presence of Italian business in Iran and shows the two sides have put behind them the long saga of debts due to Italy as a result of construction of the Bandar Abbas port under the late Shah. The contract was signed in Tehran yesterday, in spite of rising tension over Iran's presence on the disputed Gulf island of Abu Musa.</p>

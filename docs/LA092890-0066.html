			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAST MEETS WEST AT CARNEGIE HALL FETE;  </P> <P> SOCIETY: ANGELENOS BRIEFLY ENTER SOCIAL CIRCLE OF THE KISSINGERS, TRUMPS, AND  BUCKLEYS AT GALA AFTER L.A. PHILHARMONIC CONCERT.  </P> <P> The 100th anniversary of Carnegie Hall may have belonged to New York, but the  gala centennial performance belonged to Los Angeles.  </P> <P> At least that's how some 40 L.A. Philharmonic supporters felt Wednesday night  when the orchestra performed in the newly restored Carnegie Hall. The concert  wrapped up two days of events planned around the sold-out performance.  </P> <P> At a rehearsal earlier in the day, Philharmonic board president Stanley Beyer  told orchestra members, "There will be 2,800 people here tonight celebrating  Carnegie Hall -- but there will be 40 people celebrating you."  </P> <P> The celebrations continued at the post-performance, black-tie gala for 600 at  the private Metropolitan Club, a former residence with an interior that rivals  a museum: walls and ceilings painted like the Sistine Chapel and elaborate  moldings.  </P> <P> The overstuffed chairs and vague mustiness that usually characterize the club  were gone for the evening, replaced by tables for 10 decorated with black lace  runners and enormous sprays of hydrangeas, roses and baby's breath.  </P> <P> The Angelenos were not only awed by the surroundings but also by the other  guests.  </P> <P> The New York social X-rays and usual suspects seen in the party pages of W were  there, including Henry and Nancy Kissinger, Blaine Trump, Nan Kempner, Estee  Lauder, Claudia Cohen and Ronald Perelman, Ricky and Ralph Lauren, Beverly  Sills, Annette and Oscar de la Renta, Gloria Steinem, and Pat and William  Buckley Jr., who co-chaired the gala with Stanley and Lynn Beyer.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles contingent displayed a strange fascination with these fabled  Eastern socialites come to life. Some scrutinized the New Yorkers' jewels and  debated whether or not they could carry off wearing strapless gowns.  </P> <P> There was little interaction between East and West Coast camps. The  Philharmonic supporters were seated together at separate tables and seemed  content to be with each other.  </P> <P> When Carnegie Hall board chairman James Wolfensohn spoke to the crowd and  declared the L.A. Philharmonic "one of the great American orchestras," the  loudest cheers came from the four Los Angeles tables.  </P> <P> Among those applauding were John and Joan Hotchkis, David Begelman, the Beyers'  children Robert Beyer and Laurian Legett, Joanna Carson, Royce and Jennifer  Diener, Ginny Mancini, Della Koenig, Diane Downey and Philharmonic managing  director Ernest Fleischmann with daughter Stephanie.  </P> <P> Carson, like others in the group, has an apartment in New York and comes here  frequently. She said she joined up with the others because of her support of  the orchestra. Begelman mentioned a love of music, a fondness for the  Philharmonic and a good excuse to come to New York.  </P> <P> Not everyone realized that 40 people had come from Los Angeles to hear the  Philharmonic. Declared conductor Andre Previn, with some surprise, "I didn't  know there were so many (L.A.) people here."  </P> <P> Violinist Itzhak Perlman seemed in a jolly mood as he accepted congratulations  from his fans for his performance. "My husband was transported," gushed Pat  Buckley, leaning over to greet him while tugging at the bodice of her black  strapless mini.  </P> <P> Other than the setting and the players, the gala was amazingly similar to the  Los Angeles social circuit -- same schmoozing, same banquet food (veal chops,  stuffed vegetables, ice cream in a chocolate shell), same air kisses, same  designer gowns, same urgency to leave at the stroke of midnight.  </P> <P> "Oscar, come on!" said his wife Annette when the designer dallied too long  talking to a friend.  </P> <P> Before the concert, the Angelenos were invited to a cocktail party at the  pied-a-terre of songwriter Hal David and wife Eunice.  </P> <P> Guests nibbled on hors d'oeuvres and gazed out at the  they-look-like-ants-from-here view. They chatted about differences between New  York and Los Angeles. (Of New York: It's great to be able to walk, bad when the  cars aim for you.)  </P> <P> The day had begun with a four-course lunch at Bice that had diners groaning as  they left the restaurant.  </P> <P> Pianist Emanuel Ax, who is performing with the Philharmonic tonight at Carnegie  Hall, was there, along with Carnegie Hall archivist Gino Francesconi.  </P> <P> Those who were up for more visual stimulation proceeded to Carnegie Hall after  lunch for a tour of the archives.  </P> <P> And when the day was finished, friends parted ways, discussed plans to tour  with the orchestra to London and Salzburg, Austria, next, and said, "See you  back in town."  </P> <P> * MUSIC REVIEW F8  </P></p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Arms For Iraq - The Scott Inquiry: Cast of characters in a Whitehall farce - In the firing line SIR NICHOLAS LYELL, attorney-general, is trying to resist being set up as the 'fall guy' if the Scott inquiry delivers a harsh verdict. However, as the minister most directly responsible for the overall conduct of the Matrix Churchill case, he remains vulnerable. Sir Nicholas gave evidence which was defensive rather than convincing, although he is widely regarded as an honest man. However, even his friends concede that the arms-for-Iraq affair has left him politically out of his depth. MR WILLIAM WALDEGRAVE, minister for open government, faces opposition knives out for him. They have been sharpening since he told the inquiry rather lamely that he approved defence-related machine tools to Iraq because he was not given vital intelligence about their end-use. Mr Waldegrave, who was a Foreign Office minister from July 1988 to November 1990, has also left himself open to charges of misleading parliament. He accepted a form of words drafted by one of his officials which did not tell the whole truth about the government's policy towards Iraq. Nevertheless, other evidence shows he was usually more cautious than the more gung-ho Mr Alan Clark and Lord Trefgarne at the ministries of trade and defence. MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor, may rue the day he promised to resign if he was seriously criticised by the inquiry. He says he signed a PII certificate in the Matrix Churchill case to protect the intelligence services. But his insistence, along with the other serving minister Mr Malcolm Rifkind, now defence secretary, and former Foreign Office minister Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, that he had a duty to sign based on well-established law, has since been questioned by the judge. MR ALAN CLARK, a former trade and defence minister, has made few new friends as a result of his involvement in the Matrix Churchill affair. Some of his former colleagues say that it is only he who is really to blame for the way the trial of three businessmen turned into a Whitehall farce of potentially tragic consequences. He said one thing to Customs and Excise and the government, and another thing to the judge. Mr Clark's evidence to the Scott inquiry provided a further twist in the tale when he declared that the change in the guidelines should have been announced to parliament. He has also dropped a mischievous hint that Baroness Thatcher, as prime minister, had known more about what was going on that she had told the judge. MR ALAN MOSES QC, the chief prosecutor in the Matrix Churchill trial, performed a remarkable U-turn over PII certificates. Having argued strongly for the application of these certificates to prevent disclosure of official information, he told the inquiry that the system he had adhered to was fundamentally flawed. He also admitted to the inquiry that he may have failed in his duties as prosecutor by not chasing some of the documents he needed. Previously Mr Moses was regarded as on the fast track to become a High Court judge. Some colleagues wonder if this promotion might now take a considerably longer time. CUSTOMS AND EXCISE: The role of Customs in investigating and prosecuting the Matrix Churchill businessmen was not a happy one entirely. Officials have been questioned by the judge over their failure to fully familiarise themselves with the facts of the case, and over the way that witness statements were drawn up. WHITEHALL: The list of trade, defence, and Foreign Office officials who have emerged less that sweetly from the Scott inquiry is considerable. A few are likely to be moved sideways. Some already have been. INTELLIGENCE SERVICES: They may escape along with the arms manufacturers, dealers and bankers who have not been called to give evidence.

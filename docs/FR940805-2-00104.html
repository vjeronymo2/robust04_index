Section 274j(1) does not require such a hearing if suspension is requested by the Governor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before the opportunity for a hearing can arise, the Office of State Programs must submit to the Commission a paper containing a recommendation to suspend the State program in question. This Commission paper will include the recommendations of the MRB and any other material pertinent to the staff's recommendation to suspend the Agreement. Before a decision is made on the OSP recommendation, the Commission must provide the State with notice and an opportunity to request a hearing on the issue. If the State does not request a hearing, the Commission will make a final decision on the issue. If the State does request a hearing, the Commission will initiate the hearing process described below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The hearing for the suspension of an Agreement State program will be an informal hearing conducted either by the Commission itself, or at the Commission's discretion, by a Special Agreement State Board appointed by the Commission. In cases where the Commission determines that a Special Board will be used, the Board will consist of three members: (1) the chair of the Organization of Agreement States (OAS) (unless the chair is from the State in question, in which case the Agreement State representative will be the past chair of the OAS); (2) an official from the Office of General Counsel, and (3) the Deputy Director of an NRC regional office (outside of the region in which the State is located).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission, or the Special Board, as appropriate, will conduct an informal hearing to address the issues in question. At the hearing, the NRC staff, representatives of the Agreement State, and interested third parties will have an opportunity to testify, answer questions from the Special Board, and submit written materials. Third parties may submit written material to the Special Board and may testify for a limited period of time. After consideration of the issues, the Commission or the Special Board will issue a decision on suspension. A majority of the Commission or the Special Board will be required to support a decision. In cases where a Special Board is used, the Commission will have discretion to review the decision of the Special Board, and either uphold or overturn the Board's decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Additional Coordination During the Suspension  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A. NRC will conduct a meeting with the licensees in the State to explain the reassertion of NRC authority and the present fee structure. Lead for the meeting should be the Region in consultation with NMSS, OGC and OC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. After the suspension of the Agreement, OSP will prepare a letter to the Department of Labor advising the Department of the effective date of the termination of the Agreement (Appendix J).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. The Regional State Agreements Officer (RSAO) should obtain from the State a computer printout of all specific and general licenses affected by the suspension of the State's agreement. Mailing labels should be obtained if possible from the State. A letter should be prepared notifying each licensee of the suspension and reassertion by NRC and appropriate information (Appendix K).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. OSP will prepare a letter to all Agreement and Non-Agreement States notifying them of the effective date of the suspension and if appropriate, enclosing a copy of the order or  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice (Appendix L).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. The RSAO will coordinate with the State so that all necessary action is taken to have license files transferred or made available to the NRC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Withdrawal of Suspension/Recommendation for Termination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A. When the situation requiring the suspension has been corrected or eliminated, the Management Review Board will consider all factors and recommend to the Commission whether to lift the suspension.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. If the situation is not resolved, termination will be considered and the Procedure  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for termination should be followed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

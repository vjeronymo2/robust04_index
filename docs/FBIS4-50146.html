			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By T.C. Hu and Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Washington, May 13 (CNA) -- The second round of  Taipei-Washington talks concerning Taiwan's bid to join the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) ended here Friday  [13 May] with few results.    Sheu Ke-sheng, Taiwan's vice economic affairs minister and  chief negotiator to the talks, said the United States was  generally satisfied with Taiwan's commodity inspection and  quarantine system as well as its measures to protect  intellectual property rights, prevent dumping and minimize  export subsidies.    The U.S., however, as dissatisfied with Taiwan's wine and  tobacco monopoly system, car import restrictions and tariff  reduction plans, demanding that Taiwan enforce bigger tariff  cuts on a number of industrial and agricultural products, Sheu  said.    During the talks, Taiwan promised to further liberalize its  import trade. Starting July 1, [word indistinct) products will  be allowed to enter Taiwan freely with the exception of those on  a "negative list," Sheu said.    The U.S. demanded Taiwan remove its decades-old wine and  tobacco monopoly system before it enters GATT. "If we fail to  make progress on this old issue, the U.S. might withhold its  support for our GATT bid," Sheu noted.    American delegates were also concerned about Taiwan's "area  restrictions" on car imports and its plan to raise license fees  for large automobiles. The U.S. was also dissatisfied with  Taiwan's high commodity tax rates on autos.    It also wanted Taiwan to remove all non-tariff protective  measures for agricultural products, including subsidies for rice  farmers, Sheu said.    During the two-day talks, the U.S. submitted to the Taiwan  delegation a list of service industries which it wants Taiwan to  open to foreign investment. "We'll discuss the issue in the  next round of talks," Sheu said.    The U.S. further suggested that bilateral discussions on a  government procurement agreement be conducted soon if Taipei  wants to join GATT by the end of this year. Taiwan originally  planned to begin talks on the issue one year after it became a  GATT member.    The two sides agreed to begin discussions on the signing of  a  special exchange rate agreement in June, Sheu said. As Taiwan  is not a member of the International Monetary Fund, it must sign  such pacts with GATT contracting parties before it joins GATT.    Sheu said the two sides may hold a third round of talks on  GATT issues in June. He and his 33-member mission will leave  for Geneva Saturday to attend the fifth meeting of the GATT  working party screening Taiwan's GATT membership application.    While in Geneva, the Taiwan delegation will also hold  bilateral tariff concession talks with several countries,  including Canada, Japan and Switzerland.    Taiwan, which was admitted as a GATT observer in September  1992, is expected to become a full member by the end of this  year.</p>

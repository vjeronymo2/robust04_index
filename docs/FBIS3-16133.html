			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Potemkin] </F>   [Text] Warsaw, 12 Mar -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the leader  of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) arrived in the  Polish capital late on Friday [11 March] evening in "an  atmosphere of adventure," as a commentator on Warsaw radio  nighttime news put it. Alongside the leaders of the Samoobrona  National Front, which invited him to its first congress, waiting  for Zhirinovskiy at Warsaw's Okecie Airport were a group of  young people described by commentators as belonging to an  "antifascist organization" of the capital's university.    As Zhirinovskiy left the airport terminal, these young  people  joined the rush of reporters towards him, shouting "Black Pig,"  "Go Away," and "Get out of Poland." Uniformed men of the  so-called Polish legion, Samoobrona's youth organization, their  faces concealed by their caps, leapt to the defense of their  guest. A police squad had to wield truncheons to break up the  melee.    Reporters involved in the scuffle, some of them tenderly  touched by the truncheons, made indignant mention in their  dispatches of the tough conduct of the squad that dispersed  them. However, they were unable to find out from the airport  authorities to which police unit it belonged.    Reporters also noticed that for three quarters of an hour,  border guards failed to let Zhirinovskiy and those with him  through. The guards claim that this was because their guest's  bodyguards had no visas, although Poland and Russia are known to  operate an agreement on visa-free travel.    The arrival of the LDPR leader was preceded by an  unprecedented campaign in the Polish press and political  circles. Calls to ban him from entering the country were voiced  even in the Polish Sejm, on Friday. A special opinion poll was  published here on the eve of Zhirinovskiy's arrival. According  to its authors, 66 percent of Poles believe that the LDPR leader  "is a threat to Poland."</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COMING CLEAN, NOT WITHOUT SCORN, ABOUT HOUSEWORK  </P> <P> We were fired last week. My husband says that it was his fault; I believe that  we were both to blame. When the cleaning company boss called me, she said, "We  cannot work together so we have taken you off our service." It was not the  first time our household help fired us.  </P> <P> Six years ago, when I pointed out dusty corners and cobwebs on the lintels to  our weekly housekeeper, she replied, "I can't work for you. If I am to be that  thorough for you, everyone will expect the same service." She was trying to  balance six jobs each week and to please six different bosses. My complaints  had thrown her off balance.  </P> <P> I switched gears, eventually, from a self-employed housekeeper to a cleaning  service staffed by experienced women, bonded and trained.  </P> <P> First, we toured the house, new and clean, orderly and uncluttered, no  children, no pets. We reached agreement: once every two weeks, two women would  thoroughly clean our home. The cost was high. The list was long: shutters  dusted, carpets vacuumed, mirrors polished, tile floor scrubbed, bathrooms  sanitized. (I never found out what that meant. Perhaps, the small triangular  fold on the toilet paper rolls discouraged germs.)  </P> <P> Windows would be washed on the inside, never on the outside; the furniture  would be vacuumed, but, as I discovered, never moved; the bed would be made,  but the carpet beneath it was a DMZ. I signed a contract and agreed to a  24-hour cancellation policy, just like the dentist and the Hilton.  </P> <P> It is important to note at this point that I hate housework. It is a necessary  evil, because I hate dirt more. Thus, when two resolute women took over our  home on alternate Tuesdays, I was relieved. I trusted them; they walked in and  I walked out.  </P> <P> They must have thought that they had found an easy mark. When I returned an  hour and a half later, they were gone. They were not on roller skates but they  certainly must have sped around this house. Almost 1,700 square feet,  thoroughly (!) cleaned in 90 minutes?  </P> <P> At first glance, it was a miracle. The carpet looked brand new, the kitchen  floor shone, the roly-poly bugs in the sliding door tracks were gone. The  mirrors sparkled. Or did they? One was smeared, then another, each reflecting  the trail of an oily rag. The talcum that settles on everything in the bathroom  was still on the moldings. Behind the bedroom night table, the tissue I had  dropped and failed to pick up remained.  </P> <P> So we did a talk-around with the boss, then a walk-around with the employees.  Sweetness and light; promises, promises: "Thank you for telling us; we need to  know how best to please you." Poppycock! Employee/employer conversation: make  nice and she will go off shopping again.  </P> <P> Why didn't I fire them immediately? Good question. Over the years, I have fired  employees. "You are clearly not enjoying your work, so why waste your time.  Maybe I can help you find a more satisfactory slot." I fired a baby-sitter when  I found the kids' piggy bank getting lighter after each "sitting." Another  time, another sitter, we walked into the baby's room and were nearly overcome  by the odor of whiskey. We attempted to fire that woman on the spot, but she  was out cold. I knew I would have to do it in the morning, and I did.  </P> <P> The thought of starting again, training new people, is almost as distasteful to  me as discovering a spider web clinging to a lamp. So this time, we tried a  masculine approach.  </P> <P> My husband did the walk-around and pointed out dust and dirt they had  overlooked. Speedy and her partner responded with serious looks and silence,  which we assumed was acquiescence. Wrong. When they were bonded, the small  print must have read, "Agree, do not argue, we'll shoot it down later." It was  the day after they had left us, promising to be "more thorough" that the call  came: "We are taking you off our service." Unlike what I used to say to my  volunteers, there was no offer to help me look elsewhere.  </P> <P> So, while my husband pushes the vacuum (it takes him two hours to do all the  carpet thoroughly) and I dust the shutters and all of the ledges, I try to  understand it. Neither of us was ever trained for housework. In grammar school,  there was something called "homemaking," where we baked cupcakes, learned about  weights and measures and the importance of scrubbing the sink when we were  done. That is all I remember.  </P> <P> Today, my kitchen sink is usually spotless. I can still smell the cupcakes, too  much vanilla, and I recall the stained cookbook. But, that is all. Perhaps my  mother thought that keeping house would come natural to me; she was wrong.  Perhaps, too, my homemaking teacher thought I would notice and emulate her  sparkling, dust-free kitchen, cleaned no doubt by the janitorial staff after  school ended.  </P> <P> I have done no research on homemaking, but I do know that there are people who  enjoy keeping houses tidy and spotless, and it really does not matter whether  it is mine, yours or their own. They love that work.  </P> <P> Immediately after that woman fired us six years ago, I discovered Kathleen, a  delightful and intelligent person with a keen sense of humor. For five years,  she kept our house glowing. Kathleen never counted hours; instead, she counted  us as friends and we reciprocated, enthusiastically. If she overlooked  something, she usually found it before we did. She stayed until she finished,  whether we were at home or not. She was not bonded and she never folded the  last sheet of toilet tissue into a tiny triangle. But she did do one terrible  thing: she moved to Utah.  </P> <P> I believe now, sadly, that a "cleaning service" is that and that alone. I have  no right to expect it to have a heart, like Kathleen.  </P> <P> There are 23 commercial cleaning services in inland North County. I cannot  speak about all of them, obviously, but I am skittish about having a parade of  unfeeling strangers run through my house and stamp it "cleaned," without having  stopped to find out where they are and who we are. I am naive enough to  continue believing that, if one is willing to roll up sleeves, soil hands and  work hard, one should also care.  </P> <P> Our house is our home, with its own aesthetics and with an ambiance that  reflects us and our way of life. Like yours, our house has its own personality.  I fear that every house probably looks alike to the cleaning service people. If  it is Tuesday, it is Lake San Marcos. I would be pleased if, instead, the  mental message would be, if it is Tuesday, it is the Hermans.  </P> <P> Until we find someone who will care about us and our home, who will say, as  Kathleen used to: "How are you both feeling today -- how are your children?" my  husband and I will keep house. We are, thank God, able-bodied. Now I must run;  it is my turn to scrub the kitchen floor.  </P></p>

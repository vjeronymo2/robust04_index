			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Politics a mixed blessing in Milan and Madrid Politics was a mixed blessing for bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. It kept Milan volatile, currently on the upside, and yet another strategist, Mr Jerry Evans at Kleinwort Benson, said that political concerns were overdone and that Italian equities offered solid value. But political developments continued to depress Madrid. MILAN continued to forge ahead with the weak lira, at an all-time low against the D-Mark, offering an apparent bonus to foreign investors. The Comit index rose 5.65 to 612.91. Analysts commented that the market was looking beyond the political chaos surrounding Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government, and hoping that it would soon be replaced by a caretaker institutional administration, with a prime minister selected from outside the political parties. Blue chips were broadly higher. Fiat which set the pace early in the day finished L54 higher at L5,849, off a high of L5,885. Telecom Italia, under pressure recently over the concessions that it pays to the government on its mobile telephones, rebounded L120 or 3.0 per cent to L4,095. Credito Italiano picked up L16 to L1,660, with no takers seen for its Credito Romagnolo bid, but a fresh offer still not ruled out. Rolo finished L66 down at L18,850. MADRID, already depressed about the political future of its prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, dropped again after Monday's detention of a former state security chief in connection with anti-Eta undercover operations in the 1980s. The general index fell 2.91 to 293.46. Banesto dropped another Pta27 to Pta929 after an intraday low of Pta904 as its former chairman, Mr Mario Conde, resumed his high court testimony related to criminal charges filed last week. FRANKFURT recovered some of Monday's post bourse losses in the morning, but it could go no further in the afternoon as the Ibis indicated Dax ended at 2,080.16, up 13.57 after a session close of 2,079.93. Turnover fell from DM5.2bn to DM4.5bn. Dealers said that the market was waiting to hear the result of yesterday's FOMC meeting in Washington, although the Fed was not actually expected to act on US interest rates this week. There were contrasts in automotive stocks. BMW continued to rise, although analysts had said that its supply contract with Rolls Royce was a boost to sentiment, rather than BMW profits on any scale; the shares closed the afternoon another DM12 ahead at DM766; but Continental fell DM3.10 to DM218 after strength last week on a progress report from the tyremaker. PARIS moved in a narrow range as investors remained quiet ahead of events in the US. The CAC-40 index drifted down 3.37 to 1,924.72. Kleinwort Benson's French equity team remained neutral on the market, noting that in spite of a modest return of overseas institutions recently, upside was limited in the absence of the domestic investor and support from the bond market. In addition, the broker said, sentiment remained pressured by the overhanging privatisation programme, as well as political uncertainty ahead of April's presidential election. Danone rose FFr4 to FFr777, as the foods group took a controlling stake in Russia's biggest biscuit manufacturer. The acquisition fits in with the company's efforts to establish operations in emerging markets; it recently announced that it had taken a 50 per cent stake in an Argentine biscuit producer. ZURICH was higher in low volume, supported by gains in Roche and UBS, and the SMI index rose 14.0 to 2,614.7. UBS bearers gained SFr18 to SFr1,078, with the bank again said to be a buyer of the stock. Roche certificates rose SFr55 to SFr6,190 and BBC was SFr13 higher at SFr1,120 amid indications that some foreign investors were raising their holdings of dollar sensitive stocks. Ascom was SFr50 ahead at SFr1,350 in further response to the weekend news that the group had a new chief executive. Hero, the food group, saw its bearers up SFr13 to SFr658 and the registered SFr5 higher to SFr175, extending Monday's sharp gain on rumours that it was to be acquired by Del Monte for an estimated SFr1bn. AMSTERDAM barely moved, the AEX index retreating 0.21 to 410.64. Hoogovens outperformed, up Fl 1.40 to Fl 75.80; brokers said that it was supported by local investors. KPN, rising 70 cents to Fl 58.60, got similar treatment ahead of its expected listing as a constituent of the blue chip index.

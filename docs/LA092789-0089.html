			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> DIRT BAND NICE, HARDLY GRITTY  </P> <P> If nice guys finish last, at least they get to hang around long enough to be  last. With 23 years behind them, not too many bands have endured as long as the  Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, or with less acclaim.  </P> <P> The Dirt Band has certainly generated its share of hits, but aside from the  barrier-breaking 1972 "Will the Circle Be Unbroken" album, it has also been a  group easily taken for granted; just nice guys making nice music in a business  where nice is rarely a compliment.  </P> <P> The quartet's early show Monday at Santa Ana's Crazy Horse Steak House and  Saloon was proof of the continuing appeal of the band's good-timey country-rock  and an example of its limitations.  </P> <P> Founding member Jeff Hanna and guitar/bass/mandolin player Jimmy Ibbotson  handled the front line vocals with capable ease, with occasional lead vocals  from keyboardist Bob Carpenter, and Jimmy Fadden impressively playing drums and  harmonica simultaneously. But the aggregate effect was such that, if one had  found the Dirt Band playing in a hotel lounge, the response would more likely  be, "Hey, good lounge act" than "What cruel fate has denied these fellows their  rightful spot at the pinnacle of fame?"  </P> <P> Of the show's 18 songs, Bob Dylan's "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere" from the  newly-released "Circle, Vol. II" album, the Carpenter-sung "Stand a Little  Rain" and the round-like harmonies of "Fishing in the Dark" carried more weight  than most of the country-lite fare.  </P> <P> Certainly, two decades of playing "Mr. Bojangles" nightly hasn't added anything  to their hit version, already a sticky confection compared to the Jerry Jeff  Walker original.  </P> <P> Oddly, the one real standout of the performance was Ibbotson's "Ripplin'  Waters," a song once covered by John Denver. Sparked by a round of hot solos,  particularly Hanna's guitar workout, the song finally found the band living up  to its name and throwing some grit into the musical mix. JIM WASHBURN  </P></p>

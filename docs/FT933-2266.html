			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Construction Contracts: Single site court house takes shape in Utrecht PSA PROJECTS has been awarded the contract to design and supervise construction of the Utrecht Court House, a Fl 70m (Pounds 26m) project, concentrating the administration of justice in Utrecht on a single site. The contract was awarded by the development company Maatschappij voor Bedrijfsobjecten NV (MBO), a subsidiary of the Internationale Nederlandse Groep (lNG), the largest banking organisation in the Netherlands. At present, the adminstration of justice in Utrecht is spread across several sites. The 30,000 square metre court house will provide 13 new court rooms and 13 small hearing rooms, with ancillary spaces. The new court house is to be in the city centre, near the Utrecht Central Station. It is hoped that the building will improve control, efficiency and convenience. Since October 1992, a design team from PSA Projects Edinburgh, led by Coin Thorn, has been working with the Rijksgebouwendienst (the Dutch Public Works Department) on a preliminary design and has won the approval of the local planning authority. For this scheme, PSA Projects has teamed up with a local Dutch architectural practice, Buro Schiller. 'Two existing buildings with frontages on to the main street will be retained,' says Colin Thom, divisional director at PSA Projects. 'One of these is listed and was designed in the 19th Century by the architect Van Lockhorst for the Anatomy Department of Utrecht University, by which it is still used. A small district power station at the rear of the site will also be retained.'</p>

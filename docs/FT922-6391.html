			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / RAF redundancies THE RAF is to make an estimated 1,150 people redundant, some compulsorily if necessary, Mr Archie Hamilton, armed forces minister, announced yesterday. When the 1995 target strength of 75,000 was set it had been hoped to avoid redundancies. Air chief marshal Sir Peter Harding is to take over as chief of defence staff in December.</p>

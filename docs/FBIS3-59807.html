			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Elie Rekhes: "Moslem Movement Gains Strength </F> Here"]    [Text] Local media analysts have contended that Islamic  forces were "curbed" or "blocked" in last month's municipal  elections. This use of terminiology suggests the fears and  concerns engendered by the Islamic Movement (IM) in Israel. But  the actual results in the Arab sector show that the IM actually  got stronger.    Its representatives climbed from 51 to 59, and the number of  communities in which the movement has won representation rose  from 14 to 16, including three mixed cities--Ramle, Lod, and  'Akko.    In Rahat, the Beduin township in the Negev, the IM lost the  council leadership; but in Kafr Kari, it won the top council  spot. In Kafr Kana, the Islamic representative will rotate as  head of the council for half a term.    Generally, the public put its trust in IM representatives in  those communities where the movement had already proven itself  as an efficient and active municipal force. One of the  movement's biggest achievements was getting residents involved  in community functions by instilling the virture of  "self-reliance." It replaced the old approach of dependency to  an activistic approach that emphasized community members.    In those communities where it has operated since 1989, the  movement showed itself to be a well-organized and well-oiled  mechanism. Its representatives operated in a pragmatic fashion,  cooperating with various government agencies. So, after four  years, the movement could boast the establishment of  kindergardens, improved health service, more paved roads, new  libraries, removal of alcohol, setting up drug clinics,  lessening crime, and developing an independent basketball league  and other sports activities.    Nor did the IM operate only in the narrow municipal sense.  It also demonstrated wide-ranging activities on a national  scale, especially in the Committee of Arab Council Leaders.  Shaykh Ra'id al-Salah, the mayor of Umm-al-Fahm, did not miss a  meeting and initiated projects which he took the trouble to  execute.    At the same time, the IM undertook religious activities. Its  municipal activities were carried out under "the Green Flag"  (the color of Muhammad's banner) and the slogan: "Islam is the  solution." The organization worked to deepen the religious cast  of the Arab community by spreading the wearing of Islamic  traditional clothing and the availability of religious  literature.    And the number of mosques in Israel grew dramatically from  80  in 1988 to 240 in 1993.    Special effort was exerted in spreading the cultural-social  message of the IM via educational institutions ranging from  kindergardens to a college for religious law. Simultaneously,  the IM led the battle to have properties of the Waqf (Islamic  Religious Council) returned to Muslim control, succeeding where  its opponents had failed over the years. It reawakened the  religious conscience of the Muslims in Israel, tying the subject  of the Waqf to the Muslim identity of Palestine.    Since 1989, the IM projected support for the intifadah and  its publications widely featured the activities of Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement], the Islamic force in the  territories. The IM also sent food and clothing to Hamas and  adopted 2,500 orphans from the territories.    It led demonstrations protesting the expulsion last December  of 415 Hamas activists, and demanded their return.    In recent weeks, backers of Hamas have appeared prominently  in the IM's weekly SAWT AL-HAQQ WAL-HURRIYAH (The Voice of Truth  and Freedom), often appearing to be Hamas' mouthpiece. It has  featured Khalid 'Amayun of Hebron, Fu'ad Shahin of Jenin, and  Isma'il al-Jamal of Jericho. At the same time, the IM has  strengthened its ties to Islamic forces in Egypt and elsewhere  in the world.    The 1993 municipal elections symbolize the coming of age,  the  political institutionalization, of the IM. It moved away from  its earler image of an elite cadre that used only the purest of  methods. Now it took off its gloves and got into the political  arena with other political forces, forging political deals when  needed.    Also in the social sphere, the IM abandoned as illusory its  original idea that it could form a new social context beyond the  family and the clan group. Instead, it tried to work out some  form of cooperation with these institutions, forming alliances  with certain family clans in some localities. This was  particularly true in Kafr Qasim where the clans were  incorporated under the Islamic Alliance (al-Hilf al-Islami).    It is important that the IM's leaders view their effors as  successful and that they have long-term goals and much patience:  al-Haqq, or divine justice and absolute truth, will win even if  it takes years. And it is fair to say that the IM's future  success will depend on several factors:     -  The IM will have to safeguard its own internal unity even  as regional developments of other Islamic movements (in the  territories, Egypt, North Africa, and Jordan) will have the  impact on the IM in Israel.    -  The Arab community's ability to emerge from its  post-Communist  sense of crisis will be important.    -  The IM will continue to be measured by its record in the  municipal sphere where other political forces have failed.</p>

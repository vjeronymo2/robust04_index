			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pavel Shinkarenko: "Partnership Requires Repeal </F> of Jackson-Vanik Amendment"]    [Text] The Russian prime minister, who took part in the  work of the Russian-U.S. intergovernment commission for economic  and technical cooperation which ended yesterday, has used his  stay in Washington to lend new impetus to Russian-U.S.  relations, primarily in the economic field.    The partnership relations which are taking shape between  Moscow and Washington have had a positive effect on trade  dialogue. In 1993 trade turnover between Russia and the United  States increased 20 percent compared with 1992 and was $4.3  billion (in 1992 it was about $3.6 billion). There has been an  almost threefold increase in exports -- from $639.9 million to  $1.997 billion, which has made it possible in practice to reduce  to a minimum the traditional deficit in reciprocal trade: In  1992 Russian exports were a little more than four times less  than imports from the United States. Unfortunately the structure  of trade turnover remains the same -- reciprocal deliveries are  based on raw material and agricultural goods. At a time when  machine building articles make up only 2 percent of Russian  exports to the United States.    An analysis conducted by experts on the eve of the  Washington  session showed that it is not so much the uncompetitive nature  of many Russian goods which remain a serious obstacle in mutual  trade as U.S. barriers on the path of high-technology items made  in Russia and the tough antidumping legislation. That is why,  when he set off across the ocean to take part in the  intergovernment commission, Viktor Chernomyrdin was pursuing two  more attendant aims. The first was to persuade legislators to  repeal the notorious Jackson-Vanik amendments to the trade law  which makes granting partners most-favored nation status  dependent on freedom to leave those countries, while the second  aim was to get the U.S. Administration to recognize Russia's  status as a country with a transitional market economy.    Viktor Chernomyrdin's meeting yesterday with President Bill  Clinton and the talk the day before in the U.S. Congress seems  to have advanced matters from a standstill. Viktor Stepanovich  said that he "succeeded in persuading the U.S. Administration to  grant Russia the status of a country with a transitional market  economy" and Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy commented as  follows on Moscow's request: "I think that restrictions on  trade with Russia should be repealed and will be repealed. That  will require a certain amount of work. But many restrictions  are left from the cold war and they do not apply to the present  day."</p>

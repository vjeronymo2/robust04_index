			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Water row may drown Scots Tories: A look at the party driven to say no to privatisation The Scottish Conservatives last week began issuing leaflets with the unusual headline: 'Tories say no to privatisation.' The leaflets emphasised that the government had no intention of privatising Scotland's water and sewerage industry in spite of claims to the contrary from opposition parties. Water has become the big issue in next month's elections for Scotland's nine regional and three island councils. The regions are due to be abolished in 1996 and replaced by about 30 all-purpose councils absorbing the 53 districts, so councillors elected on May 5 will serve for only two years. This may have made the election campaign almost invisible on the doorstep, but has not stopped the parties arguing. The opposition sees the water issue as a good way of pointing out the ideological differences between themselves and the Tories. The subject stirs feelings in Scotland which have little counterpart in England and Wales where water services are in private hands. Most Scots believe water is a God-given asset that must be left in public hands. It is therefore surprising that a government which has taken care since the 1992 general election not to offend the Scots allowed the issue to gain such momentum. The Conservatives contemplated privatising the Scottish water industry to manage water services after the abolition of the regional councils which now run it. In spite of very early signs from opinion polls that privatisation was highly unpopular, even with Tories, the government was slow last year to declare unequivocally that it was off the agenda. Its solution, to create three publicly owned water authorities, aroused anxiety because they would not be under local government control and could be privatised later. In March some 97 per cent of people voting in a referendum in Strathclyde region, which is centred on Glasgow and contains about half the Scottish population, said they wanted water to remain in local government hands. The turnout in this postal ballot was 71 per cent. Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, denounced the referendum as irrelevant. But two weeks ago he emphasised that councillors would be on the water authorities' boards, possibly in a majority. The government was not privatising water 'by the front door, the back door or any other door' and that would remain the government's policy 'for many years'. However the opposition shows no wish to drop the idea that the Tories will privatise water. Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National party, was pictured by a reservoir denouncing privatisation, while Mrs Jean McFadden, Labour leader of Glasgow district council, wrote in the Glasgow Evening Times that water privatisation was 'the latest stage in the government's systematic plundering of public assets for private profit'. Pensioners, she said, would have to 'think twice before they make a cup of tea'. The misrepresentation of the Tories' position has probably invigorated their election campaign, leading them to denounce the opposition for deceit. Yet they face a tough fight, standing at only 13 per cent in the Scottish opinion polls, their lowest-ever level, and blamed for income tax rises and the imposition of VAT on fuel. They control none of the regional councils and hold only 52 of the 453 regional council seats being contested. The reform of local government has some, largely silent, supporters outside the Tory party, but more see it as an attempt by the Conservatives to regain lost ground in local government by gerrymandering the boundaries of the new single-tier councils. Labour dominates local government in the central belt: it controls four regions - Strathclyde, Central, Fife and Lothian - and governs Tayside (centred on Dundee) and Grampian (around Aberdeen) in coalition with the SNP. Labour is fielding 350 candidates, about the same number as the Conservatives, but Mr George Robertson, shadow Scottish secretary, says it will do well to hold the gains it made in 1990 when it took 44 per cent of the vote at the height of Tory unpopularity over the poll tax. The SNP stands at 26 per cent in the opinion polls and thus claims to be the second party in Scottish politics. It is fielding 370 candidates, more than any other party, and claims good prospects of becoming the biggest party in Grampian and Tayside. Its main challenge is to Labour which it accuses of doing nothing to save Scottish water and of allowing the Scottish local government bill to complete its committee stage last week with few significant changes.</p>

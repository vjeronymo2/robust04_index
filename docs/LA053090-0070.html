			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ARTS  </P> <P> NEA Study Commission Meets: The belated first meeting of the Independent  Commission on the Arts and Humanities -- established by Congress last year to  conduct a broad inquiry into procedures of the National Endowment for the Arts  and National Endowment for the Humanities -- will be held next Wednesday in  Washington.  </P> <P> The 12-member commission, which does not yet have a staff, originally was to  have completed its work by now when it was set up last fall. Delays in the  naming of its members by the White House caused the commission to fall badly  behind schedule. No revised timetable for its recommendations has been set.  GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

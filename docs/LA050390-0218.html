			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART OF DINING: 3,979 CALORIES;  </P> <P> AN 8-COURSE MEAL RAISES $200,000 FOR MUSEUM  </P> <P> The next day, they swam laps, jogged on the beach, exercycled, Nautilized,  Stairmastered or otherwise atoned.  </P> <P> Maybe. Or maybe they napped, with visions of raspberry cinnamon souffle tart  with caramel sauce dancing in their heads.  </P> <P> Whatever they did on Monday, the 450 guests of Sunday's Art of Dining III  surely reflected on the marathon gourmet meal that slid down their gullets the  night before. And the wine (maybe they munched a few aspirin) that complemented  each course.  </P> <P> "For all the health-conscious people," chef Joachim Splichal told the banquet  crowd, as dessert was served, "the calorie count of (this meal) is 3,979."  </P> <P> A few groans answered Splichal's arithmetic, a ripple of laughter rose from the  tables, then the happy clinking of silverware on plates resumed.  </P> <P> As it has in previous years, the three-hour, eight-course food fest -- hosted  by the Business Council of the Newport Harbor Art Museum -- took place in the  Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach. The $250-per-person benefit raised an  estimated $200,000 for museum exhibitions and collections, thanks to a $100,000  underwriting gift from Judie and George Argyros.  </P> <P> Splichal, owner of L.A.'s Patina restaurant, coordinated the culinary efforts  of nine other chefs, with technical assists from a hotel staff that included 24  line cooks, five executive stewards and 55 servers, according to Jose Barragan,  director of banquets.  </P> <P> Annotating the proceedings, emcee Michael Mondavi set a pleasantly irreverent  tone, veering from quirky personal comments ("Isn't nepotism great?" the wine  scion began) to an insider's critique of the liquid portions of the meal.  </P> <P> The fume blanc accompanying the eggplant caviar appetizer was said by Mondavi  to have "crispness and life." The Pinot Noir served with the truffle-seasoned  pasta dish was said to be "very velvety and very soft," while a "more  structured and more intense" Cabernet Sauvignon was poured with the roasted  lamb chop entree.  </P> <P> Even those who never thought of a drink as having a "structure" could  appreciate Mondavi's description of the vin served with dessert. "In Napa, we  call this the navel wine," he said, because it "should be consumed from the  navel of a friend."  </P> <P> Before each course, the chef who dreamed up the dish stood rather uncomfortably  in front of a closed-circuit camera in the kitchen holding a sample serving.  Two huge screens in the banquet hall relayed the image of a smiling chef before  the cameraman zoomed in for a Big Brotherish close-up of the food, which  hovered over the black-tie crowd while a small army of white-gloved waiters  marched from the kitchen.  </P> <P> Splichal enlisted colleagues Susan Spicer of Bayona in New Orleans; Charlie  Trotter of Charlie Trotter's in Chicago; Christopher Gross of Christopher's in  Phoenix; Pierre Herme of Fauchon in Paris; Hubert Keller of Fleur De Lys in San  Francisco; Michel Galloyer of Le Trianon in Angers France; Andre Mandion of  Mandion in Anglet Saint-Jean, France; Debra Ponzek of Montrachet in New York;  and Michel Pieton executive chef of the Newport Beach Four Seasons Hotel.  </P> <P> The dinner was co-chaired by Samuel Goldstein and Samuel Haynes.  </P> <P> Among guests were Joan and Don Beall, Marion and Jack Shea, Berdie and Harry  Bubb, Susan and Timothy Strader, Kathryn Thompson and Gus Owen, Elizabeth and  Tom Tierney, Pat and Dick Allen, Janice and Roger Johnson, Deeann and Al  Baldwin, and Lee West, who donated a Jaguar that was sticker-priced $57,910 and  bought by the Bubbs in a between-courses live auction for $54,000.  </P> <P> Back to Nature: The Museum of Natural History and Science drew more than 600  guests to a private slice of South County wilderness on Saturday for "A Nature  Affair" -- an afternoon fund-raiser and educational event featuring guided  nature walks, a steel drum band and a Mexican fiesta.  </P> <P> Held on a sunbaked five-acre campground in San Juan Capistrano -- part of  Rancho Mission Viejo, the vast O'Neill family holdings -- the $40-per-person  ($10 for kids) benefit raised an estimated $20,000 for the museum, according to  Executive Director Dudley Varner.  </P> <P> Guests got their first taste of nature when they pulled off Ortega Highway onto  the mile of gravel road leading to "Campos de los Amantes" (roughly, "Lovers  Fields") -- the taste, smell and feel of dust billowing up to their windows.  </P> <P> After parking in the tall grass outside the fenced-in campground, the nature  lovers headed to the canteen for sodas, beer, wine and margaritas, then toured  exhibits set in the shade of California oaks on the perimeter of the field.  </P> <P> Native plants and trees brought by a local nursery were on display, as were  butterflies, spiders, silkworms, turtles and seven raptors from the Orange  County Bird of Prey Center in Villa Park (one of whom, an adult male  great-horned owl, was ceremonially set free at day's end).  </P> <P> Paul Apodaca, curator of folk art at the Bowers Museum, told folk tales and  Indian stories. Kristin Clark demonstrated the hand spinning of wool, cotton  and flax. Other booths featured basket weavers, native jewelry and experts on  subjects ranging from earthquakes and liquefaction to Orange County mountain  lions.  </P> <P> Mike Berment and the Despers performed Caribbean music. A late-afternoon lunch  of Mexican specialties from the nearby O'Neill-owned El Adobe restaurant was  served buffet-style.  </P> <P> Varner said the museum, which now operates in a 7,000-square foot temporary  location in Newport Beach, will move to another centrally located site this  summer, where it will remain for several years until a permanent residence is  built on county-donated land in the planned community of Aliso Viejo.  </P></p>

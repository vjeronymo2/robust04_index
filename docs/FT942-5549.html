			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The official Australian market indicator closed this week at 628 cents a kg., 11 cents higher than a week before and at a new high for the season. The market cannot however be described as outstandisgly buoyant. Finer Merinoes were again in strong demand, and there were price increases affecting other categories, but New Zealand was a cheaper market. An erratic and uncertain market impression is not unusual towards the end of a selling season, but it is making the task of passing on recent wool price rises to retailers a good deal more difficult. For wool the rises in price has been enhanced by currency changes, with the Australian dollar strong against the US dollar as well as against sterling.</p>

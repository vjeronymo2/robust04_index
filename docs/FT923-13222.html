			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Business and the Environment: Academic brains go up for sale Are you uncertain about what to do with your company's hazardous waste? Keen to clean up an unsightly rubbish tip? Britain's universities are eager to help. The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals is unabashedly touting for business. Its latest environment policy package contains a catalogue* of environmental research achievements and a range of environmental services on offer to British business. A growing number of universities now offer inter-disciplinary research centres, science parks and limited companies with exploitable resources for industry. Environmental subjects include global warming and water pollution, waste management, environmental auditing, accounting and law. Financial constraints on universities have hastened the trend towards sharing academic expertise with the outside world. Sheffield University, for example, set up Environmental Consultancy, its advisory unit, in 1986 and now contributes to a range of budgets across the campus. The unit's turnover has increased six-fold since its inception, and the number of clients has risen to about 70 from 16. They include local businesses, quoted companies, government bodies and even local residents. Clients have commissioned work worth anything from an hourly rate to Pounds 100,000. Industry employs the university because its expertise includes access to analytical equipment, library facilities and worldwide databases - and because it represents an independent voice, says Chris Routh, manager of Environmental Consultancy. The stereotype of the woolly-headed academic is incorrect, he adds. 'A lot of people that we use within the university have worked in industry, have practical commercial experience, know what the client wants and know the most cost-effective way of getting the answer for them.' There are many ways in which industry and universities can work together: Training courses tailor-made for industrial personnel, conducted at the university or the work place. Brunel University offers a 'hands on' course on environmental auditing, while the London School of Economics' geography department runs courses in environmental planning and management, for government, commerce and industry. Consultancy contracts for advice on specific or general problems. University of Sheffield's Environmental Consultancy performs environmental audits and advises on land reclamation, with such clients as Mercedes Benz and the National Rivers Authority. Collaborative research programmes involving a university and one or more large companies for long-term or strategic research, which may qualify for part-funding schemes. Loughborough University is leading a consortium of international companies, universities and research institutions to develop eco-friendly cars. Contract research commissioned from universities to help companies with R&amp;D needs. At Kent University, Viridian Bioprocessing can make a bacterial soup to eat industrial effluent. Longer-term environmental research is also proving applicable to industry. The University of Stirling advises companies how to cope with the possible effect of global warming on longer-term planning, investment and market share. Reed beds are being researched at the University of Birmingham for a cost-effective way of treating waters polluted by industrial waste, while at Kent University, scientists have helped the Yorkshire wool industry by using bacteria to break down the harmful pesticides which are washed out of the fleeces. *Universities Work for the Environment.

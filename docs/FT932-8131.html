			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Technology: A different angle on an old problem - A look at an Australian company which may have a solution to a three-dimensional challenge In the arcane world of imaging techniques, there is no shortage of researchers trying to crack the problem of producing three-dimensional images which can be seen on a flat screen without the aid of special glasses or visors. Most of the big electronics companies have investigated the problem and several techniques are being developed. All share a crucial problem, however  -the image disappears or is impaired if the observer changes position. The 'sweet spot' problem restricts the potential of such systems to single-user applications such as computer-aided design, in which the screen is viewed from a consistent angle by an operator who does not move around. So far, the challenge of developing a three-dimensional system which can be viewed from any angle in front of the screen and, therefore, by large numbers of people watching from different angles, has defeated all comers. However, a small Australian company called Trutan has produced a potential solution which is regarded as promising by imaging experts at IBM, the US computer company. Trutan is an unlikely source of technological innovation. The company is a joint venture between Arnotts, an Australian biscuit company, and Biceku, a family company controlled by Donald Martin, a Sydney businessman. In true inventor style, most of the development work has been carried out in a couple of cramped rooms on an industrial estate in suburban Sydney by Martin and Bjorn Olsson, a Swedish-born film technician. Neither has a background in imaging technology, although Martin stresses that some of the technical work was carried out by academic researchers at universities in Cambridge, Melbourne and Brisbane. Martin says he stumbled across the three-dimensional imagery system almost by accident while trying to develop a large-scale projection system for use by Arnotts in the kind of entertainment simulators now appearing in suburban shopping malls. So far, only one prototype has been constructed and that suffers from technical defects - principally a lack of brightness - which make the image appear dull and slightly fuzzy. Yet imaging experts who have seen the prototype have been impressed by its potential. James Lipscombe, an IBM researcher who specialises in stereoscopic imaging, says its defects are minor and easily solved. Martin says his research into visorless, three-dimensional suggests that most researchers since the war have concluded that the idea was 'about as feasible as perpetual motion'. But a post-war French researcher called Francois Savoie invented a mechanical contraption called a cyclostereoscope which produced partial three-dimensional images over a small angle of view. Savoie's machine consists of a vertical axle with a wheel at each end and a series of vertical strips fixed to the rims of the wheel. A small screen is placed inside the ring of strips, on to which a pair of slide projectors project separate left and right images. The photographs have to be taken with a double lens camera - not in itself a technical problem. When the machine is rotated, the vertical strips form a moving grid in front of the screen which separates the image into alternate left and right images, replicating normal stereoscopic vision. Martin's 'improved' version of the cyclostereoscope produces a three-dimensional image with a near 180-degree angle of view. However, the image is weak, and is distorted by the moving grid, which remains visible in front of the screen. This problem is reduced when the image is viewed on a flat-screen computer monitor situated behind a liquid crystal display screen - effectively an electronic version of the cyclostereoscope. The computer is programmed to display left and right views of slides in segments which are viewed through a series of oscillating parallel bars on the LCD screen which match the segments on the computer monitor. The LCD grid oscillates at a rate which makes it invisible to the observer while directing the left and right images to the correct eyes, producing the three-dimensional illusion. It does work, at least with static images. Martin claims the system could be adapted for use in broadcasting. However, the company says the technical limitations of the present video standard impose problems that are impossible to overcome - chiefly, a noticeable flicker caused by the frame rate (the speed at which image frames succeed each other on screen). This happens because of difficulties in blending the left and right images and the oscillating grid when the image changes. Research indicates that even high-definition television systems, which use a higher frame rate than existing broadcasting systems, would suffer from some degree of flicker. Two possible solutions have been identified: restricting the system to specialised, custom-made units with frame rates at least double the existing standard; and developing a special monitor incorporating the LCD grid in the screen. In the meantime, the company claims several Australian companies are investigating possible industrial applications for the system, such as remote control of mining vehicles in dangerous areas. However, Martin says the shortage of development capital in Australia means the technology is likely to be sold to an overseas company for further development.</p>

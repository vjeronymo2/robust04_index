"I don't eat breakfast. I  drink three or four cups of coffee and go eat lunch. . . . I don't think my  diet habits are what they should be."  </P> <P> Kansas State's improvement has to be put in perspective, but the turnaround  from a 1-10 record in 1989 to 3-1 this season has fans impressed at Manhattan,  Kan.  </P> <P> The three victories match the Wildcats' win total of the previous four seasons.  The Wildcats scored 134 points last season. This year they already have 152.  </P></p>

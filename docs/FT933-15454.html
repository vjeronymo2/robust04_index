			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool With no wool being held in the main wool producing countries, prices are static. In wool-using countries holidays are beginning to have their usual effect, underlining dullness due to the recess in the wool selling season. Sales from the Australian stockpile continue, at a low but not discouraging rate, with the emphasis on superfine merino fleece but some support elsewhere. The feeling is that at present wool prices production in primary markets will decline more than already forecast. Recovery in the UK and US economies is not seen as sufficient to offset recession in Japan and Europe which used to buy large quantities.</p>

His visit  lasted nine days from 23 February to 4 March, which was not  long, but he set off an upsurge, that is, a "China fever", in  Japan.    Zhu Rongji's visit to Japan came at a period of historical  transition. As the Cold War is over and the role of economic  factors is getting more and more important, Japan is still  exploring what kind of development strategy it is going to take.  Moreover, in view of the latest situation, Japan is forced to  make quick decisions. Trade friction between the United States  and Japan is becoming increasingly acute, the United States has  decided to impose sanctions on Japan and force the yen to  appreciate to deal a blow against Japanese exports. However,  the Japanese economy is in a state of recession, and, in the  wake of last year's negative growth, the situation this year is  grimmer. Japan must blaze a new trail if it wants to extricate  itself from the dilemma.    The rapid rise of the Chinese economy gives Japan an  historical opportunity. Although far-sighted Japanese  enterprises identify the bright prospects of China, many people  still have doubts and misgivings: Whether or not China can curb  inflation to ensure social stability and healthy economic  development. Whether or not China's monetary and foreign  exchange reform will infringe on foreign business interests.  Whether or not a developed China will become a competitor of  Japan, thus infringing on Japan's economic interests. Such  misgivings were reflected in the Japanese press prior to Zhu  Rongji's visit to Japan.    During his visit, Zhu Rongji called on Japanese Emperor  Akihito and met Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Vice  Premier and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, and key government  and public figures. The sides reached a consensus in many  respects. Meanwhile, a noticeable characteristic of Zhu Rongji's  visit was his extensive contact and profound exchange with  figures of Japanese economic circles. When Zhu Rongji visited  Tokyo, Osaka, and Fukuoka, Japan's national as well as local  economic groups, large financial groups, and major banks  displayed unprecedented zeal in welcoming him and discussing  with him issues of trade and economic cooperation between the  two countries. Such a scene has seldom been seen in Japanese  economic circles since Sino-Japanese relations were normalized.  When a lecture by Zhu Rongji was jointly organized by NIHON  KEIZAI SHIMBUN [JAPAN ECONOMIC NEWS], the Japan International  Trade Promotion Association, and the Japanese Foreign Ministry,  more than 2,700 people, mainly from Japanese economic circles,  wanted to attend, but due to the limited space of the  prearranged assembly hall, only 900 or so were given such a  chance. At the lecture, the atmosphere was friendly and lively,  and people constantly responded to Zhu's speech with warm  applause. During his visit to Japan, Zhu Rongji met as many as  280 leading figures of large Japanese enterprises, groups,  corporations, and banks, and sometimes 12 such meetings a day  were arranged, whereas over 1,500 people from Japanese economic  circles directly attended Zhu Rongji's lectures or listened to  his speeches.    Through contacts and informal discussions with figures from  the Japanese economic circles, Zhu Rongji briefed them on the  situation of China's reform and opening up, measures taken to  curb inflation, policies formulated to protect foreign business  interests, and so on. Moreover, he helped figures from Japanese  economic circles understand that if Japan wants to get over the  current economic recession, it must, apart from taking the old  method of stimulating demand, lay stress on readjusting its  industrial structure, that is, it must shift its focus away from  manufacturing industries, turn to industries with higher surplus  value, enhance its products' competitive power, and open up to  the overseas market. Meanwhile, Japan must focus on the Asian  region, particularly on economic cooperation with China, because  the Asian region, especially China, is the most vigorous and  most rapidly developing place in the present global economy. As  proved by the facts over the past two years, such economic  cooperation is the most effective means to reinvigorate the  Japanese economy.    Once he arrived in the Kansai Region of Japan, Zhu Rongji  immediately found that although Japan was in an economic  recession, Kansai was still the most dynamic economic region in  Japan. One of the reasons is that this region's economic and  trade activities with China now accounts for 40 percent of its  overall external economic activities.    With the rapid development of the Chinese economy, Zhu  Rongji told Japanese economic circles, last year three records  were broken on an unprecedented scale in terms of Sino-Japanese  economic and trade relations. First, Sino-Japanese trade volume  reached a historical record of $39 billion. Japan became the  No. 1 trade partner of China, whereas China became the No. 2  trade partner of Japan for the first time. Second, Japan's  technology export trade to China accounted for 28 percent of  China's technology imports, which ranked first. Another point  is that the rate of realizable funds given by Japanese  enterprises to China ranked first. Zhu Rongji stressed that the  rapid development of Sino-Japanese economic and trade relations  not only benefited China, but also contributed to the  revitalization of the Japanese economy. Zhu Rongji told  Japanese economic circles on many occasions during his visit  that Sino-Japanese trade volume, which amounted to $39 billion,  was not large enough and was even very small compared with the  potential of Sino-Japanese cooperation. He reckoned that  according to the present trend of development, Sino-Japanese  trade volume may reach $390 billion within the next decade and  China would become the No. 1 trade partner of Japan. Zhu Rongji  added that Japan transferred its technology to China mainly  through cooperation in production and setting up joint ventures,  which would only enhance the competitive power of Japanese  products in overseas market. He said that China and Japan,  which cooperated with each other in developing the global  market, were partners of equality and mutual benefit rather than  competitors. These insider's remarks made by Zhu Rongji helped  Japanese economic circles dispel their doubts.    During Zhu Rongji's stay in Japan, television stations,  radio  stations, and newspapers from all over Japan vigorously reported  news related to his visit and, in particular, focused on  reporting how his visit helped promote economic and trade  relations between the two countries.    A commentary published by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN said: "Vice  Premier Zhu's convincing explanation and humorous wording helped  dispel people's doubts." Keizo Tomiyasu, president of Japan's  Shin Goyo Corporation, said after listening to Zhu Rongji's  speech: "Last year, our company's trade volume with China was  approximately 15 billion yen. This year, the trade volume will  double, and in the next two years, we will strive to explore new  fields of cooperation." Authoritative figures from Japanese  economic circles predicted that within the next five years,  investments made by Japanese enterprises in China would outstrip  that of ASEAN.    The clouds have been dispersed and the blue sky is shown. We  can expect that Sino-Japanese economic and trade relations will  advance to a new stage of development soon.</p>

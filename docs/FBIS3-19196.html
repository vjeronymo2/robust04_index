She noted that the decision to lift the  parliamentary immunity of certain Democracy Party [DEP] deputies  is Turkey's internal affair.    In reply to a reporter's question aboard a plane on her way  from Ankara to Balikesir, Ciller said that she explained the  situation to the European Parliament officials with whom she  met. Ciller recalled that a similar case had occurred in  Belgium and that the immunity of certain deputies had been  lifted. Turkish Radio and Television correspondent Yurdaer  Tartan reports that Ciller said that democracy means freedom and  that the True Path Party is the party that attaches the most  importance to this principle. Ciller said: Everyone is  commenting. Democracy is a regime in which freedoms and rights  are balanced. No one has the right to help murderers under the  guise of exercising their right to freedom. No one has the  right to violate the constitution. That is not a state of law  but one of anarchy.</p>

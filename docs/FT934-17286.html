			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Rutland Trust ahead at Pounds 3.6m PRE-TAX profits of Rutland Trust, the financial services and property surveying group, edged ahead from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 3.6m in the six months to end-June. However, earnings per share rose by 11 per cent to 0.93p (0.84p). Mr Michael Langdon, chief executive, described the results as 'satisfactory'. The first half in the head office/corporate finance division was 'particularly active'. Its pre-tax profits rose by 10 per cent to Pounds 704,000 (Pounds 639,000). In addition to its normal corporate finance work, the division was closely involved in the acquisition in August of Ben Shaws, a Yorkshire-based soft drinks maker, for Pounds 5.7m. Rutland believes it has the financial skills to develop the acquisition as a separate business within the group. Mr Langdon said that Capital Industries, in which Rutland has a 42.6 per cent interest, had been transformed by the acquisition in September last year of Samuel Jones, a specialist manufacturer of sticky labels. This had led to a near-threefold rise in Capital Industries' shares, leaving Rutland with an investment worth Pounds 20m but on the books at Pounds 7m. He would not be drawn on when the group would take its profits. Pre-tax profits in the asset financing division, which is involved in vehicle contract hire, fell 40 per cent, from Pounds 892,000 to Pounds 536,000. Mr Langdon said he expected a similar result in the second half. The division's pre-tax outcome for 1992 was Pounds 858,000. Profits from professional services were ahead nearly 20 per cent, from Pounds 2m to Pounds 2.4m. Ellis &amp; Buckle, the loss adjusting business which forms the bulk of the division, maintained its profitability in a more difficult market, Mr Langdon said. Hunter &amp; Partners, the architectural and building surveying practice, had moved into the black, reflecting an improved economic environment. Group turnover rose from Pounds 46.4m to Pounds 50.5m. The interim dividend is maintained at 0.27p.</p>

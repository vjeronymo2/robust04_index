			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Business advice shop to open late THE FIRST of the government's one-stop business advice centres will open next month - about three months behind schedule. One-stop shops in nine English regions - including Birmingham, Cheshire, Tyneside and Leicestershire - are vying to be the first to open to companies seeking advice on all aspects of how to run their affairs. About 30 outlets are expected to open in the nine regions. The Department of Trade and Industry, which is putting Pounds 5.5m into the scheme over the next three years, plans a network of 200 shops throughout the country - to be known as Business Links. In a move that may be critical in determining how effectively the centres do their job, Baroness Denton, the minister responsible for small businesses, will soon start discussions with ministers in other departments to encourage them to make their business services accessible through the centres. Customers will be able to use the centres, which are recruiting core staff at the moment, for advice on a range of issues from market intelligence and exporting, to training and guidance on available finance. Lady Denton expects the centres quickly to compile registers of freelance specialists, such as translators and debt collectors, whom customers can recruit on a short-term basis. The units will normally be open from early morning until well into the evening. Some services are to be free but others will be charged for. The Department of Trade and Industry first announced its intention to create the business centres in July 1992.</p>

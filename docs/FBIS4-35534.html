			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for </F> the Hamas Movement, by Samih al-Ma'ayitah in Damascus; date not  given]    [Text] [Al-Ma'ayitah] The topical issue is how Hamas will  deal with the self-rule authority. The Movement has to choose  between confrontation, understanding, or a truce. What option  have the Movement's bodies adopted?    [Ghawshah] This issue is complex and wide-ranging. I will  try to discuss the basic topics dealing with it. First, let us  say that the stage of theorization about what stand Hamas will  adopt if the Palestinian authority is imposed and the  Palestinian police enters the self-rule areas is over. All the  Palestinian forces, those who supported or opposed the peace  process which started in Madrid and ended with the Cairo  agreement are now treading on a minefield. They all should think  before taking any step to avoid an explosion that would destroy  everything. Hamas has taken measures to counter this stage.  The Hamas Movement has resorted to all that is in its power to  confront the march of capitulation which began in Madrid, and  succeeded in obstructing and delaying this march. There is a  mighty force behind this process, represented by the United  States, the Zionist forces, and the regimes loyal to them, and  these forces succeded in imposing the Cairo and Oslo agreement  on the Palestinian people. The hands of the clock cannot be set  back, but we can make proposals that would prevent the explosion  and at least limit the losses. We in the Hamas Movement  approach the Palestinian authority and the police force with  caution. We will judge them on the basis of their deeds and  not their words, especially sweet talk which is rife at the  present time. We believe that avoiding confrontation is a  national and religious duty by which all should abide.    The Hamas Movement has translated this into a political  stand  and decision not to confront the Palestinian authority and  police force. We will deal with them in a civilized and peaceful  manner by highlighting the mistakes, secrets, and loopholes in  the Cairo and Oslo agreements and mobilizing the masses and  forces in and outside the territories to reject this agreement  and foil it with civilized methods. This is the stand of the  Palestinian opposition, represented in the Alliance of  Palestinian Forces. The Palestinian police force is part of the  Palestinian people. Most of its members are from the Palestine  Liberation Army [PLA] and had fought the Zionists in many  places, particularly in Lebanon during the Zionist invasion of  that country. We are fully convinced and we know that this  police force has decided not to confront the Palestinian people  with bullets. But the overwhelming circumstances to which I  referred at the beginning of the interview have forced the PLA  to become a police force that carries out joint patrols with the  Jews, and whose members eat with the Jews and live with them and  normalize their relations with them. We are fully convinced  that the members of this police force will not open fire on the  children of the stones or the strugglers whose role has been  instrumental in achieving the partial withdrawal from the Gaza  Strip, and whose role will also be instrumental in achieving any  future withdrawal from the West Bank. This has taken place  thanks to the blood they had shed and their sacrifices and not  as a result of the intelligence and ability of the negotiators.    [Al-Ma'ayitah] A few months ago, Hamas used to call the  Palestinian police force as a Lahd army. Now you speak  positively about it and somewhat praise it. Is this a  retraction or is there something new?    [Ghawshah] Hamas never described the Palestinian police  force  as a Lahd army. We said that this force supposedly should be  part of the Palestinian people. We also said that if the  cadres which head this police force make it stand against its  people, protect the settlements and bestows legitimacy on the  Zionist occupation, then this police force will become like the  Lahd army. That's why Hamas will act on the basis of deeds and  not words.    The Palestinian people welcomed this police force because it  means they no longer have to deal with the occupation. They  emotionally welcomed this police force bearing in mind too its  previous militant background. There is a secret struggle  between good elements and the other elements within this police  force. An example of this is the officer who prevented the  Zionist commander of the southern front from entering the  Palestinian area. Unfortunately, this officer was arrested and  will be tried. Other Palestinian opposition members were also  arrested. The question of weapons will be the test that will  show what are the real intentions of the command of the  Palestinian police force.    [Al-Ma'ayitah] Major General Nasr Yusuf has made a  statement on the issue of arms collection. As for yourself, you  have said that this issue is taboo and a red line. Do you  believe that Maj. Gen. Yusuf's statement was meant to be  implemented? Or do you think it was made merely for media  purposes?    [Ghawshah] The Hamas Movement knows Maj. Gen. Nasr Yusuf  well. He is a member of the Fatah Central Committee. He took  part in previous dialogues between Fatah and Hamas. He signed  the Khartoum agreement on 4 January 1993. It is our hope that  the police command and Maj. Gen. Nasr will uphold the ideas he  set forth during these closed meetings, the ideas regarding his  support for the Palestinian people, as well as his respect for  and willingness to protect all Palestinian mujahidin.    The arms issue is indeed sensitive and important. It  constitutes a red line. There are various weapons at stake.  The most important of these are the weapons used by the  mujahidin affiliated with the al-Qassam Battalions and other  Palestinian forces. These weapons were only used in resistance  to occupation troops and settlers. Everybody is well aware that  weapons are dear to the mujahidin. The mujahidin's weapons are  sacred. They should remain in the hands of the mujahidin. The  mujahidin's right to bear arms is enshrined in all temporal  charters and heavenly faiths. Additionally, the collection of  arms from the Palestinian people is unacceptable. This is  because it should be unacceptable to disarm the Palestinian  people as long as there are occupation troops, settlements, and  settlers on our territory. How can the Palestinian policemen  disarm the Palestinian people, and allow settlers to move freely  with their weapons in the autonomous areas?    The Palestinian people were disarmed in 1948 and 1967, and  the results were catastrophic. That is why Hamas contended that  disarming people is a red line that should not be crossed.    [Al-Ma'ayitah] What about the Hamas Movement's military  activities since the start of efforts to implement the autonomy  agreement?    [Ghawshah] The Hamas Movement has explained that it will  uphold its principled Islamic jihad stand. Our jihad will  continue as long as the occupation of our territories is  maintained. The questions posed in this regard are the  following: Have the autonomous areas been fully liberated? Has  there been complete withdrawal? The answer is that there has  been no complete withdrawal from the autonomous areas,  particularly the Gaza Strip. For the Zionists are occupying  more than 20 percent of the area of the Gaza Strip, particularly  the Gush Qatif area, in which there are 16 settlements and 5,000  settlers. The selection of Zionist targets for attacks is made  at the operations room of the al-Qassam Battalions in the West  Bank, Gaza Strip, and the Palestinian territories occupied in  1948.    [Al-Ma'ayitah] Has Hamas thought of launching an opposition  political party? Has it considered the idea of cooperating with  some forces and figures to launch such a party so that it may  deal politically with the self-rule authority?    [Ghawshah] Various reports and rumors have circulated  regarding the formation of some parties. It seems that Fatah  will launch some parties in cooperation with several independent  figures so that it may impose its political hegemony in the  autonomous areas.    The question posed in this regard is: Will Fatah allow elbow  room for other political forces? As regards the Hamas Movement,  this issue is under consideration, particularly since it was  dictated by the developments of the current phase. However, the  launching of parties has its pros and cons; and the cons might  outweigh the pros. The launching of parties that implicitly  approve the Palestinian-Israeli agreement might be facilitated.    [Al-Ma'ayitah] Hamas has declared its rejection of an offer  made by 'Arafat to take part in the self-rule authority.  'Arafat is well aware of the principled Hamas stand in this  regard. How then do you explain this offer by 'Arafat?    [Ghawshah] The offer to involve us in this authority was  communicated to us by 'Abbas Zaki. The Hamas Movement examined  the offer immediately. Hamas decided to refuse to take part in  the self-rule authority in line with its rejection of the Cairo  agreement. Zaki offered us a number of seats on the self-rule  authority council equal to the number to be allocated for Fatah.  This is reminiscent of the tactics the Fatah Movement and  'Arafat used when the issue of Hamas' joining the Palestine  National Council and the PLO Central Council was debated.    Our explanation of this offer, and all other offers by  'Arafat, for that matter, is that they are always made within  the context of the carrot and stick policy he pursues. Threats  always accompany his offers. He always warns of his ability to  penetrate the factions with which he negotiates. There are  attempts to involve several independent Islamists in the  Palestinian self-rule authority council to insinuate that some  Islamists accept self-rule. Using threats, he is laying the  grounds for penetration; and this is something we are capable of  handling. Any surprises or deception tactics citing the dispute  over the number of seats on the self-rule authority council will  be exposed.    [Al-Ma'ayitah] A few days ago, U.S. Assistant Secretary of  State Robert Pelletreau noted the existence of differences and  trends within Hamas, and that thanks to certain PLO figures some  Hamas figures are taking a positive approach to the agreement.  There had been further such talk before that. What is the true  state of affairs?    [Ghawshah] I heard these statements on Radio Monte Carlo  last Friday. Pelletreau was said to be thrilled with the news  of a split within Hamas, brought on thanks to the efforts of  some PLO figures. As a spokesman for Hamas, let me tell you the  reports are groundless. Hamas is a monolith. Throughout its  jihad history, the movement has been shown to be solidly united.  The movement was founded on Islam and an adherence to the  constants of the Palestinian people. I am told that 'Arafat was  heard by a Fatah Central Committee member saying saying that he  was baffled by Hamas. All the efforts made to entice the  movement into joining hands with the PLO so as to share the  responsibility for the Madrid, Oslo, and Cairo agreements, and  the Washington talks came to nothing. I am positive the Tunis  leadership will fail to attract or infiltrate any Hamas leaders  or rank and file.    The Tunis leadership has managed to cause splits in other  factions, but these lack the moral fiber and organization that  sets Hamas apart. All rumors of splits within Hamas have proved  unfounded.    [Al-Ma'ayitah] Palestinian factions have long been bedeviled  by the complexities of the link between their interior and  foreign-based cadres, with those inside the occupied territories  receiving instructions from the leadership in exile. What has  Hamas done to get around such complications?    [Ghawshah] As for 'Arafat's Fatah, the strings are pulled by  leaders based outside the homeland. 'Arafat has personalized  Fatah. Hamas, on the other hand, was founded on Islamic  principles and a clear vision, thus affording it the required  resilience and flexibility to withstand intense pressure and  tackle heavy blows received both inside and outside the homeland.    The Tunis leadership has sought to capitalize on the crises  and ordeals that Hamas has been through in the inside to  penetrate the movement. Fatah attempted to get through to Ahmad  Yasin in prison and fabricated news and scenarios to put our  movement and its credibility in a bad light.    [Al-Ma'ayitah] It is now three years since the opposition  was launched under the name of the 10 factions, and, more  recently, the Alliance of Palestinian Factions [APF] was formed.  Don't you think that this is as far as these factions will go  -- a ceiling that is not measuring up to the challenges?    [Ghawshah] You may recall that in late 1993, following the  signing of the Oslo accord, Hamas pressed for a provisional  Palestinian leadership to take over. Regrettably, however, a  number of the Palestinian factions had their sights set too low.  We were so anxious for the 10 factions' formula to get off the  ground that we went along with a formula based on political  tasks rather than a political agenda, governed by a majority  consensus rather than unanimity. We knew that this was not  exactly the right formula, and hoped that it will be developed.  Hamas, however, found itself a loner in the field, particularly  regarding the intifadah and militarily. When they demanded that  a combined nationalist-Islamic command be instituted inside the  homeland, we demanded confidence-building initiatives on their  part. For example, having refused to consider an alliance with  Islamic forces in the elections for the Dentists Association in  Gaza so that we may beat the capitulationist candidates, the  democratic forces should not go on to call for a unified  command. How can can there be a unified command if these other  factions are not active in terms of jihad and the intifadah.  This and other obstacles have stood in the way of refining the  APF's formula.    [Al-Ma'ayitah] Some people accuse you of arrogance and  attempting to dominate, and hold you responsible for the failure  of developing the APF formula.    [Ghawshah] Yes, we are accused. Some factions have inherited  such attitudes from 'Arafat's Fatah and are trying to repeat  them in their dealing with Hamas, although facts on the ground  indicate that Hamas has made more sacrifices than others and is  less prejudiced than other factions. Therefore, it agreed to  participate in the APF to preserve the unity of the opposition.  Regrettably, whenever Hamas finds itself in a crisis as a  result of the Zionist-U.S. onslaught inside and outside [the  occupied territories], these factions fish in murky water and  direct their arrows at the movement. We admit that some  factions trust Hamas and give it every support. The APF formula  needs reformulation in light of new factors. It may be better  to establish a wide opposition front during the next stage--a  front which has a definite concept and in which every one in the  occupied territories takes part with all his might--and to  activate the Palestinian diaspora. The Palestinian people in  the diaspora, however, are the big losers.    [Al-Ma'ayitah] Is Hamas' decision to continue the intifadah  still valid or is it under study and reconsideration?    [Ghawshah] There is no doubt that the new era, as well as  epitomizing the self-rule on the ground, will affect the  intifadah, which is aimed at ending the occupation. As a  result, the intifadah activity will drop in areas from which the  Zionist forces withdraw. However, the intifadah's activities are  numerous. Some activities are expected to reduce in the  self-rule area after the end of the occupation, and some other  activities will lead to friction with the self-rule authority  and its supporters. The Hamas Movement will study and assess  these matters, as well as intifadah activities, to secure the  desired results and eliminate negative factors. Hamas may call  for the reduction of some intifadah activities that have no  impact on the overall conflict with the Zionists, especially  within the self-rule area. But jihad and resistance will  continue against the occupation everywhere.    [Al-Ma'ayitah] Is Hamas satisfied by the interaction of  Islamic peoples and movements with the intifadah and Hamas' role?    [Ghawshah] We are in constant touch with Arab and Islamic  peoples. Most of these people strongly support the intifadah  and jihad in Palestine, and we know well that large sectors of  these peoples sympathize with Hamas.    Regarding Arab and Islamic parties and movements, we feel  that they are short of supporting the intifadah and jihad of the  Palestinian people, including the Hamas Movement. What is  really painful is that many Islamic movements are so preoccupied  with their own concerns and issues that they cannot pay enough  attention to the Palestine question, while everybody knows that  the Zionist enemy exploits every loophole. It jumps to  Indonesia, Qatar, and Oman and takes root in Egypt. The  Palestine question should be listed at the top of the agenda of  the Islamic movements because the Zionist danger threatens every  one. Some movements, which try to court the West and the United  States, are despised and humiliated by the West. Some movements  have not defined their stand on the Gaza-Jericho accord and some  others support it to win U.S. approval. We are with political  flexibility that does not encroach on principles.    The Islamic movements in the cordon states have a basic role  to play in supporting jihad activity undertaken by Hamas inside  Palestine. These movements's political, popular, and militant  performance has not reached the level required in the Islamic  and political arenas.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Banques Populaires falls 21% BANQUES Populaires, the French banking group, yesterday added to the gloomy mood of France's financial sector by announcing a 21 per cent fall in net profits to FFr1.28bn (Dollars 239m) in 1992 from FFr1.64bn the previous year. The decline at Banques Populaires is the latest in a stream of bad news to have come from French banks. They have been hit by a downturn in demand for credit and by the need to make steep provisions on their property portfolios and industrial investments. Societe Generale, one of the largest private-sector banks, last week announced static net profits of FFr3.3bn for 1992. This followed a 26 per cent decline in net profits for Banque Nationale de Paris, the state-controlled bank which is a prime candidate for privatisation, to FFr2.2bn and of a FFr1.85bn loss for Credit Lyonnais, also scheduled for sale. Banques Populaires, which operates a number of regional commercial banking networks across France, has been affected by the impact of the economic slowdown on the industry. Despite the competitive credit market, the bank managed to raise net banking income by 8 per cent to FFr17.7bn in 1992 from FFr16.5bn in 1991. It also increased operating profits by 26 per cent to FFr4.6bn from FFr3.6bn over the same period. However, the group was forced to make a steep increase in provisions on sour loans and dubious investments.</p>

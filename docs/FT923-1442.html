			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Manx authorities attacked over supervision: Regulation failed after bank's insolvency - 'Funny money' deals uncovered / Important documents impossible to find THE CHADWICK report into the collapse of the Savings and Investment Bank in 1982 was published yesterday after six years of legal delays. The 500-page report is an indictment of the regulatory role of the Manx government, which according to Chadwick was so poor that the task of supervising the island's growing finance sector could not be fulfilled. Its charges may have been softened by the passage of time and financial reform on the Isle of Man. But the report, by Mr John Chadwick QC, will be eagerly read by the 3,000 depositors who between them lost Pounds 42m. Mr Chadwick, who was appointed by the Manx High Court, tells the story of the bank's collapse in full for the first time. Supervision failed when quarterly returns showed the bank to be insolvent, but it was allowed to go on trading. The report also notes that the government's public stance that the truth should come out was not matched by co-operation from officials. Mr Chadwick and his team were unable to find some important documents. 'Rumours of shredding during June and July 1982 are likely to have substance,' the report comments. The inspectors assisting Mr Chadwick - Mr Tim Beer, of KPMG Peat Marwick, and Mr Michael Jordan of Cork Gully - found no record at the Manx Treasury of analyses or comment on the bank's quarterly returns. They said the process of supervision under the island's Banking Act could not be carried out without that. Mr Peter Duncan, the Treasury official responsible for supervision at the time, 'declined to tell us whether there was some system within the Treasury for analysis and comparison of quarterly returns. 'If there was no system of this nature, it appears to us the finance board was in practice quite unable to carry out the task of supervision as had been set under the Banking Act.' The report also refers to 'funny money' deals carried out by Mr Duncan on his own account and says it is a matter for serious concern that a Treasury official should have been prepared to indulge in such matters. The inspectors said many of the Manx bank's transactions could be understood only in the context that 'those concerned had persuaded themselves that the evasion of tax was a legitimate objective condoned in the Isle of Man'. Mr Robert Killin, managing director of the Manx bank, told the inspectors this central element of his work 'received some measure of encouragement from the government'. The inspectors said: 'SIB was to engage in venture financing to a degree which was out of all proportion to its own resources and management ability and in many cases assumed virtually the whole financial risk. Most of the back-to-back transactions we have identified had a fiscal or illegitimate purpose. 'Transactions of this nature were used to hide the identity of the true lender or investor, to facilitate the falsification of company accounts or to disguise the source of funds which have been acquired or retained illegally.' Mr Killin told the inspectors that all big decisions required the approval of Mr Victor Gray, the beneficial owner of the bank. Even when Mr Killin felt he could not cope with the various troublesome accounts, he felt he could rely on Mr Gray to eventually put it right. The bank had very heavy lending to customers such as Mr Gilbert Hunter, Mr Michael Morris and Mr Kenneth Fincken, who were using the Isle of Man to raise funds, mainly for property deals. In early 1981 Mr James Raper, chairman of the Gasco conglomerate, began borrowing from the Manx bank to support his bid for St Piran, the Cornish mining group. The bank had been insolvent for 16 months before its collapse, but its dealings with Mr Raper precipitated a final run on its funds when Mr Gray tried to seize Mr Raper's St Piran shares as security. The bank closed on June 25 1982. Rescue attempts by the bank's directors, owner and the Manx government failed.

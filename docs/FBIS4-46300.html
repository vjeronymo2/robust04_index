			<p>BFN     [Text] Muslim youth from various ethnic groups in Serbia's  Sandzak province are being brought secretly to Turkey and  trained at Urla and Foca. The first group arrived in 1993 for  commando training by Turkish officers. It has been ascertained  that 754 young men have gone through this training since the  beginning of 1994. At present 500 young men are being trained  at Urla. After completing their training, they returned to  Sandzak and were told "to bomb various government buildings and  assassinate political figures."    The parents of the young men are told that "they are going  to  attend higher educational institutes in Turkey." But the  parents do not know what their sons are doing in Turkey or which  school they are attending. The only liaison for them in Turkey  is the Sandzak Intelligence Center in Ankara. It is said that  this center is being run by the General Secretariat of the  [Turkish] National Security Council [NSC].  <H5>  Murat Bayrak's Planes </H5>   The young men picked up from the various regions of Sandzak  are assembled at the Macedonian capital Skopje [Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. Here, they are given "pocket  money" of 300 to 500 DM [Deutsche Mark] on behalf of the  President of Sandzak Suleyman Uglanin [name and title as  published], and then they are flown to Izmir on planes from  Sandzak Airlines, which belongs to Murat Bayrak's son Mustafa  Bayrak. It is also said that Murat Bayrak is contributing  financially to this project. It is stressed that Bayrak, who is  from Sandzak, has contacts with Suleyman Uglanin.    AYDINLIK made inquiries with Murat Bayrak in Bonn and  Mustafa  Bayrak in Istanbul on this matter. There were no replies from  either Bayrak when our paper went to press.  <H5>  A Deputy's Confessions </H5>   This came into the open with the publication of confessions  by Harun Hacic [name as published], a deputy at the former  Sandzak Autonomous Parliament, in the October 1993 issue of  ILUSTROVANA POLITIKA magazine, which is published in Serbian in  Belgrade and sold in European cities. Hacic was caught  red-handed during the operation carried out by the Yugoslav  police at the beginning of 1993 to detain the young people  trained as commandos in Turkey and organizers of the project. A  considerable amount of arms and military hardware that were  buried in his garden were seized. Following an exhaustive  interrogation of Hacic, the Sandzak police detained 80 people.  The interrogation of the detainees has been continuing over the  past year. ZAMAN and MILLI GAZETE [both published in Turkey]  have been campaigning for the last two weeks for the detained.  <H5>  U.S.-Saudi-Ozal Operation </H5>   The first official contact on training the Muslim youths in  Turkey was made during Sandzak President Suleyman Uglanin's  visit to then President Turgut Ozal in Ankara at the end of 1992.    Uglanin is the head of the Sandzak branch of Democratic  Action Party (SDA) of Alija Izetbegovic, the president of  Bosnia- Herzegovina. SDA is supported by Saudi Arabia and the  United States.    The project of training the Sandzak Muslims in Turkey is  part  of a plan to create "a Muslim state in parts of Serbia and  Montenegro." This also complies with the views of Izetbegovic's  party, which is active in Sandzak. It was the United States  that put forward the plan to establish a Muslim state in Europe.  Saudi Arabia is openly supporting it. Besides, Turkey's secret  diplomacy on Balkans is being financed by Saudi Arabia.    Deputy Hacic, whose confessions have already been published,  is Sandzak President Suleyman Uglanin's right-hand man. In his  statement he said that "it was Uglanin who first told me about  the groups to be dispatched to Turkey." He said Uglanin  explained the aim behind the action as thus: "At first, to  secure a special status for Sandzak, and then to form an  independent Muslim Sandzak step-by-step."    Sandzak is a multiethnic and multidenominational autonomous  region between Macedonia and Kosovo. The spreading of war to  heavily Muslim populated Sandzak or Kosovo would create a  regional crisis engulfing Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, and  Macedonia. The United States is banking more and more on using  Turkey in its plans with Muslims in the Balkans. The statement  of Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff, said that "we have  the largest army in the region, and have gained experience in  guerrilla warfare," meaning that the Balkan and Caucasian wars  are not regular but guerrilla warfares.  <H5>  Kahramanyol Is the Leading Man </H5>   Mustafa Kahramanyol heads the activity providing Sandzak  youth with commando training in Turkey. Kahramanyol, who is  from Sandzak, is an expert on the Balkans Desk of the NSC  General Secretariat and is also an adviser in the prime  minister's office. After a long pause, Kahramanyol replied to  AYDINLIK's questions by saying: "I am a government official, I  cannot comment on this issue."    Hacic's confession published in ILUSTROVANA POLITIKA  includes  names of the organization's members: Sokol Ahmetovic [name as  published], the responsible official in the city of Yeni Pazar  [Novi Pazar], who organizes the contact with the young men.  Cemal Kolasinatz [name as published] is one of the former  Yugoslav army officers. Kolasinatz arranges the travel of the  groups to and from Turkey.    [The article is accompanied by a picture that shows a group  of people squatting in a field handling pistols. The caption  says: "The special warfare official Lieutenant Colonel Korkut  Eken, who was expelled from the organization after the incident  involving MIT, National Intelligence Organization, heads the  Urla camp where the Special Army is being trained. Foca camp  specializes in commando training. The special warfare officials  are organizing the training in both camps."]</p>

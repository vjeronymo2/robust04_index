			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zoran Grgurevic from Doboj] </F>   [Text] After yesterday and last night, which were marked  by constant shelling of civilian targets in Doboj and Teslic,  and during which three civilians were wounded, the shelling  continued today.    A general danger alarm has been in force in Doboj and Teslic  since 0710. The residents are in shelters. A warning was also  sounded at 0900. Doboj, Teslic, and all suburbs are being  targeted with mortars and tanks as we report. The shells are  hitting Teslic from the direction of Tesanj, and in Doboj from  the direction of Matuzici and Gracanica. According to the  available data, members of the 110th brigade of the Croatian  Defense Council, who have been under the Muslim command of the  7-South Operative Group since the beginning of the war, have  joined in the artillery attacks on civilian targets.    As we have learned from the military sources of the 1st  Krajina Corps, which was also confirmed in the press center,  members of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] on the Zepce-Maglaj  front have publicly taken sides with the Muslims. Members of a  special British company installed, between Maglaj and Zepce,  four radar stations for detecting Serbian artillery. The data  is then given to the Muslim units. After the blockade of Maglaj  and Tesanj was lifted, the so-called peacemakers brought to the  Muslim forces in this region a significant amount of arms and  ammunition, which are mercilessly used against civilian targets.  Members of UNPROFOR have openly taken sides with the Muslims  and are engaging in small arms fire from their personnel  carriers on the Serb positions and settlements on Mount Ozren,  Parnica, Bijela Ploca, and Jablanica, together with the Muslim  units.    The units of the army of the republic of Srpska have not yet  responded to these obvious provocations because it is clear to  everyone that an attempt is being made to provoke the Serbs and  possibly transfer NATO actions to these parts of the republic of  Srpska.</p>

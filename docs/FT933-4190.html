			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Tokyo to outline trade stance THE US and Japan today begin a series of talks under a framework agreement aimed at ironing out bilateral trade and economic issues. They will provide the first glimpse of the new Japanese government's stance on trade. The talks, agreed between President Bill Clinton and former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, will cover a broad spectrum of issues, including reduction of the Japanese current account surplus and improved market access for foreign companies in specific Japanese sectors. Since the framework talks were set up Mr Miyazawa has been replaced by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa. An agenda for future discussions and possible co-operation is likely to be established at the meetings. Five areas for co-operation have been agreed between the two countries; Aids research, the environment, development of human resources, technology, and population planning in developing countries. But interest in the talks, being held in Washington, will focus on whether or not the US renews pressure on Japan to set quantifiable targets in opening up specific markets to US products and reducing its surplus. Although Tokyo's stated commitment to deregulating markets has been welcomed by Washington, Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the new finance minister, yesterday renewed opposition to Washington's demand that it set a target for reducing the surplus. In a joint statement issued after a July summit of the Group of Seven industrialised nations, the two countries called for a 'highly significant' reduction in Japan's surplus. The US has been asking for a cut from 3 per cent of GDP to between 1-2 per cent, but Japan has resisted setting a numerical target on the grounds that this would lead to managed trade. However, some Japanese industrialists say a quantifiable target should be set for the reduction.</p>

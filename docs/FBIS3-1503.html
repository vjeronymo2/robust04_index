			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the ANC on 29 March on the SAPA PR Wire </F> Service]    [Text] The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] demonstration in  central Johannesburg on Monday March 28th has been widely  described in the media as "a Zulu march". It was nothing of the  sort. Though the IFP constantly claims to speak for "the  Zulus", every opinion poll of Zulu opinion has shown that a  clear majority of Zulus reject the IFP and support the ANC  [African National Congress]. Monday's events were not a Zulu  affair but solely and simply an IFP adventure. Nor was there a  "march", the so-called march was simply a cover for a preplanned  assault on the ANC apparatus in Johannesburg.    Well before the IFP mobs gathered in central Johannesburg,  the ANC had intelligence information of an aggression against  the ANC planned to take place during Monday's demonstration.  This information was formally passed to the South African  Police [SAP] on Sunday, and a formal request was made for the  SAP to control the route of the demonstration and to cordon off  streets around the ANC buildings. The SAP failed to do either,  until after the attacks had taken place.    This was a clear dereliction of duty by the responsible SAP  officers. Even after the IFP began to spread panic by random  shooting and assaults in the streets of central Johannesburg,  police took no steps to control the marchers' routes, or to  cordon off ANC headquarters. Early on in the day, it must have  been clear to the police that the advertised venue for the  demonstration at the Library Gardens had been a diversion.  Groups of marchers who had gathered at various places in the  city began to move away from the Library Gardens towards Shell  House to the west. Whether police shepherded them or ignored  them is still not clear. Whatever the truth, the SAP will have  to explain themselves. Their present excuse of "insufficient  forces" is not acceptable in the light of the explicit  fore-warnings they had been given.    There is a stark contrast between the SAP actions in  Johannesburg on Monday, and their actions during the much larger  ANC march through the centre of Durban on the Friday before.  The Durban march of some 100,000 passed off completely  peacefully. The ANC supporters were completely unarmed. The  route had been agreed between the SAP and the ANC; it was  adhered to. Yet the entire route was cordoned off with razor  wire before the march began to prevent incursions by  provocators. The SAP will have to explain why the Johannesburg  route was not similarly controlled. And more pertinently, why  there was no attempt to disarm the IFP bands before the  Johannesburg march was allowed to proceed.    It can scarcely be coincidental that the IFP marchers were  being co-ordinated by Themba Khoza, recently named by the  Goldstone Commission as one of those involved inter alia in  gunrunning for the IFP, in collusion with certain SAP senior  officers of the so-called 3rd force. Khoza returned from Natal  immediately before the march. His spurious claim that the  shooting in the streets was done by ANC members who infiltrated  the Inkatha ranks, seems to be a total fabrication. The ANC  states categorically that there were no ANC snipers anywhere in  Johannesburg, and all ANC security personnel operated at Shell  House on the ground floor. If Khoza knew in advance about the  presence of such `snipers' -- as he apparently claims -- the  real question is whether they did not originate from the 3rd  force?    The Johannesburg events which led to the unnecessary deaths  of at least 25 people and the wounding of hundreds more have  been variously described by reporters, few of whom were on the  scene of the actual shootings when they occurred. Many reports  have been assembled at second hand from accounts of casual  by-standers, often in state of shock, and untrained to observe  and report. As a result, incidents from one place have been  concertina-ed into incidents from another, and times of one  event conflated into times of another. The SABC, for example,  in a televised opinion of DP [Democratic Party] Peace  Secretariat member Rupert Lorimer of a "crowd...in a fairly  peaceful mood", related to a scene at the Library Gardens; but  his comment was placed against TV coverage of carnage at Shell  House -- a different place and a different time.    Those who were on the scene of the violent confrontation at  Shell House were the ANC staff, and the ANC security personnel  who were deployed around the building from an early hour.  <H5>  The Events As Witnessed From the ANC Premises </H5>   Reports had been reaching Shell House since around 8AM of  armed demonstrators attacking people around the ANC regional  office in Jeppe Street; innocent passers-by seeking shelter in  the offices were being pursued. No police had been deployed.  ANC security personnel were compelled to fire warning shots  into the air to prevent a massed attack on the building. Police  arrived at the office later, and checked that all arms held by  the ANC security staff were licensed shotguns. They then  withdrew. The demonstrators returned to the attack shortly  after 9AM, attempting to enter the building through the garage.  Warning shots were again fired by security staff. So far as is  known there was one person injured in the first shooting  incident, and no one in the second.    After this second incident, ANC Regional Secretary Paul  Masitile phoned General Callitz of the SAP, who promised to  deploy police personnel in the area around the regional office.  At about the same time, NEC [National Executive Committee]  member Joe Nhlanhla phoned General Beukes of the SAP in Pretoria  to ask for urgent action to cordon off Shell House. Ten  policemen under the command of a sergeant were deployed at  around 10.15AM.    At around 11.20AM IFP marchers, moving from the west -- that  is away from the Library Gardens area -- reached the vicinity of  Shell House. They divided into two groups, one moving to the  back of the building while the remainder assembled on the  pavement opposite the entrance to the building. As this group  advanced on the building, ANC security personnel stationed  outside the entrance fired warning shots in the air. The IFP  group retreated. A second group of attackers, led by a man  carrying an AK-47 assault rifle appeared from the west side of  the building, firing as they came. The ANC security staff  withdrew from the pavement into the building, firing a second  volley of warning shots. At this stage, no police personnel  were visible.    The IFP bands began to coalesce, and to advance on the  building for what appeared to be a concerted frontal assault on  the entrance. Shots were heard, apparently from automatic  weapons somewhere west of the entrance. ANC security personnel  fired into the advancing ranks, inflicting a number of  casualties, the IFP gangs broke and fled.    Despite reports to the contrary, no ANC security personnel  were stationed above ground floor level on any of the upper  levels of the building. Nor were any ANC personnel stationed on  the roof of Shell House or any other building in the vicinity.    The ANC considers that its security personnel behaved in a  thoroughly disciplined and professional manner. They made every  effort to alert the police to the danger of an IFP attack well  in advance of the event. They acted with the utmost restraint,  firing in the air in order to warn off the attackers even when  they themselves were under fire. Their presence in the  building, and their right to carry arms for defence of the large  staff employed here, had long since been established with the  police. Their final decision to prevent the attack by direct  fire was fully justified by the provocative behaviour of the  attackers.    The ANC regrets deeply the loss of life and the injuries  suffered by innocent victims of IFP adventurism, both outside  Shell House and at other places in and around central  Johannesburg and in the surrounding townships. None of this was  fortuitous. It was the inevitable outcome of the insane  determination of the IFP's leaders to destabilise South Africa  regardless of the human cost, and so prevent the holding of free  and fair elections on April 27th.    They must not be allowed to succeed. They must not be  allowed to cover their responsibility for Monday's bloodshed by  blaming it on a shadowy group of `indunas.' They must be held  fully accountable for their reckless attempts to plunge the  whole country into anarchy and civil strife. And so must their  police accomplices in the 3rd force, and those other police  officers whose neglect of their public duties on Monday  contributed directly to the mayhem on the streets.    The response to them all will still be given on April 27th,  by a resounding and overwhelming public vote for a new  democratic government, committed to equal rights and  opportunities for all. The gangsters will not be allowed to  wreck the national future.</p>

Fees will be assessed for REP Program services provided by FEMA personnel and by FEMA contractors and not for those services provided by other Federal agencies involved in the FRPCC or the RACs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Determination of charges for services.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Charges for services will be determined by dividing the total amount of fiscal year funds budgeted for the REP Program, i.e., salaries and expenses, including travel, and Emergency Management Planning and Assistance (EMPA) funding, by the total number of commercial nuclear power plant sites, as defined under &sect;354.2, Scope. The total amount of funds budgeted for the REP Program will be recovered by dividing the funds equally among the NRC licensees on a per commercial nuclear power plant site basis; thus, all sites would be charged the same amount. Under this methodology, site specific and generic services will not be distinguished. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discontinuation of Charges.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon receipt of official written notification from the NRC that offsite radiological emergency planning and preparedness is no longer required at a particular commercial nuclear power plant site, FEMA will discontinue REP Program services and will close out the official docket. Commencing with the next fiscal year after closing out the official docket, user fees will no longer be assessed for that site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;354.5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Description of services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> REP Program services provided by FEMA and FEMA contractors for which licensees would be assessed fees include, but are not limited to, the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Evaluation of State and local offsite radiological emergency plans and preparedness. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Scheduling of exercises. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Development of exercise objectives and scenarios. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Pre-exercise logistics. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Conduct of exercises and evaluations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Preparing, reviewing and finalizing exercise reports, notice and conduct of public meetings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Scheduling, conducting and evaluating remedial exercises, medical services drills, or other exercises and drills including participation in meetings and the preparation and review of associated reports. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Preparation of findings and determinations on the adequacy or approval of plans and preparedness. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Conduct of the formal 44 CFR part 350 review process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

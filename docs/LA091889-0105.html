			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART / CATHY CURTIS;  </P> <P> 'MEDIA TALK' AT BANK'S GALLERY MAKES SOME STRONG COMMENTS  </P> <P> It was a great treat to see the first-class art that Security Pacific Gallery  assembled for its inaugural exhibition last summer. Still, as someone in the  museum world remarked to me, it's one thing for the bank's exhibition space to  show formally attractive work that's essentially uninvolved with social issues  and another to curate an exhibition with real bite.  </P> <P> Well, Security Pacific's new exhibit of painting, photography, installation and  video art, "Media Talk" (through Oct. 29), is not only intelligently conceived  and chockablock with strong, thoughtful work, it even dares to present (in a  videotape) the viewpoint of a strongly anti-capitalist social critic.  </P> <P> As arts writer Irene Borger notes in a catalogue essay rich in provocative  aphorisms, media culture is both "seductive" and "invasive." So beguiling and  so ubiquitous are the images and messages of TV and print that we absorb them  without realizing it. We accept them easily; they speak with the soothing,  authoritative voices of Truth.  </P> <P> What they lack, of course, is sober, time-consuming analysis. That's what the  artists in this show supply, in partnership with you, the viewer. You do have  to take the time to digest and decipher this work; it doesn't just glide into  your consciousness.  </P> <P> Curator Mark Johnstone has assembled an extremely varied group of American  artists for this show. Some co-opt the look of media imagery; others dissect  the workings of media on our minds; and still others are concerned with the  technological aspects of the subject.  </P> <P> Erika Rothenberg -- whose satirical exhibit "America, the Perfect County," is  at Newport Harbor Art Museum through Sunday -- contributes three  tongue-in-cheek paintings and an installation to this exhibit. Her "Celebrity  Simulator" allows viewers to step onto a microphone-encrusted red podium and be  broadcast to a TV set positioned in a roomful of furniture. The paintings are  done in a simple, cheery, colorful style, and they are garnished with the kinds  of imposing statistics the media bombards us with daily. In "Talk Shows," for  instance, a smiling mouth with gritted teeth is juxtaposed with a text  revealing a mind-boggling "fact": "America's 3,641 talk shows will need 8,912  guests today."  </P> <P> Martine Aballea creates parodies of advertising messages with hand-tinted bland  photographs and deliciously weird texts. "Luminous Sauce . . . a velvety  appetizing radiance" reads the slogan, in flowing script, that accompanies a  nocturnal view of an urban building with bright colored lights in the windows.  </P> <P> Robert Heinecken's photographs combine fragments of advertising images  featuring stereotypically sexy women. On the one hand, the works create a  kaleidoscopic sensual impact of their own; on the other, their visual density  involves the viewer in a closer examination of the insidious way the ads work  on the psyche.  </P> <P> Kathe Burkhart's vulgarly colored billboard-like paintings are deadpan paeans  to the the visual language of Hollywood movie ads. A selection from her "Liz  Taylor" series presents the star in scenes from "Little Women," "Butterfield 8"  and other movies.  </P> <P> Alan Rath has hooked up a group of "electronic sculptures," small TV screens  with their electronic workings plainly in view, that display deliberately  simple, continuously repeating imagery. In "Pow II," a hand slowly, jerkily  forms a fist. In "Ambivalent Desire," three screens show blue images of hands  tentatively stroking unseen objects.  </P> <P> The poignancy stems from the disjunction between the "coldness" of the  electronic devices and the human warmth of a small personal gesture. But there  are several notions at work here -- among them, the way TV homes in on and  magnifies images of violence and sensuality, and the sheer repetitiousness of  TV imagery.  </P> <P> Other works by Rath have no human subjects. These pieces reveal the electronic  process as a stuttering, self-contradictory monologue ("(Not) Broken" -- in  which the title words interrupt static patterns on two small screens") and as a  simple-minded binary system ("Arecibo," in which a TV screen keeps flashing the  number sequence 0, 1).  </P> <P> H. Terry Braunstein is represented in an avalanche of work, all involving  advertising imagery introduced into an alien context. The niftiest batch is  "Adolescent Series II," photographs of goofy table-top "experiments." In one, a  wide-eyed kid peers down a cardboard tube at The Future: a tiny couple with a  baby carriage.  </P> <P> Harry Bowers' "Dance of Life" doesn't seem to have much to do with the theme of  the exhibit, but perhaps the point is the way it imitates a succession of movie  frames with unlikely subjects. Each shot in this series of eight-foot-high  color photographic prints of a robe and a jacket lying on a bed brings the two  garments slightly closer together until they seem to embrace.  </P> <P> Carol Flax summons up numbing repetitions of imagery and words in her  computer-created ink-jet prints. In her most effective pieces, this visual  static suggests the gap between the complexity and rawness of real-life  emotions and the simple-minded media messages that stereotype aspects of family  life or teen-age rebellion.  </P> <P> Joyce Niemanas' large multiple-image silver gelatin prints are hard to get a  handle on, but they seem to be about the way media culture creates its own  heroes and heroines and tends to see literary and artistic heroes of the past  simply as grist for the mill of lowest-common-denominator taste. In Niemanas'  "The Copy," a see-through silhouette of Michelangelo's "David" is ignobly made  to appear as though it holds popcorn.  </P> <P> The exhibit also includes four videos, which visitors can ask to see. Chip  Lord's "Not Top Gun" is billed as a critique of the militaristic values in the  movie; it juxtaposes facts about American military spending with images from  the "Top Gun" music video.  </P> <P> "Political Advertisements," by Antonio Muntadas and Marshall Reese, is a  compilation of selected TV political commercials made for the 1988 Presidential  election, allowing the viewer to assess how Madison Avenue changed its approach  as the nature of the campaign shifted.  </P> <P> Jason Simon's "Production Notes: Fast Food for Thought" zips through seven TV  commercials, beginning with a 60-second McDonald's spot set in a high school,  and then (with the cost of the ad superimposed on the screen) takes the  listener through the ad agency's blow-by-blow description of the relevance and  meaning of each scene. The video is needlessly repetitious, but it does present  a chilling look at all the calculation that goes into insidiously cheerful,  low-key commercials.  </P> <P> Judith Williamson, the social critic mentioned previously, took a trip to a  Target store for her video, "Judith Williamson Consumes Passionately in  Southern California." She is a better writer than video maker or performer (the  piece is overlong and fairly choppy, and she seems shy and nervous), but her  analysis is keen. Beginning with "The Advertisement" -- a Burlington sock ad --  she muses on the absurdity of our "multiplicity of products and functions" that  requires industry to dream up new consumer needs.  </P> <P> Williamson notes that these needs are "all centered on the body," which  capitalism examines piece by piece in its search for new areas to "colonize."  She says the illusion of a vast array of products that are markedly different  from one another -- such as the row upon row of socks at the Target store --  are substitutes for our inability to assimilate real differences, such as those  of race or culture.  </P> <P> Whether you agree or disagree, this is provocative material relevant to our  lives -- and not at all what you'd expect to see at a bank!  </P> <P>  "Media Talk" will be on view through Oct. 29 at Security Pacific Gallery, 555  Anton Blvd., Costa Mesa. Gallery hours are 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through  Sunday. Admission is free, and the gallery will validate parking. Information:  (714) 433-6001.  </P> <P> </P></p>

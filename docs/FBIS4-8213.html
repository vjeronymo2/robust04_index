			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 11 (TANJUG) -- A delegation of the  Yugoslav Federal Government, headed by Deputy Prime Minister  Zeljko Simic, will visit the Srpska republic in order to look  into the consequences of the NATO plane bombardment there.    The government brought this decision at an extraordinary  session Monday [11 April] devoted to the situation following the  bombardment of the Srpska republic around the town of Gorazde,  in the east of war-shattered Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The government has also decided to address a protest note to  Italy for having allowed NATO planes to fly from its airfields  and a letter to the UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali  pointing out that the NATO air attacks on the Srpska republic  constitute a violation of the U.N charter, it is said in a  statement issued by the government.    At the same session the government has assessed the U.N.  decision about the engagement of NATO airforces in the  bombardment of the territory of the Srpska republic as direct  involvement in the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina on the side  of the Moslems and a dangerous precedent which could have  far-reaching consequences.    The cabinet of Prime Minister Kontic has also conveyed the  solidarity of all Yugoslav citizens with the Serb people in the  Srpska republic who are the victims of aggression.    The U.N. has brought the decision about the engagement of  NATO planes at the request of the peacekeepers on the field who  accused the Serbs of attacking the civilian population in  Gorazde.    According to Serb military sources, however, it was from  Gorazde that around 10,000 Moslem troops launched an attack on  Serb positions around the town, which should have been  demilitarized last spring as a UN-protected area.    Reports of the U.N. peackeepers confirm that the combats  around Gorazde were provoked by the Moslems. According to Serb  military sources the Moslem offensive is aimed at gaining as  much territory as possible from the Serbs ahead of the  continuation of the peace talks conducted under international  mediation.</p>

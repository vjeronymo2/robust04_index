For Escherichia coli K&hyph;12 Host-Vector 2 systems (EK2) in which the vector is a phage, no more than 1/108 phage particles shall perpetuate a cloned DNA fragment under the specified non-permissive laboratory conditions designed to represent the natural environment, either as a prophage (in the inserted or plasmid form) in the laboratory host used for phage propagation, or survival in natural environments and transferring a cloned DNA fragment to other hosts (or their resident prophages).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix I&hyph;II.

Responsibility.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Host-Vector 1 systems (other than Escherichia coli K&hyph;12) and Host-Vector 2 systems may not be designated as such until they have been certified by the NIH Director. Requests for certification of host-vector systems may be submitted to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838. Proposed host-vector systems will be reviewed by the RAC (see section IV-C-1-b-(1)-(e)). Initial review will based on the construction, properties, and testing of the proposed host-vector system by a subcommittee composed of one or more RAC members and/or  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ad hoc <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  experts. The RAC will evaluate the subcommittee's report and any other available information at the next scheduled RAC meeting. The NIH Director is responsible for certification of host-vector systems, following advice of the RAC. Minor modifications to existing host-vector systems (i.e., those that are of minimal or no consequence to the properties relevant to containment), may be certified by the NIH Director without prior RAC review (see section IV-C-1-b-(2)-(h)). Once a host-vector system has been certified by the NIH Director, a notice of certification will be sent by NIH/ORDA to the applicant and to the Institutional Biosafety Committee Chairs. A list of all currently certified host-vector systems is available from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838. The NIH Director may rescind the certification of a host-vector system (see section IV-C-1-b-(2)-(i)). If certification is rescinded, NIH will instruct investigators to transfer cloned DNA into a different system or use the clones at a higher level of physical containment level, unless NIH determines that the already constructed clones incorporate adequate biological containment. Certification of an host-vector system does not extend to modifications of either the host or vector component of that system. Such modified systems shall be independently certified by the NIH Director. If modifications are minor, it may only be necessary for the investigator to submit data showing that the modifications have either improved or not impaired the major phenotypic traits on which the containment of the system depends. Substantial modifications to a certified host-vector system requires submission of complete testing data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

A statement from the office of the chief of  general staff says the legislators could be allowed to repay the  loans in accordance with the terms of payment entered into when  such loans were obtained. The government also directed  administrators to ensure that public funds were no longer  deposited with finance houses. Instead central banks should be  used for that purpose.    Meanwhile, deposits by prospective candidates for the  abortive 1993 local government elections are to be refunded. A  directive to that effect from the presidency in Abuja asked  state administrators to ascertain the amount the politicians  spent on the abortive elections and where the money was  deposited. They are also to identify bona fide candidates and  make arrangements for their refund.</p>

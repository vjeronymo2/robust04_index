			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / The reins tighten on public spending The government is living on its nerves. If it is lucky, the recession will come to an end soon. Then it can make good its election promise 'to provide an economic environment which encourages enterprise'. We would enjoy price stability, 'firm control' over public spending and lower taxes. If that is achieved at a bearable cost, Mr John Major and Mr Norman Lamont will have earned their place in history as a remarkable duo. Wondrous accounts will be written of the far-sighted statesmen who led Britain into a new era of low inflation, steady growth, quality public services, a healthy lifestyle, clean air, dozens of Citizen's Charters and a winning smile from breakfast to bedtime. Alternatively, the prime minister and the chancellor may be, shall we say, thwarted by an absence of good luck. If that happens they will be seen as a twin disaster, the Laurel and Hardy of British politics. They will be remembered for failing to get out of the exchange rate mechanism, for producing near-zero inflation at the cost of semi-permanent stagnation, for running down public services, for making not one Briton healthier nor one cubic centimetre of air cleaner, for meaningless charters and a winning smile from Mr John Smith. You have to choose between these alternative readings of what is going on before you can make up your mind about the import of the decisions on public spending announced on Wednesday evening. My view is that the government believes (hopes? prays?) that the budget deficit can be brought permanently under control - but that experience suggests otherwise. Mr Major's ambition, as expressed in the Conservative election manifesto in April and repeated on Wednesday, is 'to reduce the share of national income taken by the public sector'. He is asking a lot. Over the past 30 years government spending has more than doubled in real terms, but national income has risen by less than 90 per cent. The effect is well-known. In 1963-64 state expenditure accounted for little more than 36 per cent of gross domestic product. When Mrs Margaret Thatcher came to office in 1979, that key ratio stood at some 44 per cent. It has been higher - above 48 per cent in the mid-1970s and above 46 per cent in the early 1980s - and lower, down to a fraction less than 40 per cent when Mr Nigel (now Lord) Lawson was chancellor. But the way things are going it may be back up to 44 per cent next year, which is where it was when the Tories came in 13 years ago. The fiscal frontiers of the state will stand where they were when Labour was last in office. To save itself the embarrassment of that revelation, the government has taken to pointing out that the ratio is misleading, since it rises naturally during a recession, as growth falls. So it does. Ratios are therefore out; firm intentions in. The new system of control that Mr Lamont will now impose will allow for a maximum real growth in spending of some 2 per cent a year, half a point below what the Treasury regards as the long-run potential of the economy. This is to be achieved over the 'medium term', which means not now, while growth is a memory, but for as long as it takes for something, preferably business activity, to turn up. Then we can presumably return to the ratio as a benchmark. It will look respectable again. The essence of the new system is that it is 'top-down'. The cabinet will decide, as it did this week, on the grand totals of future years' spending. Then ministers who seek more for their departments will have to explain why to those who must therefore get less. Not all parts of the mechanism are yet in place. It is characteristic of the incremental, nuts-and-bolts approach of Mr Major's government that this should be so. Top-down budgeting will evolve, although it starts at once. Bilateral discussions between the chief secretary, Mr Michael Portillo, and individual ministers will continue but everyone will know that the outcome cannot exceed Pounds 244.5bn for next year. In previous years the 'bilaterals' were the means by which the final figure was arrived at. Success this year will depend on the government's determination not to be moved from the number it first thought of. A special cabinet committee, chaired by Mr Lamont, will presumably bring the main spending ministers together so that in brotherly and sisterly affection they may trade favours  -within the pre-ordained total. Mr Portillo will report to this committee. There is a further wrinkle. For 1993-94 the planning total includes unemployment benefit. If job losses are higher than forecast, other departments will have to finance the consequent increase in the cost of social security, or benefits will have to be cut. In the following years, the 'new control total' will exclude unemployment benefit. Other departments neither lose if it rises nor gain if it falls. The change of system is important, but less revolutionary than it might seem. In recent years the talk has been of getting 'as close as possible' to the target, a loose control if ever there was one. But before 1987 Cabinets affirmed their faith in planning totals and tried to stick to them. The Labour party's election manifesto promised an autumn national economic assessment, which would indicate how much could be afforded. This would be adhered to, or, if necessary, taxes would be increased. Most businesses understand budgeting to a prescribed cash total. The pre-1979 government of Mr James (now Lord) Callaghan moved from real-terms, or funny money, budgeting to departmental cash limits. Now a cash lid is being placed on the entire UK enterprise, based not on a series of individual bargains but predetermined by a calculation of what can be afforded. The net result is that there are three bars to the iron cage into which the grim optimists of Nos 10 and 11 Downing Street have locked themselves. They propose to ratify the Maastricht treaty, just as soon as they can get it through the Commons. They are pledged to stick within the ERM, whatever the cost. The third bar clanged into place this week, when they published public spending totals which they promise will not be exceeded. The consequent 'cuts' may make them as unpopular as Mrs Thatcher ever was. Even in departments where real spending rises, as in the health service, there will be a chorus of anguish at the increases that might have been. In British political parlance these are 'cuts'. We can only applaud Mr Major and Mr Lamont's courage, or, if you prefer, sympathise with their desperate plight.</p>

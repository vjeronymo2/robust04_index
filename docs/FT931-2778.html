			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: The price of fiscal prudence - Political Notebook THE Conservative party at Westminster was braced for higher taxes. In the FT's pre-Budget survey 56 per cent of Tory MPs had demanded additional revenue to reduce the deficit. But that did not stop Mr Norman Lamont's package from hurting. The rumblings on the government back benches against the chancellor's decision to extend valued added tax to domestic heating were symptomatic of a broader anxiety. Mr Lamont had been both brave and right to set out a tough strategy to reduce the deficit. To re-coin a phrase, there was no alternative. Now, at last, the government could claim that it had restored a grip on economic policy. But the pensioners, the low-paid and the skilled working classes - those politically precious C2s - who bore the brunt of higher taxes will be less impressed by the rediscovery of fiscal prudence. The bitter wrangling over Maastricht threatens to sap the government's authority still further. Civil war over Europe will be followed by a spending round even tougher than last year's. An increase in the Treasury's medium-term inflation assumptions means that the new control total for public spending now implies a real cut of 0.25 per cent in 1994-95 and a freeze in 1995-96 - the very years in which the tax increases will bite. Teachers, police officers, nurses and doctors cannot expect a relaxation of the present public-sector wage squeeze to meet their higher tax bills. Unemployment will keep on rising. If it is to stick to its spending targets, the government may be forced to abandon manifesto pledges on welfare benefits. Overall, this particular cocktail could make for what one Tory MP called 'a truly bloody summer'. Few on his own side questioned the political as well as economic strategy underpinning Mr Lamont's Budget. A Pounds 1bn-a-week borrowing requirement was unsustainable. If action were not taken now - or at least next year and the year after - then the government would have to put up taxes on the eve of the next election. Mr Lamont, more relaxed than circumstances might have suggested, put the case cogently in an intense selling exercise yesterday. To win the election due by 1997 the government must deliver sustained economic recovery. Without reductions in the deficit it would be impossible to sustain the recovery which now seems in sight. There was a more optimistic sub-text also. By putting in place now what he termed a 'wedge' of revenue-raising measures Mr Lamont would leave himself - or his successor - able to take advantage of more favourable circumstances two or three years hence. Progressive reductions in the PSBR between now and 1996 would allow room for modest cuts in income tax in the approach to the election. Last year the chancellor played a significant part in securing the Conservative election victory by cutting taxes. Now he was saying he would help win the next election by raising them in order to cut income tax again in 1996. Some Tory MPs hope the good news will come rather earlier than that. For all the praise for Mr Lamont's fiscal virtue, there were already mutterings yesterday that an upturn over the next few months might provide the basis for a rather gentler phasing in of VAT on heating. There were few signs of outright rebellion. An increase in benefits for the elderly and the poor should take much of the political sting out of the new tax. But the Treasury should take note. There are enough on the populist right and the caring left of the Tory party to combine against the new tax if the increase is insufficiently generous. In the meantime Labour will make hay. No amount of sophisticated textual analysis will persuade voters that the government has not reneged on the prospectus it presented last year. Nor is there much chance of convincing them that a 1-point rise in national insurance contributions is somehow better than 1p on the basic rate of income tax. Mr Lamont may be right to argue that sustained economic recovery will help the voters to forget by 1997 the pain he inflicted in 1993. But the Treasury's forecasts suggest the overall tax burden will rise in every single year between now and the general election. In 1992 the Conservatives used three weapons to win the election: the threat of higher taxes, Mr Neil Kinnock's leadership of Labour, and the new direction for Tory government offered by Mr John Major. Now the Conservatives have raised taxes, Mr Kinnock has departed and Mr Major is no longer a fresh face. It does not leave them much with which to fight the next election.</p>

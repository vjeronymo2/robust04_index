			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Guest commentary by Chairmen of No to EU Eva-Britt Svensson </F> and Hans Lindqvist: "Study Manipulated To Support Yes on EU"]    [Text] The last of the six studies on the consequences of  joining the EU [European Union] -- the study on democracy and  sovereignty -- has now been submitted. Considering the total  domination of the study commissions by "objective" members, no  one was surprised that this last one came to the same conclusion  as all the others: a "balanced yes" to membership, as Chairman  Olof Ruin put it.    We were unable to count more than four of the 40 or so  commission members who are openly critical of the EU. Serious  criticism must therefore be directed at the makeup of the  commissions studying the consequences of joining the EU. Their  members naturally should have been selected earlier, either  before the application was made or at least before the  negotiations began. What was the point in choosing them in the  midst of the negotiations if not to use them in the yes  propaganda itself?    The no side was not represented, with the result that it has  had great difficulty in following the work and commenting on the  results. But the commission on democracy should have allowed the  no side to attend a hearing and to present its own views in an  appendix.  <H5>  Wrong Already </H5>   Formal sovereignty -- that is, the right of  self-determination -- will be reduced, the commission on  democracy says, but that will be offset by the fact that we will  be able to take part and influence "the common problems in  Europe."    Here the commission is guilty of the same mistake as the yes  side when it equates the EU's 12 states with Europe's 48.    We will be able to take part and influence, says the  commission. Who is "we"? The subway crossing guard in Bandhagen,  the nurse's assistant in Angelholm, or the small farmer in  Morjarv? No, it will be a small minority consisting of  Dinkelspiel, Carlsson, and Bildt that will get to exercise the  increased "virtual sovereignty" at a safe distance from their  subjects in Sweden.    Power will shift from popularly elected members of the  Riksdag to a Commission, Council of Ministers, and EC Court that  make their decisions in secret with little risk of public  control and publicity.    Our influence in the EU will amount to 5 percent, but 80  percent of the decisions will be transferred from Sweden to the  EU, as Jacques Delors put it several years ago, and we will be  100-percent bound by the EU's decisions.  <H5>  Superficial and Simplistic </H5>   The EU is no threat to welfare, said the commission on  welfare and equality, which was headed by Agneta Dreber, head of  the Public Health Institute. In an article published in SVENSKA  DAGBLADET, one of the commission members says it is true that we  will have to pay an annual fee of about 20 billion kronor to the  EU, but we will get it back in taxes thanks to increased  investment in Sweden. It is true that from 20 billion to 30  billion kronor in state revenues will disappear because of a  harmonized value-added tax, but we can get that back through  higher property taxes.    That is just amazing. The commission is basing its support  for EU membership on pious hopes of faster growth and dynamic  effects. It consistently overestimates the revenues arising from  membership, when in fact we do not know whether there will be  any, and underestimates the costs and declines in revenue, when  in fact we know that the total will amount to at least 50  billion kronor per year.    Where are we going to get that money? We already have a  deficit of about 200 billion kronor. The question we should be  asking is: Can we afford the EU?    And the commission has been subjected to strong criticism.  Two Social Democratic members -- Lena Gonas and Margareta  Persson -- expressed reservations regarding the commission's  conclusions. This is how they explain their reservations: "The  lack of analysis between program and reality, the minimizing of  the costs and consequences of membership, and the unwillingness  to discuss the risks that such minimizing involves from the  standpoint of welfare and equality are remarkable."  <H5>  Forgetting the Flip Side </H5>   The commission on municipalities and the EU also comes up  with a yes answer and talks about increased benefits from  changes in purchasing rules that will improve the  municipalities' opportunities for competing in Europe. Here  again, the flip side is being forgotten: the fact that foreign  firms will be able to drive Swedish subcontractors who have been  cooperating with the municipalities and county councils for  years out of business.    The outcome may be that the gains and losses will cancel  each  other out. But if there are any gains, they will not be the  result of membership in the EU. The municipalities are already  free to use the EU's purchasing data bases under the terms of  the free trade agreement, and doing so will be compulsory under  the EEA [European Economic Area] agreement.    The thing that is most likely to impact the municipalities  is  the membership fee of about 20 billion kronor per year and the  tax shortfall of between 20 billion and 30 billion kronor that  will have to made up by cutbacks and reduced subsidies from the  central government. The commission also ignores the fact that  the municipalities will be included in the EU's convergence  rules on maximum borrowing. This means that the EU will be able  to force the municipalities to make further cutbacks, since  their borrowing will not be allowed to exceed 3 percent of GNP.  <H5>  Completely Dominated by Yes Side </H5>   The commission on economic consequences comes next in the  series of commissions dominated by the yes side. One member,  Professor Yvonne Hirdman, felt that the commission was being so  tightly manipulated that she resigned. "Experts" from the  Industrial Research Institute and the Ministry of Finance are  presenting figures supposedly substantiating the thesis  regarding the economic advantages of membership in the EU.    Based on a long list of assumptions, it is claimed that  direct investment by foreign firms will increase if Sweden  becomes a member of the EU. The attempt is made to present this  as being a crucial issue for our entire country. Not mentioned  is the fact that direct investment accounts for only about 4  percent of total investment in Sweden and that even if foreign  investment doubles, domestic investment will still be 10 times  greater. In both Great Britain and Denmark, foreign direct  investment declined for a great many years immediately after  they joined the EC.    The studies have also been criticized by professional  economists, examples being Professor Magnus Blomstrom of the  School of Economics, LO [Swedish Federation of Trade Unions]  economist Dan Andersson, and Rudolf Meidner. For example, it is  claimed that membership in the EU would lead to a percentage  increase in GNP that is 0.45 percent higher than in the EEA  alternative and that unemployment would correspondingly be 0.04  percent lower than under the EEA agreement. Figures concerning  the future are being given in hundredths of a percentage point.    Nor is any attempt made to answer the main question: Does  anyone believe that Sweden's 608,000 unemployed will do better  in a European Union that already has 18 million unemployed and  that pursues a constitutionally mandated economic policy in  which the fight against inflation always takes precedence over  the fight against unemployment?  <H5>  Almost Tragic </H5>   We still have the commissions on security policy and  environment to consider. Sverker Astrom and Leif Leifland, two  retired diplomats and former under secretaries of state for  foreign affairs, stated long before the study was made that they  were strong supporters of the EU and that the neutrality policy  had had its day.    It is almost tragic the way every means is being used to try  to get the citizens, in Goran Rosenberg's words, to "adapt to  their politicians" on the subject of foreign and security policy.    Instead of shaping opinion before the decision, Bildt and  Carlsson are now having to devote themselves to "informing"  their citizens after the fact of the neutrality policy's sudden  death. No wonder people are both confused and confounded.    Unlike Denmark, Sweden has not asked to be exempted from any  of the EU's foreign and security policy provisions or from the  defense cooperation planned for the Western European Union  (WEU). Sweden has simply lain down and accepted the Maastricht  treaty down to the last comma, thereby voluntarily giving up its  independence in foreign policy. It will not be easy to "inform"  away that reality.  <H5>  Manipulated </H5>   Lastly, there is the commission on environment. It is sad  that a government commission should have to manipulate opinion  by removing information unfavorable to membership. We do not  know what role was played by the two active advocates of  "Network for Europe," Annika Ahnberg and Stefan Edman. What  happened merely reminds us of the worst features of the earlier  referendum.    The information removed from the report shows that Sweden  will find it exceedingly difficult to influence the EU's  environmental policy in the right direction. Even if Sweden had  the "environmentally friendly countries" and the "undecided" on  its side, that would not be enough to constitute a majority in  favor of a sustainable long-term policy on environment and  natural resources.    If the voting rules are changed to favor the big states --  and there are proposals to do so -- the above will naturally  become even harder. We will therefore have a greater possibility  of influencing the environment if we can pursue our own policy  in our own country, in various UN agencies, and at major  environmental conferences like the one in Rio de Janeiro.    We would like to put the following questions to Prime  Minister Carl Bildt and opposition leader Ingvar Carlsson: You  are both advocates of membership in the EU, but in view of your  roles, you also have a special responsibility to see that light  is shed on all aspects of the EU issue, especially in studies  that are being paid for with tax money. Do you think that the  makeup of the commissions has been balanced? Do you think that  the commissions are trustworthy? If not, are you prepared to  give the no side equal funds for carrying out six new studies?</p>

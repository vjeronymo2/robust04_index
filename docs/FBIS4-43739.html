			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Giorgio Bocca: "Berlusconi Thanks His </F> Enemies...."]    [Text] In all competitions the winner wins partly thanks to  his own merits and partly also thanks to his adversary's  weaknesses. And these weaknesses are partly the result of  ignorance and presumption and partly the result of a history  that has taken place and that it has been impossible to  eliminate overnight. This is what has happened in the two  recent elections, one confirming the other. What were the  weaknesses and mistakes of the Left, for which Achille Occhetto  is now paying? The first, I would say, was the inability of  first the PCI [Italian Communist Party], then the PDS  [Democratic Party of the Left] to co-opt the moderates. It is  not true that the Italian Left is numerically weaker than the  Left in other European countries: It commands 30 percent, like  the socialist parties in France, Britain, Spain, and Germany --  except that they find allies, whereas it does not.    The fault for this inability to co-opt does not of course  lie  solely with Occhetto and the rest of the leadership, which  succeeded in making the abjuration that the Communist Parties of  France, Spain, and Portugal never made. But this time it failed  to overcome the imprinting of Third International-style  communism, of the single and different party which could lead to  the dictatorship of the proletariat.    This was seen extremely clearly at the 25 April and 1 May  rallies. The party leadership wanted two great demonstrations  of unified progressives; it wanted to bind the values of the  resistance and labor to the democratic front that opposed the  new Right, but the comrades in Reggio Emilia or Grosseto did not  see it exactly that way: They came to Milan and Turin with  their banners and flags to show Italy that the old Communist  Party was still the strongest and different. And the moment  Bossi and the League supporters joined the rallies they booed  them loudly.    Their second mistake, or sad destiny, was to have taken  insufficient account of the country's modernization -- and I am  not talking about an ideal kind of modernization, but simply  keeping pace with the times. There was a failure to realize  that the crisis of the system of party domination was indeed the  crisis of corrupt parties, but also of the party as such and of  all large organizations of delegated responsibility; that  monothematic class definitions had come to an end and that  archipelagoes of different interests had emerged in their place.  In other words, that although the workers existed, they were no  longer visible as a class; that the trade unions existed, but no  longer represented all the workers.    I think that this was easy to understand and that the PDS  leaders did so; the difficult thing was to draw the necessary  conclusions, to abandon the customary routine, the fiction that  the old automatic relations between party, trade unions, and  class still operated.    The third mistake was the hysteria common to the entire  progressive front. The rejection of the election result, the  belief that insults, scandal-mongering, and total negation were  enough, if not to reverse the situation, then at least to freeze  it. That was a mistake, and the European elections have  confirmed the fact.    But Forza Italia won partly also thanks to the errors and  weaknesses of the League and of its leader, Umberto Bossi. We  knew he was not very British in his approach, but his inability  to accept defeat displays very bad manners. He has been  described as "that crazy uncle from Brianza" with reference to  the rather eccentric, cantankerous, but nevertheless rather  likable kind of uncle that you find living in the provinces.  But what Bossi has been displaying for some time is not so much  fierce polemics or eccentricity, as mental confusion. Somebody  should explain to him -- though I fear it would be in vain --  that his contortions and inconsistencies achieve the result of  earning Forza Italia more votes, as we have seen in the European  elections.    Bossi thinks he is smart -- super-smart, in fact, someone  who  can deceive everyone by saying something and then retracting it.  And he thought that the general elections, with the horse  trading over the first-past-the-post system, were the ultimate  proof of his cunning. He reasoned exactly like [former Italian  Socialist Party Secretary] Bettino Craxi who, with his 11  percent of the votes, wanted 30 percent of the seats. The  Italian people would not agree to it, and if he thinks he can  reverse the situation by shouting that Berlusconi is a  mercenary, that he will deprive him of all his television  channels, that the League is the only anti-dictatorial  democratic force, which, however, instead of abandoning the  dictatorship that is being formed, remains within it in order to  resist it -- he is making a big mistake.    It is all nonsense, and nothing more so than the observation  that "the Italian people failed to understand." But the Italian  people, by penalizing him and the League's inconsistencies,  simply followed their desire for stability, and if the new  government's critical mass is Forza Italia, if the force which  attracts votes by virtue of its sheer weight is Forza Italia,  this is the very reason why they voted for it. The fact that  this center-right option displeased the progressive forces and  that some of them considered it repugnant, no less, is another  matter, but you cannot expect those who granted the center-right  a mandate for change in the general elections to perform a  turnabout themselves within the space of a few weeks.    We hope that our fellow citizens will accept Achille  Occhetto's resignation -- painful, we imagine -- in a civilized  manner and that they do not attribute the Left's defeat to his  moustache or other personal attributes. He showed great courage  in carrying out the change of course, and now it is no tragedy  to hand over the reins. With all the shady characters and  scoundrels that have appeared on the political scene, it really  would not be appropriate to crucify him....</p>

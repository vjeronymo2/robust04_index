			<p>BFN     [Text] On 28 April, Ayacucho peasant defense patrol leaders  stated they are prepared to launch the "final offensive" against  Shining Path forces in this department, where the Shining Path  is operating in the Andean mountain range along the border with  Apurimac Department.    Susano Mendoza Preja, mayor of La Quinua and spokesman for  the peasant defense patrol of Huamanga Province, said "this  offensive will have better results than Operation Aries  (currently under way in the Huallaga Valley) because the Shining  Path will have to deal not only with the Army but with organized  peasants as well."    Mendoza argued that any operation involving the peasants  would have the advantage of the latter's knowledge of the  terrain and the ability to immediately mobilize 25,000 people.  Mendoza told EXPRESO: "We are prepare to fight and do away with  terrorism once and for all."    Mendoza and other peasant leaders, like Donato Sulca  ("Gavilan Command") and Julio Enciso ("Halcon Command"),  reported that Shining Path armed columns are operating in the  Andean mountain range along the border between Ayacucho and  Apurimac Departments.    The peasant leaders warned that Shining Path forces have  regrouped recently and Shining Path units were sighted in Ocros  District and in rural areas of Andahuaylas.    On 17 April, a group of 30 Shining Path militants attacked  San Juan de Lucanas (on the border with Ica Department) and  killed five people after destroying public property and several  interprovincial buses.    Peasant defense patrol representatives asked the central  government to give them sustained logistic support to help them  fight for peace. They sent a memorandum to political and  military officials asking for solutions to the legal problems of  nine peasant defense patrol leaders who are in prison in  Huamanga (on charges of alleged homicide) and for the pardon for  peasant leaders who have already been sentenced.    The representatives asked for the implementation of Supreme  Decree 077-DE-092, which grants benefits to members of peasant  defense patrols in case of death or disablement. They also  disagreed with the proposal to lift the state of emergency in  Ayacucho Department because they believe that "peace has not yet  taken root in Ayacucho."</p>

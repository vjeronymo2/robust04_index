			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Arts: Bidders are back - Saleroom This was the week when London became, temporarily, the market place for the most expensive pictures in the world, the week when Sotheby's and Christie's offered high quality Impressionist, Modern and Contemporary art. No one can pretend that the capital was awash with masterpieces. Few sellers are prepared to willingly consign their paintings to the auction rooms while the global recession still exercises some grip, and there are few desperate buyers. But at least the sales did not destroy the precarious confidence created by the previous major auctions in the summer in New York, when slightly better pictures were on offer. Who knows, by next summer a really important painting, or two, might be risked on the open market. Charles Allsopp, who took the major Christie's sale on Monday night, reckoned it the best he had handled in this sector since the halcyon days of 1989. 'There were often plenty of bidders in the room and the dealers were back'. The most important lot, a portrait by the mysterious French post-Impressionist Henri Rousseau of the dealer Joseph Brummer sold for Pounds 2.97m. Few works by Rousseau, known as Le Douanier because he spent most of his life working as a customs officer before taking up art, arrive on the market, and this was a rather serious subject, unlike his primitive jungle scenes. It would not have sold in a depressed market. In all the 54 lots raised Pounds 14.3m, and were 84 per cent sold by value. Christie's had judged the market to perfection and the next most important lots, works by Klee, Kandinsky, and Chagall, each sold for over Pounds 800,000, at the lower end of their estimates. However buyers are still choosy and 15 lots were unsold. Sotheby's fared slightly less well, bringing in Pounds 11.6m for 74 lots at its big Tuesday night auction. However, auctioneer Melanie Clore drew satisfaction from the fact that it was 78 per cent sold by value, as against 60 per cent at the comparable sale of 1992. A Renoir landscape made Pounds 881,500, at the bottom of its estimate, but the top picture, a Kandinsky, failed to sell. Buyers were mainly private collectors, many of them fresh faces, and, not surprisingly, they favoured accessible paintings. Oddly enough there was more interest in the sales of contemporary art. What has been an unpredictable and nervous market suddenly seems to have caught alight - perhaps late 19th and early 20th century art seems old hat. Sotheby's was very happy with its principal auction which brought in Pounds 3.8m, and was 87 per cent sold by value. A Gerhard Richter free abstract blasted its estimate, selling for Pounds 397,500 while a double self portrait by Francis Bacon was on target at Pounds 353,500. Christie's matched this with Pounds 3.7m, 92 per cent sold, and Pounds 518,500 paid for a planed down, brown, 1949 work by Dubuffet. London needs to attract better works in this post-1870 sector if its position as a plausible competitor to New York does not slip beyond recall. The imminent imposition of VAT on imported antiques from outside the EC, even at a minimal 2 per cent, will persuade many vendors to go for the glitz of a Manhattan sale. Meanwhile the picture dealers are concentrating on making sales by offering modestly priced works and selling them more imaginatively. Last weekend the 17 galleries which cluster together in London's Cork Street remained open all Saturday and Sunday. The event attracted a few thousand browsers and some dealers recorded more business than in a normal month. David Messum, at The Gallery, sold 15 paintings, five priced around Pounds 2,500; Waddington Galleries disposed of six works, mostly on paper, and ranging in price from Pounds 500 to Pounds 70,000 (for a Matisse, sold to a foreign dealer) and including art by Michael Craig-Martin and William Turnbull; Browse &amp; Darby despatched five paintings, including a still life by Leonard McComb to a buyer new to the gallery; and the Redfern notched up 13 sales, of which three were landscapes by Sarah Armstrong Jones.</p>

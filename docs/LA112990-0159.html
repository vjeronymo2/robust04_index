			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOLDEN WEST SEEKS STATE VOLLEYBALL TITLE  </P> <P> Al Gasparian, women's volleyball coach at Golden West College, said at the  start of the season that his team should be the favorite in the Orange Empire  Conference.  </P> <P> The Rustlers rolled to a 12-0 match record, losing only one game.  </P> <P> Now, he is picking his team to end the season by winning the state title.  Golden West starts state tournament play on Friday in the eight-team final at  Allan Hancock College in Santa Maria.  </P> <P> "I think we're going to win it," Gasparian said. "The key is that we have to  play with some poise. We are still really young. We have only two sophomores."  </P> <P> The sophomores are Joli Eberhart and Stacia Allen. Eberhart was the Orange  Empire Conference player of the year and an all-Southern California pick. Allen  was an all-conference player.  </P> <P> Golden West (21-3) is the top-ranked team in Southern California but is second  behind DeAnza (23-0) in the state.  </P> <P> Golden West opens with Sacramento City (17-0) at 8 p.m. in the first round of  the double-elimination tournament.  </P> <P> "Sacramento is the only team I know nothing about," Gasparian said.  </P> <P> In other first-round matches: Cabrillo (19-2) plays Cerritos (15-2) and  Grossmont (17-4) plays College of the Sequoias (11-1) at 6 p.m.; DeAnza plays  Pasadena City (17-2) in the other 8 p.m. match Friday.  </P> <P> The tournament's championship match is scheduled at 6 p.m. Sunday.  </P> <P> Grossmont, the defending state champion, also won the title in 1987. Golden  West won titles in 1979, '84 and '88.  </P> <P> No team from Northern California has won a title in the state tournament, which  started in 1977.  </P></p>

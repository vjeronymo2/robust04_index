			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / No relish for cheese and pickle sandwich In a rare display of corporate humility yesterday one of the world's best-known companies admitted to making a big mistake when it unveiled a secret weapon to take on the UK's supermarket chains. McDonald's, the hamburger chain that brought the world the Big Mac, thought it had another winner when it announced the new product to its expectant staff. Enter the McPloughman's, a cheese, pickle and salad sandwich. Mr Paul Preston, president of McDonald's in the UK, told the conference that the McPloughman's was devised to compete with supermarkets in the cold sandwich market. Instead of applauding this marketing innovation, however, staff were unimpressed. Mr Preston admitted: 'If we had done our homework we would have found that our customers didn't want the product and our staff were embarrassed even to have to say McPloughman's, let alone to have to sell it to our customers.' In a masterly piece of understatement, he added that if the company had carried out market research 'we would have found that this was not a highly desirable product'. When it did survey customer attitudes it found even more shocks were in store. Customers, he said, told McDonald's they were 'loud, brash, American, successful, complacent, uncaring, insensitive, disciplinarian, insincere, suspicious and arrogant'. He said: 'We thought we knew about service. Get the order into the customer's hands in 60 seconds - that was service. Not according to our customers. They wanted warmth, helpfulness, time to think, friendliness and advice. What they told us we were giving was horrifying. 'What we had failed to see was that our customers were now veterans in the quick-service market and their expectations had gone through the roof.' The McPloughman's market test was restricted to central London and shortlived. Only now, more than three years after the sandwich debacle and the first customer survey, has the company felt confident enough to reveal the episode. Mr Preston said the research, first carried out late in 1991, had been a turning point for McDonald's in the UK which had led to a radical change in its business approach. Rather than relying on gut feeling that it knew what customers wanted, the company had developed a fact-based approach to planning.</p>

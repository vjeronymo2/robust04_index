			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Ministry of Defense; place and date </F> not given]    [Text] With the help of Almighty God, with the bravery of  the heroes of the Armed Forces, and with the cohesion of all the  sons of the people with them, the forces protecting the unity  and Constitutional legitimacy are continuing to carry out their  combat duties against the gangs of the forces of renegade,  rebellion, and secession in the Yemeni Socialist Party. Their  wrong actions surrounded them and, therefore, they must be  defeated and must bow to the people's will and their strike  force on all axes and sectors.    On the Abyan-Aden axis, fighting is continuing in several  directions, and the forces of renegade and secession are trying  to send innocent people to certain death to merely gain time,  show empty arrogance, and entertain themselves with destruction,  after the units of the Armed Forces--the forces of unity and  Constitutional legitimacy--tightened the siege [words  indistinct] and are continuing to follow their targets with  patience and accuracy, taking into account the circumstances in  the fields of confrontation on this axis. All the feverish air  and naval attacks have failed, and the forces of renegade and  secession sustained double losses as a result of the lack of  control of the collapsing and domineering [words indistinct],  their dark and ominous fate. The brave men in the air defenses  confronted the aircraft of the forces of renegade and secession  and managed to down two aircraft, and the hostile attacks did  not cause any losses.    On the Shabwah axis, the heroes in the units of the Armed  Forces are continuing to carry out the duties assigned to them,  and they made great progress in carrying out their missions  after they managed to control the (?Sab) District as a result of  the great cooperation by the brother citizens, who moved to  shoulder their responsibility along with their forces--the  forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy. The Armed Forces  received [words indistinct] a complete battalion of the  (?Hnayshan) Brigade, as well as the [word indistinct] forces in  the (?Nisab) District [words indistinct], which declared their  joining the forces of unity and constitutional forces, rejected  the conspiracy of secession and the plan of renegade and  rebellion, and condemned the sinful secessionist elements for  what they did against the people, the homeland, and the Armed  Forces and security.    On the al-'Anad-al-Hawtah axis, the heroes in our Armed  Forces are continuing their progress to carry out the remaining  combat duties on that axis. In this sector, 22 missile bases  were seized. The brave heroes in the brave Air Force continued  to carry out the duties assigned to them with success and  effectiveness. All aircraft returned safely to their bases.  With the continued progress of the forces of unity and  Constitutional legitimacy to confront the remaining forces of  renegade and secession, out of concern about people's lives, and  to avoid the continuation of the fighting, whose result is  considered decided in favor of the forces of the people, the  unity, and democracy, we renew our call on all officers,  noncommissioned officers, and the soldiers, who are still under  the control of the sinful secessionist forces to leave the  positions of hostility and come to unity and the people and to  join the forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy, which is  the place of every officer, noncommissioned officer, and soldier  in the Armed Forces. They will find every understanding of  their situation and the circumstances that forced them to be  [words indistinct] under the banner of the Yemeni unity.    The fate of the forces of wrong, deviation, secession,  partition, and destruction is known. [words indistinct]    [Signed] The Defense Ministry</p>

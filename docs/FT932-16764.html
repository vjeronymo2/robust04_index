			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: French right to go for growth AN EARTHQUAKE hit the French political system last week with the ousting of the Socialists from parliament. Will a similar earthquake hit the French market? Economists believe not, although the election has improved the chances for longer term growth, for two reasons: Markets try to anticipate events, rather than react to them. The crushing victory of the Right and Centre Right had been widely predicted and the market had already risen in consequence - the CAC 40 index stood at 2035 last week, having been 1870 at the beginning of the year. There was some residual uncertainty about the shape of the government. But so far, ministerial appointments have been everything the market could have hoped. Edouard Balladur, the new prime minister, was finance minister during the premiership of Jacques Chirac, when he spearheaded a drive for privatisation - just is the kind of behaviour the market was waiting for. Policy, rather than people, moves markets. The key policy for the French is the 'franc fort' (the strong franc). Mitterrand and Beregovoy had tied their government's credibility to maintaining the franc's high parity with the Deutschmark. That meant keeping interest rates high, even though inflation had come under control at around 2 per cent. The Right have already shown themselves to be as closely wedded to the franc fort as the Socialists. As far as the markets are concerned, therefore, there is no need to alter prices. If the policy is the same, it hardly matters who administers it. France's policy dilemma has a familiar ring for the British, who faced a similar problem last September. This was resolved on 'Black Wednesday' when sterling was withdrawn from the European exchange rate mechanism. That stark change of policy led to sharp recoveries by both the equity and bond markets, as interest rates came down from 10 per cent to 6 per cent. The fact that Norman Lamont remained chancellor was less important to the markets than the new policy which he implemented. This suggests that in France both bonds and equities should perform strongly, once interest rates fall. French benchmark bonds have offered a yield one percentage point above German bonds consistently for the last two years, and now yield slightly more than 7 per cent. This yield should come down once German rates fall, delivering capital growth. Meanwhile, French industry is desperate for cheaper credit. How can British investors take advantage? Collective investments, such as unit and investment trusts, are easier to invest in than French shares and bonds. Only two unit trusts, INVESCO French Growth and Providence Capitol Le Fond Francais, invest exclusively in French equities. The INVESCO fund's performance is impressive, with growth over five years of 117.45 per cent, placing it third out of 92 in the European sector, according to Micropal. Jean-Baptiste De Franssu, of Invesco, believes that there are other reasons to be positive about French equities. The new government can only accelerate progress towards reform of the French pension system. This would introduce tax incentives similar to British personal pensions, bringing new capital into the market. Privatisation, at generous prices for private investors, should provide the same stimulus to share prices which the privatisations of the Thatcher era produced for the UK, he believes. These views are echoed by Talal Shakerchi, European fund manager with Providence Capitol, whose small stock-picking fund has also done well in recent months. He believes French interest rates must come down, either via a French Black Wednesday - which he does not rule out - or following cuts in German interest rates. He is investing in companies which will benefit most from cheaper credit: consumer credit companies, and companies with high gearing. A similar strategy is followed by Schroders, which now has a positive view on France. Its only note of alarm concerns corporate earnings, which may be disappointing this year.</p>

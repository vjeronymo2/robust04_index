Kovalevskyy warned against a possible explosion at the  Chernobyl nuclear power plant from the accumulation of a  critical mass of plutonium and uranium in certain parts of the  reactor. This frightening theory has its peculiarities, because  the scientist based his calculations on his own research, still  not acknowledged by official scientific circles. This is why  Kovalevskyy's attempts to draw attention to his theory were  ignored. However, if there is even the slightest chance that a  new accident might occur, the hypothesis should be thoroughly  examined, the more so since the author of the letter refers to  analogous research by Japanese scientists. VECHIRNIY KYYIV sees  its goal as receiving a clear and grounded response from  representatives of the official scientific community. Today, we  are publishing the first response, provided by physicist Yuriy  Shvaydok, manager of the International Institute [as published].    Shvaydok: According to our calculations, there  should have been another explosion at the Chernobyl plant in May  1989. I made the calculations along with Candidate of Technical  Sciences M. Koponenko and radiologist V. Savin. A reaction  indeed, was launched then; fuel caught fire and the temperature  increased. However, the concrete plate cooled with liquefied  nitrogen cracked because of a difference in temperatures and the  accumulation of a critical mass was postponed.    All the arguments furnished by A. Kovalevskyy are correct.  He claims that the accumulation of uranium and plutonium  presents a danger. This is correct, but the critical mass of  plutonium is 14 kilograms and it may take a long time for the  process to complete. However, the threat presented by americium  is much more real. One should keep in mind that a huge plate is  hanging on pieces of wire and pipes inside the containment  bunker. Its fall would inevitably result in a gigantic dust  cloud. We cannot rule out that this might bring the mass of  americium-242 to a critical level. Americium is the material  used to build neutron bombs.    It takes 16 hours for americium-241 to transform into  americium-242, while its critical mass is just a couple of  grams. Taking into account the data on accumulation, periods of  disintegration, and complete decomposition, I have come to the  conclusion that the final explosion at the Chernobyl plant will  take place on 22 May 1999.    What will be the consequences? The one-kilogram bomb used on  Hiroshima claimed 100,000 lives. The Chernobyl explosion could  destroy mankind by initiating a ``chain reaction of reactors,''  both in Ukraine and abroad, including nuclear warheads.    What should be done with the reactor? There was a suggestion  to apply the ``green meadow'' method. To the best of my  knowledge, there is no way to use this method in Chernobyl. The  idea is a bluff. I think that preference should be given to  so-called ``membrane technologies.'' Basically, they call for  the use of flat membranes to equalize the concentration of  matter in a solution. By using this method, we can interrupt  the process of building up a critical mass. Following this, we  may begin the decontamination of the Chernobyl facility.</p>

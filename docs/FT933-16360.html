			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Books: Evacuee goes west A BUNDLE FROM BRITAIN by Alistair Horne Macmillan Pounds 17.99, 333 pages ALISTAIR Horne was bundled from Britain to America in July 1940, aged 14, one of thousands of schoolchildren evacuated to America in the early part of the war before the threat from U-boats made the crossing too dangerous and the evacuations were halted. Now an accomplished historian and the author of the recent biography of Harold Macmillan, he evokes in marvellous detail the perils and pleasures of growing up in America, not least his release from an English boarding school education made unbearable by snobbery and bullying, and his welcome into the warm and unaffected environment of a Bostonian family clan. What his American family found when they unwrapped their bundle was not exactly lovable. 'I was a jangle of complexes and inhibitions, with the instinctive snarl of the mongrel waiting to be kicked, without a shred of self-confidence or dignity.' For that, perhaps, partly blame the death of his mother, Auriol, when he was five and a single childhood spent with a succession of governesses, one of whom he later seduced when she visited him at Cambridge ('She had an engaging way of saying at the appropriate moment, 'Was that nice?' - much as I remember her enquiring after I had gobbled up one of Cook's puddings'). One of the charms of Horne's book is the vignettes he provides of vanished worlds, helped by the fact that his mother wrote everything down and threw nothing away, even her dance cards. Born into the Scottish aristocracy, she became a pioneering woman journalist and a star of 1920s high-life, following the example of her aunt Maggie, a legendary Edwardian hostess, who had married into the Grevilles and kept court at Polesdon Lacey. Marriage to James Horne, 18 years her senior and the possessor of a small fortune acquired in India, was not a success. Horne's father retreated to the Oriental Club, and his mother's social world whirled faster until she died in a car accident. When he was not being bullied, Horne junior seems to have spent most of his schooldays trying to build incendiary devices from chemistry sets in the school shed at Ludgrove, where the Royal princes William and Harry are presently schooled. Horne thinks it must have improved. It needed to: 'To me, in its humbug, snobbery and rampant, unchecked bullying, it came to represent everything that, all through the rest of my life, I most disliked about England.' Thrown into a large, exuberant American family, his first response to sharing a tiny twin-bedded attic with the eldest son is to ask, 'But where's my sitting room?' Gregariousness soon knocks the edges off this awkward young English boy abroad, even as he anxiously listens to the news bulletins from England. And as America inched towards involvement on the Allies' side, Horne paints a vivid picture of the arguments between Isolationists and Interventionists being played out between 15-year-olds in the classroom and on the tennis courts of Martha's Vineyard. Volunteering for the RAF, via Canada, Horne finally returns to England, to find that the family seat has been sold and that conditions are far worse than his heroically phlegmatic father ever let on. Father and son enjoy an all too brief rapprochement; only a few months later his father falls and fractures his skull while walking home from the Oriental Club in the black-out. For all such sadnesses, though, this is an exuberant book, which describes, with honesty and humanity, a childhood played out against the backdrop of some of the most momentous history this century.</p>

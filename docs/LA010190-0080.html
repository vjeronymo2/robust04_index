From The Times Orange County in 1979: "The '70s are likely to be  remembered as the end of Orange County's free-wheeling growth . . . roads grew  more crowded. Environmental concerns led to constraints on development. Many  young adults lost the American Dream of owning a house. . . . Perhaps the  brightest note during the '70s was the rebound of Orange County's economy. . .  . Housing and transportation . . . will be Orange County's most goading issues"  of the '80s. . . . Sound familiar? Steve Emmons  </P></p>

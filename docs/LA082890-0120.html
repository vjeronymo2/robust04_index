			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FIVE WOUNDED IN SHOOTING AT SANTA ANA BAR  </P> <P> An unknown man armed with a semiautomatic handgun sprayed a neighborhood pub  with bullets early Monday, wounding five patrons, police said.  </P> <P> Santa Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said the five men were inside the  Red Baron Bar, a small, narrow saloon in the 1800 block of South Main Street,  when a gunman carrying a .25-caliber semiautomatic handgun reportedly flung  open the front door just after midnight.  </P> <P> "He just stuck his hand inside the door and started shooting randomly at the  patrons inside," Thomas said.  </P> <P> Investigators have no suspects yet, she said, and they are puzzled as to a  motive.  </P> <P> "It doesn't appear to be robbery or anything like that," Thomas said. "We are  trying to determine whether he had been in the bar earlier."  </P> <P> The bar, which was purchased May 1 by Bok Sun Song and sells only beer and  wine, was crowded at the time of the shooting, and five or six employees were  working, said Song's brother-in-law, who declined to be identified.  </P> <P> All of the victims are expected to recover, although at least three were  seriously wounded, hospital officials said.  </P> <P> Steven M. Sayles, 38, of Colton was taken to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana,  where he underwent surgery for a bullet wound to his stomach.  </P> <P> Jorge Guardado, 25, and Francisco Munoz, 29, both of Santa Ana, were taken to  UCI Medical Center in Orange, hospital spokeswoman Fran Tardiff said.  </P> <P> Guardado was reported in serious condition with two gunshot wounds to his  stomach, Tardiff said. Munoz was listed in fair condition, she said, also  suffering from a bullet wound, but she did not know where he had been shot.  </P> <P> Fillimon Covarubias, 21, of Santa Ana was taken to Mission Hospital Regional  Medical Center in Mission Viejo, where he was admitted with a bullet wound to  his stomach, hospital spokeswoman Nancy Gasho said. He was listed in serious  but stable condition.  </P> <P> Juan Ruvio, 42, of Santa Ana was also wounded, but police said they were unable  to determine where he was being treated.  </P> <P> The state Alcohol Beverage Control Department has no record of recent trouble  at the bar.  </P> <P> City and police records for the last few years show only an arrest for assault  with a deadly weapon at the location several years ago, Thomas said.  </P> <P> The establishment remained closed on Monday while employees cleaned up and  straightened out the bar.  </P> <P> "We need to get some semblance of order around here so we can open tomorrow,"  the owner's brother-in-law said.  </P> <P> He said that employees could offer little information to police because the  armed assailant -- by remaining outside the establishment when he fired and  then fleeing the scene -- did not allow anyone to see his face.  </P> <P> "We don't know anything more than the police know right now," the man said.  "They are not really able to say much to anybody."  </P></p>

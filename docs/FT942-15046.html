			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Balladur losing out to Chirac Mr Edouard Balladur, the centre-right French prime minister, failed to halt the decline in his popularity in the latest opinion polls, and is now losing ground against Mr Jacques Chirac, the Paris mayor, as the favourite contender in next spring's presidential elections. The prime minister's approval rating fell by two points in the past month to 43 per cent, according to the authoritative IFOP poll published in yesterday's Journal du Dimanche newspaper. This decline marks a stark contrast to his stellar performance last year. Perceptions of Mr Balladur have since been clouded by a series of humiliating climbdowns culminating in this spring's virtual abandonment of plans for a new minimum youth wage after violent protests by young people and students.</p>

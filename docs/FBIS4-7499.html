			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [G. Mihajlovski commentary: "A Group Photograph With the </F> Forest Ranger"]    [Text] The United States has taken matters into its own  hands. Just like the joke about the partisans and Germans  fighting in the forest, when the forest ranger arrives and kicks  the latter and the former out of the forest. The United States  has been observing the EU countries expressing all their  principles, vetos, ministerial councils, rotating presidencies,  voting practices, and declarations without displaying the  strength to cope with the Greek-Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] dispute, and it finally decided to  send its own man to try and finish the job.    U.S. President Bill Clinton's special envoy, New York lawyer  Matthew Nimietz, was very clear: "We bear in mind the fact that  we have very friendly relations with both sides, but also the  fact that this issue is of concern to the region and the world."  He was even more plain in Athens: "This is a dispute that  endangers peace and stability in the region, therefore it is of  concern to the United States."    Formally, Niemitz is only helping the interrupted  negotiating  process begun under the sponsorship of the United Nations.  Therefore, the fate of future Macedonian-Greek relations, right  now, depends on the skills of Cyrus Vance and Matthew Niemitz --  both New York lawyers.    After recognizing Macedonia, the United States halted the  establishment of diplomatic relations because of Greece's  opposition. However, its clear interest in this region was  expressed for the first time last Summer, when 300 U.S. soldiers  landed at Skopje Airport and joined the UNPROFOR forces. The  inclusion of Niemitz in the mediation process between Greece and  FYROM, particularly the arrival of John Shalikashvili, chairman  of the U.S. Armed Forces Joint Chiefs of Staff, in Skopje that  same week, only added to the belief that the United States is  really determined to have a strong influence in this part of the  Balkans.    Greece, on the other hand, is caught in a very inconvenient  position -- on the one side pressed and embarrassed by its  partners in the European Union, and on the other side limited in  its actions because of public opinion, to which it continually  serves up mass national meetings, has also turned to the United  States. After discussions with Niemitz, Greek Foreign Minister  Karolos Papulias stated that he hoped the following weeks would  give a positive result. Papulias's optimism becomes more  understandable in the context of the announced visit of Greek  Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou to the United States,  scheduled for 22 April. Namely, Niemitz made it clear that  Washington would like to see the dispute between the two  countries solved before this date.    In view of Clinton's posing with Tudjman and Izetbegovic for  reporters after setting down on paper their Constitution within  two weeks, something the European Union did not succeed in doing  in two years, a logical question arises: Will Gligorov and  Papandreou have a picture taken together with the "forest  ranger" before or after 22 April?</p>

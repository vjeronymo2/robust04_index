			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend blow at BOC CURMUDGEONLY dividend forecasts from BOC combined with caution over future prospects prompted a savage market rerating of the shares yesterday. The stock was the hardest hit in the FT-SE 100 Index, dropping 30 to 596p, its lowest point for more than a year, with turnover of 8.5m nudging record levels. Most chemicals analysts had been expecting a continuation of a policy established some five years ago of dividend growth above inflation. But when BOC announced profits in line with expectations at Pounds 337.6m, up from Pounds 215m, it also said it would pay an unchanged dividend of 23.2p for the year to September 1994. The company said: 'It is very difficult to look forward to that year (1994) with confidence in economic circumstances that are becoming more uncertain rather than more certain.' The board made moves to persuade analysts that the flat dividend projection was merely a shift in policy that had ignored low UK inflation and interest rates, but most saw the move as an underlying indication of gloomy times to come. Moreover, having seen BOC's share price tumble from above 760p over the past nine months, analysts had hoped the problems were now discounted in the price. Mr Jeremy Chantry, chemicals analyst with Kleinwort Benson, said that in spite of heavy falls in the share price in the past months, he expected further weakness and was downgrading his positive recommendation on the stock. 'Most people had expected a rise in the dividend - even a token rise would have indicated some optimism for the coming year,' he added. Courtaulds, which is expected to announce interim profits of around Pounds 88m today, suffered in BOC's wake, the shares weakening 13 to 476p.</p>

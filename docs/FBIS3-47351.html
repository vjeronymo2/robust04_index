			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa said Wednesday [12 January] the government wants to get  political reform bills through a House of Councillors plenary  session not later than January 19.    In related developments, an upper house political reform  panel adopted a motion by the governing coalition to hold a  public hearing in local cities on January 18, a precondition to  voting on the bills in the upper house plenary session. On  Monday, the committee endorsed a resolution to hold a hearing in  Tokyo on January 17.    The committee rejected a motion by the opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) to hold public hearings in Tokyo on  January 18 and 19 as well as in local cities on January 20 and  21.    Speaking to leaders of Japan's four main business groups  during a luncheon, Hosokawa said he called for the passage of  the bills through the upper house.    The groups are the Federation of Economic Organizations  (Keidanren), the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the  Japan Federation of Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren) and the  Japan Association of Corporate Executives.    If the bills pass the second chamber without being modified,  they will become law since the bills cleared the more powerful  House of Representatives on November 18.    Hosokawa also said he will consider whether it is possible  for the government to amend a package of four  government-proposed bills in the upcoming 150-day ordinary Diet  session starting from January 31.    He has staked his political future on the enactment of the  bills by the end of the current Diet session on January 29.    The bills call for replacing the current 511-seat lower  chamber with a 500-seat mixture of 274 single-seat  constituencies and 226 proportional representation seats.    The LDP has been demanding that the number of single-seat  constituencies be increased from the proposed 274. It has also  urged the coalition to ease curbs on a proposed ban on donations  from business corporations to individual politicians.    Earlier in the day, Yubun Ueno, a panel member, replaced  Shoji Motooka as committee chairman. Motooka resigned after the  panel passed a no-confidence motion against him in protest  against his handling of the political reform bills.    The committee voted 17-16 to pass the motion submitted by  the  LDP with the endorsement of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP)  and the Niin Club, a small parliamentary group.    Both Ueno and Motooka are members of the Social Democratic  Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the largest among the seven  parties in the ruling coalition.    The LDP accused Motooka of ignoring its objections to the  timetable for public hearings set by the governing coalition.    The timetable for public hearing paves the way for the  ruling  coalition to vote on the reform bills.    Coalition sources said the ruling parties may vote on the  package of four reform bills in the committee on January 19 and  at a plenary session later in the day.</p>

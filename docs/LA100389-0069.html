			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KISSINGER SAYS TO BEST OF HIS KNOWLEDGE INDIAN LEADER DESAI WAS NOT CIA AGENT  </P> <P> Testifying in court for the first time about national security matters, former  Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger told a jury Monday that while he never  knew the names of intelligence sources, "to the best of my knowledge" former  Indian Prime Minister Morarji Desai was not a CIA agent.  </P> <P> But in carefully measured testimony, Kissinger never said, unequivocally, that  Desai was not an agent.  </P> <P> Kissinger's unprecedented federal court appearance came in a libel suit Desai  filed against journalist Seymour Hersh for assertions in his 1983 book, "The  Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House." In a chapter dealing with  India, Hersh wrote that Desai was a paid CIA agent who provided information on  plans and policies of former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's  Administration in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seeks $100 Million in Damages  </P> <P> Desai, now 94 and in poor health in Bombay, called Hersh's report "a scandalous  and malicious lie." The former Indian politician, who also served as finance  minister and deputy prime minister, is asking for $100 million in damages  claiming the book brands him as a traitor to India.  </P> <P> Hersh, who won a 1970 Pulitzer Prize for disclosing the My Lai massacre during  the Vietnam War, sat quietly, eyes fixed on Kissinger. Hersh, who has written  extensively on the American intelligence community, maintains that he has  multiple confidential sources for his claim and believed the information was  true when he wrote the chapter.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Charles R. Norgle ruled last week that Hersh did not have  to reveal his sources.  </P> <P> Sometimes testy and sometimes witty, Kissinger was a reluctant witness who had  fought the subpoena served on him two weeks ago when he was giving a speech to  the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations. Outside the courtroom, he told  reporters that he had an agreement with lawyers that if he gave a deposition in  the case, he would not have to appear in court.  </P> <P> "I was not eager to testify," he said.  </P> <P> Kissinger, who was accompanied by his wife, Nancy, said this was only his  second time he had ever appeared in court. The first time, he said, he was a  witness for Mrs. Kissinger, who was accused of assaulting a supporter of  political extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche at an airport terminal. She was  acquitted.  </P> <P> In court Kissinger discussed information the United States received in the days  leading up to the 1971 India-East Pakistan war that led to the formation of the  new country of Bangladesh and acknowledged that there was reliable information  coming from within the Indian government.  </P> <P> Before giving his deposition in the case, Kissinger said he checked with former  CIA director Richard Helms. Kissinger, responding to a question by Hersh's  lawyer, Bernard Nussbaum, said he told Helms that "to the best of my belief Mr.  Desai was not an agent. And he (Helms) said, 'you are on safe ground saying  that.' "  </P> <P> When Desai's lawyer, Cyriac Kappil, asked Kissinger if he ever had a reason to  believe Desai was an agent in 1969, '70 and '71, Kissinger said: "I have no  such reason to believe that."  </P> <P> The former national security adviser to President Richard M. Nixon and  secretary of state under both Presidents Nixon and Gerald R. Ford could not,  however, identify names of sources of information.  </P> <P> "We were never briefed as to names, but we were briefed as to categories,"  Kissinger said. However, he said that he could not discuss what those  "categories" were. "That gets us into classified areas."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Attests to Unknown Sources  </P> <P> But Kissinger also testified that the U.S. did have sources unknown to him who  were providing high-level intelligence from within the Indian government.  </P> <P> After his three hours on the witness stand, Kissinger told reporters that he  too considered filing a libel suit against Hersh after reading portions of the  book but decided against it because of the time that it would take. And he said  he hoped this was his last association with the journalist.  </P> <P> "I would be just as happy if I never heard of Mr. Hersh again," Kissinger said.  "I'm not looking for an opportunity to prove points against Mr. Hersh. Frankly,  the quicker he goes out of my life the happier I'll be."  </P> <P> The trial is expected to last several more days.  </P> <P> Desai's lawyers filed their suit in Chicago citing a tradition of filing  defamation actions in the home town of the defendant. While he was born in  Chicago, Hersh no longer lives here.  </P></p>

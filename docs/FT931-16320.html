			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / International Company News: Property investors seek tighter safeguards NORTH American property investors are insisting on tighter safeguards to avoid a repetition of the acrimony and financial loss which marked last year's collapse of developer Olympia &amp; York. The heightened caution among investors is reflected in a pioneering mortgage bond issue completed recently by two Canadian securities dealers for Les Terrasses de la Chaudiere, a 1.9m sq ft hotel and also a government office complex on the outskirts of Ottawa. The CDollars 135m (USDollars 112.5m) private placement, arranged by RBC Dominion Securities and Scotia McLeod of Toronto, includes several provisions to ensure the owners of the building cannot hold up or divert rental income which is required for debt-service payments. The issue was distributed to about a dozen financial institutions, mostly North American life insurance companies. An official at ScotiaMcLeod said the agreement had been made 'as bullet-proof as possible to ensure that there is no intervening party between the government (the tenant) and the bondholders.' Several similar deals are in the pipeline, including a mortgage on a large new building in Toronto occupied by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. O&amp;Y raised funds for numerous projects in the US and Canada during the 1980s by setting up 'single-purpose' companies which were supposedly insulated from any financial problems which might be experienced by the developer. However, rents were paid to O&amp;Y. Lenders discovered last year the developer had siphoned cash out of healthy buildings to prop up the troubled parts of its empire. Investors in the Chaudiere development, owned by three limited partnerships, have insisted that rents be paid directly to a trustee, which must immediately make the required debt-service payments. As a further safeguard, the trustee is obliged to disclose all information on the project required by bondholders. Existing lenders' permission will also be required for any further debt secured by the project. In addition, the bonds amortise over 20 years, with no bullet payment of principal at final maturity. Dominion Bond Rating Service of Toronto has assigned the bonds an AA Low rating. DBRS said in a recent report the main risk of the Chaudiere project is that payments may be delayed if the complex is included in a filing for bankruptcy protection. However, it concluded that investors have considerably more protection than was the case in similar O&amp;Y financings.</p>

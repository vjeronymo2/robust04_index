			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: Paramount Publishing in Dollars 10m first-quarter loss PARAMOUNT Publishing, the US media group, reported a loss of Dollars 10.1m in the first quarter of the current year, after taking a one-off charge of Dollars 26m for moving the offices of its publishing opera-tions. Without the charge, Paramount earnings were Dollars 15.9m, or 14 cents a share, compared with Dollars 28.3m, or 23 cents, in the same period last year. Paramount's earnings were hurt by seasonal losses in educational publishing that more than offset profits from such best-sellers as Beating the Street by Peter Lynch, and American Star by Jackie Collins. The entertainment division also performed poorly, especially in comparison with the first quarter of 1992. Paramount expects revenues from this division to increase in the second half of the year, as it reaps benefits from films such as Indecent Proposal, which to June had already grossed Dollars 153m. The company also said it expected earnings to gain later in the year from the newly acquired theme parks, and increased television programming. The theme parks only started operating full-time last week. Paramount recorded the Dollars 26m one-off charge after consolidating publishing operations into two sites in New Jersey, from locations across the country. It said the move would improve efficiency of the division.</p>

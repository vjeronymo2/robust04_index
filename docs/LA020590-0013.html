			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HELP THESE PEOPLE GO;  </P> <P> SOVIET JEWS: HAUNTED BY THE MEMORY OF POGROMS PAST AND FACING RENEWED  ANTI-SEMITISM, THEY NEED WESTERN HELP TO GET TO ISRAEL WHILE THE RIGHT TO  EMIGRATE IS STILL THAT.  </P> <P> Long before the rise of Hitler, anti-Semitism was alive and well in Eastern  Europe. Whenever social or political or economic crises occurred anywhere in  the region -- including Russia -- storms of anti-Semitism erupted replete with  pogroms and suffering for the Jews.  </P> <P> We may again be entering such a period. As the Soviet Union slips into anarchy,  chaos and severe economic hardships, glasnost has allowed the anti-Semites to  come out of the closet. Responding to deep emotional nationalistic feelings,  they blame the Jews for the country's growing problems.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union's Jewish residents are close to panic. Even people who barely  identified as Jews are suddenly clamoring to escape to Israel.  </P> <P> The relatively free right to emigrate now exists. The problem is that the  conveyances for bringing Jews to Israel is inadequate. Every available flight  is currently booked through mid-September. Emigrants have taken to driving  their cars to Budapest, where they abandon their vehicles and board flights to  Tel Aviv.  </P> <P> Given the political turmoil in Eastern Europe, no one can know how long the  gates will remain open. There are many ways they could be closed. The  Palestinians and Arab governments are urging the Kremlin to stop immigration to  Israel, just as they pressured the British in the late 1930s to restrict  immigration into Palestine. The rising tide of nationalism inside the Soviet  Union could yield a new government disinclined to allow emigration, or  conservatives could force Mikhail Gorbachev to change his policies. The recent  bloodshed in Baku is a dark harbinger of the potential oppression that could  befall many Soviet Jews if the situation inside the Soviet Union worsens.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, American Jews also seem strangely caught in a 1930s-time warp. Since  the end of World War II, many have vowed never again to remain quiet when a  community of Jews is threatened. Yet when history again calls upon American  Jews to work to save their suffering cousins, people are strangely silent. The  intifada in the Israeli-occupied territories, an uninspired Israeli leadership,  the past struggles for Soviet Jews, fascination with the democratic revolutions  in Eastern Europe, inability to assimilate the unbelievably quick pace of world  events -- all these factors have combined to create an unnerving fatigue and  cynicism that has swept through the American Jewish community and made it  unresponsive to the cries of many leaders and organizations.  </P> <P> Israel must prepare for an influx of Soviet Jews. A sense of excitement and  challenge is sweeping the country. In turn, some Israelis have tried to link  the plight of Soviet Jews with territorial claims on the West Bank. History  will treat harshly any Israeli leader who endangers, through the use of  grandiose and threatening rhetoric, the ability of Soviet Jews to flee to  safety.  </P> <P> Let us be frank, however. A minuscule number of incoming Soviet Jews now seek  to live in the West Bank -- at the most 1% to 2%. This tiny number will have no  impact on Arab or Israeli claims in a settlement process.  </P> <P> The vehemence of the Arab outcry against Soviet Jewish immigrants, even into  pre-1967 Israel, raises the most ominous questions concerning whether the Arabs  oppose military occupation of the West Bank or the Jewish presence in the  region completely -- hence Israel's right to exist.  </P> <P> For Americans, there is a clear path of action that we must take:  </P> <P>  -- Keep the pressure on Moscow to make sure that those Jews who wish to leave  can, and that direct air links to Israel be expanded.  </P> <P>  -- Keep the pressure on Israel to make sure that Soviet Jews being absorbed  are not directed to the occupied territories.  </P> <P>  -- Communicate to Arab governments and Palestinian representatives that we  oppose settlement in the occupied territories, but we strongly support the  immigration of Soviet Jews into Israel and view the current Arab campaign  against them as threatening to the integrity of efforts to shape an effective  peace process.  </P> <P>  -- Increase public and private assistance to Israel as it engages in the  gargantuan task of absorbing the refugees.  </P> <P> Concerted action now could avert potential disaster tomorrow. Do we have the  wisdom and the courage to act more skillfully today than our predecessors  behaved over five decades ago? So far, the portents have not been encouraging.  Never again? Wanna bet?  </P></p>

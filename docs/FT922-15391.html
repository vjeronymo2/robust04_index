			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Arts: Dezso Ranki/Nelson Goerner Ranki's appearance at St John's on Monday was a real lunchtime treat. London seems to have been starved of fine piano recitals lately - too many cancellations, too many second-rate pianists propelled to top billing - and by any measure Ranki, an infrequent visitor here, belongs in the top flight. His programme of Haydn, Kurtag and Beethoven for the BBC Radio 3 proved to be a fine showcase for his refinement and elegant control. There has never been anything ostentatious about Ranki's playing. Haydn's F minor Andante and Variations were unfolded with an easy, slightly melancholy grace; every particle became so beautifully focused that a momentary lack of precision, a flurry of semiquavers out of kilter in the second variation, was made to seem a major miscalculation, even though poise was immediately restored for the coda. Beethoven's E flat major sonata Op. 31 no. 3 was similarly adroit, consistently illuminated by Ranki's scrupulous concern for voicing and balance. The shading imparted to the opening phrase, the weight transferred gradually from left hand to right as the tone colour was allowed to open out, was characteristic of the care he lavished on every aspect of the sonata. It was capped by a scherzo of unflagging buoyancy, each line wonderfully articulated, and a finale of plain good humour. Between variations and sonata Ranki offered a group of a dozen pieces out of Gyorgy Kurtag's collection Jatekok ('Games'), child-like but never childish explorations of the simplest ideas - a single note, a single chord, a glissando. To an artist of Ranki's sophistication and accomplishment the miniatures offer a wonderful opportunity to demonstrate how effective it can be when the most straightforward things are executed effortlessly, and difficulties made to seem straightforward. Another non-appearance at the Royal Festival Hall by Martha Argerich; she was to have played there on Sunday, with the Philharmonia under Claus Peter Flor. On this occasion there was at least a substantial measure of compensation in the substitute: the young Argentinian Nelson Goerner, most recent prizewinner of the Geneva Piano Competition. I heard him for the first time last summer, when he stepped in at the Granges de Meslay Festival at Tours for an equally elusive front-rank virtuoso, Sviatoslav Richter, and acquitted himself with memorable poise and naturalness. On Sunday it took him all of the first movement of Mozart's C minor concerto, K. 491, to fine down the edgy brightness of his delivery and calm a tendency to run nervously ahead of the beat. But once disciplined to the services of the music, that same mercurial spirit touched on the sublime unease of the concerto with remarkable vividness. In the finale, Goerner's spontaneous responsiveness to the dramatic pull of the argument was balanced by his beautifully weighted delivery, with limpid, shapely, and at the same time 'personal' insights in every bar. With partnering less insensitively brisk and bandmasterly than Flor's, he would surely have made an even more positive impression; in any event he has successfully argued the case for a return invitation.</p>

			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER NOTEBOOK: NOW IS TIME TO REVIEW FIRE INSURANCE;  </P> <P> PROTECTION: MANY VICTIMS OF RECENT FIRES DISCOVERED THAT THEIR POLICIES DID NOT  KEEP UP WITH INCREASES IN PROPERTY VALUES.  </P> <P> With the memory of devastating wildfires that destroyed almost 500 Southland  houses late last month still fresh, this is a good time to review your existing  homeowners insurance coverage.  </P> <P> Many of the victims of the fires in Santa Barbara/Goleta, Glendale and Sleepy  Hollow in San Bernardino County's Chino Hills are discovering that they are  underinsured -- or even worse, that they have no hazard insurance at all.  </P> <P> With double-digit annual percentage increases in home values common in many  Southland areas in recent years, insurers emphasize the importance of  homeowners reviewing their insurance coverage at least once a year, according  to David H. Crocker of Western Insurance Information Service.  </P> <P> While you're required by your lender to have hazard insurance, adequate hazard  coverage is just as important even if the house is paid for, because you'll  need insurance money to repair or replace it if the house is damaged by fire or  a concrete transit-mix truck falls on it -- as actually happened recently in  Studio City -- or other covered perils.  </P> <P> If your insurer offers it, you might consider obtaining an inflation guard  endorsement that automatically increases the amount of coverage annually under  a homeowners policy as protection against inflation, he said. The charge varies  with the company.  </P> <P> Insurance coverage for the house, its contents and the homeowner's or tenant's  liability to others are most commonly combined into a single package called a  homeowners policy.  </P> <P> The basic homeowners policy -- called HO-1 in industrywide terminology --  covers 11 specified perils, including fire, theft and vandalism. The broad-form  policy -- designated HO-2 by the insurance industry -- covers these 11, plus  six others. A renter's policy (HO-4) is similar to the HO-2 and is for people  who rent an apartment or own a cooperative unit.  </P> <P> An advantage of having a homeowners policy over separate polices for fire,  theft and other perils is that a homeowners policy will pay any additional  living expenses -- over and above normal expenditures -- should the  policyholder be forced by fire or other cause to temporarily live elsewhere.  </P> <P> If, like many homeowners, you have personal property -- furs, cameras, jewelry,  art objects -- that may be more valuable than the limits set under the personal  property coverage of a homeowners or tenants policy, you might want to consider  purchasing a personal articles "floater" as a separate policy or by endorsement  to the homeowners policy, Crocker said.  </P> <P> Floater refers to the portable nature of the articles insured and the fact that  coverage applies wherever the articles are located at the time of the loss, he  said.  </P> <P> To receive full replacement payment for any partial loss or damage under a  homeowners policy, Crocker said, the owner must insure the dwelling for at  least 80% of its replacement value. To receive replacement for a total loss,  you must insure for the full value of the structure or buy a replacement-cost  policy.  </P> <P> "The market value of a house in most cases is not a good basis for determining  how much coverage to buy," Crocker said. "Meet with your insurance agent -- or  a customer service representative in the case of a direct-writing company -- to  determine what the replacement value is. It's important to remember that the  building lot represents a great deal of the home's value and it will not be  destroyed by a fire."  </P> <P> Another reason that it is important to have sufficient insurance is that the  amount of coverage on the house becomes the basis for determining what  percentages of the coverage are automatically assigned to other structures on  the property, for personal property and for additional living expenses.  </P> <P> Under most homeowner policies, detached garages and other outbuildings are  covered for 10% of the amount of the coverage on the house; personal property  for 50% and additional living expenses for 20%, Crocker said. Additional living  expenses are limited to 10% of the amount of coverage under the HO-1 and HO-8  (older home policy).  </P> <P> To collect for personal property destroyed in a fire, you'll have to provide  your company's claims adjuster with a record of all belongings. Western  Insurance Information Service offers a free brochure entitled "Taking  Inventory." Available from the nonprofit, non-lobbying group that serves 10  Western states, the brochure is a room-by-room checklist with space to record  the serial numbers of television sets, VCRs and stereos, as well as a listing  of other property such as furniture and appliances.  </P> <P> For a free copy of "Taking Inventory," contact Western at 3530 Wilshire Blvd.,  Suite 1465, Los Angeles, Calif. 90010. The toll-free telephone number is (800)  397-1679).  </P> <P> Besides completing the inventory and putting it in a safe place, Crocker  recommends:  </P> <P>  -- Keeping the sales receipts of all personal property you buy. Having the  sales receipts will help the adjuster determine the value of your damaged or  destroyed property.  </P> <P>  -- Take color photos of your property or, if you have a camcorder, make  videotapes of it. Open up the closets and photograph or videotape the clothing;  go into your kitchen and make a photographic record of the pots and pans.  </P> <P>  -- Engrave your property with a driver's license number. You can buy an  electric engraving device from a well-stocked hardware store. Engraving your  property makes it easier for police to identify it if it is recovered after a  theft. Be sure to record the numbers in your inventory booklet or other form.  </P> <P>  -- Keep all these records in a bank safe deposit box or a desk or locker at  work. They won't do you any good if they're destroyed in the fire.  </P></p>

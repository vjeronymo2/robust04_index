			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / International Company News: TAP records Esc50bn loss TAP Air Portugal, the state owned airline, has announced 1992 losses of about Esc50bn (Dollars 341m), five times bigger than it forecast, AP-DJ reports from Lisbon. TAP - one of several companies due for privatisation under the government's economic reform plan - blamed declining air travel, a fares war, the closing of domestic carrier Atlantis Airlines and high capital spending. Mr Ferreira de Amaral, transport minister, has said that US and Japanese companies have expressed interest in TAP, but the company declined to comment on the identity of possible investors. United Air Lines of the US is reported to be among those most interested.</p>

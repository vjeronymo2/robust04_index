			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of European Finance and Investments - Portugal (3): Spanish banks invade - Patrick Blum records the end of an era for Lloyds SOMETIME soon the distinctive rich, blue colours of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), Spain's biggest banking group, will be hoisted on to the front of the modern headquarters of Lloyds Bank Portugal on Lisbon's busy Avenida da Liberdade. The occasion will mark the end of an era for the British bank which put down its first roots in Portugal in 1865 as the Anglo Portuguese Bank, later transformed into the Bank of London and South America, and which has operated under its present name since the 1970s. One of the few banks to escape the 1975 revolution's sweeping nationalisations, Lloyds kept and developed a small but highly profitable business niche in the country. When the bank's sale to BBV for Pounds 110m is approved by the Portuguese authorities, it will also highlight the recent inroads made by Spanish banks into the Portuguese market. It is not quite a flood, but it is already a good deal more than a trickle. Apart from BBV, Banesto has bought a leading stake in Banco Totta &amp; Acores (BTA), Banco Santander has a substantial share of Banco de Comercio e Industria (BCI), and Banco Exterior de Espana has a main branch in Lisbon and plans to open several more branches this year. Furthermore, Banco Hispano Americano is waiting for authorisation to transform its Portuguese investment company into a bank, Banco Central has a representative office and a standing request for a branch and several regional savings banks have representations in Portugal. All this, of course, excludes specialised investment, leasing and real estate companies. But whereas most Spanish banks chose either to build up their stakes gradually in local institutions as Banesto has done through BTA's privatisation or start from scratch with an investment or fund management company, BBV has taken a different route by buying up an existing private bank with a small but well-established network of a dozen branches. It was an unexpected move, but one which fitted the Spanish group's strategy. Mr Gonzalo Terreros, BBV international manager, says the bank wanted to be in the Portuguese market to offer universal banking services with an emphasis on corporate and private banking. He sees Portugal as a rapidly expanding market with reactions similar to the Spanish market in the early 1980s. 'Spain and Portugal are the fastest growing areas in Europe,' he says. Lloyds was chosen after a study of various other possibilities including that of buying a bank that was being privatised. This was discarded as too slow, too uncertain, and as a potential source of conflict with the Portuguese authorities. BBV wanted to avoid the controversy that surrounded Banesto's move into BTA as well as the need to have to negotiate with too many diversified shareholders. At the same time it was not seeking a commercial bank with a large branch network. For size and nature of its business Lloyds fitted BBV's ambitions. Calculating that Lloyds which had been cutting back on its international operations may be willing to sell, BBV approached the bank and was able to clinch a deal within a relatively short time. 'We were sure that the bank would be healthy, productive and without bad surprises. So the Lloyds trademark was a guarantee,' Mr Terreros said. Another of the bank's assets with BBV was that although Lloyds was not a typical retail bank, it had a network of branches and operated in all BBV's target markets: wholesale and retail banking with a good corporate customer base in the state and private sectors, among medium and small companies, and with a solid private clientele of high net worth individuals. Since 1986, Lloyds has more than doubled its total assets which where valued at Es87.3bn at the end of last year with profits of Es1.2bn. Once it is authorised to transform the bank into a 100 per cent BBV-owned Portuguese subsidiary it intends to build on the bank's present strengths and seek to capture a greater chunk of the market among small and medium-size companies and among private customers. 'We think we will be able to develop immediately new products, new customers and markets, and compete with highly attractive products in those parts of the market that are growing very fast,' Mr Terreros says. Plans are to increase the number of branches to around 35 within 18 months. In the longer-term, the goal is to establish BBV as an important Portuguese bank with 'a Portuguese team and character, not a marginal foreign bank'.</p>

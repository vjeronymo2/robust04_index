			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Subdued party fails to bury Ashdown rumpus - Liberal Democrats 'IT'S business as usual,' was the refrain of the Liberal Democrats yesterday, one day after Mr Paddy Ashdown's admission that he had an affair with his former secretary five years ago. Inevitably, however, it was not. Statements from the two women involved - Mr Ashdown's wife Jane and his former secretary Ms Tricia Howard - together with an arrest in connection with the theft of the document which led to Mr Ashdown's public admission, meant the party could not put the matter behind it in a single day. There was a strange silence as Mr Ashdown rose in his place in the Commons yesterday afternoon to put a question to the prime minister. Either heckling or murmurs of support had been variously expected. His call for co-operation between politicians in Northern Ireland drew warm agreement from Mr John Major, but Mr Ashdown looked tense and somewhat abstracted. In a concerted effort to raise party morale Mr Ashdown gave a pep talk to workers at the Liberal Democrat headquarters in Cowley Street yesterday morning, while Mr Des Wilson, the party's campaign manager, wrote to those involved in general election work expressing pride in Mr Ashdown's leadership. Colleagues said Mr Ashdown was 'in good heart', but the tone of party managers was almost subdued. On BBC radio Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat president, seemed to imply that lack of time was an element in any lack of change to the party's campaign strategy. Mr Wilson said that Mr Ashdown would remain at the head of the campaign. He added that the plan was for a team of the younger MPs to have a high profile. He had already approved a series of advertisements in which Mr Ashdown did not feature, as he would be appearing extensively in news coverage. There was clearly some anger among Mr Ashdown's colleagues at the extensive treatment of the story by some tabloid newspapers, which Mr Wilson accused of trying to deliver a knock-out blow. 'They have failed,' he said emphasising the flood of letters and telephone calls of support that the party had received. Mr Ashdown travelled to his Yeovil constituency last night, and prepared for his local party's annual general meeting today. His next party engagement is the launch on Tuesday of a campaign to get constitutional reform on to the election agenda. By then, the party hopes, it really will be business as usual.</p>

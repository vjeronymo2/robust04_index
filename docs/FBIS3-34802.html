			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sudan has said that paragraphs occurring in the  report of Gaspard Biru, who is the special rapporteur on human  rights in Sudan, represent a deliberate insult to the Islamic  religion, and they make it necessary to interrogate the author  of the report and be condemned by all states, authorities and  organizations, which respect the rights of man and humanity.  This is because of the insult against Islam included in the  report.    In a statement issued yesterday by the Foreign Ministry in  this connection, it strongly condemned the insult addressed by  the rapporteur against the Islamic religion and its beliefs.  The Foreign Ministry demanded the ommission of the paragraphs  from the report touching on this matter. The statement pointed  out that Biru's report is part of a bigger plot targeting the  Islamic religion and its beliefs.</p>

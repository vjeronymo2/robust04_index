			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO WIMPS ALLOWED;  </P> <P> DANCE: THE FORMER 'PUNK PRINCESS' OF BALLET IS LOOKING FOR GUYS TO DANCE WITH  MADONNA. WANNA-BE'S NEED NOT APPLY.  </P> <P> As she chats about her life and work between mouthfuls at a favorite downtown  cafe one afternoon, Karole Armitage may seem the quintessential Bohemian  enjoying a leisurely brunch. But this is, in fact, a rare moment of repose for  Armitage, a working meal squeezed in before an afternoon of auditions for  Madonna's spring concert tour, which Armitage will choreograph, and only a few  hours before her departure for a four-month stay in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Despite the demise this past fall of her seven-member ballet troupe, the  34-year-old dancer and choreographer has a bulging calendar. Besides  choreographing Madonna's rock concert, she will be working on TV and film  projects, performing and also teaching.  </P> <P> Heartland meets SoHo would be one way to describe Armitage, a native of  Lawrence, Kan., who has called New York City home for more than a decade. Her  voice is heavy on Midwestern twang; in a style most antithetical to New York  natives, she punctuates her pauses, with an engaging smile of a hot-pink  painted mouth. The trademark bleached-blond fringe bangs (the rest of her hair  cropped boyishly short) are a vestige of the punk era, yet Armitage manages to  project a wholesome earnestness.  </P> <P> Although her future projects are more commercial in nature, she maintains they  represent a less marked departure from her previous work than might seem at  first glance.  </P> <P> "I've always used street dancing in my work," she said. "What Madonna liked  about it was the theatricality, the humor, the fact that it's not  one-dimensional."  </P> <P> Audiences at Armitage's ballets were just as likely to recognize the influence  of Balanchine in her work as that of Smokey Robinson ("I think of them as  equally great," she once said.) or Merce Cunningham, with whose modern dance  company she performed in the early '80s.  </P> <P> Popular culture has always been a real nourishment for dance, Armitage said.  "It's an old-fashioned idea to even separate high and low art any more."  </P> <P> Although she will first begin to choreograph for the Madonna concert in earnest  when the dancers have been selected, Armitage says that the steps will be  composed of "real, real funk dancing -- with some wild moments, but also with  some virtuoso stuff."  </P> <P> Indeed, auditions for dancers, held in Los Angeles (and closed to the press)  last week, were advertised as "Madonna World Tour 1990, Karole Armitage  Choreographer, Open Audition for Fierce Male Dancers who know the meaning of  Troop Style, Beat Boy and Vogue. Wimps and Wanna-Be's need not apply!"  </P> <P> In her work with Madonna, Armitage says she has gone from working with a  company of serious dancers to a single serious dancer.  </P> <P> "Madonna was a dancer. That was her first interest," Armitage said. "That's  what she originally came to New York to do. She's a sophisticated observer of  dance, and a very good dancer."  </P> <P> Besides the Madonna tour, upcoming Armitage premieres include choreography for  a feature film titled "Without You I'm Nothing" starring Sandra Bernhard, to be  released later this year, a dance film for the BBC and a series of performances  in Japan. In the planning stages are a film about Josephine Baker, for which  Armitage would choreograph the dance scenes, and a possible collaboration with  her live-in companion, artist David Salle, on a film about Pinocchio.  </P> <P> This summer, Armitage will teach and choreograph at the first of what is hoped  will become an annual summer dance workshop in Crested Butte, Colo., where she  recently bought a house. Part of the summer will also be spent at Cal State  Humboldt in a dance residency with the systemwide Cal State Summer Arts  Program.  </P> <P> All of Armitage's projects promise to be a departure from her choreography for  the stage, and, she hopes, a departure from her status as ballet bad girl as  well. For years, Armitage tottered on the edge of respectability and financial  solvency.  </P> <P> Her ballets, which more often than not were performed in clubs because of a  dearth of theater space, were always infused with elements of pop culture.  Armitage was dubbed the "Punk Princess" of the ballet world. While her new-wave  iconoclastic choreography and sleek-looking productions thrilled audiences,  they often ruffled the dance establishment, and offended critics, leaving her  with a checkered reputation as an artist.  </P> <P> Her work seen at the 1987 Los Angeles Festival, "The Elizabethan Phrasing of  the Late Albert Ayler," was pronounced by critic Martin Bernheimer as a "brash  array of musical and scenic elements" with a "narrow range of kinetic ideas . .  ."  </P> <P> But battling on the front lines of the New York dance scene is what Armitage  has been doing lately and on this day, Armitage's fresh-faced manner is  slightly tempered by a trace of weariness.  </P> <P> "The dance world in New York is a place where there is so much struggle, and so  little support for doing things that go against the established grain of what  dance ought to be," Armitage said.  </P> <P> The Armitage Ballet folded just as it seemed that the company might be on the  verge of cementing its status in the New York dance world, she said, because  its government funding wasn't renewed.  </P> <P> "I had to work about 12 hours a day, between fund-raising, working on  choreography, and administration. I just decided if there was no help from the  established dance world, then it was time to move on," Armitage said.  </P></p>

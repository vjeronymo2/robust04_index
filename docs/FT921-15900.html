			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (2): Aid packages linked to social and economic reform - Foreign Relations, Donors turn frustration into action 'FROM GOLDEN boy to whipping boy,' observed a senior Kenyan official, responding to the most severe jolt in foreign relations since independence nearly 30 years ago. Once an African development model, Kenya has become an important test case for the policy which links aid levels to good government. Thus the outcome of an aid donors meeting in Paris last November dwarfed in significance other important external issues such as the instability in the Horn of Africa, the development of closer ties with South Africa, and hopes for greater economic co-operation in east Africa. The donors, chaired by the World Bank, announced they were holding back on new aid pledges for six months. It was a remarkable demonstration of anger and frustration over corruption, the slow implementation of an economic adjustment programme, and the government's intolerance of opposition. Many forces for change in Kenya were at work, some going back years. But it seemed no accident that, days after the Paris meeting, President Daniel arap Moi ended Kenya's one-party system. The Paris decision was unprecedented in black Africa. Other states, such as Sudan, have lost aid because of human rights abuses or economic mismanagement. But the countries concerned have either been hostile to the west, or of little commercial or strategic interest. Kenya, however, presents a very different case. The pro-western stance adopted under the late President Jomo Kenyatta has been followed unwaveringly by President Moi. Its mixed economy, broadly pro-capitalist when much of Africa was espousing socialism, and home to some Pounds 1bn worth of British investment, expanded at a rate that won Kenya plaudits as an African role model. On issues ranging from backing for the boycott of the Moscow Olympics and a supportive part in efforts to bring independence to Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and Namibia, to military pacts with Britain and the US involving training facilities and access to the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa, Mr Moi has been a steadfast ally. The rewards have been considerable. Kenya has been one of the leading recipients of external aid in sub-Saharan Africa, in the last two years alone receiving some Dollars 1.6bn, while the ratio of grants to gross domestic product has grown from 1 per cent in 1986 to over 3 per cent in 1990. Even as aid was rising, there was an increasing feeling among donors that the Kenyan government was running what amounted to a skilful public relations campaign, drawing up admirable development plans and policy papers  -often containing frank analysis of economic shortcomings - but falling well short of targets when it came to implementation. With the thawing of the Cold War and the end of proxy conflicts in Africa, and the growing demand across the continent for multi-party government, the time was ripe to turn donor frustration into action. First to move were Kenya's Scandinavian partners, vigorously lobbied by Kenyans in exile, drawing attention to human rights' abuses at home. In October 1990 Norway stopped its aid programme after Kenya broke off diplomatic relations following Oslo's criticism of the government's treatment of a prominent dissident. This was followed last year when Sweden reduced aid and Denmark cut off all assistance. It became apparent that the World Bank, Kenya's largest donor, was prepared to put its foot down. In the course of 1991 the Bank suspended negotiations over a loan to the energy sector, which had become notorious for the level of corruption under Mr Nicholas Biwott, the energy minister, since sacked. Meanwhile, Washington's outspoken ambassador to Kenya, Mr Smith Hempstone, was increasingly critical of Kenya's human rights record; even the British government, hitherto a proponent of discreet, behind-the-scenes diplomacy, issued an unprecedented public warning. Speaking shortly after last November's arrest of government critics Mrs Lynda Chalker, overseas development minister, condemned the action as 'oppression of opposing views' and called for 'further progress towards democracy.' In spite of these warnings, it nevertheless came as something of a shock for the government - and provided a lift for the opposition - when the communique issued after the World Bank chaired Paris meeting put the principle of linkage between aid and good government so bluntly. 'Delegates made clear their willingness to support Kenya's economic development', said the communique, 'but stressed that levels of aid for Kenya also depend on clear progress in implementing economic and social reforms.' In vain, Kenyan officials have pointed out inconsistencies and anomalies in the application of this principle elsewhere. Nigeria, they note, has not attracted international opprobrium for its use of the electoral system in which voters line up according to their political preference, for a public count - a procedure dropped by Kenya last year. Nor, they argue, can Nigeria boast a better human rights record, and the country is renowned for corruption. Closer to home, Tanzania and Uganda are also candidates for 'aid linkage', officials suggested. They may have a point, acknowledged western diplomats in Nairobi, but it would not divert donors' from their target. Scenting success, Kenya's aid partners are unlikely to ease their pressures until the government has taken further steps down the path of economic and political reform.</p>

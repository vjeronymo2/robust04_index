			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / The Property Market: The paradox in Paris The rescue package unveiled last month for Credit Lyonnais, in which the bank transferred FFr40bn (Pounds 4.68bn) of non-performing property loans into a specially formed company, has highlighted a paradox in the French property market. The tactics used by French banks to deal with their property problems have helped avoid a market collapse; but the same strategies have also been blamed for a severe stagnation in the property investment market. A paltry FFr5bn of investment deals were concluded in 1993. The deep property recession that followed the heady 1980s left French banks with severe difficulties. By the end of last year lenders had already made provisions of about FFr70bn against their total exposure of some FFr450bn. But most analysts believe that larger provisions will be necessary to bring values down to more realistic levels. Those institutions saddled with the property assets of defaulting clients have sought to protect their balance-sheets; they have done this by resisting the sale of property on the open market in a bid to crystallise their losses. Most deals have involved swaps with other institutions or the transfer of properties to specially created companies. The Credit Lyonnais deal is a prime example. The bank has transferred FFr40bn of non-performing property loans into a new state-controlled company, with the government guaranteeing FFr18.4bn of the losses on these loans for five years. Credit Lyonnais said that the decision to hive-off the property assets was taken because it had found it impossible to estimate the level of provisioning they required. This practice, which has eased the pressure on banks to sell the property of defaulting clients, is partly blamed for the stalemate in the investment market. One reason why investors have held back is the scarcity of good quality buildings at a realistic price. 'Such practices have perpetuated an artificial shortage of good investment product; however, it is only fair to say that they were also instrumental in the early stages of the downturn in preventing a market collapse,' said Mr Robert Waterland of Jones Lang Wootton, property consultants. For some dealers, the relief that France has avoided a property crash is tempered by impatience at the slow pace at which the investment market is emerging from recession.</p>

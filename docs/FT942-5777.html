			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (14): Top of the chartists - Profile, Brian Marber Few activities conjure up a dull stereotype as readily as the chartist, whose dogged study of the past as a guide to the future can appear an intellectually arid exercise. Few men, however, confound this stereotype more thoroughly than Brian Marber, doyen of the trade. Maverick and man of strong views, an hour or two in his company is enough to make anyone turn to charts. Unfortunately, Mr Marber is not quite the marketing gift he first appears. Indeed, he has a somewhat ambiguous relationship with his calling. 'I told the secretary of the Society of Technical Analysts that it was not in the interests of the society to promote itself. We would do ourselves more good if we go around pretending to be weirdos. The efficiency of technical analysis is in inverse proportion to its acceptance,' he says. Mr Marber did not receive his first fee-paying client until June 1979, when he successfully predicted that the dollar would drop against the D-Mark. Within two years Mr Marber had left his position at the stockbroking firm Simon and Coates - In his last six years on the stock exchange, he had been voted best technical analyst in the City - and Brian Marber and Co soon followed, being set up in September 1981. Mr Marber will not discuss the size of his client base, but says it 'was originally all corporates - people who were fed up with forecasts from the banks.' Initially he called himself a forecaster. 'They would not have known what a chart was 15 years ago, and if they had they would have laughed]' Mr Marber may not enjoy marketing, but he knows a thing or two about advocacy. With the practised skill of one who has many times fought off the sceptics, he sets out his stall: A 1989 Bank of England study shows that 90 per cent of all FX decisions made in the market had some degree of technical analysis in them; 60 per cent thought technical analysis 'at least as useful as fundamental analysis'. To those who argue that maybe fundamental analysis is more useful further out, over six to 12 months, Mr Marber replies pungently: 'I can tell you that is absolute rubbish.' He cites a biannual survey where analysts are asked for their forecasts one year out. Of the 24 surveys he has monitored, in only 10 of those has the mean forecast been correct on the trend. The figures show, he argues, that fundamental analysts get the trend right about 40 per cent of the time. 'Random chance would have it that you would be right 50 per cent of the time, wouldn't it?' The same Bank study found that technical analysts were right no more than 50 per cent of the time. While Mr Marber concedes that charts will not help in a ranging market, he says 'they will never leave you on the wrong side of a trend'. Research shows that foreign exchange is the only market to trend, and it does so 58 per cent of the time. 'That is sufficient to make money,' he says. Nothing gives Mr Marber more pleasure than laying into the 'fundamentalists'. Purchasing power parity? 'A load of bullshit. The dollar was undervalued for 10 years in terms of PPP in the 70s. How the hell does that help you make a decision?' Interest rate differentials? 'Lex wrote the most arrant nonsense recently: if interest rates go up, currencies go up.' He then pulls out a chart of dollar/D-Mark going back a number of years which shows that the currencies followed interest rate trends only - wait for it - 40 per cent of the time. To Mr Marber, none of this is surprising. 'The function of markets is to try and discount the future. They concentrate on anticipating future interest rate differentials, not current ones.' In fact, sceptics have long ceased to be a problem. The enemy is now within  -the problem to be faced is how to deal with success. Fifteen years ago banks did not employ chartists and people wanting to see the dollar/D-Mark relationship plotted had to come to people like Mr Marber. Now it is the mere push of a button away. 'Everybody thinks he's a bit of a chartist,' he says. The problem now is that interbank trading in foreign exchange dwarfs trade-related flows. But most interbank trading, Mr Marber argues, is guided to a greater or lesser degree by technical analysis. The danger is that it then becomes self-destructive as 'there is no follow through, since no-one else is there'. He applies this logic to the range trading in foreign exchange markets since September 1992. Why? 'Because there are too many technically-inspired decisions. Give me a market that isn't subject to technicians. It's much easier.' Longer-term calls have become much more difficult, says Mr Marber. In the case of cable (Pounds /Dollars ), the one-year average used to change direction every three years. 'Nowadays, by the time you have called the change it has topped.' Mr Marber puts this down to improved communications. 'Arbitrage works on bad communication. Where are the fundamentals when people close positions at the end of the day?' he laments.</p>

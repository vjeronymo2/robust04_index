			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASSEMBLY UNIT APPROVES PLAN TO RAISE GAS TAX 5 CENTS  </P> <P> A proposal by Democratic Assembly leaders to raise the state's gasoline tax by  5 cents a gallon was easily approved Wednesday by the Ways and Means Committee  and sent to the floor of the lower house.  </P> <P> With Republicans splitting their votes, the measure by Transportation Committee  Chairman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) and Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) won  the endorsement of the fiscal and budget screening committee by a 15-6 vote.  </P> <P> Two Republicans -- Assemblyman William Baker (R-Danville) and Assemblywoman  Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) -- joined all the Democrats in approving the  measure. But afterward, Baker cautioned that the Republican votes favoring the  proposal should not be interpreted as a sign that Democrats are beginning to  win over the GOP.  </P> <P> "My vote means I want to see a transportation plan pass but I don't think it's  in its final form yet," Baker said. "I think the state desperately needs a  transportation plan for the next 10 years. I think Mr. Katz is a player and I  want to encourage him."  </P> <P> Baker said Republicans are still hoping that Democrats will compromise with  Gov. George Deukmejian and agree that the gas tax proposal should be subject to  voter approval in November.  </P> <P> "Katz's bill is moving very, very well and I'm optimistic," he said.  </P> <P> Both Katz's bill and a proposal by Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco) for a  10-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax hike require a two-thirds majority vote in both  legislative houses, but do not need a vote of the people.  </P> <P> Deukmejian has insisted that any gas tax increase must be approved by the  voters. But Democratic lawmakers have steadfastly maintained that the  Legislature would be abdicating its responsibility if it allows the electorate  to make the ultimate decision on a gas tax hike.  </P> <P> Katz's bill also calls for a 30% hike in most truck weight fees. Under the  proposal, the gasoline tax and the fees would continue to be increased every  two years for the next decade according to a formula based on the rate of  inflation.  </P> <P> By the year 2000, Katz said, the proposal would raise $21.5 billion in  additional revenue to be used for upgrading state and local highways and  improving and expanding mass transit facilities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> State Spending Limit  </P> <P> Although voters would not have to approve Katz's specific proposal, they would  have to change the state spending limit before any funds raised by new gas  taxes or truck weight fees could be spent. The spending limit, called the Gann  amendment after anti-tax crusader Paul Gann, was approved in a statewide  election in 1979.  </P> <P> Deukmejian has proposed that the limit be modified to exempt any new revenues  raised for transportation. Democrats have insisted that any modification must  cover spending on an array of state services. The governor has proposed asking  voters this November to both change the spending limit and authorize a gas tax  increase.  </P></p>

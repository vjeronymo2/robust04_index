			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Letter: Right project for taxpayers Sir, Your leader on the Jubilee Line extension ('Transport in Docklands', July 22) is timely. With current spending restrictions, the question is whether the taxpayer should commit any money at all to building a tube extension that few people actually require. The Central London Rail Study recommended 'East/West Crossrail' as a first priority to meet present needs. If the taxpayer is to spend mega-money on railways, Crossrail should be the chosen project.

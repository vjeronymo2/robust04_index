The government held a policy coordination meeting on  reunification and security on the morning of 3 June presided  over by Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and minister of the  National Unification Board [NUB], to discuss the government's  measures to prepare for the stage of imposing sanctions on North  Korea. The government has decided to suspend indirect trade and  ban civilian companies from contacting North Korean residents in  a third country.    The government has established a policy to focus diplomatic  efforts on drawing out a UN Security Council's resolution  concerning sanctions on North Korea and to request cooperation  from permanent member states of the council, including the PRC.  The government reportedly discussed imposing multinational  sanctions pivoted by Western countries, including the Untied  States and Japan, if the PRC vetoes the adoption of the  resolution against North Korea.

After today's coordination meeting, NUB Spokesman Kim  Yong-ki  said in a statement that the government's efforts for a peaceful  resolution is seriously challenged by North Korea's attitude,  that the international community is already taking steps to  enter the sanctions stage, and that our government is also  considering various effective measures of sanctions on North  Korea.    Spokesman Kim urged North Korea to abandon the reckless  attitude of confrontation against the whole world and said that  the government will seek measures to prepare for various  situations anticipated while watching the results of  negotiations between the ROK and the United States on the tense  development of the situation concerning the North Korean nuclear  issue.</p>

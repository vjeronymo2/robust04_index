			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Economic Notebook: China's unique path towards the free market CHINA'S leaders call their approach to reform the 'socialist market economy' or 'socialism with Chinese characteristics'. This is an attempt to give ideological grounding to the communist party's maintenance of firm political control while switching from central economic planning to the free market. However, there are a number of ways in which the rapidly growing Chinese economy really does have distinguishing characteristics from other reforming countries. First of all, there is its sheer size. The World Bank's exchange rate conversion methods give China a per capita GNP of Dollars 370 (Pounds 240) in 1990, the latest year for which figures are available. But figures from the United Nations International Comparison Program, based on purchasing power parities, give per capita GDP as Dollars 1,950. This would make China the world's second biggest economy, larger than Japan but well behind the US. The International Monetary Fund will shortly publish similar statistics, though it is understood to put China's per capita GDP at about Dollars 1,300, ranking the economy among larger European countries. The significance of such figures should not be overdone. China is still a low income country with a huge population. Professor Nicholas Lardy of the University of Washington, Seattle says that if per capita output continued to grow at four times the pace of the US, it would be nearly 30 years before the economy's size surpassed that of the US. If the early boost given by reforms to productivity wears off, it would not pass the US until the middle of the 21st century. 'On a per capita basis China would not catch up to the US until the end of the 22nd century,' Prof Lardy writes in International Economic Insights. Though China's growth has many similarities with that of the four 'dragons'  -Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan - Professor Lardy argues that China will not become a newly industrialized country in the sense of growing per capita income leading fairly rapidly to developed, high income status. However, Prof Lardy notes: 'In terms of economic impact, China could soon become the dominant player in Asia.' Deng Xiaoping's open-door policies have produced export growth rates to which countries such as India at present only aspire. China is uniquely placed to have a big impact on the region - and the world - because of the scale of growth of its imports and exports in periods, such as at present, when a renewed push for reform triggers rapid economic expansion. The numbers are big. The Asian Development Bank projects China's exports and imports this year at nearly Dollars 80bn each. Chinese import growth opens new markets for exports from Asian and other countries. But its growing industrial export capacity is replacing that of its neighbours, and its exports of low-technology labour-intensive products such as toys and shoes are capturing significant shares of the world market. Moreover, its reforms are drawing large flows of funds from the region, partly due to another unique characteristic: the diaspora of well-off ethnic Chinese abroad keen to make profits in the motherland, and in particular the existence of Hong Kong as an entrepot of trade, investment, technology and management skill. While the scale of China's potential distinguishes it from other countries in the eyes of foreigners, size and its external impact are not what China means by emphasising the singular nature of its reforms. It is seeking a middle way between capitalism and socialism. For political survival, the communist party is trying to achieve market-led prosperity without the social disruption of the former Soviet bloc and the political pressures on reformers in the Indian sub-continent. Unchallenged political control has meant that unlike the east Europeans, China's leaders have been able to adopt a gradualist and experimental approach to reform, described by former premier Zhao Ziyang as 'crossing a river by feeling stones on the river bed'. They started with some advantages: a narrow industrial base, a high savings rate, a decentralised provincial system. Starting from this base, piecemeal reform had substantial benefits. Initial agricultural reforms reduced innate fears of basic shortages and created a new store of wealth as well as available labour which assisted subsequent reform. Most importantly, rather than attempting privatisation of loss-making state industries, China has fostered the development of non-state industry. This has dramatically cut the state's role in the economy, and has put competitive pressures on state industries. Mr Cyril Lin of St Antony's College, Oxford, notes in a recent paper 'the overwhelming importance of the market mechanism in China today: only 12 per cent of total industrial output was subject to planning in 1992, and is expected to fall to 7 per cent this year'. He says only 25 per cent of investment is centrally planned, and 83 per cent of sales are through the market. China, says Mr Lin, is unique among former Soviet-type economies in that it has excess aggregate supply. 'An overstocked supply of consumer goods is chasing recalcitrant buyers.' By contrast, countries in the former Soviet bloc face declining output coupled with instability, making it impossible for them to be gradualist. For them debates about the value of shock therapy compared with China's evolutionary approach are merely academic, as Mr Lin notes. Economists seeking direct parallels with China which could help the former Soviet bloc are fairly hard pressed to do so. Unique though it may be, China cannot escape the need for sound economic management. It needs to cut the budget deficit by curbing losses and subsidies of state-owned enterprises. Financial reforms, including a greater a role for interest rates, are urgently required. With these deficiencies in macro-economic control - the credit gates are either fully open or fully closed - it is quite likely that China will continue to lurch through boom-bust cycles. However, the fluctuations should become less violent, and they seem unlikely to halt either growth or reform unless there is serious political turmoil or severe external shock.</p>

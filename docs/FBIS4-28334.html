			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>   [Text] In response to U.S. Commerce Undersecretary  Garten's remarks calling on Japan to let American companies  access its Official Development Assistance (ODA)-related  projects, concerned ministries, including the Foreign Ministry,  are wondering what the United States really wanted to say.  Government officials doubt that the United States sees projects  under Japan's ODA -- which reaches approximately $11 billion a  year -- as business chances and hopes to win those projects by  making business activities or whether it wants to secure a  certain share of ODA projects in a manner similar to the one it  took in economic framework talks with Japan.    Speaking at a 2 June news conference, Undersecretary Garten,  who is scheduled to visit Japan starting 5 June, said:  "Although Japan says that most of its ODA is untied -- which  means that the purchase of material to be used for ODA projects  is open to foreign companies -- current business opportunities  for foreign companies are limited." An untied percentage of  Japan's ODA in fiscal 1993 is 96.9 percent. Of this, the  purchase of materials from the United States accounts for about  5 percent. It is apparent that the United States, who maintains  there is less chance for American companies to take part in ODA  projects, bases its demand on such a low percentage.    The Foreign Ministry counterargues, saying: "Since the  international open bidding system has been introduced to ODA  projects, even the percentage of orders received by Japanese  companies has dropped to about 30 percent. This is because ODA-  receiving countries' and their neighboring nations' competitive  power in bidding has increased, and the United States is not  treated unfavorably" (according to the Economic Cooperation  Bureau).    The Foreign Ministry says that when a contract on yen loans  is concluded with certain countries, it sends English-translated  documents showing details of the contract to each foreign  embassy in Tokyo. The ministry stresses: "A company's  receiving an order depends on how much effort it has made."    Concerning Commerce Undersecretary Garten's remarks, some  within the government show an optimistic view, saying: "He must  have made the remarks just in hopes of opening up a new,  attractive ODA- related market and encouraging American  companies to make further efforts."    However, Undersecretary Garten might have made the remarks  with an eye to pointing out alleged unfair transactions between  an ODA- receiving government and contractors because the United  States has strongly called on other industrialized nations to  sweep away suspicion that companies from industrialized nations  win a contract by sending bribes to an ODA-receiving country.    Attention is increasingly focused on how Undersecretary  Garten carries his point in meetings with Japanese officials and  business leaders. Although the Japanese Government says its  ODA-related projects are "fair and transparent," the U.S. may  step up the offensive depending on negotiations.</p>

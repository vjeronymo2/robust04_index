			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / China angered as US boosts Taiwan links Amid protests from Beijing, Taipei yesterday welcomed moves by the US to boost unofficial ties with the island, but complained the changes, announced late on Wednesday did not go far enough. Following a lengthy policy review, Washington will permit high-level bilateral meetings in government offices. Taipei's de facto embassy in the US, the Co-ordination Council for North American Affairs, will become known as the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office. 'We are happy to see and welcome the Clinton administration's policy adjustment toward us, but we are also dissatisfied with certain areas where we hope the US government can adopt a practical attitude to make further improvements,' Mr Frederick Chien, Taiwan's foreign minister, told reporters. He voiced disappointment that the US would not back Taiwan's bid to rejoin the United Nations. An angry Beijing sharply denounced the adjustments, warning, without specifying precisely how, that thawing Sino-US ties would suffer as a consequence. China views Taiwan as a renegade province. The US switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, implicitly acknowledging China's claim to sovereignty over the island. The US State Department said the enhanced contacts did not represent a deviation from the US's 'one-China' policy. The changes were made 'for the purpose of solving practical problems and doing business', according to a department official. 'They carry with them no implication that we consider the relationship (with Taipei) to be official.' The change coincides with a standoff among Taiwan, China and Japan over whether Taiwan's president, Mr Lee Teng-hui, should be permitted to attend the Asian Games in Hiroshima early next month. The US adjustment will be closely watched and could precipitate similar changes by other governments. The American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei, which has long lobbied for upgraded ties, said the US moves would improve business links but did not go 'as far as we would have liked'. Taiwan was the US's fifth-largest trading partner in 1993, buying US goods and services to double the value of China's trade. While the island's economic strength played an important role in policy change, its democratic transformation since martial law was lifted in 1987 has not escaped attention. Mr Shen Guofang, spokesman for China's foreign ministry, charged that the US upgrade 'seriously violates the principles' on which bilateral relations are based and 'interferes with the internal affairs of China'. Mr Shen went on to menace Japan, saying if President Lee is issued travel documents allowing him to attend the Asian Games, Sino-Japanese ties will be affected. 'If Lee Teng-hui goes to Japan to attend the Asian Games, it will bring serious political troubles to the Asian Games,' he said, declining to elaborate. President Lee is refusing to knuckle under to pressure to politely decline an invitation from the Olympic Council of Asia, putting the Japanese government in an embarrassing position. China earlier threatened a boycott, which could prove disastrous for the games as China's athletes are the region's strongest and comprise the biggest delegation. Analysts said Beijing fears an increasingly assertive and confident Taiwan is successfully punching through the diplomatic isolation which has shrouded the island since the UN granted Taipei's seat in the body to Beijing in 1971. Eyeing Taiwan's economic clout, countries which recognise Beijing are increasingly willing to risk provoking tantrums from Beijing to informally host Taiwanese officials. Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported yesterday that Beijing has drafted a 'war plan' to suppress Taiwan's gains in the diplomatic arena. The plan, approved by President Jiang Zemin, calls for a carrot-and-stick approach. Taiwan will relaunch its bid to rejoin the UN when the body reconvenes this fall. But China holds veto power as a permanent member of the security council, and is likely to block Taipei's efforts as it did last year. In Tokyo an embarrassed government was attempting to stay on the sidelines. Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's Socialist prime minister, said it would be difficult to arrange for Mr Lee's attendance at the games, but stopped short of barring him. China's political and economic weight as Japan's second largest trade partner, and the largest military power in the region means Japan is under compelling pressure to put China first. But a snub to Taiwan would harm Tokyo's policy of trying to keep the widest possible circle of friends among its Asian neighbours. Japanese government officials had no doubt their political masters would ultimately have to bend to China's wishes. Tokyo entertains diplomatic relations with Beijing but not with Taipei, they pointed out.</p>

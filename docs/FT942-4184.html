			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Vienna rises ahead of referendum Speculation on the outcome of Sunday's referendum on joining the European Union took Austrian share prices up a further 1.4 per cent yesterday for a two-day rise of 5.1 per cent, writes William Cochrane. The Vienna stock market's ATX index ended 14.82 higher on the day at 1,067.65 after aiming for a more spectacular gain, in which it recorded an intraday high of 1,081.55. This followed a 3.6 per cent advance on Wednesday as speculators bought for a 'yes' vote, and short-covering assumed panic proportions following a key chart reversal. However, brokers were cautious about the upswing. Mr Frank Jonuschat at James Capel in London noted that the ATX hit a 1994 low of 1,011.38 as recently as Monday, down by 17.3 per cent from its February 1 high for the year. Yesterday's gains, he said, were inclined more towards the utility and construction stocks, which had been hit severely by the market's decline this year, rather than the highly cyclical shares that had outperformed. In this, said Mr Jonuschat, investors were hedging their bets because they were cautious about the outcome of the referendum.</p>

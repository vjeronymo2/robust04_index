			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Plaudits pile up at home for hardline Hosokawa: In the face of domestic recession, the sight of a Japan that can say No is a new and welcome one in Tokyo The impasse between Japan and the US is unlikely to harm prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa's domestic political prospects. It might even improve them. Mr Hosokawa's clear denial of US demands and his refusal to cover up this disagreement with an ambiguous communique marks a clear break with Japan's previous attitude to its most important relationship. This reflects the consensus that Japan should stand up to the US, a view shared among his seven-party coalition and by the leadership of the opposition Liberal Democratic party. As Mr Hosokawa said in Washington: 'Until now we refrained from speaking candidly and saying what was difficult to say. In the past, Japan settled for ambiguous agreements with the United States that later became a source of misunderstanding and generated pressure from overseas. . . Now the bilateral relationship has turned into a mature relationship, one among grown-ups, and I'm very gratified to achieve that,' he said. With Japan deep in recession and the US well into a recovery, Mr Hosokawa's supporters would have found complete surrender to US trade demands all the harder to understand. He won full support from Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, trade and industry minister and a member of the Japan Renewal party, the main influence on the coalition's economic policy. 'Japan and the US have entered a stage to create a new relationship where one side is no longer subordinate to the other,' said Mr Kumagai. Even the LDP congratulated Mr Hosokawa for not caving in to US demands for numerical targeted rises in import market share. 'To accept such targets would mean abandoning the free trade principle and would go against the drive for deregulation,' said Mr Yohei Kono, the LDP president. Mr Kono's support is less striking than its sounds, given Mr Hosokawa's increasing habit of seeking joint positions with former LDP colleagues on vital matters, as a buttress against the fragility of his own coalition. As the reaction from Japan's business community over the weekend made clear, nobody had in any case expected a US-Japan trade deal. The failure to reach agreement was 'unavoidable', because Japan had 'stuck to its policy of rejecting the US managed-trade-like approach', said Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the powerful Keidanren business federation. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association praised government negotiators for not accepting numerical targets. Japanese business and politics are however, worried about the possible costs of Japan's new toughness, possible US trade sanctions and another rise in the yen. Accordingly, Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the chief cabinet secretary and one of Mr Hosokawa's closest allies, called yesterday for further steps to 'open up our market and increase domestic demand', without, of course, targets. President Clinton's veiled threat to use the yen-dollar exchange rate as a numerical target has already sent a worrying tremor through Japanese business, in the shape of the Japanese currency's rise to a three-month high against the dollar in New York on Friday. An anxious Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Nikkeiren employers' federation, said at the weekend the trade talks must continue. US trade sanctions and talking up the yen 'would merely increase mutual distrust', he warned. The risk that Mr Clinton might succumb to pressure for trade sanctions against Japan might also help Mr Hosokawa persuade entrenched bureaucratic and industrial interests to drop their opposition to his drive to reduce the more than 10,000 government regulations that choke economic activity. As so many times in the past, US pressure still moves Japanese governments. 'Japan, which. . . for the first time said No to what it cannot do, must implement what it can do as quickly as it can,' the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's biggest circulation daily newspaper, advised Mr Hosokawa yesterday. The prime minister must now 'take the initiative in resisting those forces that resist reform', said the Yomiuri's editorial.</p>

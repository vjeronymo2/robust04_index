			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Bank under pressure to intervene as pound falls STERLING AGAIN threatened to fall below DM2.81 on the foreign exchanges yesterday, compounding pressures on the UK government to bolster the currency's position in the European Monetary System. The pound finished at DM2.8150 in London, its lowest close since Britain joined the ERM in October 1990, while in New York it closed at DM2.8146. It is now less than 4 pfennigs above DM2.7780, its absolute floor against the German currency in the EMS. If sterling drops to that level, the UK authorities will be forced to sustain the pound either by heavy intervention in the foreign exchange markets or by raising interest rates. Alternatively, as some dealers suggest, the authorities could unilaterally devalue the currency inside the system or leave the ERM altogether - both of which the government has adamantly ruled out. Sterling's fall continues to be driven by the dollar's weakness. Traders are selling the US currency for D-Marks which raises the D-Mark's value against European currencies. Although central banks have intervened in the market three times in recent weeks to support the dollar, the policy has failed to turn the market. The dollar was still threatening its lows yesterday. Deepening gloom about the UK economy is exacerbating sterling's position. Even yesterday's good figure for retail price inflation, down 0.2 percentage points in July, had little impact on the currency markets. Some foreign exchange dealers feel that the pressure on the Bank of England to intervene in support of the pound is now overwhelming. They argue that while the Italians have raised interest rates to support the lira in the past, the UK authorities are not providing a good enough rate of return for sterling investors and should raise base rates. 'The Bank's situation is not sustainable,' said one London-based analyst yesterday. Other dealers say the Bank's position is more secure. They argue that it is increasingly risky for dealers to sell sterling at these levels because the threat of intervention hangs over the market. Another factor in sterling's favour is that it cannot technically go below its floor against the D-Mark. But the gap between sterling and its floor is small enough for ministers to feel uncomfortable this weekend. Analysts say there are no significant support levels for the pound on the downside because the currency has not been at these low levels in the ERM before. 'We are into uncharted waters,' one dealer said. Another concern is sterling's divergence from its central rate against the Ecu, which was at 71 percentage points yesterday. When the EMS was created in 1979, it was agreed that a central bank would intervene when its currency diverged by 75 percentage points.</p>

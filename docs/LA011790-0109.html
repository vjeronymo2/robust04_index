			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> COUNCIL DELAYS VOTE ON GUN DEALERS' FEE  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday postponed a final vote on a new city law that would  impose a $200 annual fee on firearms dealers who sell concealable weapons after  about 30 gun activists showed up to protest the proposed ordinance.  </P> <P> The council put off action until Feb. 6.  </P> <P> City Atty. Jack White said the proposed ordinance is mandated under a recent  legal opinion by the state attorney general that requires cities to require a  special license for gun dealers.  </P> <P> The dealers say the new license would be unfair because they already pay an  annual $21 business license fee.  </P> <P> Cathy Tolley, a firearms instructor from Anaheim, said the Police Department  already has a list of federally licensed dealers in the area. Some dealers  complained that the $200 fee is too expensive.  </P></p>

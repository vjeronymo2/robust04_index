			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 28 Mar (MENA)--A round of Egyptian-German  military talks was held today under the chairmanship of  Lieutenant General Salah Halabi, Chief of Staff of the Armed  Forces; and Klaus Naumann, Chief of Staff of the German Armed  Forces, who is currently visiting Cairo.    The session was attended by senior Armed Forces commanders  from both countries. At the beginning of the session, Lt. Gen.  Halabi made a speech stressing that it is high time, now that we  are at the doorstep of the 21st century, to work together for  the good and safety of our peoples and to deepen the concept of  an overall security for all mankind, so that the next century  may be one of security and stability for all the world.    Lt. Gen. Halabi added: We look forward to a world marked by  amity, accord, wellbeing, and common action for the coming  generations, which we do not want to suffer from the wars that  our generations have gone through. We also call for a  comprehensive disarmament and a ban on nuclear, biological, and  chemical tests so that humanity may stay free of any threat to  its security and well-being, he added.    Lt. Gen. Halabi noted that Egypt took it upon itself to  promote peace in the Arab region after it had chosen a clear  path. He noted that all parties must have equal faith in the  need to achieve a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace in our  region to achieve a bright future and security for the region's  peoples. He hoped that today's talks will lead to fruitful  results as far as joint action is concerned to preserve security  and stability in the region as well as in Europe. He added:  Egypt's participation in the European security conference in  Rome a few months ago was an indication of the role we could  play in this regard.    The talks dealt with all aspects of military cooperation  between Egypt and German and ways of developing them.</p>

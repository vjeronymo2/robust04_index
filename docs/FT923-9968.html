			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Defenders of Sarajevo launch counteroffensive Defenders of Sarajevo launched a counteroffensive yesterday in hopes of breaking the Serbian noose around their war-ravaged city. The fighting left at least eight dead and 63 wounded. Fifty orphans who were to be shuttled to safety were stranded by heavy fighting in the Bosnian capital. Five newly arrived Ukrainian peacekeepers with the UN contingent were wounded, two seriously. A senior Sarajevo defense official, described the fighting, which erupted on the city's northern edge as 'one of the worst nights since the war began.' The fighting temporarily shut down the airport, the city's only lifeline to the outside world, for the third time since UN peacekeepers secured it a month ago for aid flights.</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: Serb and Croat forces jointly attack Konjic Serb and Croat forces yesterday jointly attacked Konjic in central Bosnia, according to Bosnian radio, Laura Silber reports from Belgrade. Bosnian radio appealed to the United Nations to send food to nearly 60,000 people trapped in the town. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, appealed on radio to keep Bosnia as a 'common homeland for Moslems and Croats' and urged Croats to stay at home rather than flee to Croat-held territory. In Gorazde, the last Moslem stronghold in eastern Bosnia, a relief convoy was finally able to cross Serb lines into the UN-designated safe area. Serbs had launched a month-long offensive on Gorazde banning passage of aid despite its protected status. Ten trucks carrying 80 tonnes of aid and their armoured escort were waved through the besieging Bosnian Serb army's front lines.</p>

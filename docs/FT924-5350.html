			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Taxing the Monarchy: Queen could face king-sized life insurance policy IF the Queen does agree to pay inheritance tax, her advisers Peat Marwick could be faced with a lot of work. The planning could involve writing the biggest life insurance policy in history. No definitive figure has been reached on her wealth, but if her investments, art and jewellery collections and her private homes are included, it could be as much as Pounds 6.5bn. Since inheritance tax is 40 per cent on estates of more than Pounds 150,000, that could leave her facing a bill for around Pounds 2.5bn. The good news is that clever tax planning could reduce that bill to virtually zero. The first thing the Queen must do is write a will, since elaborate tax planning is impossible without one. The next step is to get the Treasury to give National Heritage exemption to all the art, jewellery and stately homes. According to Mr David Rothenberg, senior tax partner at accountants Blick Rothenberg, this would mean that portion of the Queen's wealth could pass to her heirs tax-free. A second bonus for the Queen is that, in the last Budget, agricultural land  -a significant element of her wealth - was granted 100 per cent relief from inheritance tax - with some exemptions. The biggest remaining element of the Queen's wealth is her investment portfolio. Here, Mr Rothenberg says she could follow a more elaborate strategy. First, she could sell all her shares and buy them back immediately - known as bed-and-breakfasting - before she becomes eligible for capital-gains tax. This would establish a new, high base level for any future capital-gains tax liabilities. Then she could give away the investments to her relatives. These gifts would be subject to capital-gains tax, but only on any gains made after the bed-and-breakfast process. Provided the Queen then lives for seven years, these gifts would be free from inheritance tax. To cover that period, however, the Queen could then take out a massive life insurance policy, says Mr Rothenberg. This would be written in trust for her heirs, and thus the proceeds of the policy would not themselves be subject to inheritance tax. If the Queen dies within the seven-year period, the proceeds of the policy could be used to meet the inheritance-tax liability. The Queen has other opportunities to save tax. Money left to a spouse is tax-free, although this would only postpone the problem until Prince Philip's death. A more populist solution would be giving the money away. Gifts of up to Pounds 3,000 each year can be made to a particular person, and be exempt from inheritance tax. On top of this, small gifts of up to Pounds 250 can be made to any number of individuals without incurring tax. On death, gifts to charities, political parties and some other non-profitmaking organisations are exempt. So this Christmas, never mind the begging letters to Santa Claus, send them to Buckingham Palace.</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: I'll be hornswoggled For reasons that do not matter, I spent part of this week fossicking through the FT's 'sportswire' basket, looking for stories about the World Cup. The sportswire basket is one of the most obscure baskets in the FT's computer system. Only the most exotic journalists are allowed near it - no doubt on the assumption that FT writers do not need to know the result of the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot, or whether the Colombian soccer team is permitted to smoke grass on World Cup rest days. I, on the other hand, am allowed to rummage anywhere, including the sportswire basket, which marshals all sports stories filed on the news-agency circuits to which the FT subscribes. Enjoyably, I found myself time-machined back into the macho milieu of news-agency sports reporting. This is a rough, tough world. You sink or you swim. You have to be good and you have to be fast. There is no room for wimps. Funnily enough, I used to be a sports-writer, and was once offered a job by Associated Press, the American news agency, in Virginia. I could not get a work permit, so I drifted back to London. But my browsing in the sportswire basket reminded me of the starkness and directness of news-agency work, and of the values of sports journalism, which is often regarded snootily by non-sports hacks. Here is the start of a news-agency sports story filed this week from Pittsburg: Colin Montgomerie has been looking forward to the US Open more than anything else this year. But when he tees off at Oakmont tomorrow the big Scot's primary aim will be to try to avoid making a complete fool of himself. And here is the start of another, filed from London: It's just what soccer purists feared. Now Americans are staging the World Cup, they plan to revolutionise the sport, painting the field red, blue and yellow, breaking the game into three thirds instead of two halves and having players wear skin-tight body-stockings instead of shirts and shorts. The new look to a sport steeped in tradition will come in a pro league starting up next year in 12 American cities. There is a great deal of technique at work here. Both stories hook your attention at once, and hold on like terriers. For example, the first story, about golfer Colin Montgomerie, used the delayed-action trick with consummate skill. It wasn't until the fourth paragraph that we realised that 'making a complete fool of himself' had a technical - golfy - meaning, and wasn't just abuse: 'By making a fool of yourself (said Montgomerie) I mean three- or four-putting from 10ft, hardly moving the ball in the rough, or thinning or shanking it.' It strikes me that non-sports journalists in Britain could learn a great deal by reading their own sports pages. There is a belief in some quarters that Britain's national press is living through a dark age, or at least a grey one, caused by the ascendancy of accountants and the drive for greater journalistic productivity. As a result, Britain's newspapers, at least at the quality end, have been bleached and leeched so violently that they have become fuzzy and unadventurous. Their aggression has been stomped out. I sometimes wonder whether this lack of aggression is the reason that John Major has survived so long in office. John Major is prime minister of Britain, though to look at Britain you would not believe that anyone was in charge. This is how one story about Major started this week: A surprise return by John MacGregor to the education department is one of the options being considered by John Major as he prepares for a substantial reconstruction of the government next month. What a cop-out. How tame. Instead, a top wire-agency writer might have written it like this: Prime minister John Major couldn't spell 'hornswoggle' if he tried. He even has trouble with 'dunce.' But to boost his government's IQ into the low 20s, he is plotting a savage ministerial shake-up. Only trouble is, it features the return of John 'Brains' MacGregor to the education job. With the World Cup starting in the US, I would urge journalists on Britain's up-market papers to study the skills and aggression that underpin the work of the sports-writers. If we were as good as they are, Britain's troubles would disperse like mist at the 14th tee.</p>

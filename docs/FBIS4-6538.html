			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Shigeru Handa; first in a series of articles </F> entitled "Building of the New SDF Following the End of the Cold  War"; this article is entitled "Secret Plan To Reduce SDF"]    [Text] How will the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] change while  the world is moving toward disarmament? At an SDF reviewing  ceremony last fall, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa declared  that "Japan will take the initiative in disarmament." Under the  leadership of the Prime Minister's Official Residence, the  government is promoting the process of reviewing the "National  Defense Program Outline." Although there are some unstable  factors in Japan's neighboring countries, including the DPRK,  which is faced with the issue of nuclear inspections, the fact  that the cold war has ended following the collapse of the Soviet  Union has significant importance. The "final battle," on which  is staked the survival of SDF organizations, has begun.    Seiki Nishihiro, adviser to the Defense Agency [DA], frankly  said: "Although it did not have enough members, the SDF was  trying to make it look as if there were enough members. The SDF  was like a paper tiger." He also said: "Because it had  responsibilities as a member of the West, Japan so far has been  trying to do things that were beyond its capabilities. Now that  the cold war is over, we should have weapons that we can afford  to have. How about reducing the number of Ground Self-Defense  Force [GSDF] divisions from 13 to about five?"    Nishihiro is an influential member of the "Panel for Defense  Issues," which is an advisory organ to Prime Minister Hosokawa.  Its task is to review the National Defense Program Outline.  Nishihiro was chief of the Defense Planning Division of the  Defense Agency's Bureau of Defense Policy 18 years ago when the  outline was prepared. After that, he acted as a leader of the  team that prepared the current midterm defense buildup plan.  Although he was deeply involved in mapping out the defense  buildup plan, Nishihiro now advocates a plan to reduce the size  of the SDF.    Looking back at when the midterm defense buildup plan was  prepared, General Yusuke Matsushima, commanding general of the  Middle Army, said: "Nishihiro has not changed. It has been his  cherished wish to reduce the size of the SDF." Matsushima, who  is called "the soldier of soldiers in terms of his ideology, and  his looks as well" and the "bravest general" in the GSDF, was  GSDF chief of staff. He had heated arguments with then Vice  Minister of Defense Nishihiro, who called for a scaling down of  the GSDF.    Gen. Matsushima said: "Only 10,000 service members are  available in case of an emergency, and none of them can be  dispatched outside of Tokyo. We could protect up to the Tsugaru  peninsula if we had 100,000 men. If we reduce the number of SDF  members, then we will be able to have a national defense  commensurate with its size. I repeatedly advised Nishihiro to  hold a Diet debate on this issue to see if the people will  accept it."    The dispute between Nishihiro and Gen. Matsushima indicates  the difference of opinions between the DA and the GSDF Staff  Office. DA officials have different opinions over the issue of  reviewing the outline of the current defense buildup plan, too.  As a group of bureaucrats, the DA is sensitive to the prime  minister's intentions. However, SDF uniformed officers, who  normally base their thinking on military rationality, are  opposed to the idea of reducing the size of the SDF, and such an  idea is preceded by a general mood favoring a reduction.    Gen. Matsushima even advocated expanding the size of the  GSDF, saying: "Properly speaking, the size of the SDF should be  determined taking into account what is the actual threat to the  nation. Even if it is determined simply by being compared to  the national population, the current size of the GSDF is still  too small."    On the other hand, Nishihiro said: "A unit becomes unable to  fulfill its duties when it loses 30 percent of its troops;  however, the active strength of the entire GSDF is currently  less than 70 percent of its permitted level. It will be  meaningless to maintain such an organization which is bound to  lose even before the actual start of a battle. It is impossible  to discuss Japan's military independence because Japan does not  have nuclear weapons. The primary concern must be to maintain  favorable Japan-U.S. relations."    The "Nishihiro theory" is often regarded as a proposal for  limiting the SDF's size to the required minimum based on the  Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, and this is attractive to many  civilian officials in the DA. Nishihiro is still regarded as a  charismatic leader of defense policy, and Prime Minister  Hosokawa relies on him greatly. When Hosokawa hit upon the  revision of the National Defense Program Outline, he brought the  plan to Nishihiro before showing it to the DA.    The final report by the "Defense Issues Council," which is  to  be submitted this summer, is expected to advocate drastic arms  reduction policies. In preparation for this, the DA and the  GSDF Staff Office secretly began to formulate a plan for  "downgrading some divisions to brigades."    The GSDF Staff Office is now trying to make sure that there  will be 15 units--13 divisions plus two combined brigades--even  if several divisions are downgraded to brigades. This is  because the GSDF Staff Office believes that if the number of  units is kept unchanged at 15, there will still be opportunities  for expansion in the future. Now that the GSDF Staff Office has  decided to resort to this "ultimate tactic," its antagonism  against the DA has disappeared.</p>

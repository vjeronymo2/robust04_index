			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Abstract owned by Saatchi reaches Dollars 1.65m: Saleroom AN ABSTRACT painting by Cy Twombly, 'Untitled', loosely inspired by Leonardo da Vinci, sold for Dollars 1.65m (Pounds 917,839) at Sotheby's auction of contemporary art in New York on Wednesday. It was sent for sale by Charles Saatchi. Although it went for below its estimate, the fact that it found a buyer  - the New York dealer Larry Gagosian  - will help to restore confidence in what has been one of the weakest sectors of the art market. The auction totalled Dollars 12.32m with 24 per cent unsold. Charles Saatchi is selling many important pictures from his collection to release money to make purchases of younger artists, and most of the works he consigned to Sotheby's found buyers. They included 'Vermeer, Portrait Of The Artist In His Studio', a pastiche of an Old Master by the British artist Malcolm Morley, which sold for Dollars 627,000, an auction record for Morley. 'Bob's World', a 'plate' painting by the controversial Julian Schnabel, sold within forecast at Dollars 319,000. However, one important Saatchi picture, 'Night Interior' by Lucian Freud, failed to get anywhere near its Dollars 500,000 estimate. Other successes in the auction were Dollars 632,000 paid for a diptych by Brice Marden entitled 'The Dylan Karina Painting' and Dollars 577,000 for Andy Warhol's 'Most wanted man: No 11'. Christie's in south Kensington held a sale of rock memorabilia. The main lot, a rare video of Jimi Hendrix in concert, was unsold at Pounds 15,000, less than half its estimate, probably because of concerns about copyright; but Hard Rock International bought one of Hendrix's black felt hats for Pounds 4,950. A stage outfit worn by Prince on his Purple Rain tour sold for Pounds 9,020 and the instruments used by the band in the film The Commitments went for Pounds 3,300.</p>

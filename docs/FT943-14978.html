			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Tomkins The market might seem churlish in continually marking down Tomkins' share price relative to those of its peers. Mr Greg Hutchins, the conglomerate's chief executive, certainly thinks so. He argues that the Pounds 1bn RHM acquisition at the end of 1992, which was responsible for the change in market sentiment, was a good deal. It has enhanced group earnings per share in the year by 4-5 per cent to the end of April. And though some of the food businesses in which RHM operates have been difficult, others have not. In the meantime, Tomkins presses ahead with introducing management controls and cutting costs. All this is fair enough as far as it goes. But until the points are made with greater conviction, doubts will remain. For example, Tomkins has done nothing to help investors understand how its figure for the contribution of RHM to earnings per share is calculated. Moreover, integrating RHM is taking longer than anticipated - four years rather than three. None of this means the RHM deal was a dud. But it is good enough reason for the market to wait for further evidence. While Mr Hutchins may continue to be disappointed, a weak share price is unlikely to constrict his freedom of manoeuvre. With a strong balance sheet, including Pounds 156m net cash, he probably does not need the market to underwrite his next big deal.</p>

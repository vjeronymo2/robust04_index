			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Former CenTrust chief indicted on fraud counts A FEDERAL grand jury has indicted Mr David Paul, the former CenTrust Savings Bank chairman, on fraud charges arising from a Dollars 25m securities deal involving an investor linked to the former Bank of Credit and Commerce International, AP reports from Miami. Mr James McAdams, acting US attorney for southern Florida, announced the federal grand jury indictment against Mr Paul, who was jailed earlier this week on contempt of court charges. The indictment also listed counts of conspiracy and other crimes. Mr Paul has been charged with conspiracy to defraud the US, making false statements, misapplying Dollars 25m in funds and allowing false entries to be made in CenTrust records. Also charged in the 22-count indictment were Mr Ghaith Pharaon, former CenTrust shareholder, and Mr William Christopher Berry, a former senior executive vice president in charge of the failed thrift's investment department, Mr McAdams said. Federal authorities have said Mr Pharaon acted as a secret front man for BCCI.</p>

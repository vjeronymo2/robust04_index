			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Futures-related buying supports Nikkei HOPES of lower interest rates and a rally in the bond market prompted a rise in the futures market, and futures-related arbitrage buying supported the Nikkei average, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average rose 173.93 to 17,185.26 after a low of 16,997.89 and a high of 17,215.65. Although light profit-taking pushed the index below 17,000 in early trading, hopes of a cut in the official discount rate prompted buying towards the end of the morning. Volume remained low at 150m shares against 136m, as most investors remained on the sidelines. Dealers, who have supported volume in recent weeks, were also absent on the last day of trading for October accounts. Advances led declines by 502 to 389 with 195 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 8.83 to 1,297.53 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.09 to 1044.67. In the absence of long-term buyers, trading by brokers dominated activity. Mr Warren Primhak, senior trader at Baring Securities, noted that companies that have made progress in restructuring operations provided a potential trading theme for traders. Pharmaceutical stocks were active ahead of a conference on viral diseases. Shionogi rose Y40 to Y840 and Daiichi Pharmaceutical gained Y20 to Y1,660. Nikken Chemicals, the most active issue, rose Y70 to Y1,160 on hopes for a cure to Alzheimer's disease. Snow Brand Milk added Y18 to Y813 and Takeda Chemical Y10 to Y1,250. Lion, the toiletries maker, gained Y10 to Y635 on optimism over its restructuring plan, which was announced earlier this month. Leading electronics makers rose on bargain hunting. Hitachi added Y15 to Y725 and Toshiba gained Y15 to Y582. Traders said no surprises were expected from their interim profits for the six months to September, which were due to be announced after the close. In Osaka, the OSE average added 18.12 to 18,743.93 in a volume of 19.4m shares. Roundup HONG KONG recorded its largest one-day gain since August, while other markets in the region were mixed. HONG KONG reversed Monday's loses on institutional buying, with the Hang Seng Index advancing 155.54, or 2.6 per cent, to 6,218.01. Turnover fell to HKDollars 3.1bn from HKDollars 4bn. Some analysts said that positive economic fundamentals outweighed the current political difficulties between Governor Chris Patten and China over the future of democracy in the colony after 1997. TAIWAN, however, fell to its lowest level since June 1989 as concern about a slowdown in economic growth deterred activity. The weighted index lost 22.93 at 3,647.97 in a turnover of TDollars 6bn. The finance sector registered the steepest falls with the three big commercial banks losing between 50 cents and TDollars 1.00. SINGAPORE rose sharply as blue chips were actively sought and volume exceeded 100m shares for the first time in five months. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 24.44 to 1,390.91 as gains led falls by 238 to 35. Among the actives, Singapore Press Foreign rose 70 cents to SDollars 13.80 and OCBC Foreign put on 60 cents to SDollars 10.60. KUALA LUMPUR closed off the day's highs on profit-taking, with the composite index finishing 3.25 higher at 633.32 in a volume of 185.6m shares. SEOUL firmed slightly on late institutional buying after further uncertainty as to whether Kim Woo-choong, chairman of Daewoo, will stand as a presidential candidate. Shares in Daewoo's eight listed companies closed limit-down, while the composite index rose 1.36 to 584.10 in a turnover of Won763.6bn. MANILA showed a slight recovery after last week's fall and Monday's closure because of flooding in the capital following a typhoon. The composite index gained 0.73 to 1,322.14 in a combined turnover of 348m pesos. AUSTRALIA extended Monday's fall with a further decline in the All Ordinaries index of 14.1 to 1,436.6. Some analysts said that the market was waiting for economic data due later this week. Turnover of ADollars 225.1m was boosted by heavy volume in Foster's rights, which finished 2 cents lower at 6.50 cents. The ordinary shares lost 6 cents to ADollars 1.16. News Corp resisted the downward trend with a 14-cent gain to ADollars 24.26. NEW ZEALAND weakened in lacklustre trading with the NZSE-40 losing 2.47 to 1,383.44 in a low turnover of NZDollars 16m.</p>

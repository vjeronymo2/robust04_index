			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: Japanese brokers move into banking JAPAN'S Big Four brokers - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities - have moved into the banking business by setting up trust banking subsidiaries. The move follows April's partial deregulation of the barriers between the banking and securities industries in Japan. It follows the the creation of securities subsidiaries by the three long-term credit banks and Norinchukin, the central agricultural institution. The move into the trust banking business will have little immediate impact on the brokers' group profits or to the operations of existing trust banks. The range of businesses of the new banking subsidiaries will be limited to investment trusts, land trusts and foreign exchange. The new trust banks, capitalised between Y20bn (Dollars 194m) and Y30bn, will not have access to the special loan trusts, or tokkin funds, the specified investment trust funds, thus the territory of the existing trust banks will be protected. The securities subsidiaries of the long-term credit banks, including Industrial Bank of Japan and Long-Term Credit Bank, started underwriting bonds in June. The brokers fear that the banks, which have links to leading stock market-listed companies, have more to gain from liberalisation. Mr David Marshall, analyst at IBCA, the banking credit agency, said the brokers' entry into the banking business would have little impact on the financial industry in the foreseeable future. The new subsidiaries, along with Bank of Tokyo's new trust banking unit, will start operations around October, after authorisation from the ministry of finance.</p>

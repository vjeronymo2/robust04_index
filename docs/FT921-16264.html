			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Boost for London shares as sterling worries recede SHARE prices in London last night closed at their highest level since mid-November, as worries about sterling receded and large investors took an optimistic view of economic prospects. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke through the 3,200 level for the first time to close at 3,201.48, a gain of 29.07. It was the sixth consecutive day the Dow had closed at a record high. The surge in London shares will have cheered ministers, who in the run-up to the election will be looking for bullish sentiments from financial markets to help convince voters that the economy is on the mend. Helped by the firm opening on Wall Street, the FT-SE 100 index of leading London shares closed up 11.3 at 2,504.1. The continuation of the rally in London stocks over the past two weeks, during which the FT-SE index has put on nearly 150 points, was aided by strong buying pressure from pension funds and other big institutions. Heartened by forecasts of a large increase in corporate profits this year as the economy gradually recovers, many large investors bought heavily in stocks such as brewing, publishing and chemicals. On currency markets, the pound suffered little selling pressure. In thin foreign exchange trading, the pound closed last night in London unchanged against a weak D-Mark at DM2.855, increasing expectations that the Treasury might be able to ride out the next few weeks without a politically damaging rise in interest rates. In New York, the pound closed at DM2.8532. There had been speculation that the government might have to follow the lead of other members of the European exchange rate mechanism and tighten borrowing rates to stop the pound falling to its effective ERM floor at about DM2.84.

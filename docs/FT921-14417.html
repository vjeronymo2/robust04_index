			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Foundations targeted in pursuit of Pounds 1.3bn The pursuit of Pounds 1.3bn missing from the late Mr Robert Maxwell's public companies has homed in on six secretive Liechtenstein foundations and two Swiss companies, writes Bronwen Maddox. The six foundations or 'stiftungs' - Corry, Allandra, Baccano, Akim, Kiara, and Jungo - have been targeted by accountants Arthur Andersen and liquidators of the collapsed Maxwell empire in their search for the missing millions. Most of the missing money appears to have flowed out from the public companies Maxwell Communication Corporation and Mirror Group Newspapers and their pension funds to the web of 400 private Maxwell companies - and then out again to Liechtenstein, Switzerland, the US and Panama. Arthur Andersen, who are administrators of the private companies under UK insolvency laws, now suspect that some of these foundations were used to conceal the origin of funds. The Swiss-based companies Yakosa Finanzierungs and Servex are thought likely to have had a central role in the alleged scheme in which Mr Maxwell illegally supported the share price of MCC, now the subject of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office.</p>

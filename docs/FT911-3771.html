			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Kohl's chickens home to roost: Chancellor's problems are of his own making, writes David Marsh JUST AS Chancellor Helmut Kohl's problems over German unity have been manifestly increasing, his capacity to do anything about them has now plummeted. Sunday's crushing defeat for his Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate leaves Mr Kohl's party in control in only one of the 10 west German states making up the old Federal Republic. The loss of the right's majority in the upper house of parliament, the Bundesrat (federal council), which has a veto over all tax legislation, significantly constrains Mr Kohl's ability to govern. Less than five months after the Chancellor gained a sweeping victory in the December 2 all-German general elections, German politics is facing a confused period of confrontation, uncertainty and drift. The centre-right coalition in Bonn, made up of the CDU, the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), still has a secure majority in the lower house, the Bundestag. But Germany's highly developed system of political checks and balances now deprives Mr Kohl of the necessary means to push through unpopular decisions. A large part of his misfortunes stems from his lack of foresight last year in failing to present voters with a more accurate picture of the economic and social challenges caused by German unification. Mr Hans-Werner Meyer, the head of Germany's Trade Union Federation (DGB), believes that, if Mr Kohl had announced the likelihood of tax rises before the December elections, he would probably have won with a still higher majority. As it is, following the large rises in taxes and social security levies decided in February, the Chancellor is now paying a triple price for his foolishness. First, as was widely predicted at the end of his year of victory in 1990, his personal credibility has taken a nosedive. Second, the round of Social Democrat election successes in recent state polls has resurrected regional coalitions between the SPD and the Greens in Lower Saxony, Hesse and now (probably) Rhineland-Palatinate. This has effectively resurrected at a regional level the Greens party which is one of Mr Kohl's pet hates, and which appeared to be close to extinction after its collapse in the national December elections. Third, Mr Kohl's misfortunes have prepared the way for a new spate of coalition bickering. The Chancellor's slightly bizarre revelation a fortnight ago that Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the wheelchair-bound interior minister, was the most likely man to succeed him has been roundly criticised by Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and CSU chairman. Mr Waigel - who shares the blame for last year's extraordinary economic policy insouciance - believes that the premature start to a leadership debate has damaged the coalition's poll standing. Mr Waigel himself has done his bit towards incurring the wrath of the free-market wing of the FDP, by announcing at the end of last week his decision to water down plans for cuts in the next few years in taxes on companies and high-earners. But these would anyway now have been blocked by the SPD majority in the Bundesrat - as well as by the need to trim the swelling budget deficit. In view of decision-making disarray, and the sharp deterioration in Germany's financial position, Mr Kohl's main hope is that an international economic recovery later this year come to Germany's rescue. Unfortunately, the foreign exchange markets - where the D-Mark fell yesterday to a 17-month low against the dollar - may upset the prospects. With the Bundesbank signalling its desire to press harder on the monetary brakes to bolster the D-Mark, Mr Kohl may face before too long, in addition to the recession in east Germany, a sharp slowdown in growth in the previously booming west.</p>

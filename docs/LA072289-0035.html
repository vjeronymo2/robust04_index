			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MOTIVATED WOODLAND HILLS WEST ROMPS  </P> <P> Ah, incentives. Let us count the ways these personal inducements affected  Woodland Hills West in its 11-3 pasting Friday of Panorama City in an American  Legion District 20 championship-bracket playoff game at Birmingham High.  </P> <P> First, we had West right-hander Lance Gibson, who was gunning for his 20th  career Legion victory. Not a bad objective to have as the playoffs roll around.  </P> <P> Second, there was shortstop Ricky Banuelos, who was ejected from a second-round  game Thursday for throwing a bat -- and not at a baseball. Not a personal  highlight.  </P> <P> Third, there was the ever-popular championship bye in today's round, which goes  to the team that starts the double-elimination tournament with a 3-0 record. In  other words, West gets to sit in lawn chairs today, sip a few cold ones and  watch three other teams fight sunburn and smog as they burn even more of their  own pitching.  </P> <P> Previous embarrassment is always good for an extra kick in the double-knits,  too. Last season, West was the top-seeded team in the playoffs but was  eliminated in four games.  </P> <P> Factor in poor offensive outings in its first two playoff games and top-seeded  West had all the edge it needed to pound three different Panorama City pitchers  for 13 hits. West (22-3) now advances to Sunday's play. It would have to lose  twice to blow a berth in the 6th Area playoffs, which begin next week at  Birmingham.  </P> <P> "Now the pressure's on the other teams to come back," said Gibson, who threw a  six-hitter, improved to 7-1 and became only the second District 20 pitcher this  decade to win 20 games. "We haven't been swept in a doubleheader all year, and  now every other team has to win three in a row."  </P> <P> Second-seeded Panorama City (19-5) will play the winner of today's 11 a.m. game  between Newhall-Saugus and Woodland Hills East today at 3 p.m. All three teams  are 2-1 in tournament play and would have to beat West twice on Sunday for the  title.  </P> <P> West pummeled Panorama City right-hander Dave Unter (5-1) for nine earned runs  in 4 2/3 innings, after he had allowed just 12 earned runs in 48 1/3 innings  all year.  </P> <P> West scored three times in the first inning, once in the second and once in the  third to take a 5-1 lead. Panorama City, however, made its one big run at  Gibson in the fifth.  </P> <P> With a runner aboard and West leading, 5-2, West center fielder Carl McFadden  fought off the sun to rob Shane Wight with a two-out, diving catch at the fence  in left-center, saving at least one run. With West's offense scoring four times  in the fifth to take a 9-2 lead, it was all over.  </P> <P> "I told (McFadden) I was glad he followed it all the way," said Gibson, who  struck out nine and walked four. "That was a spectacular play."  </P> <P> Once again, Banuelos threw the bat around, but this time, he did it in the  batter's box. Banuelos was four for five, drove in two runs and scored two  more. He was one of six West starters to drive in at least one run.  </P> <P> "I came out here to redeem myself," Banuelos said.  </P> <P> A catchy team theme, or what?  </P></p>

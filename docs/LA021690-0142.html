			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> MIXED BAG OF OFFERINGS AT UCI FACULTY CONCERT  </P> <P> Things were looking pretty grim at the Wednesday night opening of UC Irvine's  faculty dance concert when the curtain rose, midway through the program, on  Donald McKayle's "Ringalevio."  </P> <P> A wooden attempt at Fokine's "Les Sylphides," staged by Kathy Auten under  Donald Bradburn's supervision, was weighed down by mechanical phrasing and  myriad problems with myriad arms and feet. Israel Gabriel's premiere, "Mirage,"  to the music box-gone-awry score of Grant Rohr, was a laughably awful pastiche  of modern dance cliches and gimmicks, including gratuitous semi-nudity and  entrances made via a stage-floor pneumatic lift.  </P> <P> James Penrod's "Septenarius: Suite for Seven Women," to (unspecified) music by  Vivaldi, looked like a Cliff Notes version of Paul Taylor's signature style. A  constant stream of runs, turns, walks and jetes kept seven women moving from  one side of the stage to the other, but without the freshness and muscular  purpose that imbue the original.  </P> <P> And then, zap! Along came McKayle's premiere, crackling with sexual energy and  powerhouse dancing by the "Raptors" and "Marauders," particularly Achmed Valk,  Tom Smith and Kathy Auten. Named after the children's game in which members of  one group capture members of the other, "Ringalevio" features hot-to-trot  teen-agers wearing leopard print tights, vests, big hair and micro-minis.  </P> <P> Smokey music by Astor Piazzolla set up the grinding hips, the backbends, the  stretches, the conjurers' gestures and the legs that step and retreat as if on  a spring. The thrill of the piece comes from the dancers' cat-like shifts of  weight and almost palpable quality of tensile strength.  </P> <P> The program concluded with another premiere, Pat Carney's deftly workmanlike  "Blues in the Night," which segues from one famous tune to another while a cast  of characters in '20s garb regroup in continuously shifting patterns in a hotel  lobby. Standouts were statuesque Linda Cameron as The Lady from the Road and  Paul Davis as a suave Young Lover and partner.  </P> <P> Performances continue through Saturday at the Fine Arts Village Theatre .  </P> <P>  Members of UC Irvine's dance faculty perform works by Donald McKayle, Israel  Gabriel and Pat Carney; Fokine's "Les Sylphides," and James Penrod's  "Septenarius: Suite for Seven Women," in the Fine Arts Village Theatre at UCI,  Campus Drive and Bridge Street, Irvine.

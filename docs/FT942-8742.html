			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / BBC names partner for talks on US satellite deal The BBC is in talks with Cox Enterprises, the large US media group, over a joint venture to take an international BBC satellite television channel into the US market. It is not yet clear whether the channel would be BBC World Service Television News or a BBC entertainment channel of the sort to be launched in Europe in the autumn. Last week the BBC announced a 'global strategic alliance' with Pearson, the media and entertainment group that owns the Financial Times, to develop a range of satellite television channels around the world. Pearson would be a potential partner for a US venture, although so far talks have been between the BBC and Cox. The BBC has said for some time that it wants to enter the US market with World Service Television and was talking to a potential US partner. Cox, a privately owned media group, is one of the largest US communications groups with revenues of more than Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.53bn) annually and interests that range from newspapers to cable television networks. The Atlanta group is the sixth largest cable operator in the US with more than 1.8m cable subscribers in networks all over the US. A deal between the BBC and Cox would give the BBC a toe-hold in the US with immediate access to 1.8m homes. The hope would be that the BBC channel would then be carried by other cable systems. Cox, the BBC and Pearson, through Thames Television its independent production subsidiary, already work together in the UK in two satellite television channels, UK Gold and UK Living. UK Gold is based on the BBC and Thames programme libraries, UK Living is aimed mainly at women. Talks between the BBC and Cox are likely to come to a head within the next few weeks, so the BBC could enter the US market this year if agreement is reached.</p>

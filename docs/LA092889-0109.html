			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WHEN PENNANT RACE WAS REALLY PENNANT RACE  </P> <P> It's difficult determining when, exactly, a kid becomes a baseball fan. I mean,  a card-collecting, lineup-memorizing, argue on the playground, ear next to the  radio all summer baseball nut. There's a sneaking suspicion that a mad pennant  scramble or two might have something to do with it, however.  </P> <P> Approximately 70,000 games ago, the kids around my way were under the  impression that pennants were never decided before the last weekend of the  season, if then. Who could blame us?  </P> <P> The year was 1948 and the Boston Braves had clinched the National League flag  with about a week to go, so all attention turned to the American League where  the Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees and Cleveland Indians were stepping on one  another's toes entering the final weekend.  </P> <P> Boston eliminated New York with a victory in the next to last game, and visions  of a "Trolley Series" prevailed in Beantown. After all, anyone who could beat a  pitching staff of Vic Raschi, Allie Reynolds and Eddie Lopat, with Joe DiMaggio  knocking in 166 runs, could prevail over Cleveland, certainly.  </P> <P> The Tribe hung tough behind 20-game winners Gene Bearden and Bob Lemon, and Bob  Feller wasn't bad either with 19. Clear to memory is the Sox bypassing Jack  Kramer, Joe Dobson, Mel Parnell, Earl Johnson and Ellis Kinder and sending  Denny Galehouse to the mound to face Bearden because, it is reliably reported,  when Manager Joe McCarthy asked who wanted to pitch the playoff, Galehouse  (8-8) was the only one to raise his hand.  </P> <P> It probably didn't matter because by the fifth inning the Sox were hopelessly  out of it as Indians manager and league MVP Lou Boudreau already had swatted  two home runs ... just as Robin Yount did against the Baltimore Orioles a few  years back on swan-song Sunday.  </P> <P> After not missing so much as an inning or two all summer, the old Zenith was  shut down with the home team foundering somewhere in the sixth inning.  </P> <P> New England was still in deep mourning the next summer when an even better race  to the wire surfaced. The Red Sox of Ted Williams (43 homers and 160 runs  batted in), Vern Stephens (39 and 159) and Bobby Doerr (18 and 109) could no  doubt nurse a one-game lead over the Yankees through the final weekend.  </P> <P> They couldn't and, after winning twice, the hated New Yorks traipsed off to the  World Series to meet the Dodgers, who won in extra innings the last day to edge  St. Louis by one game.  </P> <P> Back then, the leagues were compact enough (two time zones) and several cities  had entrants in both loops, so radio moved to serve everyone's interest well. A  good example was the Dodgers-Philadelphia Phillies last-day showdown in 1950,  which suddenly created a Boston-to-St. Louis network.  </P> <P> The Phillies were backing up in the stretch, but Richie Ashburn saved them one  more time by throwing Cal Abrams out at the plate with two outs in the ninth to  force extra innings. Dick Sisler's three-run shot in the 10th won it.  </P> <P> Beginning to get the picture? Year after year with pencils, scorecards and  radio at the ready, fans settled in for final-day delirium. Adding to the fall  frenzy, and as if to celebrate the advent of national television, Bobby Thomson  stroked the "Shot Heard 'Round the World," as the Giants swept away a Brooklyn  lead of 13 1/2 games in mid-August and prevailed in the last inning of a  best-of-three playoff in '51.  </P> <P> Nerves had just about become unharried when, in 1956, another series of  garrison finishes ensued. The Dodgers trailed the Braves by a game with three  to play, but they won out by sweeping Pittsburgh as St. Louis was taking two of  three from Milwaukee.  </P> <P> With a week remaining in 1959, the Giants led the Dodgers and Braves by two  games before stepping aside and allowing their pursuers to move on to a playoff  won by Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The cross country rivals, Los Angeles (nee Brooklyn) and San Francisco (nee New  York) engaged in a best-of-three playoff in 1962 that had everyone waxing  poetic about the fabled showdown 11 years previous. The teams had won a game  apiece and the Dodgers led, 4-2, entering the ninth inning of Game 3. Once  again, the Giants pushed across three runs to win. Deja choke.  </P> <P> Indeed, fantastic flag finishes used to be the rule and not the exception  before expansion, division play, the DH, trampoline fields and championship  series stealing thunder from the World Series took over.  </P> <P> Being of a generation where a couple of teams ending up all but tied on the  last day of the season was fairly commonplace, one assumes a blase attitude  toward the Orioles and Blue Jays being head-and-head with a millennium-like  four days to go.  </P> <P> Sunday should prove an interesting day, particularly if it leads to another  game Monday.  </P> <P> Suddenly, the baseball season doesn't seem so long anymore, does it? Welcome  aboard, you're a fan.  </P></p>

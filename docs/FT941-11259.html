			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Moscow acts on enterprises' debts The Russian authorities yesterday proposed to tackle an estimated Rbs15,000bn in unpaid bills among enterprises by making them divert part of their revenues to paying suppliers. The so-called non-payments crisis, which threatens to drag down potentially profitable companies along with bankrupt ones, is caused by Russian managers who, on a massive scale, deliver goods without being able to secure payment for them. At the root of the crisis is the fact that bankrupt enterprises are not being pushed into closing or restructuring, while others, which have money, are not forced to pay their bills in the absence of basic commercial discipline. Mr Sergei Dubinin, acting finance minister, told parliament that in a first stage, the state would pay some of its own debts to companies on condition they spent the money on repaying their own creditors. This would include the payment in the first quarter of Rbs1,500bn owed by the government to the defence industry, and of another Rbs1,500bn to construction companies and farms. Tax revenues in the first quarter are estimated at Rbs8,000bn. In a second stage, the Finance Ministry and central bank proposed to force companies to allocate part of their revenues to paying off their debts - to the taxpayer, the workers, and the suppliers - in proportions set by the government. But this would be possible only if parliament agreed to amend legislation banning the state from interfering with enterprises' bank accounts. The state has some ability to enforce the first plan by paying some of the money directly to the creditors of the companies it plans to reimburse. But it is not clear how much room for manoeuvre it will have to enforce the second, given enterprises' accumulated experience in avoiding obligations. Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, who was welcomed like a hero by a parliament which dislikes the country's former radical rulers even more than he does, said the former government's solution - of introducing promissory notes which would allow creditors to start bankruptcy proceedings against debtors - was premature. Mr Dubinin said he was still committed to the scheme, outlined in a presidential decree produced with the help of his predecessor, Mr Boris Fyodorov, but agreed that it needed some more work before it could be implemented. Although various courts around the country have already declared dozens of companies bankrupt, an important obstacle to the scheme is the government's reluctance to take responsibility for open unemployment.</p>

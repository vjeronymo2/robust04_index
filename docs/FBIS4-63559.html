			<p>BFN     [Text] The commanders of Russia's 14th Army deployed in  Transdniestria [Dniester] have called on the Russian government  to withdraw Russian citizenship from the leaders of the  self-styled Republic of Transdniestria. They accused almost all  Tiraspol leaders holding Russian passports of abusing their  status as Russian citizens. The appeal follows compromising  evidence against Tiraspol officials that the commanders have at  their disposal.    Military commander of Tiraspol Mikhail Bergman in an  interview with INTERFAX accused regional leaders not only of  financial irregularities and corruption, but also of  uncontrolled distribution of weapons to dubious individuals and  former criminals. "I am in possession of evidence indicating  that a total of 908 units of firearms were handed over to  different people under orders from President Igor Smirnov  himself", he said. Bergman hopes that this and the local  militants' involvement in last year's parliamentary revolt in  Moscow will bring an immediate response from Moscow.    Bergman also said that the Transdniestrian officials took  advantage of their Russian citizenship to travel freely to the  West where they keep secret accounts for money laundering.  Smirnov himself has a total of 3.5 million dollars on his bank  deposit in Austria withdrawing a further 1.5 million dollars  from that account at the end of last year, according to Bergman.  He said other Tiraspol leaders were no better.</p>

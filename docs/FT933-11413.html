			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: UNP setting its sights on pole position - Canadian group has spent CDollars 9m on former Polish state companies WHEN International UNP Holdings was a junior exploration group on the Vancouver stock exchange, the abbreviation in its name stood for United Northern Petroleum. Mr George Bonar, UNP's chairman and chief executive, now mischievously tells inquirers the initials come from three Polish words meaning 'beloved new Poland'. The remark is only half in jest. UNP has emerged from obscurity on Canada's west coast to become an active western investor in Poland. It has spent CDollars 9m (USDollars 7m) over the past two years buying control of three privatised Polish companies: Ibis, the country's biggest maker of bakery equipment; BIAWAR, the leading manufacturer of hot-water heaters; and Unipak (formerly GNIEZNO), the dominant maker of packaging equipment. In each case, the remaining shares continue to be held by the state. UNP, which recently moved its head office from Toronto to London, aims to negotiate about four new investments a year as the privatisation of Polish state-owned enterprises proceeds. Mr Bonar has his eye on makers of clothing, building materials and food processing machinery, among others. He is also setting up a partnership with Murray Johnstone, the Scottish fund managers, to manage investment trusts with interests in privatised Polish companies. UNP is listed on the Toronto and Vancouver stock exchanges. It is thinly traded because 92 per cent of its stock is held by 24 blue-chip institutional investors in North America and Europe. Led by JP Morgan (which has put in CDollars 5m) and Morgan Stanley, they have contributed a total of CDollars 27m in capital. Another equity issue, which Mr Bonar hopes will bring in CDollars 5m to CDollars 10m from six more institutions, is in progress. UNP's prospects depend heavily on Mr Bonar's ability to spot sound investments among Poland's state-owned enterprises, then to negotiate their privatisation and turn them into market-driven companies. Mr Bonar, who was born in Poland and speaks the language, was formerly chief executive of Eldorado Nuclear, a Canadian uranium processing company. Before that, he was in charge of marketing at Falconbridge, the international nickel producer. Mr Bill James, his former boss at Falconbridge, remembers Mr Bonar as a 'pretty shrewd guy'. Another former colleague says the expansive Mr Bonar, now 59, left Falconbridge after disagreements over his ambitious plans for the marketing department. 'He was maybe too innovative,' the ex-colleague says. UNP has set its sights on a group of between 4,000 and 6,000 mid-sized manufacturers which have been neglected in the stampede by foreign and domestic investors for a slice of the Polish privatisation pie. Mr Bonar is adamant he will not - at least for the time being - become involved in competitive bidding for state-owned enterprises. 'If I find competition, I walk,' he says. 'I don't need to buy the company that makes cups and saucers. I can get the company that makes spoons.' This, he says, explains why UNP has so far paid a modest multiple of 1.5 times pre-tax cash-flow for its investments. Its targets are the less glamorous companies with fewer than 1,000 workers, high labour content, low brand visibility, and with little dependence on high-technology. But, like the three which UNP has bought so far, they are likely to have a dominant market share. Mr Bonar is also seeking companies run by managers who can adapt to a free-market economy. He has a chance to evaluate a company's management during the period, usually six months to a year, that it takes to negotiate a deal with the government. Only a handful of changes have been made in the three companies UNP has bought. 'If I have to chop three or four members of senior management, I've made a bad business decision,' Mr Bonar says. In spite of the good track record, there is no shortage of risk. UNP's latest prospectus lists 11 things that could go awry, from the unpredictable timing of negotiations with the Polish government, to Polish accounting standards and a volatile currency. It cautions that UNP's securities are 'speculative'. But Mr Bonar is confident that Poland is undergoing a 'fundamental systemic change' which will present enormous opportunities. He predicts the Polish elections on September 19 will improve political stability by eliminating most of the 29 parties vying for office. As evidence that UNP is in the right place at the right time, Mr Bonar notes that a leading US hot-water appliance maker has shown an interest in buying all or part of the 90 per cent stake in BIAWAR which UNP acquired only nine months ago.</p>

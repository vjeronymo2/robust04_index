			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Steyr-Daimler-Puch expects deeper losses Steyr-Daimler-Puch, the Austrian motor group, expects losses to rise sharply this year to about Sch320m (Dollars 27m). This would represent a marked deterioration compared with the 1992 deficit of Sch65m. Parent company losses are expected to be about Sch180m. The company said yesterday the sudden worsening of its position stemmed from the downturn in the automotive industry world-wide. Several group companies are running below capacity. The armoured vehicles division has stopped production because of government export restrictions on military equipment. Group turnover for the first six months of 1993 was Sch5.59bn, down Sch2.54bn on 1992. The group said small improvements may be achieved next year, but a return to profit would have to wait until 1995. The company has been restructuring with the workforce falling from about 7,700 employees to 5,500 this year. Further lay-offs are expected before the end of the year. SDP is 71.2 per cent owned by Creditanstalt Bankverein, the large Austrian bank in which the state has a 49 per cent stake but 70.5 per cent of the vote. The bank wants to sell most of its industrial holdings.</p>

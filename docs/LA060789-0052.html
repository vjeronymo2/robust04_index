			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> SOVIET RIOT TOLL PUT AT 100  </P> <P> About 100 people were killed and scores injured in ethnic rioting between the  tiny Meskhetin Turkish community and majority Uzbeks and police in Uzbekistan  last weekend, Soviet television reported. More than 6,000 riot police were  flown to the remote manufacturing region in the far eastern tip of the Soviet  Central Asian republic to help maintain order, the Ministry of Internal Affairs  said. The television news program "Vremya" said that "no one can answer the  question" of what sparked the violence. However, other sources said it started  when a Turk insulted a Uzbek produce seller in the town of Tashlak. The ethnic  clashes, which began May 23, were the worst to hit the Soviet Union since  ethnic clashes in Azerbaijan in February, 1988.  </P></p>

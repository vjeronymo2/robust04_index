			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ASTRONAUT'S SORE THROAT DELAYS ATLANTIS' BLASTOFF  </P> <P> Atlantis' commander got a sore throat today, forcing NASA to postpone for at  least 24 hours the launch of the space shuttle on a secret, all-military  mission to put a spy satellite in orbit.  </P> <P> "We've never had a postponement due to the illness of an astronaut. This is the  first time in the space program," NASA spokesman Kyle Herring said.  </P> <P> A space agency statement said a bad weather forecast was also a factor in the  postponement, but officials said that if not for the illness, they would have  continued the countdown, hoping for clear skies by launch time early Thursday.  </P> <P> NASA said Navy Capt. John O. Creighton "developed an upper respiratory tract  infection during the last 24 hours."  </P> <P> "The commander's health and weather will be evaluated on Thursday to determine  if the launch will be attempted on Friday morning," the statement said.  </P> <P> In 1970, astronaut Thomas K. Mattingly was taken off the Apollo 13 crew a few  days before the flight was to lift off for the moon. But backup astronaut Jack  Swigert replaced him without delaying the flight.  </P> <P> The announcement came shortly before technicians were to begin pumping more  than half a million gallons of propellant into Atlantis' fuel tank for the  four-day mission, which was to end at Edwards Air Force Base.  </P> <P> A bleak weather forecast early today had gradually improved to a 50-50 chance  for a launch Thursday. But the outlook for Friday and Saturday is even worse,  with one cold front moving out and another moving in.  </P> <P> Because the Pentagon mission is classified, the space agency would not provide  the exact launch time, saying only that it would occur between midnight and 4  a.m. Thursday. However, sources said Atlantis was to lift off at 1 a.m.  </P> <P> Atlantis' orbit reportedly will cover a greater area of the globe than any  previous shuttle.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> "Someone called it the Law Wash," admitted Thomas White, a 44-year-old attorney  who recently opened an office inside the Valencia Car Wash.  </P> <P> One advantage of the arrangement, White pointed out, is that "I have a low  overhead" -- and he wasn't referring to the sprinklers.  </P> <P> His office is adjacent to the car wash operation, and is open to foot traffic  only.  </P> <P> But White said that he has taken on clients "who happened to notice my sign  while their cars were being washed."  </P> <P> And, he noted, "They can still watch the progress of their car from my office."  </P> <P> The idea for the novel setting came to him when he operated a limousine service  and a friend remarked that "I spend so much time at the car wash, I ought to  move into an office there." When he saw the space-for-lease sign at the place,  it was too good to pass up.  </P> <P> White, who has two other offices in the Santa Clarita Valley, said he has heard  the inevitable puns, too:  </P> <P> "Yes, people who've had a brush with the law come here. And my fellow lawyers  ask if they can get some of the overflow."  </P> <P> The case of the Canoga Park transsexual with the three-wheeled automobile  scheme may be coming to a close.  </P> <P> Perhaps a word or two of explanation is in order.  </P> <P> Geraldine Elizabeth Carmichael, known before her sex-change operation as Jerry  Dean Carmichael, founded an Encino car company more than a decade ago.  </P> <P> She was later convicted in Los Angeles Superior Court of various fraud charges  in connection with the promotion of a three-wheeled roadster called the Dale,  which was never produced. She disappeared in 1980 after being sentenced to 2 to  20 years in prison and fined $30,000.  </P> <P> But after she was profiled on a recent episode of the television series,  "Unsolved Mysteries," tipsters alerted authorities to her whereabouts, who  arrested her in Texas.  </P> <P> "She had been selling flowers on the streets and had crews of children doing  the same thing," said Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Youngdahl.  </P> <P> The ex-promoter of the Dale was arrested in a suburb of Austin -- Dale, Tex.  </P> <P> You may recall that a Long Beach store unveiled the world's largest bed last  week. Just the thing to snooze on after partaking of the world's largest  tostada, which was assembled Thursday at Universal Studios.  </P> <P> The dish, featuring 162 pounds of beans, 600 heads of lettuce, 40 pounds of  Mexican sausage and 40 pounds of grated cheese, was later donated to the Love  Is Feeding Everyone food distribution organization.  </P> <P> Earlier, promoters had said that the tostada's contents would be blended in a  cement mixer. A driver did show up in such a rig, but he seemed unaware of why  he was summoned.  </P> <P> When asked by a reporter if the mixer was clean, he laughed and said: "Yeah,  for making cement."  </P> <P> The tostada was put together by hand, not mixer.  </P> <P> If it were a movie, students asked to redesign their campus might start with a  recommendation to replace the science building with a pizza parlor.  </P> <P> But not in real life at Dana Junior High in San Pedro. Advanced drafting  students there are so serious about sprucing up their school that they've been  chosen to participate in a program in which they will work with the Los Angeles  chapter of the American Institute of Architects.  </P> <P> Teacher Frank Sele said his students are starting out with low-cost,  "realizable" recommendations, such as improving the landscaping and adding  murals. Naturally, a joke or two have been heard. "Someone cracked that the  first thing we should do is level the school," said Sele.  </P> <P> For a moment it sounded like KMPC traffic reporter John McElhinney was  reporting a sighting of quacking animals loose on the San Bernardino Freeway.  </P> <P> Then he added, "Those are air conditioning ducts."  </P></p>

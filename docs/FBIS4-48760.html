			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By David Isaacson] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg May 23 SAPA -- All parties in the PWV  [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] provincial legislature  responded positively to Premier Tokyo Sexwale's opening address  on Monday, but a few members suggested his housing target was  not realisable. Mr Sexwale last week said 150,000 low-cost  houses would be built in the next 12 months.    National Party caucus leader and MEC [member Executice  Committee] for public transport Olaus van Zyl said the plan  meant building 600 houses every working day.    His Democratic Party counterpart Ian Davidson translated it  to building 51 houses an hour.    But Mr van Zyl said: "Let's get it started and see what can  be done."    Mr Jan Landman of the Freedom Front said those occupying the  houses should be allowed to own them. Not allowing this in the  past had been a mistake by the NP [National Party]. He warned  against a social welfare system whereby the state was milked of  resources.    Ms Gertrude Mzizi of the Inkatha Freedom Party congratulated  Mr Sexwale for allowing hostel dwellers to choose between living  in single-sex dormitories or family units.    The Pan Africanist Congress' sole representative, Mr Benny  Alexander, said Mr Sexwale's housing goal was achievable and  suggested the masses be trained to build the houses.    Mr Davidson referred to reports that at most 70,000 low-cost  houses could be built in 1995.    "Contrary to (Mr Sexwale's) undertaking...informed comment  seems to indicate that we have neither the financial nor  institutional capacity to deliver...    "Let me not be misunderstood. Let us recommit ourselves to  our challenges but let us also be conscious of the reality of  institutional capacity and the reality imposed by our commitment  also to maintain macro-economic balance."    Mr Davidson further warned the PWV needed to compete with  what he called two other major economic areas, the Western Cape  and KwaZulu/Natal. Each province was controlled by a different  political party with its own economic philosophy and each would  compete for local and foreign investment.    "We therefore have to allow our province to compete  unshackled by political or ideological dogma."    Mr Davidson said enterprise could not flourish under special  taxes or reconstruction levies. "A compromise must be reached  between the necessary ambitious plan of the reconstruction and  development programme and the private sector's vital role in  this regard on the one hand, and the necessary commitment to  economic balance which will be a prerequisite to private-sector  involvement on the other."    Mr Thamsanqa Bam of the African Christian Democratic Party  welcomed the housing plan.    Mr Sexwale will respond at the end of the debate on Tuesday.</p>

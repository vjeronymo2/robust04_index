			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 6 (CNA) -- A Taiwan tourist was among  the 159 passengers and crew killed after the Mainland Chinese  Tupolev-154 they were aboard crashed eight minutes after taking  off from Xian on a domestic flight to the southeastern Province  of Guangdong on Monday [6 Jun].    The Taipei Association of Travel Agents, after contacting  mainland tourist authorities, identified the Taiwan tourist as  Chuang Yao-tsung, 38. No further information about Chuang was  available.    According to foreign wire service reports, government  workers  in Changan County, where the plane went down, reported that the  China Northwest Airlines plane was racked by an explosion before  it crashed.    The international airline passenger association earlier this  year rated Mainland China as one of the most dangerous places to  fly in the wake of the five crashes [words indistinct] last year  that killed 76 people.</p>

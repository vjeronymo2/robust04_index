			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- Japanese commercial banks  hired more employees in the three-year period ended March 31,  1993, despite the collapse of the speculative "bubble economy,"  according to a private survey published Tuesday [17 May].    Teikoku Databank, which published the survey, said the  number  of workers employed by banks as of that date totaled 427,197, up  3.7 percent from three years earlier during the bubble economy's  peak, which was characterized by surges in stock and land prices.    The employment rise came amid widespread moves among  industries to cut jobs as part of restructuring programs.    Teikoku Databank, a credit research agency, attributed the  phenomenon to high net operating profits from core banking  business following a series of cuts in the official discount  rate by the bank of Japan during recent years.    The survey covered 112 leading commercial banks, long-term  credit banks, trust banks and regional banks, all listed on  stock exchanges.    The poll also showed the number of employees at securities  companies decreased 2.2 percent in the period under review.</p>

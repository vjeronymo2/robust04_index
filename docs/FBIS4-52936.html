			<p>BFN     [Text] The Thai Navy detained a Vietnamese boat named  "TD-008" with 14 crewmen and a number of weapons in Thai  territorial waters on 7 February while the boat was chasing Thai  fishing trawlers. It was charged with an act of terrorism and a  violation of international and Thai laws. Later on, Prime  Minister Chuan Likphai and his delegation visited the SRV  between 16-19 March at the invitation of the Vietnamese prime  minister. During their meeting on 17 March, the foreign  ministers of the two countries discussed the issue of the  release of the fishermen, proposing an exchange for Thai  fishermen held in Vietnam. Vietnam offered to release Thai  fishermen held in Vietnam as soon as possible and to consider  releasing 16 Thai prisoners held for trying to escape prisons  and for killing people in Can Tho Province, provided that the  relatives of those prisoners agreed to pay a fine of U.S.  $20,000 as judged by the court. At the same time, Vietnam  asked Thailand to release the 14 Vietnamese crewmen held by the  Thai Navy. Subsequently, the Thai prime minister agreed to  release the 14 Vietnamese to promote good relations with Vietnam  and to create a good atmopshere for future talks with Vietnam on  other issues.</p>

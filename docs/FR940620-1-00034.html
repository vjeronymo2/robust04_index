			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed addition of a new &sect;67.37 would set out the citizenship requirements for associations and joint ventures as vessel-owning entities for documentation purposes. The citizenship requirements for associations and joint ventures are currently stated in &sect;67.35 with those for partnerships. However, there is no logical reason to continue this grouping. Separating the requirements for associations and joint ventures, which are identical, from those for partnerships would present the information in a more logical and orderly fashion. None of the current citizenship requirements for associations or joint ventures would be changed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed revision to paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of &sect;67.39 would clarify the current regulations by rearranging the citizenship requirements for corporations in a more logical order. None of the current citizenship requirements for corporations would be changed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed revision to paragraph (e) of &sect;67.119 would clarify the current regulations. Paragraph (e) of &sect;67.119 was intended to serve as a savings or ``grandfather'' provision with regard to hailing port requirements for vessels issued a Certificate of Documentation prior to July 1, 1982. The language of the final rule implies that the provisions of the entire section do not apply to the identified vessels, rather than only the provisions of paragraph (c). This revision will remove the confusion that currently exists because of the omission from the final rule. The proposed revision would clearly state that only the requirements of paragraph (c) of &sect;67.119, specifically that a hailing port include a State, territory, or possession designation, do not apply to vessels issued a Certificate of Documentation before July 1, 1982, until: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. a port of record assignment is required under the regulations, or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. the owner elects to designate a new hailing port. Therefore, vessels to which &sect;67.119(c) do not apply can display a hailing port consisting of the name of a city only until either of the conditions described are met. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment to &sect;67.145 would correct the cross-reference to appropriate paragraphs in &sect;67.167 where mortgagee consent is required to exchange a Certificate of Documentation. The current regulation cites, in part, to paragraph (a) of &sect;67.167, which is incorrect since that paragraph contains only procedural information and refers to the remaining paragraphs of that section. This cross-reference error has led to confusion, causing some documentation officers to conclude that mortgagee consent is required for any cause of exchange listed in &sect;67.167. The reasons requiring mortgagee consent contained in the paragraphs referenced in the amended language are those for which consent has been traditionally required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed revision to paragraph (d) of &sect;67.171 would clarify that the request for a certificate evidencing deletion from documentation must be made to the vessel's port of record. Since the port of record is the custodian of the vessel's file, only that port should issue a deletion certificate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed revision to &sect;67.321 would clarify that when the address of the managing owner of a vessel changes, the managing owner must report that change to the documentation officer at the vessel's port of record within 10 days of its occurrence. This revision would conform &sect;67.321 to a similar requirement in &sect;67.113. Unreported changes of address have proved to be a particularly bothersome problem. If changes of address for the managing owner are not reported, the Coast Guard may send the renewal notice to the wrong address which can lead to late renewal or a failure to renew with civil penalty action. The proposed revision would clarify the responsibility of the managing owner to provide proper notice of changes of address. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed revision to &sect;67.539, adding the words ``or document'', would clarify that the fee is charged for a copy of any instrument or document for which a specific fee is not listed. Also, the revision would clarify that the cross-reference to 49 CFR 7.95 is solely for the purpose of calculating the fee in the same manner as described in that section. It does not mean that a request for a copy of any instrument or document not specifically identified in Subpart Y of Part 67 is to be processed as a request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. Therefore, once the fee for the copy has been calculated in the manner described in 49 CFR 7.95, it is incorrect to refer to any other section in 49 CFR Part 7 for any purpose with regard to the fee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. As discussed earlier in this preamble, this proposal, if adopted, would clarify the citizenship requirements of a trust as a vessel-owning entity, correct certain errors and omissions made in the final rule for 46 CFR part 67, clarify a cross-reference with regard to calculation of fees for copies of instruments and documents, and address the statutorily required endorsements for vessels employed in towing and dredging. These matters are administrative in nature and do not have any economic impacts on the regulated public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

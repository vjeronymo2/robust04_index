			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 29 (XINHUA) -- China is making  efforts to reform the enrollment of colleges and universities  and employment methods of college graduates, according to the  State Education Commission.    The reform, now on a trial basis, is aimed at changing the  traditional obligation of the state to pay fees for university  students and assign them to jobs when they graduate.    According to the new methods, colleges and universities will  work out rational fee collection methods under which new  students will have to pay a certain amount of fees calculated  according to varying costs for different majors and relative  family income.    On the other hand, such higher learning institutions will  offer scholarships and student loans to encourage industrious  study habits and preparation to compete on the labor market.    The institutions in turn will announce enrollment plans in  advance, with reference to different majors in different  provinces and regions, and make clear their fee standards in  order for students to choose appropriate college locales and  majors.    In this way, a college or university only has to set a  unified standard for enrolling students to form a fair  competition mechanism for all.    Traditionally, in addition to enrolling students who do not  have to pay fees under the state's overall plan, universities  have been allowed to admit students with sub-par entrance exam  marks as long as they pay their own expenses.    The state will set up specific scholarships to meet demands  in majors relating to key state construction projects, national  defense, cultural and educational undertakings, basic sciences  and eventual assignment to work in remote places.    Industrial enterprises and social institutions will also be  allowed to establish scholarships. Students can apply for such  specific scholarships but will have to be employed according to  corresponding contracts signed beforehand.    In time, all students who do not apply for scholarships will  have to rely on their own effort to find jobs when they graduate.    This year, 37 Chinese colleges and universities will begin  to  carry out such reforms.</p>

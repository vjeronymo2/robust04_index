			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Germany bids for DM3bn China deals GERMAN industrialists are hoping to sign contracts worth up to DM3bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in China next week, when Chancellor Helmut Kohl leads a top-level delegation for talks in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Among the deals expected to be finalised are the purchase of six Airbus A340 aircraft, worth some DM500m, and the DM700m contract for an 18km stretch of underground railway in Canton, to be built by a consortium headed by Siemens and AEG. Around half the cost of the underground railway is intended to be financed with soft loans from the German development ministry, on the grounds that it is not a commercial project. A further contract, also part financed with development loans, is for DM165m worth of railway wagons for the Chinese railway system, to be provided by Deutsche Waggonbau, one of the biggest east German enterprises still to be successfully privatised. Some 40 chief executives of German companies are expected to travel with the Chancellor on his week-long trip, including Mr Edzard Reuter, the head of Daimler-Benz, Mr Heinrich von Pierer of Siemens, and Mr Ferdinand Piech of Volkswagen. Daimler-Benz' troubled Deutsche Aerospace subsidiary has been negotiating on possible collaboration deals in satellite technology, solar collectors, and other electronic components. Siemens, apart from its involvement in the underground project at Guangzhou, is also hoping for major telecommunications contracts in transmission systems, and digital mobile telephones. Siemens Transportation Systems will also be making a proposal to the Chinese government to supply its ICE high-speed train system. The German delegation is also hoping to sign new contracts for container ships which might be built at east German shipyards, on top of an existing contract for eight ships already signed. Mr Kohl is to visit the VW plant in Shanghai, where the annual capacity of 100,000 Santana cars is to be increased to 150,000. More than 100 potential new projects are under negotiation, according to the German economics ministry, including power stations and engineering plants. German exports to China soared by more than 85 per cent in the first half of 1993, to reach almost DM5.6bn, while Chinese exports to Germany increased by a more modest 12 per cent to DM7.57bn, according to German figures. The Chancellor's visit is seen as a big effort by the German government to support German industry in a new drive for Asian markets, which officials admit have been neglected in the past. On departure from China, he will visit Hong Kong for talks with Mr Chris Patten, the British governor, underlining Germany's commitment to a 'harmonious solution' between Beijing and London on the future of the colony, according to officials in Bonn.</p>

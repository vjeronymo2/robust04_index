			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / More than one way to skin a public-sector cat The cabinet's refusal to back Mr Michael Heseltine's plan to sell parts of the Post Office has prompted a widespread view at Westminster that 15 years of Conservative commitment to privatisation are over. Not everyone agrees. Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, was among the powerful figures arguing yesterday against the view that the government no longer has the stomach to force contentious privatisations through an unwilling parliament. But others pointed out that the question might not matter. For one thing there is little left to privatise, for another, the government has developed equally powerful and less controversial ways of changing the delivery of services. Mr Daniel Finkelstein, director of the Social Market Foundation think-tank, said: 'The heroic phase of privatisations is over, but a gradualist phase which could ultimately be more radical and have more profound implications has begun. In terms of privatisation policy, power is passing from the Leninists to the Fabians.' Most of the big privatisations have already happened. In 21 large sales, starting with the first tranche of BP shares in 1979, the government has disposed of most of the big public-sector companies and utilities inherited from Labour. According to the Treasury more than 50 enterprises remain in public ownership. But most are either arms of bureaucracy, such as the Central Office of Information, or scheduled for privatisation, such as British Coal and the railway companies. Few straightforward businesses remain. The BBC, Channel Four, and a number of local authority airports and transport companies could eventually be candidates for privatisation. But ministers have for several years been moving towards a successor policy to old-style privatisation, based on introducing competition to services which continue to be provided by the public sector. There are three main elements: Agencies. At the last count 99 agencies covering 350,000 civil servants had been set up under the Next Steps programme, launched by Baroness Thatcher in 1988. They range from the social security benefits agency, with 65,000 staff, to the Wilton Park conference centre in Sussex, which employs 30. The agencies cover activities as diverse as weather forecasting, issuing passports, and support services for the armed forces. Ministers have identified a further 67 candidates for agency status, covering another 96,000 civil servants. Contracting out. Under the market testing programme a range of government activities are put out to competitive tender. Public-sector units are allowed to compete, but often lose to more street-wise private companies. The government's latest market testing bulletin, aimed at potential private-sector bidders, lists 59 contracts awarded by tender, ranging from payroll services for the Overseas Development Administration to computer maintenance for the recruitment and assesment services unit. A further 72 contracts are being advertised, and ministers have set out a future programme covering activities as diverse as the agriculture ministry's reprographic services and the Queen's Flight. Private finance initiative. Launched by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, the initiative has attracted only Pounds 500m of private capital into public projects since 1992, mainly because of uncertainty about rates of return. But there is mounting feeling in Whitehall that the scheme is gathering momentum. A Pounds 150m computer system to hold records on National Insurance contributors will be the first project of its kind to be funded through the initiative.</p>

			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family: A guide to good companies - Diary of a Private Investor / Kevin Goldstein-Jackson outlines his system for deciding whether to buy shares AS A PRIVATE investor, I have already made use of the FT's new company reports service and found it fast and efficient. For just the cost of an ordinary phone call, I can receive a copy of a number of company reports. Further details are given on the FT share price pages, where companies for which reports are available are marked with an ace of clubs. Unfortunately, only 130 companies have so far availed themselves of this service, but I hope this number will increase in the near future. I would particularly like to see more small to medium companies on the list; the more interest taken in them, the more marketable their shares might be. In these difficult and uncertain economic times, however, I remain very wary about further stock market investment. It has to be a pretty good company to attract my money. I am, therefore, using a marking system when looking at company reports in order to decide if further investigation - and possibly investment - might be warranted. Under my system, each company starts with 100 points. I then flip through the pages of the report. If I see more than one photograph of the chairman, I deduct five points. If the company has just moved to an expensive and luxurious new head office building, 15 points are deducted. I then look at the chairman's statement. Has he given a profits warning  - perhaps shrouded in words like 'trading is proving difficult' or 'we are well poised to take advantage of conditions when the current recession ends?' If so, I deduct 20 points. (The reason I deduct only 20 is that, theoretically, by the time the report has been published, the market ought to have adjusted to take account of the chairman's views and analysts' comments. Also, a number of chairmen are unaware of the true state of their company - or wish to conceal it - and so do not reveal as much as they might. So, as an indication of prospects, the chairman's statement has to be viewed with some caution). I then look at the list of substantial shareholders (those owning more than 3 per cent of the company's ordinary share capital). If the list contains no signs of any respected City institutions or major personal shareholdings, I deduct 10 points. Do all the executive directors own shares? Five points are deducted for each one who does not. Is the company in a niche market with very little competition or the owner of undervalued brand names? If not, I deduct 10 points. Is the company proposing a change in the date of its year-end? If so, 15 points are deducted. It is the accounts of the company and, more importantly, the note to the accounts, that can cause most points to be lost: 75 are deducted if gearing is more than 100 per cent. If the company capitalises interest, 15 points are deducted. If the short-term borrowings are greater than the long-term, the penalty is 25 points. A further 15 are lost if the company has a large amount of borrowings in certain foreign currencies where changes in the exchange rate could prove costly. Have there been any changes in the method of valuation of stocks? If so, and the effect of this is to increase stock values significantly, then 20 points are deducted. Even without a change in valuation policy, there will be a further penalty of 20 points if stock levels/values have increased considerably over the previous year. I would be concerned the company might not be able to find buyers for all its products stockpiled at profitable prices. Has the company sold assets to companies in which it also has a large shareholding, and attributed large profits to such asset sales? If so, I deduct 60 points. Has the company engaged in a number of deals where deferred consideration is payable? If so, 15 points are lost. If the company has changed its depreciation policy by considerably extending the depreciation period of plant and equipment, then 15 points are deducted. Is the pension scheme fully-funded? If not, I deduct between five and 15 points depending on the amount of under-funding. If the scheme is over-funded and the company is having a pensions 'holiday,' five points are lost. Does the company have any contingent liabilities? If so, then five to 30 points will be deducted depending on their size and nature. Does the company have a good cash flow? If not, 25 points are removed. And a further 15 points are lost if the company does not have a healthy amount of cash on deposit with reputable banks. Do the accounts contain a statement along the lines of: 'The open market value of the company's freehold properties is substantially in excess of the book value?' If not, I take away 10 points. Have the auditors qualified the accounts of the company? Depending on the nature and number of such qualifications, 20 to 80 points will be deducted. If staff costs have increased considerably over the previous year, then 10 points are deducted; and if the directors have had considerable salary increases while the profits of the company have fallen, then a further 10 points go. If the net asset value of the company is not more than its current market capitalisation, I deduct 10 points. Of course, I also look at the profits of the company. But, again, by the time the report is published the market ought to have adjusted the company's share price to take account of reduced or increased profits. On some occasions I may, therefore, not deduct any points for reduced profits. Any company that has lost all its 100 initial points (or more) will not, in present circumstances, be considered by me for investment. Every company will have lost some points by my system, and a company with fewer than 35 remaining will be viewed with considerable caution. Naturally, those with more than 35 would be investigated further before I invested. For the record, Pentland Group and British and American Film Holdings would have passed my test; companies such as Gresham House, Maxwell Communications, Leading Leisure and the Lep group would have failed it. I stress that this scoring system is based only on my personal judgments and might well not suit others. But at least it ensures I go into future stock market investment with my eyes open wider than before. The Annual Reports Service is available by calling 081-643-7181. Readers need to quote a code, which is shown on the share listings page at the back of the FT's front section.</p>

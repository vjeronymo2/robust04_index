			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Volatile conditions keep activity to a minimum Eurobond issuance dried to a trickle yesterday, with Japanese markets slowed by Golden Week holiday, and tomorrow's UK local elections and Friday's US jobs data looming. Volatile conditions in some of the underlying government bond markets are keeping activity to a minimum. 'A lack of investor interest doesn't usually stop underwriters from issuing bonds, but given the current volatility, they're less inclined to hold unplaced paper on their books,' said one syndicate official. The Canadian Wheat Board braved the Canadian dollar sector ahead of Ontario's budget announcement tomorrow. The triple-A rated government agency issued CDollars 125m of 7 1/2 per cent three-year bonds priced to yield five basis points over the interpolated government bond yield curve. That spread widened to around 7 1/2 basis points by the close, said lead manager Hambros Bank. Targeted mainly at retail investors, the issue was said to be slow to place. However, one dealer said the spread was likely to tighten, as it did with the recent three-year issue for Canada's Export Development Corporation, which now yields substantially less than government bonds after being issued flat to them. The day's other deal was a self-led L200bn issue of 9 3/4 per cent 10-year bonds with a four-year call option for Credito Italiano. At less full fees, the paper yields 10.03 per cent to maturity (80 basis points over the corresponding government bond) and 10.29 per cent to its four-year call date (130 basis points over). According to Mr Niccolo Nuti, head of capital markets at Credito Italiano, the issue saw strong demand from Italian investors attracted by the high coupon and the familiar name. Although South Africa stands a good chance of achieving a successful economic performance, its debt is unlikely to achieve an investment grade credit rating in the foreseeable future, the European rating agency IBCA said. Examining prospects following last week's first multi-racial elections, IBCA warned that overseas capital flows to South Africa are still smaller than capital flight by current residents; that investment has been low and needs to rise sharply; and that the balance of payments has been a traditional weakness of the economy. Consequently, the scope for a rise in living conditions is limited and there is little scope for income redistribution if the skills of the middle class white population are to be retained, IBCA said.</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Control Techniques rises 50% to Pounds 6.22m CONTROL TECHNIQUES, the Powys-based electronic drives group, reported a 50 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits yesterday, and announced plans for a significant expansion of its overseas marketing and sales operations. Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 4.15m to Pounds 6.22m in the year to September 30 after rationalisation and closure costs of Pounds 1.02m, mainly related to the sale of its process control division. Turnover grew by 26 per cent to Pounds 88m largely reflecting the acquisition of ICD Drives in the US last year. Excluding ICD, turnover grew by 3 per cent. Mr Trevor Wheatley, chairman, said the integration of ICD had proved costly but was now nearing completion. Earnings per share increased to 9.7p (7.7p) and a proposed final dividend of 4.7p makes a 6.85p (6.5p) total. Mr Wheatley said the strategy of growth by acquisition in order to reach the 'critical mass' in the core manufacturing business had been achieved, together with a streamlined and automated manufacturing capability. As a result, the group planned to focus on organic growth by opening a further 30 sales and marketing CT Drive Centres overseas in the next couple of years. Currently it has 15 overseas offices with another six under negotiation. The chairman added that research and development expenditure, totalling Pounds 3m in 1992, would be increased by 20 per cent in the current year.</p>

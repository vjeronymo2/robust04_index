			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Albanian President Sali Berisha by Samih </F> 'Abdallah in Tirana; date not given]    [Text] ['Abdallah] Mr. President, it was noticed that you  reacted with anger following the recent border incident with  Greece. However, things calmed down and the crisis seems to be  heading toward a solution. What exactly happened on the borders  with Greece and why did your reactions vary with the passage of  time?    [Berisha] I do not think that we acted angrily. If you read  our first message to the Greek Government in the wake of the  massacre you would see that we expressed the conviction that the  terrorists came from Greek territory and returned to it after  executing the operation. In the same message we asked the Greek  Government to identify the culprits and condemn the attack.  Therefore, I don't think that this was evidence of anger.    But the Greek reaction was weird. They failed to express  regret or convey condolences to the families of the victims.  This made us believe they were gloating over the crime. It  was, therefore, natural for us to believe that the Greek  Government supports such deeds. We had information last year  that a number of elements were trained in Greece and then Prime  Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis was informed of the matter.    ['Abdallah] But did the Greek Government supervise the  training?    [Berisha] Yes, the government did supervise the training at  that time. But later we received information that the  government had ended the training. At any rate, the culprits  came from Greek territory. The Greek Government did not respond  to our demands at the beginning, but later it responded.    Consequently, we decided to postpone any downsizing of the  staffs at the embassies until the problem is discussed by the  two countries' foreign ministers during their upcoming meeting.  This is what happened, but the Greeks might have a different  viewpoint of the incident.    ['Abdallah] Are you sure that the culprits came from Greece?    [Berisha] Certainly. We identified their tracks, which  showed that the culprits came from Greece and later returned  there.    ['Abdallah] But why are the Greeks trying to foment trouble  on their border with Albania?    [Berisha] Since the beginning of the century and for the  past  50 years, the Greeks have been pursuing a policy based on using  terrorism and terrorists against southern Albania. But I don't  believe that the Greek Government was behind this specific  incident; otherwise we would have asked them to punish the  culprits. However, we do not believe that the incident was an  isolated one, because the Greek Army has in the past provoked us  by firing at our boats sailing in our territorial waters.    ['Abdallah] When did this happen?    [Berisha] Two months ago. But they denied it. I don't think  this is the right way to create a good atmosphere to promote  bilateral relations.    ['Abdallah] But why are they doing this? What is their  objective?    [Berisha] The Greeks are afflicted with nationalistic  fervor.  They have ties with the Serbs, and through this alliance they  think that they can make gains toward reconstructing the Balkan  area.    ['Abdallah] Do they have any regional claims in Albania?    [Berisha] Greece has not yet signed the Florence protocol,  which is quite important in the border issue.    ['Abdallah] Does this mean that they do not recognize the  present borders with Albania?    [Berisha] They recognize the borders, but they have not  signed yet.    ['Abdallah] What about the internal secessionist movements  in  southern Albania?    [Berisha] There are no such movements. But there are signs.    ['Abdallah] Do you recognize the Greek minority in southern  Albania?    [Berisha] There is a Greek minority in the south. I am  pleased to say that Albania guarantees all rights, including  human rights, to this minority.    ['Abdallah] Are they entitled to learn the Greek language  and  do they have their own press?    [Berisha] They have three newspapers and well over 88  schools, which cover all stages of elementary and higher  education. They have their own parties and establishments.  They have ministers and judges. They will continue to enjoy  these rights; these events will not affect our policies toward  the minorities. They are Albanian citizens and we respect their  rights.    ['Abdallah] Mr. President, do you have a specific stand on  the conflict between Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] and Greece?    [Berisha] Yes. We have no particular stand regarding the  name, but Macedonia has to accept a compromise regarding the  issue of their flag and some other matters. In my opinion,  Greece is taking a mistaken approach regarding the name and the  economic boycott. However, a dialogue is necessary between the  two countries.    ['Abdallah] Do you have any problems with Macedonia  regarding the Albanian minority residing there?    [Berisha] Yes. There is a human rights problem that must be  resolved. There is some progress, however, and we expect  further progress in the future.    ['Abdallah] What are your specific demands?    [Berisha] There should be a census to determine the number  of Albanians; schools should be opened at all levels. Albanians  should have the right to use their language and they should be  allowed to enter all the Macedonian state's institutions.    ['Abdallah] Is this the same requirement as for Kosovo  province?    [Berisha] The situation is different in Kosovo. The  Albanians there constitute 95 percent of the population. One  has to establish whole institutions for them; and agreement  should be reached through dialogue and through agreements  between the various parties on the special status of the region.    ['Abdallah] Do you believe that the situation in the region  is quiet now?    [Berisha] No, there is great oppression.    ['Abdallah] What is your opinion on current events in  Bosnia?    [Berisha] The situation there is very difficult and the  peace process seriously fails to meet the requirements.    ['Abdallah] What mistakes are the international community  making in its efforts to resolve the conflict?    [Berisha] The international community must treat the Serbs  and Milosevic more forcefully. The aggressors must be punished.    ['Abdallah] How can they be punished? Militarily?    [Berisha] That is a naive question. Of course, militarily.    ['Abdallah] Aren't the air strikes NATO is carrying out  against the Serbian positions enough?    [Berisha] These air strikes are merely symbolic. They  should take place on a much larger scale.    ['Abdallah] What would be the objective of such large-scale  strikes?    [Berisha] The objective is to prove that Bosnia must  continue to exist as a state, either within a federal or a  confederal framework. Bosnia must remain united.    ['Abdallah] Do you not see the agreement between the Muslims  and the Croats that was signed recently in Washington as an  introduction of partitioning?    [Berisha] No, I see the result as an agreement between two  sides; and the third side, the Bosnian Serbs, must respond.    ['Abdallah] But Mr. President, the agreement speaks of a  confederation with Croatia.    [Berisha] This will take place at a later stage. The  international community must not accept the status quo imposed  by the Serbian occupation. That would be the first step toward  many problems in the Balkan. There would be a series of wars in  the Balkans and many countries would take part in them. The  only way to avoid all of this is to punish the aggressor.    ['Abdallah] Mr. President, there is a famous principle in  the OAU Charter that stipulates that countries should adhere to  the borders defined by colonialism on the continent, despite the  numerous problems these borders create. Do you not believe that  the Balkan countries, with all the problems they have among  themselves, should agree on something similar to this?    [Berisha] It is vital that borders in the Balkans should not  be changed by force.    ['Abdallah] Why can't the borders stay as they are and  each state keep the minorities it has within its borders?    [Berisha] Yes, that is what is required.    ['Abdallah] But this will mean that Kosovo will stay with  the Serbs, Albania will keep the Greek minority, just as  Bulgaria will keep the Turkish minority, and so on.    [Berisha] (Interrupting) No, you are comparing two different  situations. How can you compare a situation where you have  40,000-60,000 Greeks in southern Albania and 2 million Albanians  in Kosovo?    ['Abdallah] Why is Fatos Nano, the leader of the Albanian  opposition, in prison now? Are the reasons political, or does  it have to do with financial improprieties, as has been  announced?    [Berisha] Why do you not ask the same question of the  Italian authorities to find out why de Michelis and some other  Italian politicians are being tried? The reasons are the same.  They, together with Fatos Nano, committed crimes of corruption  pertaining to the aid given by Italy to Albania (when Nano was  prime minister of Albania). There was embezzlement in an amount  of $9 million. Had the reasons been political, there would have  been others the government could have taken to court.    ['Abdallah] How far has your reform program gone after two  years in power?    [Berisha] I believe that in those two years we have made  great progress in this regard. Inflation has dropped from 400  percent to 30 percent. Last year we had the highest rate of  development in the whole of Europe--11 percent, according to the  IMF evaluations. Our currency is stable. In addition, we have  freed all our prices. This puts us at a difficult stage, but  this is the only thing we can do to encourage production. We  have also privatized all agricultural land, homes, services, and  transport.    ['Abdallah] What about foreign aid?    [Berisha] We are grateful to all those who have helped us.  This aid has been used as best as possible. Now, we do not need  urgent aid; we need economic cooperation.    ['Abdallah] Do you cooperate with any Arab or Islamic  countries?    [Berisha] We cooperate with Egypt, Kuwait, Turkey, Malaysia,  and Saudi Arabia. Cooperation with these and other countries is  constantly increasing.    ['Abdallah] What about your work agenda for Albania in the  coming stage?    [Berisha] Increasing cooperation with the countries in the  region and merging the state with the European institutions are  our two major goals for the next stage. In addition, we are  trying to prevent conflicts in the region and to liberate and  strengthen the economy.    ['Abdallah] What do you expect from the meeting between the  Greek and Albanian foreign ministers? Do you have some sort of  prescription to prevent a repetition of such border incidents?    [Berisha] The Greeks have to stop those activities that  negatively affect bilateral relations. That is the first thing.  Albania has tried to be friends with Greece, but the Greeks were  not happy with our friendship.    We will continue our attempts to have good neighborly  relations, especially since there are many factors that  encourage such relations. I believe they also want that, not  only for the sake of our two countries, but for the sake of the  whole region.</p>

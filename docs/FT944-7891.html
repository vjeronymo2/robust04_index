			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Hungary bank chief to quit Hungary's central bank governor has said he will resign today, ending weeks of speculation that he would be unable to work with the country's new Socialist-led government. Mr Peter Akos Bod, appointed by the previous conservative administration in 1991, said it had been clear since the government took office in July that he did not have its full support. He was one of the main architects of the previous administration's economic policies. Top management at several large state companies have been purged by the government in recent weeks. Analysts said yesterday they did not expect Mr Bod's resignation to have a serious impact on financial markets or central bank policies. However, they said much would depend on who succeeded Mr Bod who had not been due to step down until 1997. The front-runners are Mr Ferenc Bartha, government privatisation commissioner, and Mr Gyorgy Suranyi, managing director of Central European Investment Bank, a foreign-owned local bank.</p>

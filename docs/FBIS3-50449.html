			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Chilean President Patricio Aylwin's year-end address to the </F> nation from La Moneda Palace -- recorded]    [Text] Fellow countrymen: On New Year's Eve I wish to  convey to all Chilean citizens and all those who live in our  fatherland a cordial message of friendship and hope.    As this year ends we have legitimate reasons to feel  satisfied. The recent presidential and parliamentary elections  concluded a phase of our history in which Chile happily rescued  its democratic traditions. We Chileans live in peace,  respecting our legitimate differences and striving to overcome  them through understanding. Authority is exercised within the  framework of the law; the peoples' basic rights are respected;  the state institutions, although they need to be perfected,  function normally within the framework of our democratic system;  the country continues to develop. With the limitations  characteristic of a developing world, Chile grows and improves  the living standards of its people. Production, income per  capita, job opportunities, savings, and investments continue to  grow. Unemployment and inflation rates are dropping. More  houses, highways, ports, and other infrastructure works are  being built. The great efforts to improve our public health and  education systems are beginning to yield positive results.    Yet, we must be careful. These achievements which fill us  with pride and hope must not make us complacent. Although we  have reasons to be optimistic, nothing justifies any sort of  vanity or arrogance. We are neither tigers nor jaguars. We are  one of the many developing countries in the world greatly  limited by the poverty that affects a great part of our  population and by our economy's dependency on fully developed  countries. A single example is enough to show what I mean.  During the year that is ending, the drop experienced by our  main exportable goods, as a result of the recession affecting  most of the rich countries, has reduced Chile's income from  exports by 8 percent regardless of the fact that the volume of  our exports has continued to grow. This fact requires that we  continue with our policy for growth with equity with each and  every one of us cooperating, according to our own possibilities,  with the clear understading that work, perseverance, and time  are necessary to be able to reap the desired results.    As we tackle this challenge we must bear in mind that we  belong to an increasingly interdependent world. This is why we  must persevere in the effort made during these past years in  order to increase and strengthen our relationship with the other  countries of the world and cooperate with them in the task of  consolidating peace, of increasing and liberalizing world  commerce, and building a more fair international order. The  steps we have taken to solve problems and increase cooperation  with neighboring countries and other Latin American sister  republics, and our recent acceptance as an APEC [Asia Pacific  Economic Cooperation] member country represent valuable  contributions in that regard, that open new possibilities for  the future of our country. Likewise, the recent agreement  reached at the GATT Uruguay Round and the approval of the North  America Free Trade Agreement represent legitimate reasons for  optimism for our future.    In September 1990, before the UN General Assembly, I had the  honor to urge jointly tackling the poverty problem which is one  of the main threats to world peace. Accepting this suggestion,  the United Nations has summoned a world summit on social  development that will be held in March 1995 and will be  organized by a committee headed by the Chilean ambassador.  Therefore, we must, as a country, contribute with constructive  ideas and promote efficient international agreements so that  this summit will be fruitful. I urge my fellow countrymen, in  the year that is comming, to accept this challenge as a national  commitment.    The year 1994 has been declared the International Year of  the  Family. It is only natural that human beings value the family  which, by essence, is the natural home of love and the nearest  social nucleus we all have. Undoubtedly, some characteristics  of modern life threaten to undermine the strength of the family.    In modern culture, selfishness prevails over love for our  fellow man. More often than not there is more interest in  material issues than in people and the desire to have material  possessions prevails over the desire to have good friends. The  greed for pleasure overwhelmingly surpasses the willingness to  make any sort of sacrifice. These facts weaken family ties and  affect the family's stability, obviously harming its members,  especially the children. I cordially urge all my fellow  countrymen to calmly ponder about this very important subject  and to contribute in the search for the most adequate paths to  fortify our family life.    Next March the new government recently elected by the  people,  which will be headed by my friend Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, will  assume the presidency. I hope the new government will be able  to continue and strengthen, in keeping with its government  program, the job of perfecting our democracy, economic  development, and social justice for which we have worked these  past years.    In addition to thanking my fellow countrymen for their  support and sense of responsibility with which, in general, they  have honored my government, I ask them for the same for my  successor.    I wish that the new year will be a year of peace,  development, and justice for Chile and the entire world. I wish  happiness to all my fellow countrymen. May God bless you all.</p>

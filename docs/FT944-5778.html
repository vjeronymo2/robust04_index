			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (18): Fitting in the with package - Business process re-engineering / John Kavanagh finds that software was the key to company restructuring at ventilation group Colt One way to ensure that a company takes business process re-engineering seriously is to first destabilise the entire organisation - something that can be achieved easily by introducing a new computer system. This is the view of Malcolm Goodwin, management information systems manager at Colt Group, following a re-organisation from separate national companies to a single Europe-wide business running the same program package in each country. Colt, a UK company formed in 1931, is the European market leader in ventilation for factories, shopping centres and other industrial and commercial complexes. Some of its systems are custom-built - such as the pyramid on top of London's Canary Wharf - but most are configured to order from standard products. The group has 200 staff and a turnover of more than Pounds 90m, two-thirds of which comes from outside the UK. Until the early 1990s, Colt's manufacturing companies in Germany and the Netherlands and at group headquarters in Havant, Hampshire, operated largely autonomously. This autonomy was reflected in the fact that each manufacturing site had its own IT staff running different systems. Sales teams in six other European countries had PCs. None of these systems was linked to any other. The impending opening of the single European market led to a business strategy review. This highlighted the need to re-organise into a pan-European operation, retaining local autonomy where possible. Computer systems were seen as vital. 'Standardising our systems would not only address existing shortcomings such as inflexibility and separate databases but also encourage culture change to align each company to the new group business strategy,' Mr Goodwin says. A standard software package for all sites was seen as the only way ahead: 'We wrote into the group's policy statement the fact that we would not use any bespoke systems, even if it meant changing the business to fit the package. 'With bespoke systems there is the problem of specifying exactly what is needed so that the IT department can exactly produce it.' Colt wanted a supplier which would still be around in 10 years' time and which could support it in the three main countries. However, it took a liberal approach on system functions. 'We didn't write a detailed functional specification, because it would be impossible to find a package which would fit precisely,' Mr Goodwin says. 'We set up multinational teams of users from the same business functions to discuss their requirements in general terms and produce a high-level invitation to tender.' An independent consultant helped with detailed weighting and analysis of technical bids from two short-listed suppliers. These suppliers also had a day each to present their systems to the user teams. A lesson was learned here. 'The end-users' evaluation was not adequately structured, so their responses tended to be emotive,' Mr Goodwin says. 'This could have distorted the selection process but fortunately they preferred the supplier which had emerged as favourite from the more scientific analysis of the technical bids.' The winning supplier, Baan International of the Netherlands, had extra attractions for Mr Goodwin. 'It's a family business, with two brothers, both very active,' he says. 'They have great vision for the future of the company and the product, which we needed.' Colt now has Baan's Triton manufacturing package, which includes related applications such as accounting. Triton was seen as lacking pre-sales facilities, so Colt chose the Brock Activity Manager, a market leader in the US and sold in the UK by Cocam. Uniplex was chosen for office automation. One factor in the choice of these last two packages was that they use the same relational database design as Triton, allowing them to be linked easily, for example to extract data from Triton into Uniplex to produce tender documents for prospective customers. All the systems run under the Unix operating system on IBM RS/6000 computers at all three factories. The systems are gradually also being installed at the other European operations. Colt uses the Internet for communications and has gone to Internet services supplier Pipex. Colt introduced Triton using a Baan method which was time consuming but brought considerable benefits. 'The method involves training a key user in each functional area to a high level and allowing them to lead the implementation,' Mr Goodwin says. The team approach to choosing and introducing the new system has had lasting impact. 'There is far greater communication between people in different countries,' Mr Goodwin says. There has been a small reduction in IT staff but they now work more closely with the users and focus on helping them get the most out of the packages. Mr Goodwin says the IT staff were previously seen as an obstacle to business use of IT. Using a standard package has had a dual impact on Colt's business reorganisation. 'Before, we were constrained by rigid systems; our new package is highly configurable: there are always two or three ways of achieving something. This means we can continue to change our organisation without being held back by our systems.' Running a single package across all countries has also brought many operational benefits. For example, an order that once generate 22 copies is now on one piece of paper and information can be shared instantly through a single database by manufacturing, sales and finance. In some cases this has cut deliveries to customers from four weeks to three or four days. Stock and work in progress have been cut by more than a quarter. The significance of the systems project to the future of the group is reflected in the fact that it was the biggest and most ambitious initiative ever undertaken. The first phase, putting the systems and equipment in the three main sites, cost Pounds 1.75m. Supplier profile Baan International: formed in 1978, it is a privately owned Netherlands company specialising in packaged software for manufacturing. Product: Triton, the company's main product, is described as an enterprise resource planning system. It covers MRP-II, logistics, distribution, transport, finance and project management, and handles multiple currencies, plants and languages. Employees: 820 in Europe, North and South America and Asia. Turnover: Dollars 75m. Hardware and operating systems: Triton runs under the Unix operating system. Number of users: 1,800 installations worldwide. Price: on application; the Colt contract, covering multiple sites, was worth more than Pounds 650,000. Contact: UK head office. Tel: 0532 383262.</p>

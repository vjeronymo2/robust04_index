			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Management (Under Pressure):  The Scottish bank with an English money-box - James Buxton continues the series on UK clearers by assessing the Bank of Scotland, one of Britain's more innovative institutions When Bank of Scotland produces its annual results on Wednesday they will show its first fall in pre-tax profits since the early 1980s. Higher provisions for bad debts means that group profits for the year to February are likely to fall short of last year's record Pounds 194m. Yet despite this, the bank's reputation as one of the most successful clearing banks in Britain is unlikely to be tarnished. Over the past decade, it has devised a strategy which has resulted in its share of the UK banking market roughly doubling (to about five per cent), with half its business now coming from south of the border, despite having only a skeleton branch network outside Scotland. That is backed by a management system which has so far enabled it to avoid many mistakes, to keep costs low and consistently to innovate. Most of its growth has been organic. The transformation of what at the end of the 1970s was a competent but hidebound organisation owes much to Bruce Pattullo; now deputy governor and chief executive, he took over running the bank, which he had joined straight from Oxford, in 1979 when he was 41. When he arrived at The Mound, the bank's headquarters in Edinburgh, no one seemed to be responsible for the direction the bank was taking. 'The management assumed that the non-executive directors were worrying about future strategy and left it to them,' he says. 'In fact the directors were busy running their own businesses and assumed that the management was thinking about the future. Despite good intentions there was a void.' Pattullo, a man whose liveliness belies his somewhat stern appearance, created a management board consisting of the clearing bank's full-time senior executives and told them that where the bank was in five years' time was up to them. The main board of directors became entirely non-executive and its role became that of vetting the decisions of the management board, with Pattullo the only person on both. 'The idea was to give the managers responsibility. They wanted change and were delighted to rise to the challenge,' he says. Responsibility then began to cascade down the managerial ranks. According to Peter Burt, 47, who took over as chief general manager in 1988, Pattullo 'took the lid off the pressure cooker and allowed ideas to bubble up in a gradually accelerating process'. The bank's initiatives in the English market are designed to reduce dependence on the sluggish Scottish economy, and to offset and even exploit the fact that it does not have a full branch network in England. 'If we'd inherited a network like Royal Bank of Scotland we'd have been delighted,' says Pattullo. 'But it was too late to buy or to build. Necessity is the mother of invention.' The bank still has only about 15 branches in England outside London compared with 487 in Scotland. The initial big step was the 1983 launch of the first money market cheque account offered by a clearing bank. It was an immediate success in the south-east of England. That was followed by: Joint ventures with more than 30 organisations such as the Halifax Building Society and the Automobile Association, with the bank normally contributing financial products and processing, and the partner offering its customer base. HOBS, the bank's Home and Office Banking System, which was the first in the UK whereby a customer can operate his account remotely. The majority of HOBS customers are companies which had no previous connection with Bank of Scotland. Creating a card-processing centre at Dunfermline, Fife, which processes the Bank's own Visa and Mastercards as well as those issued by institutions such as National Provincial building society and, in a joint venture, Halifax Building Society. It now operates 1.5m cards. Invention of TAPS, the bank's transcontinental automated payment service, which links countries' automated payments systems for low cost transmission of very large numbers of small payments. The bank says it was a first and is still unique in dealing with payments to several countries simultaneously. Development of a substantial English business in mortgages and targeted loans fed to it by intermediaries and operated through the bank's computerised central banking services in Edinburgh. It says it was the first UK bank to create this kind of centre for processing remote transactions. With its small English branch network the bank has a low cost-base. Its cost/income ratio fell three points in 1989/90 to 53 per cent as it pushed more business through its existing structure. That compared with ratios for London-based clearers of 64 per cent in the case of Barclays and 76 per cent for Midland. Bank of Scotland did not make some of the mistakes committed by other banks. Its first criterion for new ventures is never to do anything that might imperil the independence of the bank (reinforced by a 33 per cent stake held by its Edinburgh neighbour, Standard Life), which automatically makes it cautious. Thus it did not buy into capital market operations at the time of Big Bang (though it was anyway hardly big enough to have made much impact). It contemplated and rejected buying a chain of estate agents before that became fashionable. It has a low exposure to less developed country debt; it did not buy a US bank, though, in this case, it tried but was outbid. 'We've elected not to pay more than book value for acquisitions,' says Archie Gibson, general manager for central banking services. 'You'll be familiar with the expression 'short arms and deep pockets'.' Although Bank of Scotland has a joint venture in a new bank in Greece, a joint venture in credit card-processing with Quelle, the German mail order company, and a stake in Italian credit card processing as well as a venture in New Zealand, the UK is the main focus of attention. It believes it understands UK banking best. Says Burt: 'I believe we are still small enough to double our market share in the UK.' Already relatively small, Bank of Scotland believes it benefits from devolved authority and short lines of communication. Gavin Masterton, general manager since 1986 for UK banking east (covering the east of Scotland), says: 'Cascading authority goes down as far as there's a willingness to accept it.' Every branch manager, he says, should feel that he 'owns' his branch. Within branches junior managers should feel they 'own', say, their own operations. In a phrase which often comes up in conversations in the bank, he says, 'the triangle of authority here is flatter than in other banks'. The district manager in, say, Fife, is 'the man of business there who doesn't need to refer many decisions to Edinburgh'. He says he regards both his regional managers and his colleagues on the management board as his partners. Masterton says the bank is continually asking 'is your journey really necessary?' to cut out redundant work. Staff put up ideas and a formal staff suggestion scheme produces results, such as a more economical way of storing a customer's standing orders, and ditching a rule requiring mortgage arrears to be reported to the district manager. In February, as the effects of recession in England on the bank's lending book deepened, the bank told its staff that there would have to be significant belt-tightening, but assured them that there would be no compulsory redundancies, though some of the 12,200 jobs would go through natural wastage. 'If a person knows he isn't going to be sacked it becomes a lot easier for him to agree with you that his current job may not be necessary and do another one,' says Burt. Pattullo believes, he says, in a 'bottom up' approach to management, preferring to wait for ideas to germinate down the line and be pushed up to the management board for approval, rather than to dictate from above. 'A chief executive who is over-anxious to stamp his personality on a bank has a high risk of failing,' he says. 'Such an executive might say: I want to create an operation in every country in Europe. But if the people down the line don't really want to do it, if the chemistry isn't right, it won't succeed.' Some people who know the bank well suggest that its wish to keep its distinctiveness as a low-cost institution, its typically Scottish refusal to pay for goodwill and its dedication to increasing the wealth of its shareholders limit its growth. But the bank's record of expansion and new ventures contradicts that; the need for consensus in the management board, however, restrains individual egos and may avert rash moves. Pattullo says he exercises direction with a light hand, and the consensus has very occasionally gone against him. But senior managers believe his leadership and consistency of approach are the key to the the bank's success, not least in engendering high morale. Burt says: 'With high morale you achieve miracles.'

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Lunch with the FT: Trading his way to the winner's enclosure  -Michael Thompson-Noel meets horse racing's Robert Sangster At its highest level, horse racing is an amalgam of glamour, money, hope, elation and despair, with some madness thrown in. To succeed, you have to be rich, tough, lucky and fanatically determined: four of the qualities that have made Englishman Robert Sangster one of the world's most successful breeders and owners of racehorses this century. He has made a flying start to the 1994 European racing season. Already, nine horses owned or bred by Sangster have won or been placed in European classic races. However, at Royal Ascot this week he was right out of luck. He calls himself a horse trader. He jets far and wide from his tax-friendly Isle of Man base, supervising a bloodstock empire that stretches almost to the South Pole. I asked this 58-year-old about his workload. 'Well,' he said, 'in March I travelled on 20 different aeroplanes. I was in Dubai, Ireland, four states of Australia, New Zealand and the US, where I travelled extensively.' 'So you're tough?' 'I guess I am. I saw the doctor this morning, and was given a clean bill of health.' 'How about stress? What is it like to watch a horse you own on the brink of victory, or of a photo-finish defeat, in a top race like the English Derby or France's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe?' I asked this because I knew that in June 1977, when The Minstrel, owned by Sangster and some partners, was bullied by jockey Lester Piggott in the English Derby to win by a neck in a savagely dramatic finish, Sangster and his trainer, Vincent O'Brien, had been reduced to jelly. In the years since, Sangster must have watched hundreds of pulsating finishes in which much was at stake. 'Yes, it can be stressful,' he replied. 'At this year's Epsom Derby I was watching a TV screen as my horse, Colonel Collins, made his finishing burst, and someone slammed me on the back and shouted: 'Robert, you've done it]' By the time I'd picked my binoculars up, Erhaab (the 7-2 favourite) had charged past my horse and won. Yes . . . something like that raises the old blood pressure.' (Colonel Collins finished third). I had arranged to meet Sangster at The Square, an elegantly contemporary restaurant in St James's, London. In the event, he asked if we could switch to Wiltons, a gamey, establishment joint in nearby Jermyn Street. We could talk for an hour, then join a lunch being held to celebrate the wines of Domaine Ott. Sangster has a house in that part of southern France. I agreed. We chatted. Then we joined the all-male group that had gathered to enjoy lunch (crab, fish, raspberries) at Domaine Ott's expense. It was an amusing, powerful group. All were rich and sporty. Many owned racehorses. One of them at our table was a young Tory minister from the House of Lords. 'Yes, my lord,' the waiter kept saying. 'Yes, my lord.' I could not work out what the group was for, so I asked one of its members, a City businessman. I said: 'What is the common denominator?' And he said: 'Piss artists.' In company such as that, the quietly-spoken Sangster merges decorously into the background. He is diffidence itself. He could be a bishop. If you passed him in the street you probably wouldn't notice him. But he is friendly and direct, and says that he enjoys the social side of racing. 'The people I deal with - trainers, jockeys, bloodstock agents, fellow owners - are all very good friends. At Royal Ascot, I and my wife entertain 30 different people to lunch on each of the four days, and I enjoy that.' The value of the horses that have passed through his hands easily exceeds Dollars 1bn. As a trader, he spreads his risks, and is always willing to buy and sell. Worldwide, his bloodstock holdings include a great many broodmares, yearlings - he keeps some and sells others - horses-in-training and shares (usually a 25 per cent stake) in about 20 top stallions. For example, he owns 25 per cent of the Irish-based Sadler's Wells (stud fee: Pounds 125,000), which he describes as 'probably the best racing stallion in the world'. There are 40 shares in Sadler's Wells. The last share to change hands did so for Pounds 500,000, says Sangster. 'You're a dealer,' I said. 'You buy and sell. Suppose I had Pounds 1m to spend. What would you sell me?' The horse-trader smiled. He barely paused to think. 'All right,' he said. 'At this point in the English season (June 9) I've had three two-year-old runners, and all three won their first races impressively. For Pounds 1m, I would probably advise you to take a one-third stake in each of them.' 'Would that be good for you? You'd show a decent profit?' 'I would.' 'Would it be good for me?' 'It would. There is a chance, I'd say, that one of them will win a classic; that the second will fare extremely well; and that the third - well, that might bang a knee tomorrow and never be heard from again. But at Pounds 1m for the three, you'd be all right. As the vendor, I'd want you to come back  -to do business with me again. You'd be better off buying a Pounds 333,333 stake in those three than spending Pounds 1m at the sales in Kentucky.' (Pounds 1m does not go far in racing. All three of these creatures ran at Royal Ascot, and none won, though Helmsman was only narrowly beaten. One of them, General Monash, was injured). 'Do you bet?' I asked Sangster. He was born to wealth, and is an expert on betting. He inherited Vernons Pools, a business that takes bets on soccer matches, before selling it to Ladbroke, and was involved in setting up large-scale lotteries in Australia and New York. He sold Vernons five years ago because, he says, he heard the authorities were considering a national lottery in Britain. They were: it starts in a few months, and is expected to knock pools-betting for six. 'Yes,' he said, 'if I go racing I'll have a bet for fun.' 'What, to you, is a big bet?' 'A monkey: Pounds 500.' 'You're successful?' 'I show a profit once in three years. I could make a profit every year, but I'd be very boring about it. I would probably only have five bets in the year, and only two would win, but I would show a great profit.' The speculative madness that infects the racing game in cycles can be gauged from the roller-coaster fluctuations in bloodstock prices, whether for yearlings sold at auction or for stallions being floated on the international market. For instance, in 1984-85, when the racehorse market was in frenzy, Sangster's bloodstock empire was estimated, by accountants, to have been worth almost Dollars 350m. By 1992, values had crashed, and Sangster's empire had shrunk in value to Dollars 160m or so. Values are recovering now. I asked the master horse-trader how his fortunes stood. 'It's difficult,' he said. 'Until you come to sell something - a horse or a painting - you don't know what it is worth. But the whole bloodstock industry today is reckoned to be worth a quarter of what it was worth in the early 1980s. In 1992, after an intense campaign to extract maximum value for him, I sold one of my horses, Rodrigo de Triano, to Japan for Dollars 6m, whereas 10 years previously I had sold Assert, a fairly similar sort - similar breeding, the same sort of racehorse - to Kentucky for Dollars 24m. 'If I was selling Rodrigo today, he'd probably be worth Dollars 10m. In the early 1980s, 50 yearlings would have been sold at international auction for Dollars 1m-plus each. Today, it is only eight or nine.' As a horse-trader, one of Sangster's attributes is memory-power. Others: shrewdness and competitiveness. And he still studies hard: still pores over racehorse pedigrees and other data. If you were interested in the glam-mad world of international racing, you would be delighted by his company. If you knew nothing about racing, his stories would make your eyes pop.</p>

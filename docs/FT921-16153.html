			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / International Company News: Portugal to privatise 90% of oil group PETROGAL, the Portuguese oil group and the country's largest company, is to be 90 per cent privatised. An initial 51 per cent stake will be sold this year. The government hopes to raise about Esc130bn (Dollars 967m) from the privatisation. Under terms it approved last week, the privatisation will be divided into several tranches, with an initial sale of 25 per cent. This will include a capital increase of around Esc20bn, representing 20 per cent of the company's share capital, and the direct sale of another 5 per cent stake. This first stage of privatisation will be on the basis of competitive bids. The winner will be chosen during a special session of the stock exchange. The new shareholders will have preferential rights over the purchase of another 26 per cent stake later. The government intends to keep a 10 per cent holding in the company because of its strategic importance in the economy. Around 20 per cent will be reserved for employees; 10 per cent for Sonangol, the Angolan oil company which is an important supplier of oil to Petrogal; and 9 per cent for the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, a diversified Portuguese private investment group. Foreign shareholders will be limited to a maximum 40 per cent holding. The new shareholders must also undertake to fulfil commitments and contracts already agreed by the company, including the modernisation of its large refinery in Sines, on the southern Atlantic coast, which is expected to cost about Esc60bn. In 1990, Petrogal had sales worth Esc419bn and profits of Esc3.5bn. However, it has suffered increasingly from uncompetitive production costs and overmanning, and is expected to return a loss in 1991.</p>

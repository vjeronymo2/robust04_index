			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Classics with extra spin: A new UK audience has been created for classical music Musical monks from an obscure Spanish village may seem unlikely rivals of the world's wealthiest opera stars. But over the next few weeks the Silos Monastery choir will be battling against Placido Domingo, Jose Carreras and Luciano Pavarotti for top place in the UK's Christmas classical music charts. The Silos choristers' Canto Noel is a seasonal follow-up to their Canto Gregoriano, a compilation of Gregorian plain song that is this year's classical best-seller. Their rival for the number one position is the Three Tenors' 1994 concert before the football World Cup final in Los Angeles. So far this year, the popular success of records such as these has boosted the volume of classical music sales in the UK by more than 10 per cent against the same period of 1993, according to the British Phonographic Industry. The question for the music industry is whether this year's increase reflects a genuine widening of the classical market or just the impact of a few one-off hits. 'The success of the Three Tenors and Canto Gregoriano shows that people enjoy classical music if they have a chance to hear it,' said Bill Holland, head of Warner Classics. 'We've got to break down the old snobberies and help the public feel more comfortable about buying operas or symphonies.' The UK classical market has experienced similar upsurges before. Sales peaked in 1990, at 16.7m units (CDs, cassettes and LPs) worth Pounds 67.3m, according to the British Phonographic Institute. But the increase was fuelled by the one-off success of particular albums, such as the first Three Tenors' concert at the 1990 World Cup. There was no long-term increase in sales, and the new customers drifted away. By 1992, sales had shrunk to 12.3m units worth Pounds 50.9m. The market has since picked up again, and is expected to reach over 14m units by the end of this year. Roughly two-thirds of these will be bought by serious collectors who form the core of the UK market. But even at these levels, the classical music market is small in comparison with that for popular music. It represents 7 per cent of UK music sales by volume, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, against 9 per cent in France, 10 per cent in Germany and 15 per cent in Switzerland. The cost of meeting demand for recordings of new productions of operas or symphonies is high. 'It costs at least Pounds 300,000 just to record an opera and you can expect to sell only 9,000 units in the first year, so you're looking at a 15 or 20 year investment,' said Kick Klimble, vice-president international of EMI Classics. 'We also take a long-term approach to working with a star conductor. We've made 50 recordings with Simon Rattle over 18 years and he's only just become profitable.' Occasionally, the pay-off period can be much shorter, with 'cross-over' hits, records that find an appeal among a mass audience. The Three Tenors' 1990 album sold 13m copies worldwide; Vivaldi's Four Seasons by the violinist, Nigel Kennedy, launched the following year, has sold 2m. Cross-overs are an anathema to collectors, however. 'It seems impossible for the musical establishment to accept that someone can be popular and artistically worthy,' said Chris Tooth, classical product manager for the Virgin retail group. 'Nigel Kennedy is a seriously good violinist, but he was attacked as soon as he became successful. 'No one has actually said Pavarotti is a bad singer. But there is this sniffy element of 'If he sings My Way, can we take him seriously?'.' One of the chief catalysts of this year's upsurge in sales, according to Mr Klimble, is the success of Classic FM. The populist classical radio station, launched in 1992, has introduced a new breed of classical fans into the market. By playing a medley of the most accessible music, Classic FM has built up a weekly audience of 4.8m listeners. This is double that of Radio 3, the BBC's classical station, which appeals to purists with entire works, including austere modern compositions. Classic FM has provided a tailor-made advertising vehicle for music companies to target the popular classical market. Its easy listening format has also helped fuel the appetite for compilation albums of popular pieces of classical music collected under titles such as Sensual Classics, Classic Sleepies and Classic Creepies. These now dominate Classic FM's weekly chart. Compilations are not only heavy sellers but are cheap to produce as they are assembled from archive recordings. Canto Gregoriano and Canto Noel were re-edited from four albums recorded at Silos Monastery by EMI in the early 1970s. Warner is rumoured to have paid Dollars 5m to each of the Three Tenors for the rights to record their 1994 concert. The purists are even sniffier about compilations than about Nigel Kennedy. 'You can't really call them classical at all,' said Mr Tooth. However compilations can act as a stepping stone into the 'serious' classical market. Warner now adds suggestion lists to its compilations identifying complete pieces of music the listener might like. It has already detected an increase in sales of those works. 'It will take a long time to break down the elitism surrounding classical music, but we're getting there,' said Mr Holland of Warner Classics. 'I was encouraged by the success of Gorecki's Third Symphony last year. It's very rare for the work of a living composer to top the charts for 35 weeks. 'Then I read a letter in CD Review asking why anyone could have released such a dreadful piece of music. Six million people bought it. That's why.'</p>

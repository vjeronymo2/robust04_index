			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Arts: 'The Fiery Angel' and 'Stiffelio' - Opera Germany's municipal theatres are famed for their novelty-seeking opera productions - but as long as the music is familiar, the public will buy it. Give them something unknown, and they are notoriously conservative. That is why most companies stick to tried and tested favourites, however unrecognisable the characters may appear when they reach the stage. Fortunately, there are occasional exceptions, when a well-cast, well-staged production makes an immediate impact, and word gets round that a little-known work is actually worth hearing. This has been the case with The Fiery Angel at Freiburg and Stiffelio at Ludwigshafen. Unlike Shostakovich's two operas, which are fast becoming repertory works, Prokofiev's more substantial output is virtually unknown in Germany. The Freiburg Fiery Angel will help redress the balance. The work's structure may be illogical, its grotesque climax too farcical for Teutonic taste, but it is otherwise well-suited to the German theatre: a fast-moving, colouristic, virtually indestructible music drama about obsession and devil-possession. It offers a tough challenge to its leading soprano - which Vivian Tierney, a familiar voice at Glyndebourne and ENO, meets with thrilling equanimity. She may not yet possess the sheer weight of tone considered desirable for Renata, but she sounded comfortable in the role, as if stamina were taken for granted. There was ample projection and dramatic expression, and her pure, well-produced voice had an appealing lustre, with no uneven squalls. In visual terms, she portrayed a tragically youthful heroine, slim, athletic, almost angelic, darting barefoot and terror-stricken across-stage in the opening scene, clinging restlessly to Ruprecht in Act two, unnervingly self-contained in the finale. Miss Tierney came over as a fresh and sincere artist, drawing the best from those around her (and singing in excellent German). She found admirable support not just from Neal Schwantes' chivalrous young Ruprecht, but from the conductor Thomas Gabrisch, who kept orchestral dynamics well under control. The production team - staging by Wolfram Mehring, decor by Herbert Murauer, costumes by Maja Scholl-Lemcke - adopted a bare essentials approach, in which a set of dislocated representational designs, imaginatively used and selectively lit, created a potent theatrical atmosphere. Haunting the proceedings from the start were a group of diabolical black-hooded figures, moving in slow motion and working up a powerful cauldron of steam in the Agrippa scene. These, one presumed, were the same characters who, transformed into monks, set about raping the crazed nuns in the expertly choreographed pandemonium of Act five. Verdi's Stiffelio, about a German Protestant priest who confronts and eventually forgives his adulterous young wife, had never previously been performed in Germany (although its later re-incarnation as Aroldo was staged several times in the 1950s and 1960s). The opera's subject-matter has never matched Italian taste, but it seems to be enjoying a minor revival north of the Alps. London's Royal Opera will stage it in January, and Ludwigshafen's Italian-language production will be shown later in the Netherlands, Belgium and Poland. The Swiss producer/designer Marco Arturo Marelli gave the work a clear, concentrated aesthetic, drawing attention not to production tricks, but to the human drama in Verdi's music. The action was dwarfed by a simple set of blue-grey panels, re-aligned and re-lit according to the demands of each scene. Together with Dagmar Niefind's black period costumes, they captured the austere religious claustrophobia which shrouds the drama. The principals acted with poise, while the chorus scenes had a severe formality, from which Marelli drew maximum expressiveness. One does not often encounter Verdi productions as discreet and intelligent as this. There were no big Italianate voices on offer, but the cast was balanced and sang with a sense of style. As the adulterous Lina - her symbolic red wig and shawl providing the only visual colour all evening - Inga Nielsen delivered her arias with delicate expression, as precisely-tuned in her crystalline top as in her ample chest register. The stage presence was graceful but cool. As Stankar, the opera's strong-tempered father-figure, Eduard Tumagian gave an experienced performance, despite his narrow vocal range. In the title role, which must rank as the most unromantic of Verdi tenors, Zvetan Michailov sang elegantly, but with tight, bottled tone. Lothar Zagrosek's neat conducting lacked Verdian fire. The local Ludwigshafen chorus was excellent. I enjoyed this encounter with Stiffelio. It may lack the consistent melodic inspiration of its immediate predecessor, Luisa Miller, or the dramatic breadth of the later works, but it is short, coherent and unmistakably Verdian.</p>

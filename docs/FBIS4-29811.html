			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, June 21 (AFP) -- The Indonesian Government  on Tuesday banned three weekly publications, including the  country's biggest-selling magazine, shortly after they had run  articles sharply critical of a close associate of President  Suharto.    The director-general of the ministry of information,  Subrata,  told a press conference that the authorities were withdrawing  the publishing licences of TEMPO, EDITOR and DETIK.    Subrata, who is in charge of press and the graphic  industries, accused them of flouting official "warnings." He  said there were administrative reasons for barring EDITOR and  DETIK, while in the case of TEMPO, the licence was withdrawn  because of editorial content.    All three publications had recently published articles  attacking the research and technology minister, Bacharuddin  Jusuf Habibie, a close ally of Indonesian President Suharto.    The last magazine to be banned was MONITOR in 1990, for  having published a popularity survey that placed the Prophet  Muhammad in 11th place, a rank that outraged many Indonesian  Muslims.    TEMPO, the country's largest-circulation magazine, as well  as  the newer DETIK, a tabloid newspaper, had recently reported on a  rift between Habibie on one hand and the armed forces and  Finance Ministry on the other, over the purchase of 39 former  East German warships.    On June 2, EDITOR had published a front-page piece on plans  to set up a group establishing former members of the student  nationalist movement in the 1960s, which would have rivalled  Habibie's Association of Muslim Intellectuals.    It quoted another government member, Siswono Yudohusodo, a  former student leader who is now minister of transmigration, as  saying Habibie's group was guilty of "manoevering." The  minister of transmigration has responsibility for internal  population movement in Indonesia, from crowded to remote areas.    TEMPO, a news magazine launched in the 1970s, has a  circulation of 180,000, while EDITOR, also a news magazine,  founded in 1987 has 30,000. DETIK was launched in 1992, using a  defunct title, and has a sale of 400,000.    Subrata said DETIK had diverged from the remit of its  publishing licence, which restricted it to reporting on crime  and social stories. Its reporting on political matters amounted  to a violation of these parameters, he said.    A DETIK journalist, reached by telephone, said that this was  merely a technical pretext to bar the publications.    In the case of EDITOR, the publisher did not exercise full  editorial control over the magazine, which was also an  administrative violation, he said.    In the case of TEMPO, he said, without elaborating, that the  ban was because of editorial content.    President Suharto had already threatened, at a naval review  on June 9, to take action against newspapers that targeted  Habibie.    He accused the media of having generated "an atmosphere of  suspicion that harms stability" and declared: "We cannot let  (the press) carry on like this. If they are deaf to warnings,  then we will take steps against them."    Indonesia's biggest daily seller, KOMPAS, reported on June  13  that Information Minister Harmoko -- another close friend of  Suharto's and president of the official party, Golkar -- had  drawn up "severe measures" against what was considered to be a  media campaign against Habibie.    The official news agency ANTARA reported Tuesday that  Harmoko  complained last week that "several publications ... have been  failing to uphold journalistic ethics."</p>

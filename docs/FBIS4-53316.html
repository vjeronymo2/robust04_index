			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Focus" by Kohei Murayama] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, 17 May KYODO -- With the long-delayed Diet  deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget finally getting under  way, the Finance Ministry is stepping up its campaign to  pressure legislators into an early passage of the bill.    Ministry leaders have started to openly admit their fears  that a further delay would put a damper on the economy, which  has recently shown improvements and been relieved from a further  rise in the yen.    "I can't deny that a long delay will affect the economy,"  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii told a press meeting held  Tuesday [17 May] just before the Diet started its budget  deliberations.    The day before, Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito made  headlines by spelling out his concerns at a usually vague  regular news conference.    The full 73 trillion yen budget for the year that started 1  April faced a Diet impasse over former Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's questionable loans from the scandal-tainted Sagawa  Kyubin trucking group.    During the stalemate, the government adopted a 50-day  provisional budget in March worth 11 trillion yen, effective  from 1 April, to bridge the spending gap. That stopgap budget  will expire on Friday.    The Diet deadlock continued in April, with the opposition  Liberal Democratic Party stubbornly pursuing the loan issue and  causing Hosokawa to resign.    To further bridge the delay, the government endorsed last  week a 40-day supplement to the provisional budget.    Both Fujii and Saito said that fresh public projects and  other outlays related to new policy measures cannot be included  in the stopgap budget, and Saito stressed, "that's why we are  calling for early Diet passage" of the full budget.    Economists said the budget has become crucial to Japan's  economic recovery during the halt in the yen's rise, and warned  that economy-stimulating spending included in the February 15.25  trillion yen package will dry up by the end of June.    Jesper Koll, chief economist at S.G. Warburg Securities  (Japan) Inc., said the stimulus package helped Japan's real  gross national product (GDP) to grow 0.1 percent in calender  1994, and without it real GDP would have contracted 1.8 percent.    He added that Japan needs to continue bolstering the economy  with fresh spending even after the package-related outlays  disappear.    Diet budget deliberations usually last about two months,  roughly the time frame necessary to have the budget passed by  the end of June.    The LDP and the Social Democratic Party, which split from  the  ruling coalition when the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  was formed, have said they will try to ensure the budget is  passed by the end of the current Diet session on 29 June.    Many economists say there is no guarantee that goal can be  realized, given all the current political turmoil and with  Hata's coalition holding only a minority in the diet.    Koll said, "foreign institutional investors have completely  lost faith in Japan's budget and they are set to sell off  Japanese stocks if a clear direction is not in sight by around  15 June."    This would mean a major setback in Japanese stocks that have  been underpinned by foreign buying, he said.    From around that time, market attention will shift to the  bank of Japan with a cut in the official discount rate becoming  the only way to buoy the economy, Koll said.    Meanwhile, bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno, in his  latest news conference, called for Hata to use "leadership" to  push through the budget.</p>

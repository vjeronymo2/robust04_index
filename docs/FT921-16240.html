			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Union claims Sunday work pressure SUPERMARKET chains and other stores which opened on Sundays before Christmas are trying to force staff into signing new contracts of employment in order to avoid paying premium wage rates as Sunday opening becomes permanent, Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, claimed yesterday. Usdaw said several large retail employers were trying to follow the example of Woolworth, where all employees taken on since last April had been put on contracts which defined Sunday as a normal working day, attracting no overtime payments. These workers can get time-and-a-half pay for Sunday if they work 39 hours during the rest of the week, but Mr Pat Jones, for Usdaw, said that most workers were women part-timers who would rarely be called on to work a full week. Woolworth employees who were with the company before April get double-time pay for Sundays, irrespective of which other days they work or whether they work Sundays within a 39-hour week. Mr Jones said this can mean workers receiving different pay for the same work in the same store. He added: 'We have evidence that supermarket chains which opened illegally before Christmas enticed sufficient staff to volunteer by paying double-time  -over Pounds 30 for five or six hours' work. Now they plan to make Sunday work compulsory for single-time, or at best time-and-a-half. We fear that some employers will simply give three months' notice to staff who won't comply.' Usdaw is particularly angry because retailers who have given evidence to past parliamentary committees on Sunday opening claimed then that premium payments would make Sunday trading very attractive to staff. Premium payments are also part of a 'Shopworkers Charter' drawn up by the Shopping Hours Reform Council, a pro-Sunday trading pressure group in which Kingfisher, Woolworth's owner, is prominent. Mr Jones said the union would name the retailers concerned on Wednesday, when store employees would give accounts of what their employers had proposed to them. 'The extra trade which even the more successful Sunday openers did over Christmas and the new year has not been sufficiently profitable to cover seven-day working with double-time, so now they want to cut Sunday rates. Without paying double-time, they won't get enough volunteers, apart from casual staff,' he added. Usdaw admits some difficulty in organising retail employees, partly because of the increasing number of part-time women joining the workforce. Recession and joblessness are also on the employer's side, since many employees reason that any job is better than none. Even a place with a strong trade union tradition such as Merseyside may put jobs before industrial action. The busy Crosby branch of J. Sainsbury, for example, has advertised no local vacancies on its in-store noticeboard for months, with only the company's graduate training scheme seeking recruits.</p>

			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Japan impatient for 'annus horribilis' to end - Emiko Terazono looks back on a difficult 1992 and assesses the stock market's prospects for next year The last year has brought more trouble to the Tokyo stock market, rocked by horror stories about a possible meltdown of the financial system, a plunge in the real estate market, a slump in consumer demand and poor corporate earnings. From a high of 23,801.18 early in January, the Nikkei average had dropped 40 per cent to 14,309.41 by mid-August. At that point, a Y10,700bn (Dollars 86bn) emergency government spending package to revive the economy took the Nikkei up to 18,908 in September, but that recovery has been only partly sustained and analysts believe that many of the problems affecting Japanese share prices are likely to continue in 1993. Tokyo's woes started in early April, when bank shares plunged on fears over the financial system. Investors' worries were compounded by the authorities' failure to react, causing discontent among the financial community. Sharp falls in real estate prices and rumours of financial problems at leading condominium developers and housing concerns came next. Mounting bad debts at housing loan companies also distressed investors and figures for bad loans held by the banking sector, ranging from Y20,000bn to Y60,000bn, circulated the market. The government's emergency package lifted the Nikkei from a six-year low. Along with the fiscal spending package, the government pledged to stimulate the stock market by adding additional public funds into stock investments and restricting investors from selling stock holdings to realise profits. The government's support for the stock market, however, has kept shares expensive at a time when the economy is still stumbling, and corporate earnings are continuing to fall. Companies were hurt by the sudden decline in consumer demand which government officials had hoped would pull Japan's economy out of the doldrums. A study showed that interim earnings at 516 leading manufacturing companies fell by 38 per cent on average, and most analysts are predicting a 20 to 30 per cent fall for the fiscal year to March. With the Nikkei at a price/earnings ratio of 55 times, investors have little incentive to jump in. The critical question for the stock market next year is the level of economic growth, and corporate earnings. This month the government halved its growth forecast for the current fiscal year from 3.5 to 1.6 per cent, and has declined to say when a recovery will begin. Private growth forecasts range between 2.3 to 2.8 per cent, while most economists predict corporate profits may not recover until 1994. Stock market strategists have set their forecasts accordingly. Mr Peter Tasker at Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo predicts that the Nikkei average will trade between 15,000 and 19,300 while Mr Jason James at James Capel sees it moving within a 16,000-20,000 range. Japanese analysts are a little more bullish, with Mr Tatsuo Kurokawa at Nomura Securities predicting 16,000-21,000 and Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities on 16,500-24,000. Mr Ueki expects heavy profit-taking around the 20,000 level, but thinks that sentiment will be lifted by economic recovery. The lack of exciting new products this year probably heralds a trend over the next few years. Mr Tasker says that the major talking point next year is likely to be how well leading companies handle a rehabilitation phase. Manufacturers will undergo slow and painful restructuring, adjusting to low growth over the next few years, and shedding fat accumulated in the late 1980s by cutting staff and capital spending. Meanwhile, some analysts predict a return of the crisis in confidence in the banking sector, triggered by surfacing problems at a few smaller financial institutions. The banks are scheduled to launch the 'Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company', a loan and land buying agency early next year, with 162 institutions investing a total of Y7.9bn. But rather than stimulate the faltering property market, the new agency is designed to accelerate the write-off of bad loans at the banks. Ms Alicia Ogawa, banking analyst at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, comments: 'I don't know anybody who has high hopes of the land buying company.' However, share prices are likely to remain firm against possible turmoil in the financial, political, or industrial arenas thanks to support from public funds. And while heavy-handed management may increase the inefficiency of the market, investors may find comfort in some sectors. The revival of the US economy could lift high-technology issues, especially in semiconductor-related sectors. Early buyers have already started to move into electricals and semiconductor equipment makers. Other investors may see value in public works-related stocks, such as regional contractors, roadmakers and sewage diggers which are likely to be beneficiaries of the government's fiscal public works programme.</p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOOD NEWS ON ECONOMY SENDS DOW UP 4.75  </P> <P> The stock market finished slightly higher Tuesday after a strong rally fizzled  in the final hour of trading.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials ended with a gain of 4.75 points at  2,663.94 after climbing more than 21 points during the session. On Monday, the  blue chip indicator dropped 22.42 points.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 5 to 3 in  nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 740 issues  up, 634 down and 556 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume was 158.35 million shares, up from 121.13 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in  those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled  183.925 million shares.  </P> <P> The market opened broadly higher, aided by a sharp run-up in Japan's stock  market overnight and an unexpectedly strong U.S. government report on durable  goods.  </P> <P> The market had recouped most of its losses from Monday, with the Dow Jones  industrial index up more than 21 points at one point in the session, before a  sharp pullback in the final hour of trading.  </P> <P> "I can't tell you why it sold off," said Philip Roth, with Shearson Lehman  Hutton Inc. "I don't know of any news. The market's technical position for a  rally was weak. Stocks were rallying on poor volume and it was destined to fade  anyway."  </P> <P> Computerized trading strategies and buying by big institutions in the final  week of the third quarter helped buoy prices during much of the session,  traders said.  </P> <P> Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Columbia Pictures lost 1/8 to 26 1/4,  USAir dipped 5/8 to 46 1/4 and Exxon fell 1/4 to 44 1/2.  </P> <P> Paramount Communications rose 1 1/2 to 56 1/4, MCA advanced 2 to 65 5/8 and  Orion Pictures added 5/8 to 22 3/4. IBM gained 1 1/4 to 117 1/2 and General  Motors advanced 1 1/8 to 48 1/4. Spain Fund showed the biggest advance, gaining  12 to 38 3/4.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, share prices advanced broadly, pushing the Nikkei index up to a  record high in active trading. The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues  climbed 484.11 points to 35,444.82. The previous record, set Aug. 21, was  35,140.83.  </P> <P> Shares fell sharply in moderate trading in London after the publication of  worse-than-expected trade figures for August. The country's current account  deficit was $3.20 billion, the third worst on record.  </P> <P> The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 23.5 points lower  at 2,336.1.  </P> <P> Credit  </P> <P> Bond prices recovered from a steep decline the day before, as a large auction  of Treasury notes was absorbed more smoothly than had been expected, analysts  said.  </P> <P> The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond rose about 1/2 point, or $5 for  every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which falls when prices rise, dropped to  8.23% from 8.28% late Monday.  </P> <P> Bond prices fell sharply Monday after central banks attacked the dollar. The  30-year bond had lost more than a point, its biggest daily decline since  mid-August.  </P> <P> Finance officials from the most powerful industrial nations sold dollars from  their reserves on Monday and Tuesday, following up their agreement over the  weekend that the U.S. currency should not rise from current levels. The dollar  dropped sharply as a result.  </P> <P> Average yields on the notes rose to 8.39%, the highest level since May.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term government  issues were 1/16 point lower to 5/32 point higher, intermediate maturities  advanced 7/32 point to 1/2 point, and long-term issues rose 1/2 point,  according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial information  service.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.01% as the discount jumped 5  basis points to 7.76%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.23% as the discount  gained 3 basis points at 7.81%. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.31% as the  discount slipped 1 basis point to 7.72%.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted late in the day at 9%, down from 9.50% late Monday.  </P> <P> Commodities  </P> <P> A forecast of ideal harvest weather sent some grain futures prices lower, but  the selloff helped to bolster cattle prices.  </P> <P> Wheat futures prices moved higher, while soybeans prices tumbled and corn  futures were mostly lower on the Chicago Board of Trade. Analysts said the  outlook for perfect harvest weather in U.S. growing areas depressed corn and  soybeans.  </P> <P> On other markets, feeder cattle prices rose, live hogs gained, precious metals  fell and energy prices were mixed.  </P> <P> Jon Horton, an analyst for Research Department Inc. in Chicago, said a lack of  any real export demand for soybeans was weighing on futures prices.  </P> <P> Wheat prices, however, were supported by an announcement Monday by the U.S.  Agriculture Department of a sale to China of 300,000 metric tons and  anticipation of more export business this week, traders said.  </P> <P> Activity in the corn pit was light as traders awaited a USDA grain report  Thursday, said analyst Susan Leighty of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New  York.  </P> <P> Wheat settled 2 1/4 cents to 4 1/4 cents higher, with December at $3.94 1/4 a  bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to 3/4 cent higher, with December at $2.29 3/4 a  bushel; oats were 1 1/2 cents to 2 cents higher, with December at $1.43 1/2 a  bushel; and soybeans were 1 cent to 6 1/4 cents lower, with November at $5.66  1/4 a bushel.  </P> <P> At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, futures prices for live cattle soared,  while feeder cattle prices were higher and pork complex futures were mixed.  </P> <P> Live cattle futures rallied on higher cash prices in Texas and Kansas, analysts  said.  </P> <P> Futures prices for precious metals fell on the Commodity Exchange in New York.  </P></p>

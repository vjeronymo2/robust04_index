			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> CITY DEBATES FATE OF 'PEOPLE'S PARK'  </P> <P> Almost four months after voters decided Newport Beach should not sell a plot of  land dubbed "People's Park," city officials are still considering what to do  with it.  </P> <P> The debate over the fate of the 30-by-100-foot lot at 4210 River Ave. continued  at a recent City Council meeting.  </P> <P> Park neighbors who have planted trees on the lot and maintain it as a mini-park  are asking the city to rezone the land to ensure it is kept open for  recreational use, said Irene Butler, assistant city clerk.  </P> <P> However, the council voted unanimously to review all potential uses for the  lot, including the possibility of building affordable housing on the site,  Butler said.  </P> <P> On Feb. 12, the city's Parks, Beaches and Recreation Department advised the  City Council that the lot is not needed as part of the city's park system and  recommended that the current R-2 zoning be maintained.

			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Wapping plant may face industrial action LEADERS OF the EETPU electricians' union are likely this week to order a ballot that might lead to the first significant industrial dispute at News International's Wapping plant since it was set up five years ago. The union said that about 300 members in Wapping had requested the industrial-action ballot at the weekend after the company's announcement of 185 redundancies - about 130 at Wapping and the rest at plants in Glasgow and near Liverpool. Union members, who are among 1,500 production workers employed in the UK by News International, are angry at the company's decision to put production workers on a five-day week or nine-day fortnight, against the present four-day week. News International said yesterday it was increasing salaries by 7 per cent to compensate for the changes, taking minimum salaries for pressroom workers to Pounds 27,000. Mr Bob Shannon, EETPU national officer, said that about 40 Wapping workers had joined the union at the weekend. The union's main aim was to get the company to agree to talks. Although it claims membership of about 60 per cent, it does not enjoy collective bargaining rights.</p>

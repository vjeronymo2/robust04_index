Kyrgyzstan "sees no imperial ambitions in Russian actions  and  does not feel any pressure from Moscow", he told a press  conference after meeting Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  on Tuesday and added that he intends to use every effort to  strengthen the provisions fixed in the Russian-Kyrgyz friendship  treaty.    Akayev also stressed that he would do everything possible so  that nealy a million of Russian ethnics living in Kyrgyzstan "do  not feel any inconveniences" and that the Central Asian republic  "remains good motherland for all citizens of the country,  including Russians".    Kozyrev, in his turn, said the Russian leadership supports  democratic Kyrgyzstan and will render any necessary assistance  to President Akayev.    The minister added that the protection of the rights of  Russians in CIS countries has nothing in common with imperial  ambitions. Human rights protection has nothing in common with  "imperial policy as Russia respected and respects sovereign  rights of its equal partners", Kozyrev said.    He handed over to Akayev a message from Boris Yeltsin in  which the Russian president pledged support to market reforms  and democratic transformations of Kyrgyz authorities.    Akayev and Kozyrev signed a consular convention and a  protocol on the exchange of ratification credentials to the  treaty "on legal assistance and legal relations in civil, family  and criminal cases".    Kozyrev, who is accompanied by Deputy Defence Minister Boris  Gromov, left for the city of Blagoveshchensk on the border with  China from where he will proceed for a visit to the neighbouring  country.</p>

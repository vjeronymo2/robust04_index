			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Fighting flares in Somalia Heavy fighting between rival clan forces erupted in Somalia's breakaway north-western capital of Hargeisa, forcing relief workers and hundreds of civilians to flee, foreign aid officials said yesterday. Some 20 relief workers from the United Nations and other agencies had abandoned the town where fighting raged on Tuesday. The workers were attempting to leave by road to Burama, about 160km west, the officials said by satellite telephone from Hargeisa. Witnesses described scenes of mayhem as hundreds of civilians fled on foot through the streets of the war-damaged city as the rival clans duelled with mortars, anti-aircraft guns and small arms fire. The number of casualties is not yet clear. The fighting was between Habr Awal clan militias loyal to Mr Mohammed Ibrahim Egal, the 'president' of the breakaway republic of Somaliland, and Habr Yunis militias loyal to the north-western region's former ruler, Mr Abdurahman Ahmed Ali 'Tur'. North-western Somalia was devastated by a civil war which erupted in 1988 and spread to the southern capital of Mogadishu.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Boost for NZ debt rating Moody's Investors Service has upgraded New Zealand's foreign currency debt rating to AA2 from AA3, Reuter reports from New York. About USDollars 7.8bn (Pounds 5.2bn) of long-term debt is affected. Not only had New Zealand's foreign currency debt/exports ratio been declining rapidly, but this ratio was expected to continue falling over the next several years, Moody's said. It also expected New Zealand's current account and government budget deficit to move into surplus. It seemed almost certain that important political realignments would occur within New Zealand as a result of the adoption of a 'mixed member proportional' electoral system (MMP), but these should continue to reflect the underlying support for the overall reform process. New Zealand should hold a referendum on abandoning the British crown as head of state, Prime Minister Jim Bolger said in Blenheim yesterday, AP reports. He wants the country to become a republic by the year 2000.</p>

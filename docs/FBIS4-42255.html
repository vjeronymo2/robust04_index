			<p>BFN     [Text] The Greek Cypriots are continuing their border  provocations and shooting incidents. The Greek Cypriot National  Guardsmen fired 12 shots, in twos or threes, towards the Turkish  Cypriot side in the Lefke [Lefka] [word indistinct] region at  2045 today. No one was killed or injured by the shots, which  were probably fired from automatic weapons. Soldiers attached  to the Security Forces Command acted with a cool head and did  not respond to the provocations, preventing the incident from  escalating any further.    Turkish Cypriot authorities lodged a protest about the  incident with the UN Peace Forces. The Greek Cypriots fired  shots on the Turkish Cypriot borders on three different  occasions in the past week.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zilvinas Pekarskas: "No Kidding With Blood"] </F>   [Excerpts] On Wednesday [2 December], the Lithuanian AIDS  Center held a press conference devoted to the AIDS World Day --  1 December. A man infected with the AIDS virus appeared before  the public for the first time in Lithuania. [passage omitted]    AIDS Center Director S. Caplinskas said that the slogan of  this year's AIDS World Day -- "Time for Action" is slightly  ironic, because the world learned about the epidemic 10 years  ago. Nevertheless, the director urged the nation to rally its  forces at least now in order to change its behavior.    L. Stribinskiene, chief of the AIDS Center laboratory,  familiarized the audience with the recent story of AIDS-infected  donor blood in Germany. [passage omitted]    By the way, Lithuania began to test the blood of its donors  with perfect "Abbott" systems only a year ago. TIESA's readers  may remember the scandal when the virus of jaundice  (fortunately, not the AIDS virus) was found in the blood of  almost all donors in Vilnius.    According to S. Caplinskas, the blood of Lithuanian donors  is  now being tested with the most reliable systems.    S. Caplinskas presented the following statistics: Of 19 AIDS  carriers identified in Lithuania, one is a woman, 14 are men who  have had homosexual contacts, and 10 persons have families with  13 children. The wife of one infected man is expecting a child.  No member of the carriers' families have caught the AIDS virus.  The age of the patients ranges from 19 to 40 years. There are  only two persons with unfinished higher education, six of the  patients are serious businessmen, and one is a representative of  bohemian circles.</p>

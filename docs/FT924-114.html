			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Women to the fore in new honours list WOMEN have a higher-than-usual profile in the New Year Honours list published today. Six dames are created and two of the weightier political honours go to Mrs Shirley Williams, the former Labour cabinet minister and a founder-member of the Social Democratic party, and Baroness Blatch, the education minister. Mrs Williams is the only life peer created this time. In other respects, the list - the last before Mr John Major's review of the honours system takes effect - is traditional in its mix of politicians and people from business, the arts and sport. However, the prime minister is said to have put particular emphasis on charity work as well as other achievements. Mr Duncan Nichol, chief executive of the National Health Service management executive, and Mr Robert Balchin, chairman of the grant-maintained schools foundation, become knights in recognition of their contribution to the government's reforms in health and education. Among the business figures honoured are five knights: Mr John Keswick, chairman of Hambros bank; Mr Robert Clarke, chairman of United Biscuits; Mr Christopher Lewinton, chairman and chief executive of TI group, the aerospace, seals and tubes group; Mr Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman and chief executive of Kingfisher, the retail group; and Mr Paul Nicholson, chairman of Vaux group, the Sunderland-based brewer and hotels operator. In the diplomatic honours list, Mr William Purves, chairman of HSBC Holdings, parent of Hongkong Bank and Midland, becomes a knight for public and commercial services in Hong Kong. Baroness Blatch is the only member of the government to become a privy counsellor, although three senior Tory backbenchers are similarly honoured. They include Sir Peter Hordern, seen by many at Westminster as the most able Tory MP never to have been a minister, and Sir John Wheeler, formerly chairman of the cross-party home affairs committee. Mr Cranley Onslow, who lost the chairmanship of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers, is knighted, as is Mr Terence Higgins, formerly chairman of the cross-party Treasury committee. Mr Roger Moate and Mr Jerry Wiggin, long-serving but not invariably loyal Tory backbenchers, also become knights. Mr David Frost, the broadcaster, becomes a knight and, in the arts world, so do Mr Malcolm Arnold, the composer, and Mr Anthony Hopkins, the actor. Novelist Catherine Cookson becomes a dame and the writer Sir Victor Pritchett becomes a companion of honour. Mr Jimmy Young, Mrs Thatcher's favourite interviewer, whose radio programme celebrates 20 years next year, becomes a CBE, as does Mr Frank Barlow, managing director of Pearson, which owns the Financial Times.

			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Bush fails to win Japanese over: The president has stirred anti-US feelings PRESIDENT George Bush has left many Japanese disappointed with the conduct of his visit, which ended yesterday. While Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, and his officials proclaimed the visit a success, the Japanese press, at least, have judged differently. Newspaper commentaries said the president had insulted Japan by raising petty trade issues at a summit. There was also little reluctance to hit back and criticise the US president and his country. Both governments will be disturbed to see that, for some Japanese at least, the visit seems to have aggravated latent anti-American sentiments. Though most Japanese are embarrassed by the more extreme instances of kenbei (hatred of the US), many have been struck by the president's failure to win much popular support during his visit. There was sympathy for Mr Bush when he fell ill. There was also admiration for the president's quick recovery and the brave way in which Mrs Barbara Bush made light of her husband's illness and blamed it on his losing a game of tennis with the Emperor. But this paled in comparison with anger at US officials' willingness to attack Japanese economic policies and paying too little attention to problems in their own backyard. A cartoon in the Yomiuri newspaper showed the president dressed as a cowboy sitting in front of his wagon, with a re-election slogan on his hat. However, the wagon is on fire - with Mr Miyazawa running to it carrying a bucket of water. Analysts are dismayed at what they see as the president's crassness in lecturing Japan over its economic management. Mr Takahiro Ota, a columnist with the Asahi newspaper, asked: 'Is there not a single decent individual in the Bush government who truly understands Japan?' But there is also a sense of pride among Japanese that their country came out best in the comparisons made between the US and Japanese motor industries. Perhaps mistakenly, Mr Bush singled out the car industry for special treatment in the trade talks, insisting that Japanese companies increase purchases of US-made cars and parts. Commentators, Japanese and foreign alike, pointed out that US failure to sell cars in Japan was partly its own fault. Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, the vice-minister for international affairs at the ministry for international trade and industry, said these sentiments may have been provoked by the widely-reported criticisms of Japanese trade practices by Mr Lee Iacocca, the Chrysler chairman, and American business leaders who accompanied the president. Since the mid-1980s, Japanese leaders have themselves become increasingly willing to criticise the US. At his joint press conference with Mr Bush on Wednesday, Mr Miyazawa was not shy to name Aids, homelessness and declining educational achievements among America's problems. Such bluntness before an honoured guest would have been unthinkable a few years ago.</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow hit by lower bonds and weak Dollars Wall Street US stock markets turned sour yesterday, retreating in the face of dropping bond prices and fresh instability in the value of the dollar, writes Frank McGurty in New York. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished a volatile session only 15.86 lower at 3,669.64 after pulling back from a 45-point fall in the final hours. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 1.23 at 446.08, but declining issues on the Big Board outscored advances by nearly a two-to-one margin. Volume was a moderate 268m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was off 2.78 at 422.67, but the Nasdaq composite held up better, dipping just 0.63 to 702.05. At the opening, the bearish tone had little to do with the dollar. The US currency was holding fairly steady against the yen and the D-Mark, allowing equity investors to focus on developments elsewhere. To the regret of the bulls, bonds caught the most attention. The Treasury market, putting aside currency concerns, was disturbed instead by two signs that the economy was not cooling in response to a tighter monetary policy. In the first, the Commerce Department said sales of new homes had risen by 4.2 per cent, rebounding crisply from an April decline. In the second, the Conference Board said consumer confidence was much higher than economists had expected. Inflationary fears, which had been suppressed briefly during the recent currency crisis, resurfaced with the release of the data. With the Federal Reserve's policy-making arm scheduled to meet next week, the timing of its next move to lift rates again began to cast a shadow over the market's thinking. The effect was to drive down share prices across the board in early trading. But the damage grew more pronounced near midday, when the dollar again began to flirt with the Y100 level. The blue chip Dow index widened its loss, led by stocks which were most vulnerable to a fifth Fed strike on interest rates. Later, the market attempted to rally but there was too much ground to retrace. Caterpillar slipped Dollars 1 to Dollars 104 1/8 as its share price continued to be buffeted by the implications of strike action by production workers. Alcoa shed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 72 1/8 and General Motors Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 50 7/8 . Financial issues, which moved in parallel with rising bond prices on Monday, again mirrored the trend in Treasuries. JP Morgan shed Dollars 1 to Dollars 62 1/2 , First Chicago gave back Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 47 7/8 and Wells Fargo was off Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 154. Shares in Corning were marked up 6 per cent, or Dollars 1 7/8 , to Dollars 33 1/8 . The glass maker's second-quarter net income of 54 cents a share beat the consensus forecast by 3 cents. With technology stocks stable, the Nasdaq was able to outperform the other leading indices. One of its best-performing issues was St Jude Medical, a leading supplier of artificial heart valves. The stock jumped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 30 3/4 on news that the company had agreed to acquire the cardiac-pacing device businesses of Siemens for Dollars 500m. Canada Toronto recovered from sharp losses seen earlier in the session to end just slightly easier after moderate trading. The TSE 300 index was off a net 6.8 points at 3,996.8. Falls led rises by 401 to 317 and volume was 52.9m shares. Transportation and gold stocks posted the day's largest falls of 1.97 and 1.28 per cent respectively, but the banking sector rose 1.44 per cent. Brazil Sao Paulo closed 5.7 per cent higher in local currency terms after investors followed through on Monday's 8.4 per cent gain. The Bovespa index rose 1,914 to 35,635 Local investors were showing confidence over the July 1 arrival of Brazil's new currency, the real. However, trading was thin, with foreign investors still concerned about the prospects for Brazil's forthcoming elections. Venezuela Caracas fell sharply following President Rafael Caldera's announcement of foreign exchange and price controls, with the Merinvest composite index down 8.62, or 6 per cent, to 137.08. Volume was low at about 2.6m shares, mainly because foreign investors were barred from trading until the new currency exchange system comes into effect next Monday. Electricidad de Caracas fell 29.30 bolivars to 335.75 bolivars.</p>

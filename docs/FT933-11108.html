			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Good US buying lifts ICI CHEMICALS giant ICI outperformed even yesterday's strong stock market as it unveiled its first set of results since its demerger. US buying was again in evidence as it was announced that American investors now speak for nearly 15 per cent of the group's stock, up from 3.5 per cent at the time of the break-up two months ago. The shares added 16 at 666p in turnover of 8.2m. The reaction among London analysts was mixed, with the balance of opinion believing the shares to be fully valued, although still a good longer term purchase. The solid set of results were boosted by exchange rate moves, although analysts said they were pleased at the margin growth from cost-saving measures. The company warned that generic growth would be hampered by the economic downturn in many of its overseas markets. Most analysts were moving their profits forecasts up to the Pounds 300m level following the results. However, James Capel remained a seller, arguing that the stock was probably around 10 per cent overvalued. Kleinwort Benson was positive but 'not chasing the stock at these levels', while Smith New Court said it retained its 'buy' recommendation.</p>

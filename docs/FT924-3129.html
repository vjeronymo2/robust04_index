			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / International Company News: Increase in sales helps Heinz advance to Dollars 154m H. J. HEINZ, the food group based in Pittsburgh, yesterday reported after-tax profits of Dollars 154.2m in the three months to October 28 - the second quarter of its financial year. The result compares with a Dollars 122.8m in the same period of 1991, and was scored on sales which rose from Dollars 1.59bn to Dollars 1.74bn. Operating profits improved by 15 per cent, year-on-year, to Dollars 261.6m. At the earnings per share level, the result translates into 60 cents, compared with 46 cents a year ago. Heinz said that the gains in sales and operating profits were due largely to an overall volume improvement of 7 per cent and to favourable exchange rate movements. It added that the volume advance had come in all US affiliates and in certain overseas markets, including the UK. 'Volume gains were noted in Weight Watchers brand food products, pet food, tuna, baby food, beans and ketchup,' it said. Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman, claimed that some of the moves taken by the company in 1991, which included restructuring action designed to cut costs, lay behind the improvement. 'A record number of new products will be introduced this fiscal year with full marketing support,' he added. The company has been the target of criticism recently, with commentators questioning whether it can match its impressive performance during the 1980s, particularly since it is operating in some of the most competitive areas of the food industry. Yesterday, however, the second-quarter figures helped the shares up Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 43 7/8 . After-tax profits for the first six months now stand at Dollars 298m, against Dollars 377.2m a year ago - although the 1991 figure included Dollars 221.4m from the sale of a subsidiary.</p>

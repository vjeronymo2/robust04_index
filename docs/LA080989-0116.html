			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'MONSTER' BAILOUT FOR S&amp;LS SIGNED BY BUSH;  </P> <P> STEPS TO DEAL WITH FAILING THRIFTS TAKEN SHORTLY AFTER CEREMONY IN ROSE GARDEN  </P> <P> President Bush, saying, "I'm proud to sign this monster," today put his  signature on sweeping legislation to rescue the nation's troubled savings and  loan industry and put a $50-billion bailout into effect.  </P> <P> Architects of the nearly foot-high bill, which authorizes $50 billion in new  government borrowing over the next 26 months, attended the Rose Garden  ceremony.  </P> <P> The bill also imposes tough new standards on savings and loan institutions and  triggers the most sweeping overhaul of the regulatory bureaucracy in 50 years.  </P> <P> Along with the late-morning signing of the measure, Bush was ordering his  Administration to gear up to close or merge hundreds of failed institutions.  The first meeting of a new board to oversee their holdings was called  immediately after the ceremony.  </P> <P> Bush said the measure, which received final congressional approval Saturday,  "says to tens of millions of savings and loan depositors: You will not be the  victims of others' mistakes."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Safeguard and Stabilize'  </P> <P> Among the 300 people at the signing ceremony were Treasury Secretary Nicholas  F. Brady, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp and key Capitol  Hill sponsors, including Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) and Rep. Henry B.  Gonzalez (D-Tex.), chairmen of the congressional banking committees.  </P> <P> "This legislation comes to grips with the problems facing our savings and loan  industry. It will safeguard and stabilize America's financial system," Bush  declared.  </P> <P> He called the measure, a variation on a bailout plan that he submitted to  Congress on Feb. 6, "historic legislation."  </P> <P> "It is responsive and responsible. And for that, I salute the Congress," the  President said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bad Loans, Repossessions  </P> <P> Immediately after the signing ceremony, Brady conducted the first meeting of  the board overseeing the Resolution Trust Corp. The RTC was created to manage  the sale of sour loans and repossessed real estate the government is inheriting  from ailing savings and loans.  </P> <P> The RTC board, whose members also include Kemp and Federal Reserve Chairman  Alan Greenspan, will approve operating policies for the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corp., the agency charged with managing the bailout.  </P> <P> The FDIC has already taken over 262 failed thrifts, and the first deals to wipe  out their losses and put them in the hands of new owners could come as early as  this week.  </P> <P> Earlier, the Treasury Department announced plans to borrow the first $5-billion  installment of the bailout Thursday and said it intends to raise an additional  $15 billion within eight weeks.  </P></p>

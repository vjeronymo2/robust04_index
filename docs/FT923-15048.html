			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Delors says he is EC scapegoat: UK's budget rebate under threat, warns Commission president MR JACQUES DELORS last night protested at the way he had been blamed for the problems surrounding the Maastricht treaty and professed confidence that the treaty's goals would be achieved on schedule. In an interview with the Financial Times, the European Commission president said: 'I have become a scapegoat now. But when everything works people forget about me.' Mr Delors predicted that the 12 EC states would only be able to reach agreement on future Community financing on the basis of his compromise plan. He strongly pressed the case for a large increase in aid for poorer EC countries to boost growth and help avoid a 'deflationary' run-up to monetary union by the end of the decade. This was one of two key elements in his compromise, which would have let richer states stretch out a 30 per cent increase in overall contributions to the EC budget over a longer period, provided they fulfilled their particular commitment to the less well-off countries. The absence of this commitment at the Lisbon summit sparked anger from Spain and led Mr Delors to withdraw his compromise. Although Mr Delors said his proposals at Lisbon were not final, he said he saw little alternative to the next summit in Edinburgh in December agreeing a deal along these lines. 'I don't see how it (a deal) can be done otherwise.' In a move likely to discomfit Britain, Mr Delors said the Commission would publish proposals this month on revising the UK budget rebate, which London has clung to ever since it was agreed in 1984. He said the German government, under its own budgetary pressures, insisted that he should no longer delay plans to revise the scheme by which Britain gets Pounds 2bn a year back on its EC contribution. He said the Community needed the resources to match its ambitions, including the desire for a more active external policy. 'If one accepts our proposals, the EC budget would represent in 1997-99 a maximum of 3 per cent of all public spending in the Community. Is this unreasonable, in a Community which will then have a single currency, macro-economic co-ordination and a common foreign and security policy, even if that progresses slowly?' He suggested that Britain was unlikely to succeed in its efforts to bring the planned European central bank to London. In Lisbon, he said, the Community had lost 'a good moment' to decide the sites of its institutions when Britain prevented agreement on the central bank going to Bonn. In the overall understanding on monetary union, there was 'a balance' between the Germans accepting a date for the start of Emu and their need for 'assurance' on the central bank site. He voiced his confidence that a single currency would come into being by 1999. But he warned that slow growth across the Community was, by depressing budget revenue, jeopardising countries' chances of reaching the Emu criteria for fiscal deficits. Growth of more than 2 per cent was necessary, he said.</p>

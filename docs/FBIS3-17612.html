Nine hundred and nine thousand voters took part in the  elections to the Supreme Council of Ukraine. However, Mr.  Alsufyev stressed that this was the number of those who received  ballot papers and not those who had dropped them into the ballot  boxes.    According to the personal observation of the Crimean Central  Electoral Commission, the recommendation by President Meshkov  for Crimea not to vote in the elections to the Ukrainian Supreme  Council but to take the ballot papers home, was being partially  carried out at polling stations.    The elections to the Supreme Council of Crimea in  multi-member national constituencies have taken place. By 1600  71.2 percent had voted in the Crimean Tatar constituency; 63.5  percent in the Armenian constituency; 45.6 percent in the  Bulgarian constituency; 57.5 percent in the Greek constituency,  and 57.9 percent in the German constituency. According to  information from the Central Electoral Commission, elections to  the Supreme Council of Crimea had taken place practically in all  rural constituencies. Viktor Alsufyev said that there had been  no information about significant violations that could have  influenced the course of the elections.</p>

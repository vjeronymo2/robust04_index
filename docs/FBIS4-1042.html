			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Burundi's national judiciary system seems to be  recovering from a state of lethargy since last October's events  and various aftereffects. Two commissions have just been set up  to prepare the different cases in connection with the aborted  coup which cost life of President Melchior Ndadaye and some of  his close aides, as well as the bloody killings that followed  it. Raphael (Njenguye) elaborates:    [(Njenguye)] According to an article from the local daily,  that is, Tuesday 19th [April], the first commission will have to  try to identify and take action against the putschists and  murderers of the late head of state and his close aides. The  second type of commission is at the provincial level. It will  have to inquire into the political and ethnic massacres which  followed the aborted coup of last October. [passage omitted]    The commission will be back in New York by next week and  will  draft a report to be submitted to UN Secretary general who will  give it the appropriate response.</p>

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 1. Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rule 104.13 requires that transactions effected in speciality stocks for the accounts of specified persons affiliated with or related to a specialist must be for investment purposes and executed in accordance with certain restrictions relating to the price at which transactions may take place, known as ``tick'' restrictions. The accounts specified in the rule include accounts of employees or parties active in the business of the specialist, the spouse or children residing in the same household as a specialist or persons active in the specialist business, and any approved person (individual or entity in a control relationship) of the specialist, other than an approved person entitled to an exemption pursuant to Exchange Rule 98. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> NYSE Rule 98 and its Guidelines provide exemptions from various Exchange rules affecting approved persons affiliated with specialists, including Rule 104.13. The exemption is predicated on the existence of procedures to achieve a functional separation between the specialist organization and the approved person. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Exchange believes it is appropriate to amend Rule 104.13 to make it clear that the investment account transaction requirements contained in the rule apply to transactions effected ``for the benefit of'' the parties specified in the rule, rather than simply to transactions effected for the ``account'' of such parties. This would apply, for example, to situations where transactions may not be effected directly for the ``account'' of one of the parties specified in the rule, but may be effected for an account in which one of these specified parties has a beneficial interest. The rule would also make it clear that specialists, and persons associated with specialists, may not originate orders in specialty stocks for any accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

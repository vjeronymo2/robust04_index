			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Bank accepts inflation risk The Treasury and Bank of England have accepted, when deciding yesterday's 1/4 -point cut in interest rates, that there is a risk that inflation could start to gather pace again, the Bank's latest inflation report makes clear. The report forecasts a slight rise in underlying inflation - as measured by the retail prices index minus mortgage interest payments - throughout this year from 2.7 per cent in December. But the Bank's 'central projection' is that RPIX, as the underlying rate is known, will be just more than 3 per cent by the end of next year, and so within the government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range. Both RPIX and the 'headline' retail prices index are set to rise in the coming months as the indirect taxes announced in last year's two Budgets come into effect and earlier mortgage interest rate cuts drop out of the 12-month comparison. In the next two months the gap between RPIX and headline RPI, which was 1.9 per cent in December, will largely disappear. The report acknowledges that recent inflation figures have been better than expected and this observation provides the intellectual underpinning for yesterday's rate cut. It notes, however, that the projected path of RPIX to the end of 1995 keeps inflation in the upper half of the government's target range and that the risks to this projection are 'asymmetric' in the sense that a rise in underlying inflation is more likely than a further fall. It is no surprise that the Bank favours a refined version of the underlying inflation measure, which excludes local authority and indirect taxes as well as mortgage payments, which it calls RPIY. This has fallen sharply in recent months, and at 2.3 per cent is in the lower part of the government's target range. Some of the recent decline in RPIY has reflected a one-off fall in supermarket food prices. The Bank expects this measure to stabilise around 2.5 per cent from the first half of this year. Its hope is that people will focus on RPIY. But it notes that inflationary expections, particularly among wage bargainers, are above the rates of inflation that have recently been achieved. The Bank says: 'Keeping inflation low and getting it into the lower half of its target range depends on an adjustment of expectations to a low-inflation world.' Ultimately, progress to higher levels of output and employment depends on how far 'everyone involved in decisions on saving and investment and on wages and prices' is convinced that inflation will be kept down. The Bank admits that it is difficult to gauge the strength of the present UK recovery and that judgments on the state of the economy are unusually uncertain. In particular, the Bank is concerned that wages may yet rise in response to the fall in take-home pay caused by planned tax increases and pose a risk to the present combination of continuing output growth and low inflation.

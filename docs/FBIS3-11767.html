[Begin Carreras recording] At the Bay of Pigs, that small  air  force made a significant contribution to victory. I believe that  the DAAFAR in Angola proved that those young people have  demonstrated in the field, in reality, during operations and all  the difficult moments we faced there, the great competency of  our DAAFAR forces. [end recording]    Other issues discussed at the meeting were the efforts made  by our Air Force during the search for Commander Camilo  Cienfuegos, as well as Bay of Pigs operations and the 5  September 1957 events.    The meeting was held to commemorate the 50th anniversary of  the graduation from pilot school of Division General Enrique  Carreras, Hero of the Republic of Cuba.</p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROSE SIMPLY BETTING HE'LL BE REINSTATED; PUBLIC DESERVES MORE  </P> <P> Ross Newhan reminds us that his hands are tied because on baseball's Hall of  Fame ballot, it says that "character and integrity" must be taken into account  also.  </P> <P> Another sports reporter from the New York Times indicated that "character and  integrity" applied to the player on the field and not off the field. I happen  to agree. All of a sudden, performance takes a back seat.  </P> <P> Rather than sit back and condemn Pete Rose, we should truly feel sorry for him.  He may very well be a victim of circumstances. He needs our sympathy rather  than our condemnation.  </P> <P> BENNY WASSERMAN  </P> <P> La Palma  </P></p>

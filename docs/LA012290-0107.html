			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CARBIDE SINKS ON INDIA ACTION  </P> <P> Union Carbide Corp.'s stock dropped in heavy midday trading today after the  newly elected Indian government said it will review the company's $470-million  settlement with victims of the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster.  </P> <P> In midday trading, Union Carbide fell $1.625 to $20.875 and was the second  most-active issue on the New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> Traders and industry analysts noted that the drop in Union Carbide's share  price was also aided by the current cyclic downturn of the domestic chemicals  business.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Union Carbide, Bob Berzok, said he had nothing to add to an  earlier statement on the case by the chemical company's vice president, Joseph  Geogan.  </P> <P> The statement said, "We are confident the settlement will stand. There is  simply no basis for overturning it."  </P></p>

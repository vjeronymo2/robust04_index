			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Trustees must face ICI portfolio headache - An important decision looms following ICI's demerger plan TRUSTEES with ICI shares in their portfolio should meet well before June to decide what to do with them if they are to avoid possible action for breach of trust. The problem stems from a case decided by the Privy Council in 1930 which says that a company which is not in liquidation cannot make a 'capital' distribution to its shareholders except as a step in an authorised reduction of capital. The planned demerger of ICI in June is neither a liquidation nor an authorised reduction of capital. It will be effected by ICI declaring a huge dividend out of distributable profits, which it will satisfy by allocating shares in Zeneca Limited. These shares will then, because of the Privy Council case, be treated as 'income' in the hands of the trustees. The majority of trusts in the UK - apart from accumulation and maintenance trusts set up for children under the age of 25 - do not give their controllers power to accumulate income because the tax regime on them is prejudicial. The trustees must, therefore, pay income to the beneficiary - known as the the life tenant - as it arises. So, if the trustees add the Zeneca shares to their portfolio, they will be depriving the life tenant - for example, a widow - of her 'income' and will be in breach of trust. (If they add the shares with the life tenant's consent, the trustees may not be sued - but the life tenant will have created a new settlement of these shares which could have unexpected tax consequences and create administrative headaches). The alternative is to distribute the Zeneca shares to the life tenant. This also could land the trustees in trouble. Without a specific instruction in the trust deed, trustees have a common-law obligation to make investments so that the life tenant gets a 'reasonable' income while, at the same time, preserving the capital for those entitled to it after the life tenant's death. They also have a statutory obligation to take into account the circumstances of the beneficiaries when making, changing or retaining investments. Therefore, if the trust portfolio were diminished substantially because the trustees had paid out the Zeneca shares to the life tenant, the remainderman might be able to sue the trustees for breach of their common law and statutory obligations. It is also a moot point as to whether demergers such as the ICI split would be treated by the courts as an exception to the 1930 Privy Council case, in which event all trustees who distributed the Zeneca shares would be in breach of trust because they would have distributed capital. There are also tax problems with distributing the Zeneca shares. The life tenant, although he might not be liable to income tax on them, might have to pay capital gains tax on the entire proceeds when he came to sell the shares and would not be entitled to any future indexation because the Inland Revenue believed the base of the shares would be nil. The position is somewhat more straightforward for trustees of children's accumulation and maintenance trusts or discretionary trusts where there is power to accumulate the income. In these cases, the trustees should add the Zeneca shares to the existing trust portfolio and will suffer no adverse tax consequences. But not all discretionary trusts have power to accumulate the income, in which case the Zeneca shares must be distributed and the nightmare reappears - but worse. The tax position of trusts where there is no life tenant (discretionary trusts) is very different. On the distribution of the Zeneca shares from a discretionary trust, their value must be grossed-up to pay tax at 35 per cent. In addition, the trustees will have to pay CGT on any gain made on the shares - unless an election is made to hold over the chargeable gain until the beneficiary disposes of them. The discretionary beneficiary might be pleased to receive his windfall distribution, but he will not thank his trustees for the tax charges. So, what should the beleaguered trustee do, assuming he does not wish to incur the expense of going to the court for direction? Even selling the shares is not without its problems. First, he must sell before the dividend is declared and the demerger occurs or it will be too late. Second, the sale could result in an unwanted CGT charge in the trust. But if he sells, and provided he sells in time, at least he should be protected from claims by his beneficiaries. Representations have been flooding in to the Lord Chancellor's office for a change in trust law. Despite the urgency and seriousness of the problems, however, there does not seem to be any prospect of action before the ICI split in June.

			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Russia begins to choose between Union and empire 'Russia faces a choice: that between the recreation of a Union, and the imposition of an empire,' according to Mr Sergei Karaganov, influential deputy head of the European Institute think-tank and presidential adviser on foreign relations. Mr Karaganov was co-chairing a conference outside Moscow last Friday on Russia's place in the world - jointly organised by his institute and the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung, a German think-tank - as leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States struggled in the capital to cope with the broader international role Russia is now according itself. The deliberations of the conference shadowed those of the leaders' summit in eerie counterpoint: as the policy analysts saw a greatly strengthened Russian hegemony over the former Soviet states, so the Russian leadership put flesh on their words. Mr Mark Urnov, one of Russia's leading pollsters and sociological analysts, presented to the conference a range of poll evidence which showed the huge shift in both elite and public opinion in the past three years; from a view in which 'the west was seen as a model, an Eldorado, the centre of civilisation' to one where the majority believed that foreigners had too much influence on Russian policy, and favoured a planned economy over a market one. Mr Alexander Tsipko, one of the country's leading political philosophers, said Russia 'never had a national consciousness: it is uniquely without a national state'. For Mr Tsipko, the destruction of the Soviet Union was also a destruction of a state in which Russians had felt at home: confining Russia within its present borders was to give it an impossibly narrow compass. This is a theme which echoes much of the contemporary political discourse in Moscow The views, voiced by men who are principally seen as moderates, are uncomfortable and were identified as such by the non-Russian participants, including Germans and Poles. In Moscow, the leaders of the other 11 CIS states were dealing with the practical result of this new assertiveness and of their own weakness. Russia has now an agreement - still subject to differing interpretations - with Belarus on complete economic union and has seen Ukraine join the general, and looser, economic union as an associate member. It has also pinned Kiev down to yet another agreement on the division of the Black Sea Fleet, with Russia reportedly taking at least 80 per cent of the hardware (although this too is subject to differing interpretations). And it has agreed with the central Asian and many Caucasian states to put Russian frontier troops on external borders, while having military agreements with nearly all of them. They are committed to developing a tariff-free zone and to forging new links between companies, the latter clearly in the interests of Russia which has by far the largest share of large enterprises. Leadership has its responsibilities. Russia has sought to bring Armenia and Azerbaijan to the negotiating table to solve the Nagorno-Karabakh problem and has won an agreement to put its peacekeepers into Abkhazia. These may draw its troops into vicious and apparently intractable conflicts but will increase Moscow's power and prestige while giving its army something to do. This month's meeting of the CIS could, in retrospect, be seen as the watershed of the organisation: the one when, after 2 1/2 years when its existence was in doubt and when its proceedings drowned in unfulfilled treaties, Russia took control. Mr Karaganov's choice between Union and empire has still to be made but there is now little doubt that the trend is towards one or the other.</p>

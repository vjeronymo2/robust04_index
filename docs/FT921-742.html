			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: Recovery undermined by fragile stability since coup - The discontent in Venezuela Concern over Venezuela's political and military stability in the wake of a frustrated military coup in February has been depressing stock prices. The Caracas Stock Exchange index closed at 28,284.23 on Wednesday, down 17.2 per cent from the year's peak of 34,142.60 on February 3, the day before the coup attempt against the government of President Carlos Andres Perez. While this shows a fall of just 3.5 per cent in the index since the end of 1991, clearly investors were shaken by the frustrated rebellion, the first of its kind in the country since the early 1960s, and by subsequent events. Over the last few weeks, opposition parties have been calling for the resignation of the president. His five-year term is due to finish in February 1994. Along with frequent rumours of another military uprising, there have also been a rash of anti-government protests and two popular demonstrations in which tens of thousands of Caracas residents, calling out from rooftops and balconies, demanded that the president should quit. Mr Perez and the three-year-old economic reform programme he initiated are the main targets of this wave of discontent, but the president has asserted repeatedly that he will not resign. The Caracas stock index fell by more than 9 per cent in the four trading days after the market reopened on February 6, following a two-day closure. Prices then rallied briefly, and it seemed that the market - in dollar terms its stocks grew by 555 per cent in 1990 and by 34.3 per cent in 1991 - was headed for a recovery, at least in local currency terms. However, the brief upswing ended in mid-February, since when the market has continued to slide. The Venezuelan bolivar, which lost 23.1 per cent of its value against the dollar in 1991, has also been hit hard by the general lack of confidence. The currency closed at the end of last year at 61.63 to the dollar, and had fallen 5.5 per cent to 65.00 by March 25. The general declining trend steepened after the putsch. With inflation expected to be between 20 and 30 per cent this year, the bolivar will continue to fall. Large exporters believe it should decline even faster than it has so far this year, asserting that the currency is still somewhat overvalued. All of this is somewhat ironic, since the economy grew by 9.2 per cent in 1991, the biggest rise in Latin America, and expansion of 5 to 6 per cent is expected this year. But aside from a lack of confidence, perhaps the biggest problem for the economy is inflation, which reached 148.2 per cent for the 1989-91 period. Last year inflation dropped to 30.7 per cent, compared with 36.5 per cent in 1990. But government promises to reduce it to 20 per cent by the end of 1992 are viewed sceptically by most businessmen and investors. The government has said that it means to attack inflation with renewed vigour this year, but it is not clear yet how it will proceed in terms of interest rates. One thing is certain: the government will continue to intervene actively on the foreign exchange market, which is dominated by bolivar-dollar trading. Senior officials are worried about the domestic political effect of a bolivar that devalues 'too quickly' this year, and the administration is likely to use its large dollar reserves (Dollars 13.2bn at the end of the 1991 year) to attenuate the devaluation trend. Although the bolivar's exchange rate is supposed to depend on a free float, the government, which controls most of the country's foreign exchange, has traditionally intervened actively on the market.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: PepsiCo to make Dollars 16m expansion in Greece PEPSICO, the US soft drinks maker, is expanding in Greece through the acquisition of Best Foods, a northern Greek manufacturer of snacks, for a reported Dr3.2bn (Dollars 16m). Best Foods, based in Thessaloniki, produces corn curls and other snacks for the local market. Sales this year are projected to rise from Dr1.7bn to Dr2.5bn with profits increasing from Dr80m to Dr250m. The acquisition was made through 7-Up Netherlands, a European subsidiary of PepsiCo. Earlier this year, PepsiCo took control of Tasty Foods, another Greek snack manufacturer, following the merger of the US company's European operations with General Mills. Pepsico entered the Greek market three years ago with the takeover of Ivi, a struggling Athens bottler which produced Pepsi Cola and 7-Up, together with local soft drink brands and mineral water. After cutting losses in 1991 to Dr2.6bn, down from Dr4bn the previous year, PepsiCo-Ivi expects to make a modest profit this year. It plans to invest Dr7bn in the next two years on modernising production and strengthening distribution, notably among the Aegean islands. Although sales are up by around 6 per cent this year, PepsiCo-Ivi's share of the Greek soft drinks market has remained at around 18 per cent. However, Loutraki Water, the company's leading brand, claims to have increased its share of Greece's growing mineral water market to 35 per cent.</p>

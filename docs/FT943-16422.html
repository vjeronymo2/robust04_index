			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Settlers plan to disrupt Arafat return to Jericho Mr Yassir Arafat, the veteran Palestinian leader who made a triumphant homecoming last week, was expected today to fly from Gaza into Jericho, the West Bank town which is the capital of Palestinian self-rule and a vital foothold for Mr Arafat in the West Bank. Jewish settlers, who fought police throughout the weekend in protest at his arrival, were last night making plans to disrupt the visit. Mr Arafat is expected to be brought by helicopter into Jericho. He will swear in the Palestinian National Authority, the cabinet which will run the self-rule areas, and inaugurate a Palestinian broadcasting station. PLO officials said Mr Arafat would return to live in the Gaza Strip from Saturday after attending a farewell ceremony in Tunis which will mark the end of the organisation's 30-year exile from the land it calls Palestine. In between Mr Arafat will meet Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, in Paris tomorrow where he will press for the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and the speedy implementation of the next phase of the peace process: the extension of Palestinian self-rule from Gaza-Jericho across the rest of the West Bank. Frantic preparations were under way in Jericho last night to receive Mr Arafat - or 'The Traveller,' as he is known locally. A street-party atmosphere overtook the central square last night where Mr Arafat will address Palestinians from the West Bank. Palestinian workers were putting the finishing touches to a stage and boys were busy erecting flags, bunting and posters of Mr Arafat emerging phoenix-like from an air crash in the Libyan desert in 1992. Two bullet-proof black Mercedes limousines, which Mr Arafat used to cross from Egypt to Gaza, stood out in the quiet oasis town. Security preparations were also being tightened following threats by Israeli settlers to disrupt the visit. One report said demonstrators planned to seize Orient House, the PLO headquarters in Arab East Jerusalem. Mr Aharon Domb, a settler spokesman, refused to confirm the report but said: 'There will be a range of new protests, all kinds.' Aides said the 65-year-old Mr Arafat, who recovered his voice yesterday after a series of engagements left him speechless, was fit and elated by the welcome Palestinians have given him.</p>

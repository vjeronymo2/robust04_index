Bilateral trade between the two countries, which  stood at 235.4 million ringgit in 1991, had increased to 473  million ringgit in the first nine months of last year. Speaking  at a dinner hosted for the visiting general secretary of the  Communist Party of Vietnam, Mr. Do Muoi, in Kuala lumpur last  night, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said many Malaysian companies had  ventured in Vietnam. As such, the Vietnamese Government should  give consideration to these companies, which should help in its  economic growth, by further awarding them projects. He also  pointed out that Southeast Asian countries should resolve  problems among themselves in a peaceful manner while cooperating  with each other to bring about mutual benefit. Everyone must  realize the dream of a peaceful, stable, and united Southeast  Asian region.</p>

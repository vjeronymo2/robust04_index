			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norwegian production predicted to surge in 1994 NORWAY'S CRUDE oil production is expected to surge by 11 per cent in 1994 to a daily average output of 2.4m barrels, compared with a projected 3 per cent rise in 1993 to 2.2m barrels a day, according to industry and energy ministry forecasts in the 1994 budget, which was unveiled this week. The state's direct share of production is forecast to increase to about 750,000 b/d from 660,000 b/d in 1993. Gas sales, according to the ministry, will rise by some 2bn cubic metres to 28bn cu m in 1994. The rise in crude oil production will be derived principally from five new fields coming on stream, including Sleipner East, Gullfaks West, Tordis and Statfjord East and North satellites. In addition, production from the Draugen, Brage and Snorre fields will rise after their first full year of production. The ministry said that it expected the value of oil and gas exports in 1994 to expand to NKr114bn (Pounds 10,65bn), based on an oil price of NKr120 a barrel, from NKr105bn this year. It based the oil price on an exchange rate of NKr7.10 to the US dollar and a world oil price of USDollars 17 a barrel - within a few cents of the current price on the European spot market - officials disclosed. Norway never officially reveals the dollar exchange rate on which it bases its domestic currency price per barrel of oil. Investments in petroleum activity will be reduced next year to an estimated NKr58bn from NKr62bn in 1993, including exploration costs. Of the total investment, the state will spend about Nkr24.8bn in 1994, mostly unchanged from 1993. In 1993 the Norwegian state ran a deficit of NKr2.9bn on its direct involvement in petroleum activities as investments exceeded income. But it forecast that these activities would yield a positive cash flow of NKr350m in 1994. The country's total income from the petroleum sector was likely to rise to about NKr26.2bn in 1994 from NKr25.1bn this year, the ministry estimated. Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, will see its dividend payment to the state fall in 1994 to NKr900m from NKr1.2bn this year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- The primary opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) submitted a resolution Friday [13  May] demanding the dismissal of the chairman of the House of  Representatives Steering Committee, the crucial committee that  handles Diet affairs.    The Steering Committee's executive members immediately held  a  meeting and decided to hold a vote-taking plenary session of the  lower house next Tuesday on the resolution, political sources  said.    The dismissal of Keiwa Okuda, the committee chairman and a  member of the coalition's core party Shinseito (Japan Renewal  Party) led by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, is virtually certain  because the Social Democratic Party (SDP) is expected to vote  for the resolution, the sources said. The SDP is the second  largest opposition party.    It also appears certain that Okuda's successor will be  picked  from the LDP, they said. The LDP and the SDP have a combined  majority in the 511-member lower house.    "The base on which the current cabinet stands has definitely  altered, the proportion of power of ruling and opposition  parties is reversed. There are no longer any grounds to select  (the chairman) from the ruling parties," the resolution said.    In response, Hata criticized the LDP, saying Okuda has been  giving consideration to the opposition camp. "It (the  resolution) is nothing but tyranny by force of number," he said.    Since Hata was forced to inaugurate his administration on a  minority base last month after the SDP left the coalition, the  LDP, which was ousted from its decades-long dominance last  August, has demanded comprehensive changes in the chairmanships  of the lower chamber's 20 standing committees.    The chairmanship of the Diet Steering Committee, which  handles a no-confidence resolution against the cabinet if it is  submitted, is a key post for the LDP as a step toward managing  Diet affairs.    Political sources speculated that the LDP will put forth a  no- confidence resolution against the Hata cabinet possibly in  June, after the Diet passes the state budget for fiscal 1994,  which started on April 1.    At a meeting of the Steering Committee's executive members  in  the morning, the LDP demanded that ruling parties surrender the  chairmanships of other lower house committees to the opposition  camp, political sources said.    The chairman posts demanded by the opposition are those for  the lower house Cabinet Committee, the Commerce and Industry  Committee and the Transport Committee, all of which were vacated  when the previous chairmen became ministers in the Hata  administration, the sources said.    The ruling and opposition camps agreed to discuss the other  posts next Tuesday, they said.</p>

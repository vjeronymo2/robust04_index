			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / People: Fox to advise ECGD Robin Fox, vice chairman of Kleinwort Benson, has succeeded Sir Peter Leslie as chairman of the Export Guarantees Advisory Council. Since a change in legislation last year, the Council advises the Export Credits Guarantee Department on all its activities - whereas previously it was formally consulted only in cases where 'national interest' considerations applied. Fox, 55, who was brought up in the same Cornish village as trade minister Richard Needham , has been at Kleinworts since 1961, and has in the past been heavily involved with the bank's project work. While Kleinworts is a big arranger and provider of ECGD-backed finance, the Council has traditionally picked a clearing banker - such as Sir Peter, a career Barclays man before he became Midland's deputy chairman last year - for the post. But Fox is a well connected City figure, and, as a member of the Overseas Project Board advising the Department of Trade and Industry, also a familiar face at the DTI. Appointed as chairman designate 12 months ago, he was given a three-year term instead of the standard five because the agency was then in a state of flux, according to ECGD. Since, the division offering short-term cover has been sold to the Dutch insurer NCM. Now ECGD, which insures against export risk 'is doing well' says Fox. 'We hope we have entered a new era - though we have a big hangover (of bad debts) from the past'. Last month, it resumed cover for some exports to Russia. ***** LEP GROUP, the troubled freight forwarding and security company, has appointed Wynne Denman and Brian Smith to the board, following indications last month from chairman David James that he wanted to strengthen his team with more 'experienced' non-executive directors. Denman is currently a director of Sterling Industries, Amber Industrial Holdings, North Sea Assets and FLS Aerospace. As well as joining the board, Denman will be closely involved in the management affairs of the Freight Forwarding division, the company said yesterday. Smith is on the board of Eagle Trust, Manganese Bronze Holdings and Gerald Gobert Holdings. He was previously group managing director of The Rank Organisation. He will also be joining the Board of Lep's principal USA subsidiary, The National Guardian Corporation.</p>

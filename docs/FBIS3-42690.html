THE ARSON </H5>   The rapid development of the Ossetian-Ingush armed  conflict resembled a tightly wound spring suddenly coming loose.  Without the understanding who had wound this spring, and how, it  is impossible to discern the pattern of interests  behind this chain of events. Therefore, we have to apologize to  the reader for a detour in the narrative and bring him back to  the testimony and documents that will allow him on his own to  find cause-and-effect connections between seemingly random  events and the historic underpinnings under the continuing "cold  war" between the two republics; we will begin with the testimony  of Oktyabrskoye village resident Bashir Buzurtanov. There are  hundreds of such, or similar, tales.    My, Bashir Buzurtanov's, family had lived in Sholkhi  for generations. My grandfather and father are buried in Sholkhi  (now Oktyabrskoye). When my father returned from exile, he was  not permitted to settle in his native village. He had a dream of  buying out his house, but the new owners refused. He died still  carrying this heartache. In July 1990, in carrying out his will,  I bought a house in Sholkhi; all of my father's savings went  into this. And on 2 August, burning torches were thrown into my  yard. These are sticks with a kerosene-soaked rag wrapped around  one end. At the time, the house was still occupied by the  Ossetian Dzanagov, who sold me the house; he was the one who  extinguished the fire. The gloomy Dzanagovs begged me to take my  money back; otherwise, Ossetian informals had promised to kill  them for selling the house to an Ingush. The informals told them  that there was some decree to this effect. I refused to take the  money. On the same night, at 0200, the house was doused with  kerosene and a torch was thrown in. My wife and I, together with  the elderly Dzanagovs, put out the fire. Other neighbors wanted  to help, but they were afraid of the bosses and the informals.  Rural Soviet Chairman Totrov came, upbraided the Dzanagovs, and  then talked to me. He advised me immediately to leave the  territory of the NO ASSR [North Ossetian Autonomous Soviet  Socialist Republic]. I went to Petr Dzhusoyev, the first  secretary of the CPSU raykom [rayon committee]. He said that  Ingush do not have the right to complain against Ossetians. He  demanded that I leave the house that I had bought and settle in  Nazran.    The Dzanagovs and the Buzurtanovs probably could get along  after all, but the informals were correct: There had been a  decree. And not even one--three. The first one during  Khrushchev's thaw, when in order to correct "excesses of the  personality cult," the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was restored.  Anticipating a mass return of Ingush to their homeland, the NO  ASSR Council of Ministers by a secret circular (No. 063) as  early as in 1956 prohibited organizations and private  individuals to sell houses or rent apartment space to Ingush.  Nevertheless, Ingush still brought houses, got residence  permits, and settled in. Naturally, not without some greasing of  palms. The NO ASSR leadership, fearing that despite everything  the Ingush would strike root in their former homeland, decided  to close all the loopholes. It had always had access to the  all-Union government, and in 1982 the USSR Council of Ministers  issued a decree (No. 183) "On Limiting Issuance of Residence  Permits in Prigorodnyy Rayon of the North Ossetian ASSR." This  unclassified decree did not mention "persons of Ingush origin,"  but everybody knew to whom the limitation on issuance of  residence permits applied. Nevertheless, Ingush continued to buy  houses, build new ones, and pay bribes for this, albeit in  greater amounts than before. Perestroyka and the democratic  trends that developed in connection with it brought new distress  to republic leaders, who were aware that, having set root, the  Ingush would want to legalize their status--among other things  so that they would not have to pay horrendous tributes.    In 1989 the Congress of USSR People's Deputies adopted a  declaration "On Recognizing as Illegal and Criminal All Acts  Against People Who Have Been Subjected to Forced Resettlement."  A return of Prigorodnyy Rayon was not a too distant future. The  declaration elicited a sharply negative reaction among both  informals and the NO ASSR leadership. Former enemies joined  ranks. University professor Galazov, who took an anti-Ingush  position, became a secretary of the CPSU raykom, and then the  republic leader. Under him the propaganda apparatus kicked in at  full power and eventually implanted in society's consciousness a  deeply negative attitude toward the Ingush as a people. He was  unexpectedly helped by the disintegration of the communist  ideology, with its decorative taboo on ethnic intolerance. This  made the former leader of the Communist Party free to later  speak of the Ingush people as a snake that had snuggled into the  bosom of the Ossetian people.    On 14 September 1990, the NO ASSR Supreme Soviet adopted a  third decree banning--this time on the territory of the entire  republic--buying and selling of residential housing and other  structures into private ownership. The protest of the procurator  general of Russia was ignored. But in Moscow, RSFSR Supreme  Soviet commissions already were at work, which found the Ingush  population's demand to return Prigorodnyy Rayon in its pre-1944  borders to the Chechen-Ingush ASSR to be well founded. Then it  so happened that a fight over a vegetable garden broke out  between Ossetians and Ingush in Kurtat village. On 19 April 1991  a state of emergency was imposed not only in this village, but  in the entire Prigorodnyy Rayon, as well as in Vladikavkaz. A  week later, the RSFSR Supreme Soviet, under B.N. Yeltsin's  leadership, almost unanimously did pass the law "On  Rehabilitation of the Peoples Subjected to Repression," with  Articles 3 and 6 envisaging the return of the old status to the  territories. As Ossetians had feared, the impatient Ingush  leaders immediately began to demand that the law be implemented  and that the state of emergency be lifted. The Moscow  authorities remained silent, as if they had forgotten about the  just-adopted law.    The North Ossetian press filled up with articles justifying  the deportation of Vaynakhs by Stalin. Zaur Dzarakhokhov, the  chief of the North Ossetian MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]  press center, mockingly suggested that the Ingush should  announce a collection of money and erect in Nazran a monument to  the father of all peoples, Stalin, for sending Ingush far away  from the front lines and thus giving them the "opportunity to  preserve the genetic stock of the nation."    It is of course the simplest explanation--that the  anti-Ingush attitude of the Ossetian society is merely the  result of massive government propaganda. While not diminishing  at all the influence of the propaganda apparatus and the force  of its impact, it should be noted that the inhabitants of North  Ossetia, despite the 70-year-long uninterrupted tradition of  trusting Soviet power, in the end would be able to separate  obvious lies from the truth. On two conditions: that they would  have an independent source of information and that there would  not exist objective reasons for them to fear the Ingush.    One would assume that among such unconscious feelings,  locked  in the back of their mind, is an old guilt complex. The  barbarity of Stalin and Beria was not only in mobilizing 3,000  Ossetians--among many members of other ethnic groups in the  Caucasus--to participate in driving out the neighboring people,  but also in encouraging them, and sometimes even forcing them,  to take over other peoples' homes, with beds still warm, food  still on the stove, and unmilked cows in the barn. No matter how  politicians and journalists may have exerted themselves later in  trying to justify the deed, it is impossible to fool a healthy  sense of morality among the people. The only thing that may  lighten the burden is a reciprocal and greater fault of the  neighbors.    But these are emotional-psychological reasons for fear.  There  are other, more conscious ones. The fertile lands of Prigorodnyy  Rayon always fed Vladikavkaz and will continue feeding it, no  matter who lives there--Ingush, Ossetians, or Russians. Such are  the laws of economic geography. The density of population there,  however, according to the republic statistics, is already  high--127 persons per square kilometer--and will steadily  increase through the natural growth of Ingush population (15.6  per 1,000 of population, as compared to 6.4 among Ossetians).  They even came up with a term for it--aggressive birth  rate--which has replaced military aggression. Youth under the  working age comprised 37.3 percent of the Ingush population  (among Ossetians, 26.7 percent, respectively). Demographers say  that no matter what, after a certain number of years, Ossetians  will end up an ethnic minority in this region, and then the  Ingush farm market in Vladikavkaz will become a political factor.    More than a year later, on 4 June 1992, the RSFSR Supreme  Soviet made the following step--it adopted the law "On Forming  the Ingush Republic as a Component of the Russian Federation."    What remained was to determine the republic borders and  elect  a parliament. V. Tishkov, the former chairman of the State  Committee on Nationalities, was inclined to hold elections to  the Ingush Republic parliament among other places on the  territory of Prigorodnyy Rayon in North Ossetia, in the places  of compact habitation of Ingush. The Ossetian representative  flatly refused even to discuss this proposal.    On 26 October 1992, after a number of meetings of the  presidium of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet, where the  Ossetian-Ingush--no, not a conflict yet--question was discussed,  a proposal was made for a joint commission with the  participation of Ossetian and Ingush representatives to draft a  decision. For the Ossetian side to sit down at the negotiation  table would mean to recognize the existence of the problem. To  refuse to further participate in the discussion meant an open  conflict with the government, the Supreme Soviet, and the  president, who had signed the laws under dispute. For the  Vladikavkaz leadership a diplomatic failure was fraught not only  with the danger of losing their political face. A scandal  replete with accusations of corruption was brewing in the  republic parliament. A certain top official sent a daughter  abroad; another was being linked to sales of valuable metals  abroad and the vanished hard currency proceeds. A good shake-up  could turn public opinion around. It is quite possible that by  that time the Ossetian leadership had made a decision to get a  decisive hold of Prigorodnyy Rayon at any cost. Now it was  possible to achieve only by squeezing Ingush out of its  boundaries and setting a strict military border between the two  republics.    In this coagulated atmosphere of fear and mistrust toward  one  another, any torch thrown over a fence, any new street killing,  held the danger of an explosion. Which is precisely what  happened.  <H3>  FROM THE IZVESTIYA FILE. What Kind of Legacy Do We Refuse To  Reject? </H3>   Top secret.    To the people's commissar for national security,  Comrade L.P. Beria    I hereby report that loading of Chechens and Ingush due  for resettlement began by 0500 on 23 February 1944. Altogether,  accepted for convoy and dispatched were 180 trains, 65 railcars  in each, carrying a total of 493,269 resettlers. On average  2,740 persons per train. Travel time by train is between nine  and 23 days--16 days on average. While on route, 56 persons were  born, 285 delivered to medical facilities for treatment, and  1,272 died....    [Signed] Chief of the convoy troops of the USSR NKVD  [People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs], Major General  (Bochkov)    State Defense Committee    To Comrade I.V. Stalin    26 February 1944    In connection with the resettlement of Chechens and  Ingush..., to transfer to:    ....North Ossetian ASSR--Achalukskiy, Nazranovskiy, and  Psedakhskiy Rayons within their existing borders, as well as  Prigorodnyy Rayon, with the exception of its southern  high-altitude part, and a part of Sunzhenskiy Rayon.    ....The initial plan was to transfer two  rayons--Psedakhskiy and Malgobekskiy--to the Kabardino-Balkar  ASSR. However, it was found expedient to transfer Psedakhskiy  Rayon to North Ossetia, especially considering that after the  planned resettlement of Balkars, who occupy the territory of  about 500,000 hectares, Kabardins will get the vacated  lands.    [Signed] L. Beria    Later on, as it follows from the Supreme Soviet presidium's  decree "On Liquidating the Chechen-Ingush ASSR...." dated 7  March 1944, it was found expedient also to transfer both  Psedakhskiy and Malgobekskiy Rayons to North Ossetia, and on top  of that, to grant the request of the Soviet of People's  Commissars and the VKP(b) [All-Union Communist (Bolshevik)  party] oblast committee of this republic to transfer to it the  city of Mozdok in Stavropol Kray, together with adjacent  population centers, as well as Kurpskiy Rayon of  Kabardino-Balkaria. "Thanks to continuous support of the  bolshevik party and Comrade Stalin personally....the territory  of our republic has increased by up to 50 percent," said the  North Ossetian BKP(b) obkom's secretary, I.D. Kulov, in one of  his reports.    From the decree of the presidium of the USSR Supreme  Soviet (not to be published in the press) dated 16 July 1956    "Taking into account the fact that there is no further  need to continue existing restrictions in the legal status of  Chechens, Ingush, and Karachay and their family members  currently residing in restricted settlement areas, the presidium  of the USSR Supreme Soviet resolves: 1. To remove from  restricted settlement records and free from under administrative  oversight. 2. To stipulate that removal of restricted settlement  provisions regarding the persons enumerated in Article 1 of this  decree does not entail returning to them the property  confiscated during the eviction, and that they do not have a  right to return to locales from which they had been  evicted."    Special file. Top secret.    From the memorandum of the Committee for State Security  under the USSR Council of Ministers to the CPSU Central  Committee, 1 April 1957 (No. 682-E).    In violation of the USSR Supreme Soviet presidium's  decree dated 16 July 1956, individuals of Ingush origin formerly  subject to restricted settlement provisions in unorganized  manner and en masse have returned to old areas of habitation....    In reporting the above, the Committee for State  Security believes it expedient to instruct the RSFSR Council of  Ministers to take urgent steps with respect to factors causing  an unhealthy situation in North Ossetian ASSR.    [Signed] I. Serov, chairman of the Committee for State  Security under the USSR Council of Ministers.    Undoubtedly, the KGB chief, concerned over exacerbation of  the political situation in North Ossetia, could not fail to be  aware of the fact that the ban on Chechens and Ingush returning  to their homeland had been lifted three months prior to that.    On one and the same day (9 January 1957) and under an almost  identical heading ("On the Restoration of the Chechen-Ingush  ASSR...."), one expanding the other, two decrees--an all-Union  and a Russian one--were issued that were in sharp conflict to  each other. The first repeals as no longer in effect the decree  "On Liquidating the Chechen-Ingush ASSR....", and hence restores  the republic's borders as of February 1944. The second--the  Russian--decree, in the list of rayons being returned to  Chechen-Ingush Republic, does not mention Prigorodnyy Rayon,  which makes the republic's restoration within the old borders  impossible and return of the Ingush to their homeland quite  questionable.    Issa Magomedovich Kostoyev, an experienced legal scholar,  has  shoveled through piles of paper in archives trying to find at  least some serious--even by the standards of those  times--legislative act formalizing Prigorodnyy Rayon as part of  North Ossetia. He could not find anything! Moreover, until 1978,  in the Chechen-Ingush Republic Constitution Prigorodnyy Rayon  was listed as its component, and only after 1978 did North  Ossetia include it in its Constitution. If we approach this  matter from a strictly legal standpoint and take as the basis  the only competent document in this entire chain of decrees--the  decree "On the Restoration of Chechen-Ingush Republic," which  repealed the repressive acts, Prigorodnyy Rayon all these years  has been and remains a part of Ingushetia. Unless, of course,  following the example of North Ossetia, we take as the sole  basis the Stalin-Beria decree on the deportation of the  population and the liquidation of the republic.    "The USSR Supreme Soviet declaration 'On Recognizing as  Illegitimate and Criminal Repressive Acts Against Peoples  Subjected to Forced Resettlement and Ensuring Their Rights,'"  adopted with applause by the Congress of USSR People's Deputies  on 14 November 1989, and the law "On Rehabilitation of the  Peoples Subjected to Repression," dated 26 April 1991 and signed  by the Chairman of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet B.N.  Yeltsin, do not leave any doubt in this respect. They once and  again unconditionally affirm that "all acts of all-Union,  republic, and local organs with respect to peoples subjected to  repressions, with the exception of the acts restoring their  rights, shall be considered null and void."    Nevertheless, the fate of the new law "On  Rehabilitation...."  was dramatic; its first opponent was the CPSU leadership.    From the open letter of Idris Bazorkin, people's writer  of Chechen-Ingushetia, a delegate of the First Congress of USSR  writers, to the General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee  M.S. Gorbachev (June 1991):    I joined the party as a candidate in 1942, when the  Germans were bombing the Groznyy oil fields. I was a military  correspondent and believed in the power of the party.    I received my party membership card on 24 February  1944. The last party membership card in the no-longer existing  Chechen-Ingush Republic. On that day, my people had already been  en route for a day, evicted from their own home, some of them  executed on the spot.    Finally, on 26 April 1991, the RSFSR Supreme Soviet  passed a law "On Rehabilitation of the Peoples Subjected to  Repressions." This edict, aimed at blocking the RSFSR Law "On  Rehabilitation of the Peoples Subjected to Repressions" and  aimed at provoking interethnic conflicts, was the last straw.    I return to you my party membership card, since I  consider it impossible for an honest man to be a member of the  party of enemies of the people.    Idris Bazorkin, the most significant Ingush writer, lived to  see the August of 1991; he lived through a revival of hope and  another crash of it: The law "On Forming the Ingush Republic as  a Component Part of the Russian Federation," signed by the  Russian Federation president on 4 June 1992, proclaimed the new  state entity on paper: without territory, without borders,  without a capital, without administrative and economic  structures and ties. It does mention "the interests of the  Cossacks and the possibility of expanding their self-rule" and  establishes a transition period until March 1994. The writer did  not live that long.    On the second day of the Chechen-Ingush conflict, the  82-year-old novelist was taken from his Vladikavkaz apartment;  his entire family also found itself held hostage. Later, under  public pressure, Bazorkin was let go to live in Nazran. The loss  of his home and archives (the apartment is occupied, the fate of  the archives is unknown), and most importantly, the tragedy of  his people, undermined the writer's health--Idris Bazorkin died  in the spring of 1993.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alexander Nicoll and Andrew Taylor: "Amec to Set </F> Up Joint Venture With China"]    [Text] Amec, the UK construction group, has agreed to set  up a joint venture which will build petro-chemical, oil and gas  production facilities in China.    The company's process engineering subsidiary yesterday  signed  an exclusive memorandum of understanding with Chinese Offshore  Industrial Corporation [COIC], a state-owned shipbuilding group.  The two companies are finalising joint-venture terms.    The agreement covers construction of on-shore petro-chemical  plants as well as off-shore oil and gas production facilities  for use in China.    The deal will also enable the joint venture to build  advanced  deep-water floating production vessels in China for sale  worldwide.    Amec will contribute half the venture's costs. In return for  enhancing its strategic position in the Chinese market, Amec  will transfer technology for management of projects and  engineering design.    Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman, said: "Although technology  transfer was an issue, it was clear than many key skills and  abilities already exist in our partner's organisation."    The venture will develop a joint facility at Huang Pu  shipyard in Guangzhou province in southern China, capable of  building modules of up to 5,000 tonnes each. COIC also has the  ability to build large floating production platforms at a  300,000-tonne dry dock in north-east China.    Amec is already building accommodation modules in  partnerships with COIC for Phillips Petroleum platforms in the  South China Sea.    Amec is one of Britain's biggest manufacturers and service  providers for the UK oil and gas industries. Demand for North  Sea off-shore platforms for has fallen sharply in the past 18  months. Amec has been seeking to use its technology to expand  abroad.</p>

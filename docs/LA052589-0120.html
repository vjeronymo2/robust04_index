			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAPITOL BARGAINING ON HIGHWAYS FAVORS O.C. TOLL ROAD PLAN  </P> <P> Allowing private companies to build and finance toll roads in California has  become a new option in legislative negotiations over a 10-year plan for easing  congestion in the state's highway system, possibly including two tollway  projects aimed at relieving congestion on two Orange County freeways.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) said that, as a concession to Republicans,  Democratic negotiators are considering offering their support for a measure by  Assemblyman William P. Baker (R-Danville) which would permit private groups to  build and operate transportation projects.  </P> <P> "It's something we're looking at and it's a serious consideration," he said.  </P> <P> Orange County officials said Wednesday that Baker's proposal is linked, in  part, to recent interest among authorities in Los Angeles and San Bernardino  counties who have been promoting two potential toll road projects to relieve  the severely congested Orange and Riverside freeways.  </P> <P> Those same Orange County officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said  that Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum and a San Bernardino County  official have been trying to garner private support for toll roads into Orange  County. They said Schabarum favors a route through Tonner Canyon, while San  Bernardino County prefers Soquel Canyon. Both are in Chino Hills north of Brea.  </P> <P> Schabarum could not be reached for comment Wednesday.  </P> <P> Katz said the toll road proposal would be part of an overall agreement that is  being hammered out by legislative leaders and Gov. George Deukmejian on a plan  to finance $20 billion in transportation improvements over the next decade. The  plan includes proposals for a gasoline tax increase and a hike in truck weight  fees.  </P> <P> Until now, private construction and operation of toll roads as part of the  state highway system has been prohibited by California law. In 1987, the  Legislature authorized three toll road projects in Orange County but specified  that two newly created local government agencies would oversee both the  construction and financing.  </P> <P> Baker said his proposal would allow the California Department of Transportation  to enter agreements with private business to construct and lease transportation  facilities which could include everything from bridges to roads and urban  interchanges to elevated traffic lanes.  </P> <P> "We've left it open," he said. "I don't have a specific project in mind."  </P> <P> The legislation would be limited to authorizing only three projects -- one each  in Northern and Southern California and a third in an area yet to be specified.  </P> <P> Whatever the project, Baker said it would have to be built to state  specifications and with specific approval by Caltrans because "we wouldn't just  want a road to nowhere."  </P> <P> Private companies entering agreements with the state, he said, would be  permitted to impose tolls on the new facilities to pay for construction and  provide them with a "reasonable" profit.  </P> <P> Although he anticipated that tolls would be the most popular method of paying  for the projects, he said the companies could propose other financing schemes.  The private companies would operate the facilities for 35 years, at which point  they would revert to the state, he said.  </P> <P> Baker said private involvement is needed in state transportation projects  because there is not enough public money to pay for all the projects needed.  </P> <P> Such a plan for toll roads in northern Orange County would provide badly needed  "relief valves" in an area where the borders of the three counties meet, an  area for which little or no state highway money is available to build new  highways, Orange County officials said.  </P> <P> However, they said that they have not been asked yet to support either the  Tonner or Soquel Canyon projects, nor have they been approached by Orange  County businesses interested in funding or building either link.  </P> <P> The Orange County Transportation Commission already is studying the feasibility  of building a proposed extension of the Orange Freeway as a toll road. But the  study is not aimed specifically at the possibility of building the project with  private funds.  </P> <P> The freeway currently ends at the Garden Grove Freeway near Anaheim Stadium and  would be extended along the Santa Ana River to the San Diego Freeway in  Fountain Valley, at a cost exceeding $1 billion. No money is expected to be  available for the project from the state or federal government, because such  sources already have been tapped for other traffic improvements, including the  massive Santa Ana Freeway widening project.  </P> <P> Orange County officials said that although the Orange Freeway extension has not  come up in discussions with Los Angeles and San Bernardino County officials,  and is in no way connected with Wednesday's legislative developments, some  talks have been held with Orange County developer Henry T. Segerstrom and the  Reason Foundation, a Libertarian think tank in Santa Monica, about building the  extension as a toll road.  </P> <P> Stanley T. Oftelie, executive director of the county transportation commission,  said Wednesday that he welcomes the Assembly proposal, although he added that  he has not discussed it with anyone.  </P> <P> "We have no resistance to private toll roads," he said. "We need every kind of  innovative funding technique we can get in this county. We should carefully  look at the (Orange Freeway) extension and a new connection to San Bernardino  County or Los Angeles County."  </P> <P> Walt Hagen, chief deputy director of Caltrans District 12, which encompasses  Orange County, added, "There are some areas where private financing may be the  only way to build new highways. The location of those (proposed) routes --  Tonner Canyon and Soquel Canyon -- are in places where there is a great need  but no money to do anything like that."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Baker's legislative proposal has the strong backing of the  Deukmejian Administration through Robert K. Best, director of Caltrans, who has  argued that it would "give us the flexibility to supplement governmental funds  with the resources and talent of private industry to bring additional projects  in line."  </P> <P> Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), chairman of the Senate Transportation  Committee, said that while he has consistently supported the "use of toll roads  in theory," the plan may face strong opposition from some Democrats in the  Senate.  </P></p>

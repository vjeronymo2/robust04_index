			<p>Language: <F P=105> Xhosa </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] today  expressed concern over the training of between 500 and 1,000  people at Umfolozi. The TEC said the government should deploy  the defense force in this area to ensure a free and fair  election. [passage omitted]    There was also heated debate following a resolution that the  TEC [Transitional Executive Council] said must be relayed to the  president and be entered in the Constitution of the country to  ensure that people residing in Bophuthatswana and other areas  are able to vote freely. It was proposed that security forces be  deployed in these areas and ballot boxes be placed at polling  places on the Bophuthatswana border so that voters do not have  to travel long distances to cast their vote, as the people of  Bophuthatswana resumed their South African citizenship legally  on 1 January 1994, including public servants, the police and the  defense force.    [Begin Cyril Ramaphosa recording, in English] To allow all  our people in Bophuthatswana, and we have up to 2 million of  them, to go and vote knowing that they exercise their vote  freely and fairly, and that they will be protected by South  African security forces, if the Bophuthatswana Defense Force  ever seeks to do anything. But this resolution goes further,  Mr. Chairman. It calls on the civil servants in Bophuthatswana,  the soldiers, policemen, nurses, judges and magistrates and  everyone else to know that they are not going to be left in the  lurch when the rationalization process takes place. So it calls  on them to have full confidence in what we are doing. Already  there is unrest in Bophuthatswana. Civil servants are up in arms  and they are up in arms because they have deep uncertainties of  what the future holds for them. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

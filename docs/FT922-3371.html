			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Racal Sir Ernest Harrison was evidently displaying unusual modesty last December when he forecast profits of Pounds 50m for Racal Electronics in 1991-92. Thanks particularly to a squeeze on working capital, the actual outturn was Pounds 6m higher than expected and debt has fallen by nearly half to Pounds 121m. As if that was not enough to justify an 8 per cent leap in the shares to 69p yesterday, a firm timetable has emerged for the Chubb demerger promised in the defence against the Williams bid. It would be rash, however, to assume that the shares have a long way further to run. Racal is already trading nearly 30 per cent above the initial value of the Williams bid, and more than 10p above the level where Williams finally unloaded the stake it acquired. The historic multiple of 30 is slightly more than twice that of the sector as a whole. Racal has shown with Vodafone that demerger can unlock value both at the time of announcement and on implementation. Some expectations on that score must already be in the price. So apparently is a bid premium for a demerged Chubb. The real question remains the more basic one of how much scope exists for further growth. Racal's markets are not expanding. Margins in the security division were already running at 10 per cent in the second half. There is a possibility that Chubb, like Vodafone before it, may emerge pretty fully valued. Since the demerger, Racal has outperformed Vodafone by 50 per cent. There is far greater scope for margin improvement on the electronics side than in the security business which is now due to be spun off. But Racal must find a way of increasing sales as well as margins in this division, if its shareholders are to reap the maximum reward.</p>

Korean </F> Authorities" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Tokyo, March 22 (KNS-KCNA) - The Central Standing  Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in  Japan (Chongnyon) released a statement Tuesday denouncing the  U.S. arrogant acts to isolate and stifle the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea at any cost and accusing Japan and the South  Korean authorities of following it.    The United States has all along departed from its agreement  with the DPRK, reversed even the February 25 agreed conclusions  on four steps of simultaneous action for a package solution to  the nuclear issue -- the suspension of the "Team Spirit" joint  military exercises, the resumption of the working contact for  the exchange of presidential envoys between the North and the  South of Korea, inspection by the International Atomic Energy  Agency for the continuity of safeguards and the opening of the  third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks -- and brought the peaceful  solution of the nuclear issue to an impasse again, the statement  said, and went on:    The perfidious acts of the U.S. are very dangerous moves  which may entail confrontation and war again on the Korean  peninsula.    It is not fortuitous that the South Korean authority brought  to a rupture the working contact for the exchange of  presidential envoys between the North and the South. This is a  logical result of his acts seeking confrontation and division,  not reconciliation and reunification, while consistently  following the United States, with no will and no capacity to  resolve the nuclear issue on the peninsula.    He, who had blared in chorus with the U.S. that "the  exchange  of special envoys is a precondition of the third round of the  DPRK-U.S. talks," decided on "a tough reaction" and cried for  the introduction of Patriot missiles and the restarting of the  "Team Spirit" at "a high-level strategic meeting" held while the  working contact was under way.    Kim Yong-sam is going to visit Japan to discuss  "international sanctions" against the DPRK. This is nothing but  an anti-national act to antagonize the fellow countrymen in the  North with the backing of foreign forces.    It must not go unnoticed that the United States has fostered  pressure on the DPRK, openly revealing its intention to take  "sanctions" against it through the United Nations Security  Council, while the Japanese authorities are zealously responding  to it.    Recently, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa charged the DPRK  with "the breach of the agreement," while closing his eyes to  the U.S. failure to implement the agreement. This is a  preposterous misrepresentation of the reality.    If the United States, Japan and the South Korean authorities  continue acting against the demand of the Korean people and the  world peaceloving people and the trend of the time, they will  face a stern judgement by history.</p>

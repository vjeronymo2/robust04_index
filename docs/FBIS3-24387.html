Therefore, the City  Assembly will have a very important role in our life, Sergey  Tsiplyayev emphasized in yesterday's conversation with  journalists in St. Petersburg.    The president's representative is concerned about the  outcome  of the election campaign mainly because it was not properly  covered in the mass media. There is no question, remarked  Tsiplyayev, that if each of the more than 700 candidates were  given 20 minutes of air time, we could only pity our voters.  Television debates between blocs and coalitions, however, would  have helped voters make a choice.    As it stands, said Sergey Tsiplyayev, name recognition is  about the only factor that can affect the choice; if there is no  recognized name on the candidate list, the choice will be almost  random. This was exacerbated, on top of everything else, by  shortcomings in the preliminary screening mechanism, which  allowed 10-15 candidates per one seat to remain on the ballot.    Political capital is not earned overnight on the eve of  elections; in order to avoid the current difficulties next time,  a city political elite should form. A considerable role in this  may belong to the mass media, noted Tsiplyayev.</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Russia will receive IMF money 'in month or two' RUSSIA could start to receive money in as little as a month or two from a new temporary facility set up by the International Monetary Fund, Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, said yesterday. The IMF board last week approved in principle the 'systemic transformation facility', which is expected to provide Dollars 4bn-Dollars 6bn (Pounds 2.6bn-Pounds 3.9bn) to help Russia and other countries in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union make the leap to a market-based economy. Some Asian countries, such as Mongolia or Vietnam, could also become eligible. Countries will be eligible to receive up to half their IMF quotas from the facility. This would allow Russia to get up to Dollars 3bn, with half this sum available immediately and the rest 6-12 months later. The facility is intended to provide balance of payments support to countries which experience a sharp fall in export earnings or a sharp rise in net import costs, particularly for energy, because of a shift to market prices. Mr Camdessus estimated Russia's balance of payments shortfall at around Dollars 40bn over the next year, roughly the size of the Dollars 43bn package unveiled in Tokyo last week by the Group of Seven. The conditions required by the IMF will be looser than for a normal standby agreement, but countries will still have to take 'significant policy actions' to stabilise their economies, stem capital flight and implement structural and institutional reforms.</p>

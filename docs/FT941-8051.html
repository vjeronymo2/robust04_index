			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Singapore suffers an embarrassment of riches: Growth is greater than is comfortable Not many finance ministers can feel as comfortable preparing their annual budget as Singapore's Mr Richard Hu. Mr Hu's budget address tomorrow will be set against the background of a far stronger economic performance last year than had been expected. According to official figures published yesterday, the Singapore economy grew 9.9 per cent in 1993, the biggest increase since 1988, and a sharp acceleration from the 6 per cent growth of the previous year. Fiscal deficits are virtually unknown in Singapore, and there is little in the country's recent economic performance or near-term prospects which could give Mr Hu cause for serious concern. The surge in growth last year was due mainly to a big increase in activity in the financial services sector, with rapid bank-loan growth combined with a sharp increase in stock market turnover. The financial and business services sector grew 13 per cent last year, more than double the growth rate in 1992. But there was also an unexpectedly big jump in manufacturing activity, with overall manufacturing output increasing 9.8 per cent in 1993 against 2.5 per cent in the previous year. Singapore's electronics industry, which produces half the world's output of disk drives as well as many other computer peripherals, benefited from the US recovery and a computer price war in many export markets. Mr Hu says last year's economic growth rate was 'somewhat higher than is comfortable' and is forecasting expansion of 6-8 per cent this year; economists generally expect 7-8 per cent. In spite of the high growth, the government would appear to have little to worry about on the inflation front: Singapore's consumer price index rose 2.4 per cent last year, a marginal increase on 1992. This year will see a one-time blip in inflation caused by the introduction of a 3 per cent general sales tax (GST) in April, expected to add 2.5 per cent to the consumer price index. The government, which oversees foreign exchange reserves of more than Dollars 40bn (Pounds 27bn), controls inflation primarily through currency market intervention to help a steady appreciation of the Singapore dollar. Mr Hu says foreign capital inflows, particularly into the stock market, in effect mean government policy not to internationalise the local currency has been relaxed somewhat. But he says: 'Our fundamentals are strong enough to avoid destabilising flows'. Also warding off an over-heated economy are domestic interest rates which had already begun to edge up before the US Federal Reserve tightened the monetary reins earlier this month, a factor expected to dampen domestic economic activity during the year. Few surprises are expected in tomorrow's budget. Mr Hu had already announced the introduction of GST this year. Economists say the finance minister is likely to cut corporation tax at some point within the next few years from the present level of 27 per cent to the government's stated target of 25 per cent. Mr Hu may also raise employers' contributions to the central provident fund, the government's forced savings system. However, Mr Hu does admit concern about wage increases in Singapore's large public sector and therefore may be reluctant to increase employers' costs further. The need for Singapore to remain competitive is a constant government theme. Singapore, with only 2.8m people, faces severe labour shortages. Another constraint is a shortage of land. Surrounding countries with lower wage rates are challenging the island republic's export competitiveness. Ministry of Trade and Industry officials say last year saw an improvement in productivity and a drop in overall unit labour costs: but Singapore has to keep climbing the technological ladder to gain advantage over its neighbours. In spite of high costs relative to other rapidly-growing Asian countries, Singapore's efficiency and infrastructure continue to attract substantial new investment, particularly from US companies which committed SDollars 1.45bn (Pounds 625m) or 37 per cent of new manufacturing investment last year, mainly in the petrochemical, electronics and medical supplies industries. Singapore's fortunes remain closely linked to economic activity in the US, which accounts for nearly a quarter of domestic exports. Singapore's exports to the US grew 12 per cent last year, while Malaysia overtook the EC as the island republic's second biggest export market. Seeking to turn its expertise and other countries' cheaper labour costs to its advantage, the government has invested several hundred million dollars in its programme to assist local companies in investments abroad, principally in industrial parks such as at Wuxi in China, Bangalore in India and Batam island in Indonesia. In a country where carefully worked out policies are repeatedly driven home by a chorus of ministers and officials, the drive to 'regionalise' the local economy is likely to be a theme of Mr Hu's budget. He has ample resources at his disposal, though Mr Philip Yeo, chairman of the Economic Development Board which is spearheading the policy, warns that Singapore will not be a 'regional Father Christmas' and will ensure that every project earns a good return.</p>

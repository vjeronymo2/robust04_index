			<p>BFN     [Text] Syria today asked Israel to stop issuing mysterious  statements and to declare its clear readiness to effect a  comprehensive withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan in order  to realize a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.    Speaking before U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's  arrival in Damascus today, an official Syrian source said that  Syria is serious about its call for realizing comprehensive  withdrawal in exchange for comprehensive peace, but will not  accept a peace by installments.    The source said that Syria wants a just and comprehensive  peace in the region and will support all efforts in that  direction but will not accept any partial or separate solutions  and will reject incomplete peace, a peace which comes by  installments.    The Syria official [as heard] said: Peace cannot be divided.  Either there is a just and comprehensive peace, giving everybody  their full rights and ending the roots of tension in the region,  or there is not. This is because a settlement that lacks these  elements cannot survive and the region will continue to be  primed for an explosion at any time.    The Syrian official ridiculed Israeli Prime Minister Rabin's  statements in which he described making a decision to withdraw  from the Golan as a painful decision, saying that the Golan's  people are the ones who are pained because Israel occupied their  land and homes. He said that occupation is an illegal act of  aggression and it is the people of the Golan who should be  feeling the pain because they were expelled from their land and  homes. By withdrawing from the Golan, Israel is not offering  concessions because it will be withdrawing from a territory  which it does not own, he said, adding that the Golan has always  been and will always be a Syrian Arab territory.    The Syrian official urged Christopher to play the role of an  impartial mediator and a full partner and pressure Israel in  order to state its readiness to implement UN resolutions and  apply the land-for-peace principle.    The official said: All we want is the implementation of the  resolutions of international legitimacy, which are supported by  international norms and conventions. We want to regain our  rights and this is legitimate.    The source reiterated Syria's rejection of secret talks and  separate deals. The Syrian official asked: Why demand secret  talks if the party calling for them is sincere in its intentions  and desire to realize peace?</p>

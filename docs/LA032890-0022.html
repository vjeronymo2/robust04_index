			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AIR BASE TO BUY A BILLION GALLONS OF WATER ANNUALLY;  </P> <P> EDWARDS: OFFICIALS SIGN A 10-YEAR DEAL WITH THE REGION'S MAJOR SUPPLIER TO HELP  CURTAIL GROUND-WATER PUMPING, WHICH IS CRACKING THE SPACE SHUTTLE'S RUNWAYS.  </P> <P> Edwards Air Force Base, seeking to solve a serious water shortage and preserve  the landing ground of the space shuttle, has agreed to buy more than a billion  gallons of water a year from an Antelope Valley supplier, a deal that officials  insist will not mean shortages for the rest of the region.  </P> <P> Air Force officials said their use of water from the Antelope Valley-East Kern  Water Agency could help preserve the base's famed dry lake bed runways, where  the shuttles land. The new water supply will allow Edwards to curtail  ground-water pumping, which is believed to be contributing to the sinking and  cracking of the lake bed.  </P> <P> But the agreement is not in time to save the Mojave Desert base from a second  summer of water rationing.  </P> <P> Edwards, the second largest Air Force base in the 48 contiguous states, would  initially pay nearly $1.6 million a year under a 10-year contract with the  water agency, known as AVEK, which wholesales water to the region.  </P> <P> "AVEK is definitely going to be an essential part of our infrastructure," said  Bob Johnstone, chief of Edwards' plans and policies division. "Everyone is  saying it's going to be expensive to use AVEK water. But we didn't really have  any other options."  </P> <P> Edwards will pay the water agency nearly three times as much for water as the  agency's other customers, mainly because the others pay taxes to the agency.  But the air base, as federal property, does not.  </P> <P> Johnstone said he could not say how much the base now pays to produce its own  water.  </P> <P> The water pact, which makes the agency the base's major water supplier, was  approved Tuesday night by its board of directors. Air Force officials said a  formal contract could be signed within a week. The pact had been under  discussion for nearly a year, Johnstone said.  </P> <P> Edwards now gets all of its water from on-base wells. But many of those have  been failing due to age or have been shut down because of natural arsenic  contamination. When it has the agency's water, the base will use the wells only  during the high-demand summer months.  </P> <P> Last summer, the estimated 20,000 daytime residents of the base, including  employees and their families, sweated out mandatory water conservation measures  because of the dwindling water supply.  </P> <P> Base officials predict that the same measures will be required this summer  because, water agency officials said, they do not expect to begin supplying  water to Edwards until early 1991. It will take that long for the agency to  build a 1.25-mile pipeline connecting the base to a feeder line. That $660,000  project is part of the overall contract.  </P> <P> The water the agency plans to supply to Edwards -- nearly 3 million gallons a  day -- is equal to about 11% of all the drinking water supplied by the agency  last year. Because of the drought, the agency this year expects that deliveries  of water from the California Aqueduct will fall short of the demands by its  water retailers. But agency General Manager Wallace Spinarski said the agency  should have enough water by 1991, when the Edwards service will begin, to meet  all demands.  </P> <P> The water agency is the major supplier of State Water Project water to a  2,300-square-mile area that includes the Antelope Valley and portions of Kern  County.  </P></p>

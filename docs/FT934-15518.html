			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Salaryman takes on might of corporate Japan MR HARUO KAWAGUCHI is an unlikely challenger to the might of corporate Japan. A company man down to his blue suit, white shirt and nondescript tie, he is fighting for the right not to be selflessly loyal in a society that counts on it. Mr Kawaguchi has taken his employer, Teikoku Hormone Manufacturing, to court to get compensation for a six-year separation from his family that was the consequence of a standard career move in Japan: a transfer from his Tokyo-based family to Nagoya. Mr Kawaguchi, a 47-year-old middle-class administrative officer, has challenged the fairness of what is known as tanshin funin, in which husbands are routinely obliged to accept the solitary life of a distant transfer away from their family. 'I am becoming famous. You know they mentioned me on TV last week. The commentator said he sympathised with me,' he said. He has just lost the first round, but the case has touched a nerve in Japan because of a widespread sense that the traditional contract binding companies and workers for life is up for renegotiation. Mr Kawaguchi was seeking compensation for the six years he lived away from his family, as his wife was unable to leave her job and he would have been in danger of dismissal had he refused the order to move. The court found he had 'no justified reason' to refuse the transfer. 'I think it is a terrible thing that a father misses seeing his children grow,' he says. 'No, I don't believe that work itself is the only thing in life. You have to enjoy life and share things with your family. The company told me I was selfish when I first complained, but I think companies are too strong in Japan. Life has many aspects: your family, the company and the community, and you can't only devote yourself to the company,' said this mild-mannered and polite rebel. A survey of salaried workers of Mr Kawaguchi's kind by Meiji Mutual Life Insurance suggested 66.5 per cent believed that a merit-based system of employment will take root in Japan, replacing the hierarchy that rewards time-serving and suffering in silence. Asked what they most wanted from their companies, 44.5 per cent of the 800 salaried workers surveyed said 'work worth working for', while 42.6 per cent wanted employment that used their skills; 35 per cent said 'working at my pace', which means allowing time for personal priorities. Only 17.1 per cent selected 'higher salary'. But the Kawaguchi case suggests change will not come as quickly as the salarymen would like. The Tokyo district court ruled it is 'not unfair' for a company to transfer an employee to a distant post: 'A transfer order cannot be considered illegal on the ground that it harms the stability of a family or changes the children's educational environment.' Mr Kawaguchi is likely to appeal against the court's decision, but he will also keep his job at Teikoku Hormone. He was careful to play by the company's rules and wants to serve out his time until retirement. The company says it has no reason to dismiss him, but also no cause to regret the original transfer. 'We gave a very normal and reasonable order at the time. It is a common thing in Japanese society and the court judgment naturally reflected that,' Teikoku Hormone said. 'We have no intention to fire him. He is performing his sales work normally, doing the average job.'</p>

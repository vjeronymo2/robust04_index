			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW CZECH LEADER ORDERS AMNESTY FOR UP TO 30,000  </P> <P> Newly installed President Vaclav Havel, a playwright who spent five years in  jail as a dissident, announced a nationwide amnesty Monday that could cover up  to 30,000 prisoners.  </P> <P> In an announcement read on television, he said he will free all prisoners  facing or serving sentences of up to two years for crimes committed  deliberately, and also prisoners with terms of three years for crimes committed  out of negligence.  </P> <P> Those with longer sentences would have up to half remitted.  </P> <P> The amnesty does not cover people charged with abuse of public position,  including former Communist officials, and with a number of criminal offenses  such as murder, armed robbery and rape.  </P> <P> Petr Uhl, a member of a government committee set up to investigate prison  conditions, estimated that about 40,000 people are imprisoned in  Czechoslovakia. He said that up to three-quarters of them apparently would be  eligible for amnesty.  </P> <P> Dozens of political prisoners have already been released under an amnesty  granted by former President Gustav Husak. He acted last year after huge  pro-democracy protests and the fall of Communist hard-liners.  </P> <P> Havel, who took office last week, was jailed for his dissident activities by  the former government.  </P> <P> In a New Year's message before the amnesty announcement, Havel pledged to lift  his country from a mire of political hypocrisy.  </P> <P> "The worst thing is that we live in a contaminated moral environment . . .  because we became used to saying something different from what we thought,"  Havel declared. He called on Czechoslovakia to rediscover its self-confidence  and help Europe restore the concept of morality in politics.  </P></p>

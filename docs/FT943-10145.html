			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: What's in a name? Annie Armandias is a senior sales secretary for London stockbrokers, Crosby Securities. The firm does not provide an occupational pension scheme, so she is keen to take out a personal pension plan to ensure an adequate retirement income. Armandias read Weekend FT articles about the merits of fee-based advice and wants to find an independent fee-based adviser to avoid any commission bias on the selection of the plan. We suggested she should try the Money Management register to obtain a list of firms in her area and follow the selection technique explained in the story above. A list arrived promptly and Armandias set to work. 'The register does not give any indication of the quality of advice offered, so it is essential to follow the selection procedure to find which are pensions experts and which simply sell pensions along with every other insurance product,' she said. Out of six names one in particular, Aspen Actuaries &amp; Pension Consultants, seemed to meet all her requirements at a reasonable price. 'This company I liked very much. They were courteous and explained everything precisely to me but did not make me feel like an idiot.' She said product selection was based on four main criteria: investment performance, expenses, administration and the stability of the organisation. The firm is independent and has been trading for six years as a specialist pensions adviser. Aspen has seven fully-qualified actuaries who are also associates of the Pensions Management Institute (PMI). The rest of the consultants are training for professional qualifications. The firm has 70 corporate pension clients and 250 individual clients. Aspen's fee for a typical personal pension is approximately Pounds 400, plus VAT, which can be paid by cheque or deducted from a commission. The rest of the commission would be reinvested in the plan. Armandias was also interested in two other advisers but was concerned about the rate charged by one and the fact that the second would not give details of fees by phone. If you have a straightforward request or problem to sort out, then getting a fixed quote for the job is vital. Advisers who take commission may be under pressure to sell but, with fee-based advisers, time is money and there may be a temptation to make the case more complicated than it is.</p>

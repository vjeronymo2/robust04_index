			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Irish overnight rate raised as pressure on punt grows CURRENCY TENSIONS inside the European exchange rate mechanism intensified yesterday after Ireland's central bank was forced to announce a sharp rise in money market interest rates to try to halt selling of the punt. The Irish authorities announced that the overnight rate for lending punts would be raised from 14 per cent to 50 per cent, effective from today. The move came after the currency fell to its ERM floor against two of the strongest currencies in the system, the Belgian franc and the Dutch guilder. The Irish authorities continued to pledge that there would be no devaluation of the currency. Mr Bertie Ahern, Ireland's finance minister, said yesterday that he 'unequivocally and consistently supported the existing parity of the punt'. The announcement of the rise in rates came after official ERM trading had closed at 4pm London time. However, it was not enough to stop the punt trading below its floors against the Belgian franc and Dutch guilder in late trading in London. By contrast, the French franc appreciated sharply against the D-Mark, following a strong show of determination by the French and German central banks earlier this week to defend the currency's existing ERM parity. The franc rose by more than a centime against the D-Mark, closing at FFr3.409 in London. It closed at FFr3.40525 in New York. French money market rates also eased, with the overnight rate falling to 12 1/2 per cent from 15 per cent on Tuesday. Dealers in the French franc and the punt were waiting to see whether the Bundesbank would ease its interest rates at its fortnightly council meeting today. However, the Bundesbank announced that there would be no press conference following the council meeting, which is sometimes interpreted as a sign that there will be no change in rates. Speculation of a possible easing in German rates continued to help sterling. The pound gained another pfennig to close at DM2.52, after gaining nearly 6 pfennigs the previous day. But sterling was slightly weaker against the dollar, closing at Dollars 1.5420 against Dollars 1.5455 on Tuesday. In New York it closed at DM2.52025 and Dollars 1.5423. The punt closed in London at BFr53.90 and Fl 2.9505 - levels broadly held in New York. The selling of punts followed two days of relative calm since Ireland lifted its exchange controls at the beginning of the year. Mr Jim O'Leary of Davy Stockbrokers of Dublin, said: 'The removal of exchange controls in their entirety on the first of January has permitted a type of speculative attack on the Irish pound that was hitherto not possible.' Dealers said selling of the punt had been exacerbated by doubts about the Bundesbank's intentions on interest rates and uncertainty about whether a new coalition government due to be formed next week would continue to maintain the punt's parity within the ERM. Some also pointed to remarks made on Monday evening by Mr Ahern that the coalition might have to review the country's exchange rate policy if pressures in the EMS continued.

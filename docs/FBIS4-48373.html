			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Michel Cariou] </F>   [Text] Libreville, May 17 (AFP) -- About 50 would-be  illegal immigrants drowned overnight in a shipwreck off the  Gabonese coast near Cape Esterias as they sought to make their  way into the country, police said Tuesday [17 May].    Paramilitary police and firemen went Tuesday to rescue  survivors from the disaster, who were thought to be of West  African origin, but the precise number and nationalities of the  victims was not clear.    Early in February, 67 illegal immigrants, mainly Ghanaians  and Nigerians, died in their crowded cell at a paramilitary  police base in Libreville, sparking an international protest and  a Gabonese government enquiry.    People from other West African countries are attracted by  the  relative prosperity of Gabon, which until last year had the  highest income per head in the region. The minimum wage is  still higher than in other countries.    For clandestine travellers, the sea trip is the most  perilous  part of the journey. They travel in pirogues, generally owned  by Nigerians, which can carry up to 80 people. The voyage from  Nigeria to Gabon takes five or six days, with port calls in  Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, where the ferrymen engage in  more or less shady trading activities.    It is not uncommon for the boats to be caught in storms and  shipwrecks are frequent in the Gulf of Guinea.    Already weakened by the journey and by the lack of food,  according to some survivors, the hopeful immigrants sometimes  find themselves at the mercy of unscrupulous smugglers.    One oft-used trick is deliberately to ground the pirogue on  a  bank not far offshore, where the ferrymen rob their charges of  their luggage. Some of the passengers are themselves smugglers,  carrying objects of value.    Over the years, the growth of illegal immigration and  smuggling has led to the founding of illegal ports, tucked away  on isolated shores or islands, particularly in Equatorial Guinea.</p>

			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE '80S A SPECIAL REPORT;  </P> <P> TASTE MAKERS;  </P> <P> PRESENTING THE BIG PLAYERS AND MAJOR IDEAS THAT -- FOR BETTER OR WORSE --  SHAPED THE 1980S. THIS IS CALENDAR'S FIFTH ANNUAL TASTE MAKERS REPORT, EXPANDED  THIS TIME TO COVER THE LAST 10 YEARS IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: SHOW BUSINESS  EXECS, FILM PRODUCERS, FILM DIRECTORS AND WRITERS, STAGE, TV, MUSIC, DANCE, POP  MUSIC, JAZZ, COMEDY, RADIO, ART AND RESTAURANTS.;  </P> <P> RADIO;  </P> <P> LARRY KING  </P> <P> Larry King was -- and is -- a media man for all seasons. Wherever America  looked or listened during the 1980s, King was there . . . and usually with him  were the men and women whose celebrity, dynamism, wit and wisdom defined the  decade.  </P> <P> For reasons he is even loathe to explain, King is one of a handful of media  interviewers who seems to be able to make everyone from country singers to  contract killers feel comfortable. There is a secret to it of sorts: Larry King  pulls his punches. He doesn't profess to be a journalist. He doesn't go into an  interview with pretensions of exposing or embarrassing a guest. That reputation  has given even the most wary celebrity a sense of safety in facing Larry King.  He remains the only major media maven to get a one-on-one interview with Frank  Sinatra whose hate affair with the press dates back more than 25 years.  </P> <P> In addition to his nightly radio show, aired over the Mutual Radio Network on  more stations than any other talk program in the country (heard locally over  KFI-AM), King's musings are to found in a regular column in USA Today, a  nightly hour of interviews over the Cable News Network; and in three  best-selling books.  </P> <P> At 55, King shows no signs of slacking the pace on his other ongoing programs,  despite a heart attack three years ago. His most recent book is testimony to  Larry King the survivor. "Mr. King, You're Having a Heart Attack" (Delacorte,  1989) covers his chain-smoking, Type A behavior throughout the first two-thirds  of the decade and the switch he had to make in life style following bypass  surgery.  </P> <P> In that way alone, King was typical of a nation that learned about the benefits  of exercise and the results of tobacco, alcohol and drug abuse during the  1980s.  </P> <P> The Taste Makers project was edited by David Fox, assistant Sunday Calendar  editor.

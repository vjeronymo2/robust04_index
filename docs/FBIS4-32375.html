			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 21 (CTK) -- Although it is still  not known how the Hungarian minority parties will go into  Slovakia's autumn elections, their most likely strategy is a  coalition -- either between Egyutteles [Coexistence] and the  Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH) on their own or  with the addition of the Hungarian Civic Party (MOS).    Egyutteles and the MKDH are both in the five-party coalition  government of Jozef Moravcik, while the MOS is a minor non-  parliamentary party.    The prospect of coupling with a third Hungarian party has  become something of an apple of discord between Egyutteles and  the MKDH. Initially Egyutteles propounded a coalition embracing  all four Hungarian parties in Slovakia, which the MKDH opposed.  Egyutteles now does not directly reject the idea of a three-way  coalition but it is seeking reassurances from the MOS that after  election MOS deputies will not desert the Hungarian bloc for  some right-of-center Slovak party.    The situation is further complicated by personal antipathy  between Egyutteles Chairman Miklos Duray and MOS Chairman Laszlo  Nagy, who in the past has criticized the former for nationalism.    The MKDH backs MOS admission to the loose coalition  currently  existing with Egyutteles so that, in the words of MKDH chairman  Vojtech Bugar, "not one Hungarian vote is lost"    Egyutteles deputy Edita Bauerova said at a party press  conference today that the MKDH had, however, not yet stated its  conditions for any such coalition.    A two- or three-party coalition will not affect requirements  for entry to parliament. For both, a minimum of seven per cent  of the vote is needed. Observers agree a four-party Hungarian  coalition is probably out of the question because it would  require ten percent of the vote. The Hungarian minority in  Slovakia (i.e. the voting base for the Hungarian bloc) numbers  some 560,000 people, 10.8 percent of the total population.    Egyutteles is also toying with the idea of including  candidates from the fourth minority party, the Hungarian  People's Party (MLS, also non-parliamentary) on its election  lists, as the law allows, but the MKDH does not hide its  objections to this strategy.    Whatever the outcome of these pre-electoral maneuvers,  observers believe Egyutteles and the MKDH will retain their  ability to tip the scales in favor of the anti-Meciar government.    General elections will be held in Slovakia on September 30  and October 1.</p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Clark gives Henry Moore the boot On Sunday morning huge cranes will rumble through the Somerset village of Street to remove one of its most famous landmarks. C&amp;J Clark, Britain's biggest shoe maker, is selling the giant Henry Moore sculpture which graces the lawns of its headquarters, writes Peggy Hollinger. The 3 1/2 -tonne bronze sculpture, entitled Sheep Piece, is thought to have been sold for about Pounds 2m. Although the buyer remains anonymous, it is believed that the sculpture will go abroad. Clark intends to commission another sculpture to sit in its planned retail development behind the headquarters.</p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Strathmore purchase ends search by Matthew Clark MATTHEW CLARK, maker of Stone's ginger wine and Old England British sherry, is to buy Strathmore, Scotland's leading bottled water brand, for Pounds 11m. The consideration will be paid in cash but, subject to shareholders' consent, Joseph Dunn (Bottlers), Strathmore's parent company, will subscribe for Pounds 3m of Matthew Clark ordinary shares, giving it a 7.4 per cent stake. The acquisition ends a two-year search by Matthew Clark for a bottled water or cider brand to strengthen its drinks portfolio. The group has focused its strategy on developing as a producer and distributor of drinks in the UK market after a substantial restructuring. Mr Peter Aikens, chief executive, said yesterday: 'Strathmore fits well into our plans. It is a strong brand in a high growth sector; and its potential for rapid growth will complement our existing mature and cash generative brands.' The bottled water market in Britain has been one of the fastest growing drinks sectors. Between 1984 and 1990, sales volumes rose from 80m litres to 400m litres, and the value of retail sales increased from Pounds 52m to Pounds 330m. Annual consumption per person in the UK is still far lower than in continental Europe: 8 litres a year compared with 70 litres in France, Germany and Italy. Strathmore, based at Forfar, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 452,000 last year on turnover of Pounds 4.3m. The water, extracted from a natural spring, is sold in sparkling, still, and citrus flavoured versions. It has gained a 25 per cent share of the bottled water market in the Scottish grocery sector during the past six years, but has only recently been listed by several multiple grocers south of the border. Joseph Dunn, one of Scotland's leading beer and soft drinks wholesalers, will continue to distribute Strathmore in Scotland and has agreed reciprocal distribution deals on other drinks brands with Matthew Clark. The acquisition is expected to lead to a small dilution in Matthew Clark's earnings per share this year, but to make a positive contribution in 1993-94.</p>

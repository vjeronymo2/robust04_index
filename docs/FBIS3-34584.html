In press statements published in Aden, al-Bid said  that by signing the document his party supports all the options  of the Yemeni people. He called for Yemeni coherence for the  sake of Yemen's unity and awakening.    Al-Bid accused some parties of trying to create an  atmosphere  that would prevent him from signing, adding that the signing  will take place as soon as possible.

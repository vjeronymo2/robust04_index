			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / PM takes Euro-sceptic line on EU voting crisis: Major accuses member states of 'phoney threats' as Brussels talks fail to secure agreement Mr John Major raised the stakes yesterday in the battle over enlargement of the European Union by siding decisively with Conservative Euro-sceptics as talks in Brussels broke up without agreement. Mr Major astonished the Commons by accusing other member states of using 'phoney threats' against Britain, and warning that the government was digging in for a long campaign. His language, the strongest used by any British minister during the enlargement negotiations, contrasted sharply with conciliatory comments by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. Mr Hurd, who appeared uncomfortable with Britain's hardline stance in the enlargement negotiations, said time was running out for a compromise. 'Agreement requires movement by everybody,' he said in Brussels yesterday after a meeting of the Union's foreign affairs council broke up. The council rejected three sets of Anglo-Spanish proposals aimed at protecting the ability of large member states to block decisions. The dispute threatens to delay the entry of Finland, Sweden, Austria and Norway into the Union. Mr Pieter Kooijmans, Dutch foreign minister, reflecting widespread frustration with British and Spanish brinkmanship, said: 'We are now in a crisis. That is because they cannot present any compromise as a victory for themselves.' Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, said Anglo-Spanish demands would make decision-making in a Union of 16 member states more difficult. 'We want enlargement with a reinforcement of the European Union's powers,' he said. Ministers from the applicant countries warned that tepid support for EU membership could cool further. Hopes of a compromise rest on a deal being reached at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Greece this weekend. But both Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, and Mr Javier Solana, Spanish foreign minister, said they were not optimistic. The UK and Spain are seeking to maintain voting rules which allow two large member states and one small one to muster 23 votes to block decisions. But the rest want to raise the minority blocking threshold to 27 votes to take account of the entry of the four new countries. EU diplomats said the UK and Spain proposed three formulas to safeguard their position. These were: raising the blocking minority to 25 votes, a UK proposal; making it impossible to outvote countries representing more than 100m or more people; or adding a legally binding protocol to the Maastricht treaty which would allow countries mustering 23 votes to postpone decisions indefinitely. In the Commons, many Conservatives roared their approval at question time as Mr Major told MPs: 'We are determined to negotiate in Brussels, to fight Britain's corner hard, just as hard as every other nation would fight for themselves. We will not be moved by phoney threats to delay enlargement. There is ample time to complete the enlargement process. If there is delay, it will be because certain other member states, two in particular, have taken an inflexible and doctrinaire line.' Downing Street said Mr Major's remarks were aimed at Belgium and the Netherlands, which were believed to have blocked agreement in spite of the willingness of other states to settle on terms acceptable to Britain and Spain. Mr Major also launched a bitter attack on Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, who has urged the government to agree to a blocking minority of 27 votes. In comments seen as laying the groundwork for a nationalistic Tory campaign for June's European elections, Mr Major described Mr Smith as 'Monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels'.

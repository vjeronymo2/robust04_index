			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PROBLEMS CAUSED BY BALBOA CRUISERS  </P> <P> I live on the Balboa peninsula, a residential community now in its third year  under siege by the out-of-town adolescent scofflaws known as "cruisers." They  swarm through our neighborhoods, creating chaos and gridlock with impunity. Our  homes are rocked by the outlandish din of their thundering stereos, blaring  horns, roaring engines, snarling motorcycles, screeching brakes, piercing  whistles and maniacal shrieks, screams and howls.  </P> <P> Our city authorities, who welcomed the vanguard of the youthful invaders in the  spring of 1986 with assurances that they wanted "everybody to have a good time"  and wouldn't "rain on anyone's parade," have steadfastly refused to take any  effective action to discourage the "cruisers" and restore order. The  installation of permanent Permit Only Lane traffic signs crushed whatever  lingering hopes we residents harbored that the city administration would act to  mitigate the preposterous, infuriating situation.  </P> <P> Except for World War II Marine service and college out of state, I've been a  part of Balboa virtually all my life. I've seen many changes over those years  but nothing so devastating as the deterioration of the quality of life on the  peninsula since the cruisers seized control. When we residents are permitted to  come and go, enjoy a book or go to sleep is now determined by out-of-town  hooligans. We seldom have visitors because few of our friends will suffer our  blocked streets. Unless changes are made soon, I see Balboa becoming just  another drug-ridden seaside slum.  </P> <P> Balboa is virtually an American institution and its name evokes fond memories  in countless thousands who have come here over the years. Its destruction now  by the failure of one city administration to protect the rights of residents  and law-abiding visitors would be a senseless tragedy.  </P> <P> Why our Newport Beach policy-makers have permitted bedlam and near-anarchy on  the peninsula for 2 long years when we have an outstanding police force capable  of restoring order defies all reason.  </P> <P> WILLIAM J. McGEE  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Deep Regrets: "This is really getting kind of embarrassing," said Harry  Thomason, co-executive producer of CBS' "Designing Women," in reference to  Wednesday night's refueling of a feud with co-star Delta Burke during an  interview on ABC's "The Barbara Walters Special." Burke grew teary when  discussing how her complaints about her treatment risked "losing my career and  my good name and the money." Thomason repeated an earlier admission that "I did  yell and scream at her once two years ago -- and believe me, for that I am  deeply, deeply sorry . . . I really don't know what else to say."

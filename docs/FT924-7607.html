			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Swiss set to vote down entry to EEA SWISS VOTERS look likely to defy their government and reject membership of the 19-nation European Economic Area (EEA) in a referendum on December 6, Reuter reports from Geneva. A survey in two local newspapers showed that only six, mainly French-speaking, cantons favoured the EEA, while another seven, all German-speaking and mostly in central Switzerland, continued to be strong opponents. The remaining 10 cantons were previously evenly divided on the issue. Three days before Sweden's parliament votes on ratification of EEA membership, an opinion poll yesterday confirmed growing opposition among voters to EC entry. According to the newspaper survey, in October, opponents of the EC leapt to 43 per cent from 38 per cent in April-May. Supporters dwindled to 35 per cent from 39 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR WHEELS: SQUEEZING BY WITH HELP OF LEMON LAW  </P> <P> Question: I have repeatedly had to return my new Chevrolet to the dealer for  different repairs. The engine computer went out once, stranding me. Since then,  the engine doesn't seem to run right. The power door locks would not work. And  just recently, the automatic transmission seems to be making a loud clunk every  time it shifts. I am worried I have a lemon. I have heard there is something  called a lemon law. What is it and how do I use it? -- N.G.  </P> <P> Answer: The vast majority of problems on new cars, even difficult ones that  defy the first repair attempt, can be solved without invoking lemon laws, but  occasionally a car is so badly built that a motorist has no alternative but to  do legal battle with the manufacturer.  </P> <P> Most states, including California, have lemon laws that give new car owners  specific legal rights. But the lemon laws require that a series of specific  steps be taken to solve the problem.  </P> <P> In California, the lemon law, which is part of 1982 amendments to the  Song-Beverly Warranty Act, is administered by the New Motor Vehicle Board. An  owner must have a car that's less than a year old and have fewer than 12,000  miles to use the law.  </P> <P> A motorist must make four or more attempts to have the dealer fix a single  problem before he or she can proceed under the law; alternatively, a motorist  must be able to show that the dealer was unable to fix all of the problems on a  car within 30 working days at the garage.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Into Arbitration  </P> <P> If these conditions are met, the motorist must contact the manufacturer in  writing about the failure of the authorized dealer to make the repairs under  the warranty. At this point, the owner and the manufacturer are ready to go  into third-party arbitration.  </P> <P> A variety of organizations can fill the third-party role. Manufacturers use the  Better Business Bureau, the American Automobile Assn. or the Automotive  Consumer Action Assn., which is sponsored through the National Automotive  Dealers Assn. Some manufacturers, such as Ford and Chrysler, have their own  arbitration boards. Some, such as Hyundai, do not offer arbitration.  </P> <P> Decisions made by the third-party arbitrator are binding on the manufacturer,  but they can be appealed by the consumer through the state civil courts. That's  where the lemon law's specific protections come into play.  </P> <P> The law puts the burden of proof on the manufacturer to show that the car is  not a lemon. If you win the case in court, the manufacturer has an obligation  to buy back or replace the car. But most cases don't go that far. The New Motor  Vehicle Board can help resolve disputes between consumers and dealers or  manufacturers. The board handles about 150 calls per day. Its telephone number  is (916) 445-1888.  </P> <P> The New Motor Vehicle Board is separate from the California Bureau of  Automotive Repair, which licenses and regulates repair facilities. It helps  resolve disputes between consumers and repair garages or dealer service  departments. Its toll-free number is (800) 952-5210.  </P> <P> Q: You recently wrote about gas-line antifreeze and said isopropyl is safe to  use. It seems to me that most antifreeze is methanol. Which should I use? --  M.S.  </P> <P> A: You are right that methanol is the most common anti-icing additive for fuel  lines, but most types of alcohols will work. Ethanol, another type of alcohol  that is made from grain, also acts as an anti-icing agent. It has an affinity  for water and picks up moisture throughout the fuel system. By moving the water  out of the tank and fuel lines, you avoid having it freeze.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Commercial Additive  </P> <P> It's best to buy a commercial anti-icing additive that contains the correct  concentration of alcohol.  </P> <P> But unless you have a specific problem with your fuel system, you probably  don't need to add anything. Major gasoline brands contain an anti-icing agent  that should provide all the protection necessary.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vartabedian cannot answer mail personally but will respond in this column to  automotive questions of general interest.

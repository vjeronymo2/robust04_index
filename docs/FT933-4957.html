			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Ukraine deal with Russia under attack OPPOSITION is growing to Ukraine's agreement to sell its half of the Black Sea Fleet, and to return its nuclear warheads, to Russia. Ukraine has thereby put itself into political crisis. The agreement, announced by President Leonid Kravchuk and President Boris Yeltsin after talks on Friday, was denounced over the weekend by a Ukrainian minister, Mr Valery Shmarov. It was described by a deputy premier as 'nothing short of a disaster' and by Mr Vyacheslav Chornovil, head of the nationalist opposition party, Rukh, as 'high treason'. Mr Kravchuk himself partly defended, partly denied, his alleged agreement to the deal. General Konstantin Morozov, defence minister, said yesterday that no agreement on the sale of the Ukrainian fleet had yet been concluded. Mr Kravchuk stressed that details of both the sale of the fleet and the transfer of the warheads had to be worked out by joint commissions. Mr Yeltsin said after the meeting that the cost of the fleet would be set against an estimated Dollars 2.5bn which Kiev owes to Moscow for oil and gas supplies. The Russian president, in a television interview on Saturday, rubbed the message home by saying that Ukraine's surrender of her share of the fleet - agreed to be split last year - was 'forced but inevitable'. The costs, he said, 'will have to be reckoned up. But we have done our own reckoning already. We aren't losing by it, and we'll have our own fleet'. Mr Kravchuk, who has appeared in the past month to switch from a line generally hostile to Russia to one where he favours closer integration, now faces the hardest challenge of his political life. Confronted with 40 per cent inflation, falling production and growing unrest in the industrial areas - especially in the Donbass coal and steel region - he must now garner support for a policy of allegiance with Russia, and a loss of some of the strongly-expressed independence whose spokesman he has been.</p>

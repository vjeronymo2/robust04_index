			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Claims threaten proceeds of British Coal sale The government faces a potential fall in proceeds from selling British Coal following an increase of more than Pounds 160m in claims against the corporation from opencast contractors. Some of the prospective bidders for the corporation's five regions say they will have to revise downwards their proposed tenders to take account of the claims, which can arise if unexpected mining obstacles are encountered. The level of outstanding claims has risen threefold in three months to Pounds 242m. Prospective bidders will be expected to meet at least some of the claims if they win their bids. Under opencast payment procedures, contractors put in a bid to British Coal, which owns the coal, on how much they will charge to mine a site. Stiff competition has forced down the tender prices in recent years. Contractors can increase their earnings if they successfully claim for unforeseen circumstances such as geological difficulties. There is concern that some companies making claims are both opencast mining contractors to British Coal and prospective bidders for the corporation. Rivals say they are being put at a disadvantage because they cannot assess as accurately as the claimants how much is likely to have to be paid. Significant fluctuations in total claims are unusual: the Pounds 76m level three months ago is considered within the industry to be nearer the norm than the current Pounds 242m total. Most of the new claims are in Scotland, where the total is Pounds 129m, against Pounds 25m three months ago. Claims in south Wales are Pounds 76m (Pounds 25m three months ago), the north-east of England Pounds 25.6m (Pounds 21m) and the central north and central south regions a combined Pounds 12.5m (Pounds 5m). If all the claims were to be paid, the government might have to pay bidders to take some regions off its hands. 'The Scotland region is worth considerably less than Pounds 129m,' one bidder said. However, some of the claims are likely to be met by British Coal before the regions are handed over. British Coal usually pays less than the amount claimed, but all bidders have access to records showing the normal proportion paid. Claimants are privately defending the increases, saying they are bound to flag up all the potential difficulties at the sites being mined before ownership changes. Bidders for the five regional packages must put in their tenders by September 14. An announcement on preferred candidates is expected either later in the month or in October to enable ownership to be transferred on December 24.</p>

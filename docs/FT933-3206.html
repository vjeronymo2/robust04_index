			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / People: Departures Richard Jewson is stepping down as chairman and chief executive of Meyer International, the timber supplier which owns the Jewson chain of builders' merchants. The move, announced yesterday, follows the board's decision to split the roles of chairman and chief executive in line with the Cadbury committee recommendations and to seek a non-executive chairman. Jewson, 49, who became chairman in 1991, will continue to act as chairman until the end of December when he will leave the board in order to develop his career 'in other areas'. Yesterday he explained that while he did not disagree with his board's decision to divide the two roles, he did not want to become a non-executive chairman, having worked 'hands-on'; nor did he wish to go back to being chief executive, his earlier post. He said he has 'some ideas' for what he might do next, but added that he did not want to rush to any decisions. He has been succeeded as chief executive by John Dobby who joined the group in 1959, has served as a director since 1983 and was appointed managing director in October 1991.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In light of new information received since publication of the final rule, the EPA has concluded that the compliance date for surge control vessels and bottoms receivers should be the same as that for process vents and other equipment subject to subpart G, i.e., April 22, 1997. Due to the widespread need for the additional time to design, purchase, install, and permit new equipment, the EPA proposes to revise the compliance date to April 22, 1997 for all sources subject to the provisions of &sect;63.170. This proposed language is presented in &sect;63.100(k)(7) of subpart F and &sect;63.190(e)(6) of subpart I.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Revisions to &sect;63.170 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the concern with the achievability of the compliance dates, the EPA has received numerous inquiries regarding the definition of surge control vessels and the distinction between surge control vessels (and bottoms receivers) and storage vessels. The EPA has concluded from these discussions that this confusion is partially attributable to the fact that the present definition for surge control vessel is too broad and implies that any vessel that is not a storage vessel, e.g., knockout pot, is a surge control vessel. A revised definition for ``surge control vessel'' is being proposed to clarify that the term is limited to vessels that are within the process unit to provide in-process storage, mixing or management of flow rates or volumes to assist in production of a product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Even with this revised definition, the EPA recognizes that considerable overlap will remain between vessels used for storage of materials, storage vessels, and equipment that meets the definition of surge control vessels or bottoms receivers. This is expected because the equipment is frequently indistinguishable in terms of structure, size, materials of construction, and materials stored. In many cases, these items of equipment may be distinguished only after reviewing process diagrams to determine whether the chemicals in the vessel will undergo further processing steps at the chemical manufacturing process unit. The EPA is aware that in some cases surge control vessels and other unit operations have been regulated as storage vessels although the function of the particular vessels was not for storage of feed materials or product. This classification probably occurred because the equipment is physically indistinguishable from other containers used for storage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To minimize the confusion over appropriate categorization of equipment, the EPA believes it would be most appropriate to apply the same control criteria to surge control vessels and bottoms receivers that are applied to storage vessels in subpart G. This approach should provide a workable solution to the problem by eliminating the remaining differences between the two categories of equipment and should avoid creating unforeseen problems. An additional consideration in this decision was that this approach would involve only minimal changes to the present text of the rule. Given the length and complexity of the HON as a whole, the EPA thinks such a change would be understood more readily and with fewer implementation delays. If surge control vessels and bottoms receivers were addressed in subpart G, substantial redrafting would be required throughout subpart G. Therefore, the EPA considered this alternative to have a greater potential for creating more issues and confusion than if the problem were addressed in subpart H.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The use of the storage vessel control criteria is also considered appropriate for the following reasons. First, it would take considerable time, perhaps as much as 1 to 2 years, to gather the necessary information and establish separate control requirements for surge control vessels and bottoms receivers. Second, information presently available to the EPA indicates that surge control vessels and bottoms receivers have been regulated as storage vessels in a number of cases. Third, the range of physical characteristics and operating conditions of surge control vessels and bottoms receivers appears to substantially overlap that of storage vessels. Although the EPA does not have quantitative data on the characteristics and controls of surge control vessels and bottoms receivers, EPA considers the storage vessel information to provide the best available data on the characteristics of surge control vessels and bottoms receivers. Therefore, the EPA believes the MACT floor analysis and selection of the standard analysis for storage vessels are adequate for surge control vessels and bottoms receivers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Compressors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provisions of &sect;63.164 require the use of mechanical seals equipped with a barrier-seal system and controlled degassing of the barrier fluid or enclosure of the compressor seal area and venting of emissions through a closed-vent system to a control device. The standard also allows designation of a compressor as being subject to a 500 ppm performance standard. These provisions are consistent with the provisions in existing equipment leak standards in 40 CFR parts 60 and 61. Because no public comments were received that identified categories of compressors or types of changes that justified compliance times longer than the 6 to 18 months provided in the proposed rule, the EPA concluded that case-by-case extensions would be sufficient to address any implementation problems that might arise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the final rule was issued, the EPA has received new information that indicates it is infeasible for some sources subject to the October 24, 1994 compliance date to comply with the compressor provisions in the allotted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6-month compliance period. In the development of the equipment leak rule, the EPA treated control of compressors as requiring similar lead times and control measures as those required for control of pumps. It has since been determined that significant differences exist in the time required to make the necessary equipment changes for compressors. In particular for some compressors, compliance with the provisions of &sect;63.164 requires replacement of an existing mechanical seal system or identification of an alternative barrier fluid system. Because compressors are individually designed for each process and for the expected range of operating conditions (pressure, temperature, chemicals in the process, etc.), selection of replacement seal or barrier fluid systems requires case-by-case engineering evaluation and equipment specification. Replacement of a seal system or barrier fluid system for a compressor could involve significant capital outlay and always requires careful planning and evaluation to ensure continued proper operation of the compressor. For projects of this nature, the time required to conduct and complete such an assessment, write equipment specifications, bid and purchase the equipment is roughly 1 year. Actual installation of the replacement seal or barrier fluid system reportedly can be completed within 1 week. Thus, the EPA believes that 1 year is the minimum feasible period for installation of required equipment. Therefore, the EPA is proposing to revise the compliance date for compressors at process units subject to the October 24, 1994 and January 23, 1995 compliance dates to April 24, 1995. The proposed language is presented in new paragraph &sect;63.100(k)(4) in subpart F and &sect;63.190(e)(3) in subpart I.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

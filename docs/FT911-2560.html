			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Letter: Taxing arguments as seen from Britain's north and south (1) Sir, Mr. Michael Heseltine claimed in the House of Commons last Tuesday that his new Council Tax would be related to a local authority's spending - the only acknowledgement to the principle of accountability in his whole speech. Unfortunately, his failure to make any changes to the National Non-Domestic Rate (NNBR) and the Standard Spending Assessment (SSA) method of revenue support grant distribution makes this claim unlikely. The NNDR will remain a national tax earmarked for local government. The decision of the government to increase its revenue support for local government by raising VAT merely exacerbates the problem that most of a local authority's income is not under its control. Relatively minor increases in expenditure will have a major impact on the Council Tax, the only source of an authority's variable income. In addition to this gearing effect, there remains the inefficiency of the SSA on which grant distribution is based. The SSA is objectionable in principle since it assumes that Whitehall knows better than a local council what its needs are. The SSA is objectionable in practice because of its unreliability. It is unreliable because year to year changes may have a serious impact on a council's grant entitlement. For example, Salford City Council had to reduce a standstill budget by Pounds 8m this financial year and still increase its Poll Tax by Pounds 44 - all because of amendments to its SSA which led to grant loss. The SSA is also open to political manipulation. It is incomprehensible to most in local government why authorities such as Westminster can gain so much in grant because of the weighting given in the SSAs to the number of tourists visiting an authority. It is incomprehensible why tourists - usually a sign of prosperity - should be seen as a burden on the local taxpayer at all. D Antrobus, 191 Manchester Road, Swinton, Manchester M27</p>

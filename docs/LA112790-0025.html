			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Tony Togs: Buckingham Palace on Sunday released the glamour photographs of  Princess Di ahead of their publication in the December issue of British Vogue  magazine. All the pictures -- taken by American photographer Patrick  Demarchelier -- show her wearing off-the-shoulder evening dresses with a  sophisticated, swept-back hairstyle and dark eye makeup.  </P> <P> Lie Down: A group of London lawyers demonstrated last week what some people had  long suspected -- they are Britain's best liars. The barristers easily snowed  bankers, models, real estate agents and clergymen in a tournament of Perudo, a  dice game in which players must lie to win. "I reserve my right to remain  silent," said lawyer Clare Montgomery. "(Lying) is an essential life skill,"  said player Carl Hindmarch, a magazine editor. Whether the two were lying was  not discussed.  </P> <P> What Recession?: Celebrities fanned out over Beverly Hills during the  Thanksgiving weekend, shopping for Christmas. At the posh Fred Hayman boutique  on Rodeo Drive, Vanna White of TV's "Wheel of Fortune" bought a cocktail suit  for her holiday parties in Aspen, and actress Jill St. John picked up presents  for her first Christmas with Robert Wagner, whom she married in May.  </P> <P> Maiden Flight: The hot trading card market, already booming with baseball,  hockey, football, basketball, bowling and golf cards, is going into higher  orbit. The Space-Shots series from a Gulfport, Miss., business pays tribute to  Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee, who died in the launch-pad fire of the  Apollo I spacecraft in 1967. The new business is being launched by Ed White  III, son of the astronaut.  </P></p>

In the morning, the National Assembly  deputies discussed a draft law on environment protection. In the  afternoon, they discussed a draft law on business bankruptcy."  You, friends, are invited to listen to the following report on  the National Assembly's group discussions on the draft law on  environmental protection:    "The National Assembly reserved the whole morning session  for  deputies to discuss the draft law on environmental protection.  The general views expressed by almost all the deputies at their  group discussions asserted the need to promptly promulgate an  environment law. Many deputies agreed with the goals of the  draft law, namely, to prevent and overcome bad consequences  caused by human beings and nature; and to rationally regulate  the exploitation and use of the environment in support of  long-term national construction."    Deputies contributed their views on every single chapter of  the draft law. A Kien Giang Province deputy said the contents of  the draft law were too general, especially with those measures  to deal with environment violations. A Ho Chi Minh city deputy  asked that the phrase "The Right to Live in a Healthy  Environment Is a Human Right" be added to the preamble.    "The feasibility of this law was fervently discussed by the  deputies. Many of them maintained that to make it possible for  the law on environmental protection to enter into life, we  should delegate localities with more powers, set up a government  agency to provide guidance for environmental protection  activities, and draw up clear-cut measures to deal with  environment law violations."    Deputies from Minh Hai, Kien Giang, Hanoi, and Ho Chi Minh  City said environmental pollution in urban areas is now  relatively grave due to the presence of many heaps of garbage  and the poor maintenance of public toilets.    Agriculturally, deputies from Ha Tay, Hoa Binh, Vinh Phu,  and  An Giang Provinces also complained about the indiscrimate use of  insecticide by peasants, and this, according to them, has  adversely affected livestocks and food products. Some deputies  said overuse of fertilizer and insecticide has resulted in the  extinction of almost all of useful creatures in ricefields such  as frogs, crabs, and mollusks. A deputy denounced a paint  factory in Ha Tay for pouring its industrial waste into the Song  Nghe River, polluting it and killing fish in its hatcheries.    Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province Deputy Do Quoc Hung said:  [begin recording] I think it is very necessary to  promulgate this law, especially in the current circumstance. I  agree with the proposal that we call this law the law on  environmental protection [end recording].    Recommending measures to overcome the state of environmental  pollution, Kien Giang Province Deputy Nguyen Duc Thang said:  [begin recording] In the Mekong River Delta, we  should do away with the presence of latrines built along  irrigation canals and ditches if we want to keep our environment  clean and beautiful [end recording].    Deputies from Ha Tay and Hoa Binh Provinces stated that  while  our country is stepping up the industrial process and broadening  cooperation with foreign countries, the prompt promulgation of a  law on environmental protection is very necessary.    Ha Tay Province Deputy Nguyen Phuc Dinh said: [begin  recording]It is very necessary for the fourth session of  the Ninth National Assembly to pass the law on environmental  protection. This is because in national industrialization, we  must specify which chemicals are toxic and harmful to health and  which are not [end recording].</p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Arts: Jessye Norman IN RECENT years Jessye Norman has elected to tackle some of opera's most 'extreme' heroines - Bartok's Judith and the unnamed protagonist of Schoenberg's monodrama Erwartung, Isolde and Salome. The majority of these have already been sampled, in some form or another, in London; little that she has done here has been quite as impressive as her concert account of Erwartung at the Barbican Hall on Thursday, in company with Pierre Boulez and the London Symphony Orchestra. On the face of it there might be thought a certain lack of 'match' between the soprano and at least some of these ladies. Certainly, the Schoenberg monodrama - a miraculously fine-woven, subtly-coloured musical marriage of nightmare, Freudian psychological analysis and prose-poem, in which a woman searches in a wood for a lost lover whose body she suddenly discovers - would seem to require an altogether different kind of artistic profile. The stream-of-consciousness narration calls for spontaneous utterance, wide emotional range, nimble alternation of moods from quiet reflection to furious torment. The mature Norman style is monumental - the stance and demeanour totemic, the bronze streams of tone grandly poured out, then channelled by minute calculation in the shaping and shading of every word. Mercurial responsiveness finds no place in the delivery. And yet, because all the singer's considerable intelligence had been concentrated on the task, the experience developed a mesmeric power all its own. The presence on the podium of Boulez was, in the best sense, a counterweight to monumentality: his handling of those intricate Schoenbergian thought-patterns was itself a miracle of balance - of nervous energy sustained, dramatic impulse disciplined, musical imagery lucidly traced. The old view of Erwartung as one long overwrought Expressionist torrent seemed light-years distant. concert sponsored by the Sema Group; repeated at the Barbican Hall tonight</p>

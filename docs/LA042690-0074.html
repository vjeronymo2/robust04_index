			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: SCALING MOUNTAIN OF S&amp;L DEBT  </P> <P> The new figure for the savings and loan bailout is $500 billion. For those who  are unable to comprehend this amount, just put one-half trillion dollars on  your kitchen table.  </P> <P> There are some people who say that $500 billion isn't what it used to be, but  for the lower middle class, it's still a sum not to be sneezed at.  </P> <P> You can build 500 Taj Mahals in Atlantic City for $500 billion. For $500  billion, Donald Trump can even make a reasonable divorce settlement with his  wife. It will also buy you one of Imelda Marcos's buildings in New York City or  two orchestra seats to any Broadway musical.  </P> <P> While nervous Nellies think of the $500 billion as a debt, others look at it as  nothing more than a tall mountain of paper that reaches up to the sky.  </P> <P> Cleveland Franklin, who specializes in bailouts, invited me to climb the  largest mountain of bad paper that the country has ever seen. It's located in  what is now known as the Vale of Greed.  </P> <P> He tied a rope around me and handed me some grappling hooks.  </P> <P> "Follow me up," he shouted. "The base of the mountain is made of junk bonds.  Above the clouds it's all real estate loans."  </P> <P> "It sure stinks," I said. "How could this country build such a tall stack of  debt in such a short time?"  </P> <P> "The banks just kept making loans, and every time someone couldn't repay them,  the S&amp;L rolled it up into a ball of paper and tossed it on the pile."  </P> <P> "But it's awesome!"  </P> <P> "You have no idea how many bad loans they made. I'm going to pull you up onto  this ledge. It's very famous."  </P> <P> "What is it called?"  </P> <P> "The Grotto of the Gang of Five. Legend has it that five senators met with a  savings and loan medicine man on this very outcropping and blew smoke at each  other. This kept evil spirits from hurting the medicine man and, in exchange,  he showered gifts on the senators."  </P> <P> "Is he still alive?" I asked.  </P> <P> "Yes, but all the deadbeat paper on the next two levels belongs to him."  </P> <P> Both of us struggled upward. Cleveland handed me a flask of oxygen.  </P> <P> "You can get a good view from here," he said, as we tied ourselves to another  ledge. "You see those carcasses down there."  </P> <P> "There are a lot of them."  </P> <P> "They are all dead S&amp;Ls. They were abandoned by their avaricious owners."  </P> <P> "The S&amp;Ls deserved better than that."  </P> <P> "We're almost to the top. You can never say that you have reached the summit of  an S&amp;L debt, because tomorrow it's bound to be higher."  </P> <P> I was excited. "I never thought that one day I would be standing on top of $500  billion worth of red ink."  </P> <P> "This mountain represents more than lost causes," Cleveland told me. "This debt  has become an environmental hazard. It smells all the way from New Jersey to  Texas. Someday it's going to smother California."  </P> <P> "Can we go back down? I'm beginning to feel nervous. There could be an  avalanche of fresh debt at any time."  </P> <P> "Don't worry. You can't get hurt. It's only paper."  </P></p>

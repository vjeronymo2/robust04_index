			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NHL;  </P> <P> C'MON, HOWE HAS HAD ENOUGH COMEBACKS  </P> <P> Gordie Howe said Wednesday he would like to wait until his 11-year-old grandson  makes it to the National Hockey League so that he can make another comeback and  play with him, just as he made a comeback to play with his sons, Mark and  Marty, until he was past 50.  </P> <P> Let's say his grandson, Travis Gordon, is at least seven years away from the  NHL. Howe would be 68 then.  </P> <P> Crazy? Is it any crazier than the talk about him coming back at 61 to play on a  line with Wayne Gretzky?  </P> <P> Oh, he was joking about the grandson comeback?  </P> <P> So what? This whole furor over his comeback started out as a joke. Or at least  as teasing. He mentioned it first at the Hall of Fame dinner to Richard Gordon,  owner of the Hartford Whalers, the team he last played for and the team he  still works for. Back East, the first flurry of stories concerned a one-game  comeback with the Whalers after New Year's, so he could claim to have played in  six decades.  </P> <P> Gordon originally thought it sounded like a good idea, but then started to back  off. Gordon was quoted in the Hartford Courant as saying: "I haven't thought  about all the ramifications. It reminds me of, 'What's a person's last wish?'  </P> <P> "I want to do what's right for Gordie. We've got to discuss this with the  general manager, the coaching staff and the players."  </P> <P> And when the idea was compared to the publicity stunt that Chicago White Sox  owner Bill Veeck pulled when he sent a midget up to bat, Gordon said: "Are you  saying I'm turning the greatest hockey player into a midget?"  </P> <P> It would be hard to pass off Howe's one-game comeback as an attempt to improve  a team and win a hockey game. It wouldn't exactly be a publicity stunt, but it  would be more ceremonial than serious.  </P> <P> Gordon turned the matter over to NHL President John Ziegler for consideration  regarding questions of "roster, insurance and league image."  </P> <P> When Howe arrived in Los Angeles to await Gretzky's breaking of his scoring  record, he joked in the locker room that he would like to make the one-game  comeback after New Year's and "challenge the little guy to do that."  </P> <P> Owner Bruce McNall of the Kings, asked if he would let Howe play for his team,  said it would be a fun thing to do, that the fans would enjoy it, that it would  be an honor for the Kings and that he would like to "accommodate" whatever Howe  wants.  </P> <P> Coach Tom Webster of the Kings said it was "a nice idea to try to do something  for this man who did so much for hockey."  </P> <P> Through the league, Howe's wife, Colleen, called it "a fantasy which will be  given some further thought."  </P> <P> Gretzky has said that if Howe wants to extend his five-decade record to six  decades, he needn't bother. "I think five decades is a safe record," Gretzky  said.  </P> <P> With his idol sitting at his side Wednesday, Gretzky was asked how he would  feel about playing with Howe again. Gretzky said: "If there's anyone who can  play at this age, it's Gordie. People say, 'He's 61.' But believe me, I know he  can take care of himself out there. If Gordie wants to play, I'm sure he can  play."  </P> <P> Howe has said much the same thing, sort of: "I wouldn't want to just stand out  there. How does John Candy look on blades? If I get there, Walter Gretzky  (Wayne's father) would probably want to suit up, too."  </P> <P> Next: Will Walter Gretzky skate with Wayne or wait until Wayne has a son, and  the grandson learns to skate?  </P> <P> The first NHL game pitting Soviet players against one another occurred Tuesday  night in New Jersey, and the Calgary imports ended up on the winning team.  </P> <P> This was no surprise to Viacheslav Fetisov, one of the two Soviets on the  Devils. Fetisov said of Calgary's Sergei Makarov, who won the Soviet League  scoring title nine of the last 10 seasons and who started his NHL season with  two goals and eight points in three games: "He's a player the same caliber of  Mario Lemieux or Wayne Gretzky. He's one of the strongest offensive players in  the world today."  </P> <P> Fetisov and Makarov played together on the Central Red Army team.  </P> <P> After the game, New Jersey Coach Jim Schoenfeld concluded: "We're a better team  with the Soviets. So are (the Flames). Especially with Makarov, a damn good  hockey player."  </P> <P> Mike Liut lost his ranking as Hartford's No. 1 goaltender last March, so his  start Wednesday night against Washington was his first in more than six months.  Peter Sidorkieweicz started the first two games of the season, and Kay Whitmore  started the third. In the Whalers' fourth game, Liut made 24 saves as they beat  Washington, 4-1. It was hailed as a turning point in his 11-year career.  </P> <P> Teammate Ray Ferraro said: "Lootie was kidding that never before has 24 saves  evoked such a round of enthusiasm."  </P> <P> Whaler Coach Rick Ley said he does not like a three-goalie system. "We have to  give all three a chance," he said. "But if one guy gets hot, he could become  the man. We'll have to make a decision by the end of the month."  </P> <P> Hockey Notes  </P> <P> At the end of the first week of NHL competition, the Whalers' Ron Francis was  the league's points leader. His response: "Scary, isn't it? Quick, draw me a  finish line before the other guys catch up." Francis has never had even a  100-point season. . . . Hall of Famer Guy Lafleur had three goals in his first  three games with Quebec. . . . Defenseman Doug Crossman, who played in 10 of  the Kings' 11 playoff games and then was let go in the trade for goalie Kelly  Hrudey, is the Islanders' leading scorer with eight points in four games.  </P> <P> Chicago defenseman Dave Manson was suspended for three games by the NHL for  inadvertently knocking official Ron Asselstine to the ice during a tussle with  the Rangers, after Chris Nilan poked Chicago goalie Alain Chevrier in the mask  with his stick. Manson argued that he didn't even see Asselstine: "I only had  eyes for Nilan." Blackhawk General Manager Bob Pulford was amazed by the  three-game suspension and will be watching to see if everyone who touches an  official this season gets hit with three games. By the way, Manson will be back  just in time for the Blackhawks' rematch with the Rangers Tuesday night.  </P></p>

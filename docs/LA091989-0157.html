			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> STRAWBERRY, MCREYNOLDS BENCHED FOR LEAVING DUGOUT DURING GAME  </P> <P> New York Mets Manager Davey Johnson benched outfielders Darryl Strawberry and  Kevin McReynolds today for leaving the dugout during Monday night's 10-6 loss  to the Chicago Cubs.  </P> <P> "Let's just say I was disappointed in a couple of peoples' actions and this  will give them time to think about it," Johnson said.  </P> <P> Nobody would give details, but apparently what happened was the two went into  the clubhouse Monday night and were not on the bench in the ninth inning when  the Mets rallied for two runs and had the bases loaded.  </P> <P> Strawberry had to be called back when it was his turn to bat and he struck out  for the final out of the game.  </P> <P> "I talked to them about it and told them what I expected and, obviously, I  didn't get what I expected," Johnson said.  </P></p>

Only one  of his guards was wounded in the attempt.    In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, a source close to  Shaykh  al-Ahmar said the attempt occurred in an ambush on the northern  road outside the town of 'Umran 60 km from Sanaa when the car of  a group of tribal gunmen intercepted and collided with the first  car in Shaykh al-Ahmar's motorcade which had already overtaken  it.    As the motorcade continued its journey with the shaykh's car  between two guard cars, a hail of bullets rained on the  motorcade from both sides of the road. The guards returned fire  and although the attackers concentrated their fire on the  shaykh's Mercedes, he was not hurt at all and the attackers fled.    The attempt does not seem to have any political significance  and is not linked to the current Yemeni crisis. There is  speculation that it might be related to tribal differences. The  source said that all members of the attacking group were  identified as tribal men but he did not say to which tribes they  belonged. He said that they were not from the area where the  incident occurred and that they came from other areas. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "How Much and What Type of Army Does </F> Lithuania Need?"]    [Text] Yesterday, the State Defense Council held its  meeting chaired by the president. The meeting discussed the  possibilities of producing military equipment in Lithuania. A  decision was adopted to coordinate all issues with Latvia and  Estonia, and to set up a special working group to analyze the  possibilities of its own production and assess its economic  basis.    As V. Petkevicius, chairman of the Seimas [parliament]  National Security Committee, reported to RESPUBLIKA, alongside  these problems, the meeting also dealt with technical matters in  deploying the Army and the issue of control over the airspace.  RESPUBLIKA found out that the problem of the establishment of a  peacekeeping battalion was postponed for another meeting which  will, probably, be held on 7-14 March. According to V.  Petkevicius, the "Partnership for Peace" agreement does not  oblige a single country to form peacekeeping battalions or  corps. Preliminary estimations show that the establishment of  such a battalion or a corps would require about $30 and $10-12  million, respectively. The Defense Council also had to consider  the manner in which European standards must be applied to the  Lithuanian Army. In V. Petkevicius' opinion, first of well,  Lithuania should decide how much and what type of Army it needs.  The military could claim 5 percent of the national budget at  best. Unfortunately, the purchase of fighters will have to be  abandoned, to say nothing of luxury cars for the National  Defense Ministry. According to V. Petkevicius, fighters in  Lithuania are as necessary as skis in Africa.    Speaking about the problems at the National Defense  Ministry,  the chairman of the Seimas National Security Committee noted  that measures would be applied to prevent the temptation of  dealing in arms -- a draft law regulating the purchase of arms  for Lithuanian defense structures is being prepared. The draft  law does not project that "arms will be bought by the Arms Fund  alone, and that ministries will be only contractors and experts  in arms quality." Currently, the Prosecutor General's Office is  investigating 150 cases concerning disorder at the National  Defense Ministry.</p>

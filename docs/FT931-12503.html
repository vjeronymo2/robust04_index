			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Social chapter opt-out defended THE government yesterday defended Britain's opt-out from the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty as the Commons resumed its debate on the European Communities (Amendment) Bill. Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, foreign office minister, underlined the 'change of emphasis' by the European Court of Justice when appealing to Tories opposed to the treaty not to vote against the government. He cited some recent decisions by the court as evidence that it had moved away from its earlier 'centralising and harmonising' approach. Mr Garel-Jones called on Tory opponents of the treaty to take this into account before imperilling the government's 21 majority by joining forces with Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs eager to make Britain subject to the social chapter of the treaty in the same way as the other 11 member states. Tory critics argued that it would be preferable for the Commons to insert a provision in the bill which would result in Britain becoming a party to the social chapter than for it to be forced to comply with its objectives through rulings by the European Court. Mr Jack Cunningham, the shadow foreign secretary, again disputed assertions by Mr Garel-Jones that such a change to the bill would have 'serious' consequences for the whole of the community. The minister admitted that the fears of Tory MPs who believed that the economic advantages gained by Britain's not being bound by the social chapter would lead to other member states initiating European court actions claiming unfair competition could not be dismissed as groundless. But he believed that the court had shown itself to be increasingly sensitive to the rights of national governments and less interventionist in its interpretation of EC law. The government succeeded, by a 16-vote margin, in ending the debate on the social chapter yesterday evening, but its whips still have time to mount an extensive lobbying exercise among possible rebels. Commons procedures mean that the vote on Labour's amendment is not immediate.</p>

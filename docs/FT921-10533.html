			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: Pepsico stagnates in spite of 10% sales growth PEPSICO, the international soft drinks, restaurants and snacks group, yesterday reported near-static after-tax profits for 1991 of Dollars 1.08bn compared with Dollars 1.076bn for the previous year. The fourth-quarter earnings figure improved marginally from Dollars 265.9m to Dollars 271.1m. However, year-on-year comparisons are muddied by restructuring and other charges. Pepsico said 1991 income from continuing operations stood at Dollars 1.67bn  -unchanged from the previous year. This was scored after a Dollars 127m restructuring item at the snack foods business, Dollars 34m at Kentucky Fried Chicken worldwide, and Dollars 9m at the domestic Kentucky Fried Chicken operation. Restructuring charges in the fourth quarter totalled Dollars 69.6m. The previous year's figure for operating income from continuing operations, also Dollars 1.67bn, enjoyed the benefit of a Dollars 35.2m unusual surplus item. During the year, Pepsico reported that overall sales growth was 10 per cent, reaching Dollars 19.6bn. Soft drinks saw an overall 11 per cent profits advance before unusual charges, on 6 per cent sales growth.</p>

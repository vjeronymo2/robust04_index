			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Blueprint will need costly definition ONE OF the reasons traditionally given for Britain's failure to recognise the right to privacy in law was that it was impossible to define. The 1970 Younger committee on privacy concluded that the word could not satisfactorily be defined and decided to abandon the attempt to find a single and comprehensive definition. Similarly, the Calcutt committee said: 'Nowhere have we found a wholly satisfactory statutory definition.' The green paper adopts the generally accepted view recognised by Younger that privacy has two basic elements - physical seclusion and personal information about a person's private life - and that they are infringed by intrusion and the acquisition or publication of information. The simple solution to deciding when privacy had been invaded would be to define privacy in a broad way and then list different infringements. This approach was favoured to an extent by Calcutt and has been adopted in Canada, where the statutes do not define privacy beyond saying that the nature and degree of privacy which a person has is that which is reasonable in the circumstances, and then list examples of infringements. The government's view is that this approach is too imprecise and would lead to uncertainty. It has opted for a tighter definition, concentrating on the core aspects of privacy - a person's health, personal communications, family and personal relationships, and a right to be free from harassment and molestation. The government feels this will cut down on the need for the press and the media to plead defences. Nevertheless, many lawyers feel that uncertainty about what is and what is not an invasion of privacy is bound to arise, particularly until a body of case law has built up. The public-interest defence in particular might pose considerable problems where celebrities claim their privacy has been invaded. The traditional view is that the right to privacy does not prohibit any publication of matter which is of public and general interest. If that is maintained, how could public figures argue that their private lives are not of public interest, particularly as on some occasions they actively court publicity? Each case will differ, making precedents difficult to establish. Lengthy court battles are predicted which may go up to the House of Lords. The cost of such litigation would far outstrip the maximum Pounds 10,000 damages envisaged, making the risk of losing an action for infringement of privacy too great even for the very well-heeled. With no legal aid for privacy actions, few individuals would be able to afford to fight a newspaper or television company which put up a defence.</p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / People: Rowlands to become double commissioner Gill Rowlands, commissioner for the rights of trade union members, will have an additional task from the end of the month when she becomes commissioner for protection against unlawful industrial action. Admitting that it is 'a very new concept', Rowlands explains: 'I've not had much notice of this; we have no idea - the legal framework apart - of what will happen.' Asked how the idea had arisen for the relevant legislation, the 1993 Trade Union and Employment Rights Act, she replied, honestly enough: 'I have no idea; I just do the job.' However, if her first commission is anything to go by, she is unlikely to be swept off her feet, and her five-man office in Warrington will probably cope. As friend of unhappy trade union members since 1988, she has fielded some 1,000 enquiries, 200 of which turned into applications for funding. A preference for settling out of court means very little is heard of her actions, nor, of course, are many senior trade union figures involved. 'We get an awful lot of Jo Bloggses,' says the 63-year-old barrister. Now, if Bloggs qua member of the public feels he is being deprived of goods and services because of unlawful industrial action, he can apply to Rowlands for funds to bring proceedings in the High Court. Unlawful strikes being a pretty rare event in Britain these days, she expects most of her work to come from regional instances of secondary picketing, blacking, and so on. While she has kept a fairly low profile in her last job, she draws attention to certain difficulties, notably the fact that 'you mustn't canvas members, or else you are taken for a union-basher. By now most trade union members know I exist.' For the new commission, the publicity task will perhaps be a little more pressing.</p>

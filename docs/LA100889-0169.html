			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICKEY HENDERSON STEALS THUNDER, 6-5  </P> <P> Jose Canseco can hit a home run that nearly kisses the roof, Rick Honeycutt can  take the Oakland Athletics on another late-inning white-knuckler, and the  Toronto Blue Jays can unearth yet more hidden character, but Game 4 of these  American League playoffs, as with the other three, will always be remembered  for Rickey Henderson.  </P> <P> Adding to a postseason portfolio that already rivals those of Reggie Jackson,  Roberto Clemente and George Brett, Henderson hit two two-run home runs Saturday  -- one a fairway drive, the other a one-iron shot -- to pace the A's to victory  over the Blue Jays again, this time by a 6-5 score.  </P> <P> The Rickey Series stands at Oakland 3, Toronto 1, with the A's standing on the  brink of their second consecutive World Series and their ace, Dave Stewart,  scheduled to start Game 5 today.  </P> <P> To get the A's to this point, all Henderson has done is:  </P> <P>  -- Reach base 12 times in 19 at-bats.  </P> <P>  -- Hit .417 (five for 12).  </P> <P>  -- Steal seven bases in seven attempts.  </P> <P>  -- Score seven runs.  </P> <P>  -- Ruffle more than a few Blue Jay feathers with his  tip-toe-through-the-brick-dust act in Game 2.  </P> <P>  -- And now, become the eighth man in the history of the American League  Championship Series to hit two home runs in one game.  </P> <P> The first broke a scoreless tie in the third inning and landed on the black  tarpaulin beyond the center-field fence, 440 feet away.  </P> <P> The second was a line drive that tucked barely inside the left-field foul pole  and nestled in the netting behind the wall.  </P> <P> The second homer gave the A's a 5-1 lead that eventually became 6-5 before  Dennis Eckersley rescued Honeycutt in the eighth inning for his second save of  the series.  </P> <P> "This is one of the greatest times I've ever had in baseball," said Henderson,  who will be glad to remind you that he's had many great times in baseball.  </P> <P> "As a ballplayer, you always dream of being in this position. I'd always looked  at great players in the postseason and seen how some of them wouldn't do what  they're capable of, what they wanted to do. And I always thought, 'When I get  there, I want to do my best.'  </P> <P> "So far, that's coming true."  </P> <P> Saturday, Henderson's best was enough to upstage one of the longest home runs  ever hit in a postseason game -- a third-inning blast by Canseco that was  estimated at 480 feet, was probably closer to 510 and definitely landed in the  fifth deck of SkyDome's bleachers.  </P> <P> That deck, which straddles the facility's roof, is officially known as the  SkyDeck, and before Canseco, nobody had ever hit a SkyBall into the SkyDeck.  </P> <P> Oakland first baseman Mark McGwire came close earlier this season, pinging one  off the cement facing above the fourth deck that is now covered with red, white  and blue bunting.  </P> <P> "I had cement stop mine," McGwire said. "Mine was going to China. His was only  going to Hawaii."  </P> <P> Canseco said he got a kick out of how his homer instantly muted a SkyDome crowd  of 50,076 -- "I heard their jaws hit the ground," he said.  </P> <P> Henderson said he had to be helped off the ground.  </P> <P> "I fell off the bench," Henderson said, laughing. "It put mine to shame. I'm  sitting there thinking that I hit mine a long ways and then he hits one about  600 feet.  </P> <P> "It blew my mind."  </P> <P> Canseco hit his homer one out after Henderson's. With two pitches, Toronto  starter Mike Flanagan had given up three runs on nearly 1,000 feet in home  runs.  </P> <P> But according to Flanagan, the real damage was done later by the shortest of  the lot -- Henderson's fifth-inning line drive down the left-field line.  </P> <P> "I can live with Jose's home run," Flanagan said. "I can live with Rickey's  first home run. What I can't live with is Rickey's home run into the net.  </P> <P> "We had come back to make it 3-1 and then I go out and make it 5-1. That's  tough to accept."  </P> <P> It would prove to be a critical home run, too, because Oakland Manager Tony La  Russa continues to think it shrewd baseball strategy to bring Honeycutt into  pressurized playoff games.  </P> <P> Starter Bob Welch, a nervous type who hasn't dealt well with these things since  his storied strikeout of Reggie Jackson in the 1978 World Series, muddled  through five innings of jams, threats and budding rallies -- somehow escaping  with only one Blue Jay run and seven runners left on base.  </P> <P> But asking Welch to complete a sixth inning was apparently asking too much. He  left with two out in the sixth and another Toronto run in, coming on a single  by Kelly Gruber and a double by Junior Felix.  </P> <P> A relief pitcher, clearly, was needed. Not so clear, however, was La Russa's  eventual selection, Honeycutt, who faced a total of six batters in Games 2 and  3 and hadn't retired one.  </P> <P> A man without an ERA -- having given up three runs without recording an out,  Honeycutt's earned-run average, technically, was "infinity" -- the Oakland  left-hander walked the first batter he faced, Lloyd Moseby, before finally  retiring Mookie Wilson on an inning-ending force play.  </P> <P> But that was simply a sign of things to come.  </P> <P> In the seventh inning, Honeycutt gave up two more hits and another run. Tony  Fernandez doubled to center and pinch-hitter Pat Borders singled him home.  </P> <P> In the eighth inning, Honeycutt failed to field Manny Lee's single and walked  Moseby to set up a two-run inning for Toronto, an inning that ended only with  the assistence of Eckersley.  </P> <P> Suddenly, despite the heroics of Canseco and Henderson, Oakland led by only 6-5  with the ninth inning still to play.  </P> <P> Why had La Russa so stubbornly stayed with a relief pitcher who so obviously  continues to struggle?  </P> <P> "I looked at the matchups and I liked them," La Russa said. "I liked Honeycutt  in the eighth inning against Lee, I liked Felix (a switch-hitter) better  batting from the right side and I liked him against Moseby (a left-hander),  too.  </P> <P> "I was real encouraged by Rick Honeycutt. He got us four or five big outs. I'm  looking at the way he's throwing and he was looking more like himself today.  </P> <P> "We wouldn't be here today without Rick and we wouldn't have won the game  without him today."  </P> <P> La Russa could talk that way because of the way Eckersley handled the ninth  inning. Two quick outs, a single to Gruber and then a confrontation with  pinch-hitter Lee Mazzilli.  </P> <P> Eckersley and Mazzilli played chess until the count was full. Eckersley  check-mated him with a fastball, which jammed Mazzilli and prompted a pop fly  that A's third baseman Tony Phillips squeezed for the last out.  </P> <P> "It's hard to think about being up, 3-1, right now," La Russa said. "Right now,  we're exhausted. It was a real hard game.  </P> <P> "I asked Cito (Gaston, Toronto's rookie manager) outside if he's sure he wants  to do this for a living. . . . It was a hard game to win. Both clubs gave  everything they had."  </P> <P> And because the A's had Rickey Henderson, the American League pennant, for the  second time in as many years, is today theirs for the taking.  </P> <P> * RELATED STORY: Page 6  </P> <P> </P> <P> MULTIPLE HOME RUN GAMES  </P> <P> A list of players who have hit two or more home runs in one game in league  championship series history.  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.44IN:2.44IN:2.33IN:1.34IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> GAME, YEAR  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> PLAYER  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> TEAM  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> No  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Game 2, 1971  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Boog Powell  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Baltimore  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Game 3, 1971  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Re.

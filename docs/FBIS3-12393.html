With this air strike, NATO resorted to its first true  military operation since forming after World War II. The second  Security Council resolution on Bosnia-Herzegovina has been  implemented. During the past two years, the UN Security Council  has issued 19 resolutions on Bosnia and until yesterday's air  strike, only the resolution on the arms embargo, which was  limited to the Muslims, was being implemented.    The fist question that comes to mind is: Why were most of  the Security Council resolutions on Bosnia not implemented and  why was the resolution banning flights by hostile planes over  Bosnia implemented only yesterday, over a year after it was  approved?    Political analysts believe that the implementation or the  suspension of the Security Council resolutions on Bosnia stemmed  primarily from the political recklessness of international  powers and their agreements backstage. Basically, this issue  can be studied within the context of the cooperation and rivalry  between the Western countries and Russia.    The approval of the Security Council resolutions on the  Bosnian crisis and the implementation or violation of these  resolutions form the most important pillar in the West's  cooperation with Russia. The flood of Russian arms to Serbia and  the dispatch of similar Western arms to Croatia--despite the  international sanctions--are examples of how the resolution on  the arms embargo was violated by the belligerent sides in the  Bosnian crisis, with mutual connivance by the West and Russia.    The arms embargo on the Muslims, which was pursued under the  strong control of the West and Russia, is another example of  this cooperation, which shows how the world powers have a  uniform political inclination in their hostility toward the  oppressed Muslims in Bosnia. This cooperation between the West  and Russia recently adopted the character of a political  transaction. Russia's political support for the Serbs after the  NATO ultimatum and its preventing the NATO air strike against  the Serbs' heavy gun bases were among the concessions that the  West granted to Moscow so that Russia's President Yeltsin could  use these for domestic consumption against his rivals.    Yesterday's support by Russia for the NATO air strike on the  Serb fighters is a concession that Russia is giving to the West.  Although Russia supports the Serbs, it cannot agree with their  impudence in violating the resolution on the no-fly zone and in  their air strike on two Muslim-inhabited cities, especially when  Moscow voted for this resolution.    Next to the cooperation between the West and Russia in the  former Yugoslavia, there is also rivalry between the two, which  has recently become more visible. Russia's powerful entry onto  the scene toward the end of the period specified in NATO's  ultimatum two weeks ago, gathering the hostile side's heavy guns  from around Sarajevo, and Moscow's overt support for the Bosnian  Serbs form one of the clearest examples of the rivalry between  Russia and the West in the Balkans. It recalls the Cold War  era's bloc system.    The U.S. proposal to form a type of confederation with the  Republic of Croatia on the one side and the Bosnian Muslims and  Croats on the other and the two sides' [as heard] call on  Washington to examine the situation are considered to form a  reciprocal step by the West, which is trying to place the  Bosnian Muslims within an irreversible new framework and under  the umbrella of Western support and political influence.    Political analysts believe that while cooperation and  rivalry  rule relations between the West and Russia in the Bosnian  crisis, the recent NATO air strike on the Serb fighters took  place with another objective in mind that is not opposed by  Russia either. Overshadowing the savage act by the Zionist  forces in the massacre at the Abrahamite shrine may be the main  objective behind NATO's delayed attack on the Serb planes. The  Zionist regime's thoughtless act has sparked off dangerous  repercussions for the West's interests in the Islamic world and  the West is trying to resort to another commotion in a bid to  distract the world of Islam from Tel Aviv's horrific crime.</p>

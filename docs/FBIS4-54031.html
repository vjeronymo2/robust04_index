			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Robert Templer] </F>   [Text] HANOI, May 25 (AFP) -- A Vietnamese university  professor and democracy activist imprisoned for 15 years has  gone on hunger strike after being shackled for refusing to carry  out hard labour, a human rights groups said in a statement  Wednesday. Doan Viet Hoat, a former professor of English  literature, was transferred from a re-education camp to solitary  confinement in a prison for hardened criminals and denied visits  from his wife after beginning the hunger strike in early April,  Human Rights Watch/Asia said. The group said it was concerned  that Hoat's health could have deteriorated and that he had been  ordered shackled by the camp director.    Hoat, sentenced last year to 20 years in prison -- later  reduced to 15 -- for "attempting to overthrow the government" by  producing an underground newsletter, is in poor health with a  serious kidney ailment, the independent group said.    Vietnamese authorities have transferred Hoat five times  since  he was jailed in May last year and he is now being held in the  Thanh Cam camp in a malarial jungle area near the border with  Laos.    Although Hoat's newsletter, Freedom Forum, called for  democratic reforms, it did not endorse violent action against  the government, the human rights group said. Hoat's wife, Tran  Thi Thuc, has petitioned the government for his release and  demanded access to him to provide medicines and food, the  statement said. Thuc said she had travelled more than a  thousand kilometres (600 miles) from Ho Chi Minh City to the Ba  Sao re-education camp only to discover that her husband had been  transferred to another prison.    "The entire journey involved a week of tiring travel and  waiting around, yet I still was not able to see my husband for a  minute," she said in a letter addressed to top government  leaders. As Hoat had not been sentenced to hard labour, he had  a right to refuse such work as crushing stones, she said.    "My husband has a severe case of kidney stones. My family  has  to follow his health condition closely," she said. "But while  he was being moved constantly, we lost contact with him; and  even when we located him we weren't allowed to meet with him, so  how can we know he is in good health?" she said.    Human Rights Watch/Asia has appealed for Hoat's immediate  release as he "is imprisoned in violation of international law  for exercising his right to free expression."    The New York-based group has been strongly critical of  Vietnam's human rights record, which as emerged as an issue in  discussions with the United States on normalising relations. A  recent State Department report gave Vietnam a mixed review,  saying that while the 1992 constitution gave some legal  guarantees of basic rights, political and religious dissidents  were still being held for the peaceful expression of their views.    Vietnamese and US officials held talks in New York on the  issue in March, but Hanoi has said that while it will welcome a  dialogue on human rights it will not tolerate what it calls  "interference in its internal affairs.</p>

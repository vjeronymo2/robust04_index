			<p>940721 FT  21 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Egypt gives approval to privately run oil refinery The Egyptian government has approved a private-sector plan to build an oil refinery and petrochemical plant near Suez, Reuter reports from Cairo. A group of Egyptian and Kuwaiti investors, operating as the Sahara Company for Petroleum Products, plan to spend about Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 769m) on the refinery, which would probably use Saudi or Kuwaiti crude and refine products for export, oil minister Hamdi el-Banbi said yesterday. Plans to build a separate private-sector refinery of about the same size on the Mediterranean coast west of Alexandria were more advanced than those for the Suez one.</p>

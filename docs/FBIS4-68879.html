			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Inara Egle: "Greens Must Not Change Color: The </F> 5th Congress of the Latvian Green Party Discussed Party Identity  and Elected Leaders."]    [Text] One year ago, when tactics for the Saeima elections  were being discussed during the Green Party Congress, Dzintars  Abikis, while still a member of the party at that time,  attempted to convince his colleagues that by running on a  separate ballot the Greens could experience major  disappointments in the Saeima elections. In theory, it turned  out that he was right, but it seems that what was gained or lost  cannot be easily evaluated. At the 5th Congress of the Latvian  Green Party (LGP), which was held Saturday, the present day  Latvian Way-"farer", Dzintars Abikis did not participate (this  does not mean he was not mentioned -- in both a positive and  critical light). After re-registration of the party members as a  political organization, the number of united Greens has declined  from approximately 300 to 128 members, which is not that  significant, considering that many parties, even the more  popular ones, are in the same situation at present, numerically  speaking. But, just as last year, the main question for the  Congress was how the Greens, without losing their identity,  could save their ability to influence the process and defend  their interests, which is only possible through government  structures.    As we know, in the municipal elections, the Green party, in  the majority of cases, is running together with the national  forces, and even in the Riga council elections, it has joined  the ballot with the Latvian National Independence Movement  (LNIM), and the Greens have 11 seats there -- they did not even  want any more. Latvian Green Party Co-Chairman Peteris Jansons  said that the situation and the goals are different now,  bringing the national political forces closer together. As far  as we can remember, the union of national forces was formed  primarily to support Latvian interests with respect to the  citizenship law, and now it is also protesting against the  initialed documents of the Latvian and Russian talks. And these  are matters, as we learned at the Congress, that the Greens are  entrusting to their coalition partners.    But the question concerns something else: by approaching and  assimilating with other national forces, will the Greens lose  the ability to voice their own principles in a sufficiently loud  manner? This is also the concern of the longtime party  Co-Chairman, Juris Zvirgzds, who reminded everyone that only and  by itself can the Green Party create political security for all  priorities related to its work and the environment. And  therefore, two matters cannot be confused -- Greens do not join  with nor enter into another political power, but, instead, they  work together with it as an equal partner. "I am for working  together according to the principle of partner relationships,  but I am against the case where a Green changes colors or allows  environmental questions to be postponed to another time, some  time later. We know that `later' never comes", said Juris  Zvirgzds.    Maybe there is no need to be afraid, because the partners,  according to the assessment of Indulis Emsis, respect Greens  precisely for their convictions, and have also studied their  principles. But, for this same reason, according to Indulis  Emsis, a "green line" must be defined, which, when it is crossed  over, will cause the LGP to leave the partnership and drop out  of the game. It should also be respected that the realization of  Green ideas requires a long period of time, and therefore it is  unnecessary to make exaggerated attempts at become a ruling  political power, but rather, to focus on such politics that the  Green standpoint is mentioned by all political forces, said  Emsis. He also mentioned the party's financial situation,  because it is no secret to anyone that influence in a power  structure can be gained only by those parties who have money.  Greens do not have money, but in looking for it, they should  continue to be on the alert, because there are more than just a  few who would be willing to provide financial support for the  party, but only on the condition that it renounces the Green  lines and principles in specific instances.    Even though the question -- of whether to go alone or  together with others -- started some arguments, which, it seems,  still remain unresolved, this did not, in any case, show signs  of a split among the Greens. Maybe this was because there  weren't that many of them -- not quite fifty. And maybe because,  as Anna Seile concluded, this was a meeting hall where everyone  could speak in a quiet tone, without microphones, and everyone  understood and listened. And it is true that no calls to come to  order were heard in the Green Congress, although when the  candidates for party co-chairmen were proposed and  characterized, an attendee summarized this process afterwards,  asking: "Out of five angels, how can we select just three?" Yes,  the Green Party still maintains the principle of electing, not  one leader, but three co-chairmen to adopt their colleagues'  resolutions, and so that the party is not called the Zvirgzds or  Emsis party. This also has its minuses, which could be noticed  also in the review period, because, since the functions are not  precisely divided, it is also difficult to divide the  responsibilities. It should be noted that none of these  co-chairmen earn their living through being co-chairmen.    All three former party leaders -- Juris Zvirgzds, Olegs  Batarevskis and Peteris Jansons -- were also nominated for the  position this year. The bulletins also included the names of two  more candidates -- the Environmental Protection Committee Vice  President Pavils Raudonis, and Kuldiga rayon Council Chairman  Janis Klavins.    Most votes in the Congress were received by the former party  "prime mover", Juris Zvirgzds, head of the ecology laboratory at  the Zoological Garden. Next was Janis Klavins, who could be  considered as the surprise of this Congress. Klavins joined the  party only one year ago, and ran as a Green candidate in the  Saeima elections (in Kurzeme, as the very first). But the public  began to notice Klavins when all attention was turned to  Skrunda, which is in Janis Klavins led Kuldiga rayon. Like Olegs  Batarevskis -- the third co-chairman -- he was born in 1951. O.  Batarevskis works as State Secretary of the Ministry of Justice.  The Central Council elected at the Congress will include Jekabs  Raipulis, Leons Magelis, Inese Eihvalde, Indulis Emsis, Janis  Baltvilks, Gunars Lakutis, Skaidrite Albertina, Pavils Raudonis  and Karlis Gudermanis (Peteris Jansons withdrew his candidacy).    The delegates at the Congress also adopted one resolution,  requesting the President of the nation to proclaim the first  week of May as clean-up week. During this week, according to the  document, "let's wash windows -- the eyes of Latvia, clean up  courtyards and entryways."</p>

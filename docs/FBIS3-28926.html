			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 14 KYODO -- A senior trade ministry  official apologized Monday [14 February] for a  "misunderstanding" caused by an internal ministry document  advising outside bodies how to respond to reporters' questions  about the government's new economic package.    Hideaki Kumano, vice minister at the International Trade and  Industry Ministry (MITI), was commenting on a newspaper report  that the document told major economic organizations to give a  good evaluation of the 15.25 trillion yen package announced  February 8. Some phrases in the document were "inappropriate,"  Kumano told a regular press conference.    But he added that the document, prepared for the ministry's  internal use for what he termed "clarification," was not  intended for distribution to outside organizations.    The TOKYO SHIMBUN, a major daily, said Monday that MITI had  shown the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), the  Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry and other economic organs  a list of model answers to give when asked for comments by  reporters on tax reforms and other steps contained in the  package. Most of the economic organizations rejected the  instructions as "opinion making by bureaucrats," the newspaper  said.    Kumano said MITI had no intention of putting any pressure on  the economic community and will take every step to ensure that a  similar misunderstanding does not take place in the future.    Kumano expressed concern over the yen's sharp upswing  against  the dollar following Friday's collapse of the trade framework  talks between Japan and the United States.    Corporate earnings may turn worse again at a time when  inventory adjustment has been progressing smoothly and overall  business sentiment had picked up thanks to the record 15.25  trillion pump- priming package launched February 8, he said.    The failure to reach agreement in the summit between Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton served to  put "a chill blanket" on the exchange market and other sectors  of the economy, Kumano said. He cited the need for both  countries to make efforts to mend their soured economic ties by  returning to the "starting point" of the current framework talks.    He was referring to an accord reached last July between  Clinton and then-Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.    The "objective criteria" spelled out in the accord do not  call for either country to make any promise in "future matters,"  Kumano said, repeating Japan's opposition to setting numerical  targets to measure progress in import penetration.    The ongoing Japan-U.S. wrangling over the definition of  objective criteria could be settled if they read the accord  "carefully," he said.</p>

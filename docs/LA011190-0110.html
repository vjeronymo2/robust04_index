			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LEEUWENBURGH TO SEEK THIRD TERM  </P> <P> Rolling Hills Councilwoman Ginny Leeuwenburgh said Monday that she will seek  another term on the council this spring, after announcing earlier that she  would not.  </P> <P> The two-term councilwoman said she originally decided not to run again because  of the time-consuming responsibilities of caring for her mother, who has had  Alzheimer's disease for several years.  </P> <P> However, a doctor has recommended that her mother, who lived with the  councilwoman, be admitted to a care center, thereby giving her more time for  city business, Leeuwenburgh said.  </P> <P> Besides Leeuwenburgh's council seat, two others, held by Jody Murdoch and  Gordana Swanson, are open in the April 10 election.  </P></p>

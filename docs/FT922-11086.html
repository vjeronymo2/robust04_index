			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / International Company News: P&amp;G lifted by foreign markets PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, yesterday reported a 12 per cent increase in third-quarter net earnings, helped by sales growth in foreign markets. The company made Dollars 474m, or Dollars 1.33 a share, compared with Dollars 424m, or Dollars 1.16, in the same period of last year. Sales rose from Dollars 6.79bn to Dollars 7.48bn. Mr Edwin Artzt, the chairman, said that business was 'getting better. This was a solid quarter for us. Unit volume, sales and pre-tax operating earnings were all up 10 per cent or better, despite continued significant investment in new products.' The company said the increases in sales and earnings were due to 'improved operations of the business, reflecting broadly based unit volume growth, particularly outside the US'. Although other income increased primarily from one-time sales of assets, this was more than offset by higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. For the nine months net earnings were Dollars 1.53bn, compared with Dollars 1.47bn in the same period of 1991. This worked through at Dollars 4.32 a share, against Dollars 4.09. Sales rose from Dollars 20.3bn to Dollars 22.19bn.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Use of leases to inflate profits ruled out Companies will no longer be able to inflate their profits after accepting incentives from landlords to take up a lease. In the past when a tenant took a new lease and accepted benefits, such as upfront payments called 'reverse-premiums', they could be credited to the profit and loss account. Other benefits offered to tenants, particularly large retailers, have included contributions to fitting-out and re-allocation costs and rent-free periods. The Accounting Standards Board has decided that from December 23 such incentives should be spread over the whole length of the lease or until the rent meets the market rate. The rules, issued by the ASB and devised by its Urgent Issues Task Force, were prompted by worries that there was no clear guidance on accounting for such incentives. The issue came to a head last February when the Financial Reporting Review Panel commented on the case of Pentos, the specialist retailer. Pentos had disclosed that its 1992 accounts, which showed a pre-tax profit of Pounds 4m, included upfront payments from landlords of Pounds 6.3m. A draft set of rules issued by the task force in May prompted several submissions but in its final directive the task force has stuck to its view that the benefits received should be spread out and not allowed to be credited in one sum.</p>

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Arts: Loudon Wainwright III - Rock Families worry Loudon Wainwright. For more than 20 years his songwriting career has been spattered with songs that gnaw away at the raw bones of relationships - father and son, brother and sister, husband and wife, parent and child. Now as Wainwright drifts through middle age his songs seem preoccupied more and more with putting the record straight. History, his latest release, was originally going to be called 'Family Album'; the 14 songs range across the domestic battle field, bleakly cataloguing the casualties. His current British tour may be aimed at boosting the sales of History but in concert the effect is anything but bleak; Wainwright himself comes over as an energetic, hardworking performer, and immensely likeable. The running order seems half-improvised, the banter spontaneous. Among the post-Dylan generation of singer-songwriters he is much closer to Randy Newman than to, say, Neil Young or Springsteen; he shares with Newman a liking for black irony, though not his penchant for disguise. With Wainwright there is no concealment, the nerve ends are bared and the confessional element is patent. The humour becomes a vital safety valve, undercutting the despair of his lyrics, numbing the pain of the idealism that gradually has been eaten away. Even 'Talking Bob Dylan', Wainwright's witty tribute to his begetter, has a sharp edge as he charts his hero's progress and implicitly compares it with his own. Most of the time, he can't help himself - 'Boys kiss girls, make them cry/That's a man's job'. But when the humour drops away the effect can be devastating: in 'Hitting You', which traces his disintegrating relationship with his daughter, there is nothing but despair. There were old songs too - 'Be Careful There's a Baby in the House' from 1971 and a rousing C &amp; W version of 'Dead Skunk' - as well as something brand new, in Wainwright's hymn to the Clinton inauguration: 'Talking about our generation/Hope we grow up before we get old'. The subject matter, as always, doesn't bear thinking about; it is a tribute to Wainwright's feisty resilience that his audience are able laugh a lot more than they cry; look at me, he's telling them, I know it's all awful, but I'm still here, still laughing.

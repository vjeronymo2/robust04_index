			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Renault The French government's refusal to privatise Renault fully is a recipe for uncommercial meddling in the company's affairs. It reflects political sensitivities over the French car manufacturer and suggests that Renault may be managed counter to the interests of investors. But this will not stop the forthcoming Renault issue from being a roaring success. It was always likely that the issue would be priced generously, if only to avoid the embarrassment of a flop ahead of next spring's presidential elections. So it has proved. The pricing parameters announced yesterday are below analysts' expectations, valuing the group at FFr39bn-FFr42bn rather than the forecast FFr45bn. Assuming the price is fixed at the upper end of the range, the shares will be on a multiple of some 8.5 times expected earnings for next year. This is a discount of at least 20 per cent to Peugeot. It also compares favourably with the ratings of other European car manufacturers which have not coped with recession so successfully. The issue's likely success will be accentuated by the relatively small volume of shares allocated to institutions: 40 per cent of the total, with even that subject to a clawback from private investors. There will be a lot less demand for AGF, Bull and other French companies in the running to be privatised. But that is little consolation for institutions left scrabbling for shares in Renault.</p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GALANTER AND HER $100,000 FUND-RAISER  </P> <P> (Times staff writer Jeff) Rabin seems surprised that Councilwoman Ruth Galanter  raised $100,000 during a single fund-raising event.  </P> <P> As a resident of her district, I am surprised that the figure was not many  times greater, what with the liberal favors she has bestowed on the developers  who are trashing our neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Galanter's indulgence of her schoolgirl fantasy of being in with the in crowd  at the expense of the people she purportedly represents is obscene. She should  be running for homecoming queen and leave public office to a more mature  individual.  </P> <P> FRANCES LONGMIRE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

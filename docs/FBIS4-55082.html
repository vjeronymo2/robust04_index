			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Czech Republic gained associate  partner status in the West European Union [WEU] today. This took  place at a session of a WEU consultative forum which was  attended by Foreign Affairs Minister Josef Zieleniec and Defense  Minister Antonin Baudys. Our special correspondent Klara  Stejskalova reports from Luxembourg:    [Stejskalova] The WEU is the only European organization with  authority on security questions. It brings together 10  countries of the European Twelve. The countries of eastern and  central Europe -- that is, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria,  Romania, and the three Baltic republics, apart from the Czech  Republic -- have so far had observer status only. Associate  partner status means, according to Jozef Zieleniec, that our  contact with the WEU will cease to be diplomatic and will become  a working one. This means that we are becoming more and more a  part of the mechanism of European integration. He said the WEU  will now become an organization that will gradually take over  the role of security guarantor in Europe.    Today can be marked as significant. At last we can  participate, by our vote, in formulating various aspects of  policy; for example, a center for planning European identity has  been formed, among other things. [passage omitted]    On the other hand one has to admit that the associate  countries can take part in discussions, but cannot block  decisions. Associate status is thus, to some extent, a mere  formality which certainly does not mean an increase in our  security.</p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / County Hall appeal rejected THE High Court yesterday rejected an appeal against the government's approval of the conversion of London's County Hall into a hotel, residential and conference complex. Lambeth Borough Council's appeal opposed the change of use of County Hall, which housed the now abolished Greater London Council. It said that Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, had a duty to preserve the Grade II listed building in its historic local-government role. Mr Justice Pill said there was nothing unreasonable about Mr Heseltine's standpoint. He ordered Lambeth to pay the costs of Mr Heseltine; the London Residuary Body, which proposed the development; and the County Hall Development Group, an Anglo-Japanese consortium which is in liquidation.</p>

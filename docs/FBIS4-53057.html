			<p>BFN     [Text] The Japanese and the U.S. Governments have agreed to  expand the "common agenda for cooperation in global perspective"  -- one of the pillars of the Japan-U.S. trade framework. The  two governments will hold a vice ministerial meeting on the  matter in Washington on 24 May. In the meeting, the two nations  will decide to incorporate in the agenda four additional areas  of cooperation, including drug eradication and the establishment  of a network to promote exchanges between institutes engaging in  environmental protection studies. Although Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks were suspended in such sectors as autos and  macroeconomics following summit talks in February, the two  governments have continued to discuss the issue of bilateral  cooperation in the area of global issues. The Japanese  Government hopes to seek ways to resume deadlocked trade talks  in the sectoral and macroeconomics areas by confirming  cooperative ties between Japan and the United States at the  forthcoming meeting in the area of global issues.    The framework talks consist of three main sections:  macroeconomics (such as continuation of tax cuts), bilateral  cooperation in solving global issues, and sectoral areas (such  as government procurement, autos, and insurance). Although the  recent summit talks failed to result in an agreement on  macroeconomics and sectoral areas, the two governments have  since kept contacts with each other through diplomatic channels.  The two governments have decided to hold a third round of vice  ministerial talks as scheduled because there are no points of  conflict in the area of bilateral cooperation in solving global  issues. The third round of talks will be attended by Deputy  Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Hayashi and Deputy Vice  Minister for Industrial and Trade Affairs Okamatsu from the  Japanese Government, and Under Secretary of State Wirth as U.S.  delegate.    As for drug eradication measures, the vice ministers are  scheduled to discuss the need to promote information exchange  between Japan and the United States and how to help the Peruvian  Government's efforts to transform opium-growing areas into more  normal agricultural areas. Concerning establishment of a  network between environment protection institutes, the two  nations will proceed with a plan to set up a system of  information exchange between European nations, the United  States, and the Asia-Pacific region as a measure to help prevent  global warming. In addition, a "children and health" program  designed to supply vaccines for developing countries and a  "coral reef protection measure" will also be discussed as  additional areas of cooperation.    At the summit talks in February, the two governments agreed  to cooperate in dealing with 15 global issues -- such as  environmental protection, population, AIDS, the ocean, and  transportation technology. Officials concerned with those  issues from both governments will also attend the forthcoming  meeting, and in the meeting the two nations will follow up the  February agreement.    As for economic framework talks in macroeconomics and  sectoral areas, it is expected that unofficial vice ministerial  negotiations will begin this week in hopes of finding ways to  resume the talks. At the unofficial negotiations, the two  nations are expected to exchange and coordinate views on how to  define "objective criteria," which is a main cause of the  failure of the summit talks in February.</p>

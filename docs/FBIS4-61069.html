			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Gorelov] </F>   [Text] Birobidjan 3 May TASS -- Borderguards of the  Birobidjan detachment and inspectors of the Far Eastern Fishing  Inspection have put up a reliable barrier to Chinese poachers,  who began to violate Russian waters after the Amur river had  cleared of ice.    As a result of one of the recent raids, they were able to  prevent more than 20 poaching attempts in Russian waters. The  borderguards confiscated hundreds of meters of small-mesh  fishing nets and found many wooden and pneumatic boats, hidden  on uninhabited Russian islands. Their crews had to be "fished  out" of riverside brush. All the violators were deported from  Russian territory.    ITAR-TASS was told at the headquarters of the Biribidjan  borderguard detachment that such actions by borderguards and  inspection teams would be carried out regularly this season. It  was decided to put an end to the massive violations of the  Russian border by Chinese poachers. The results of the first  raid have shown that the situation can be kept under control.</p>

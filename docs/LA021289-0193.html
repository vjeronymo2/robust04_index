			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THEY DO IT ALL FOR A MOMENT IN HISTORY  </P> <P> Radford Polinsky recalls his moment of "living history" last June with an awe  reserved for life's milestones or spiritual revelations.  </P> <P> There he was, clad in a replica of the uniform of an 18th-Century British  officer -- every detail, down to the number of threads per square inch,  documented as historically accurate -- re-enacting a Revolutionary War battle  in Evesham, N.J. He and his redcoat companions advanced in lock step down a  hot, dusty road when they broke into a rendition of the regiment's somber  marching tune.  </P> <P>  He lived at Troutbeck for many a day  </P> <P>  And now he has gone far, far away  </P> <P>  That we'll ne'er hear his horn in the morning.  </P> <P>  "The 20th Century melted away, and for those few moments I was in the 18th  Century," Polinsky said. "Moments like that justify the whole darn hobby."  </P> <P> Polinsky, 34, is a West Hollywood movie and television costumer who moonlights  as a corporal in the British 33rd Regiment of Foot in Colonial America.  Periodically, he and eight Southern Californian comrades in arms engage in a  kind of time travel, back to an era when the pace was slower, hardships many  and the fate of the rebellious Colonies was at stake on the battlefield.  </P> <P> They are among an estimated 50,000 weekend warriors nationwide who spend  thousands of dollars and untold hours re-creating the sights, sounds, crafts,  folklore and feel of a particular epoch. Several hundred groups of these  gung-ho recruits re-enact nearly every period of American military history --  the Vietnam War is one exception -- as well as earlier eras, such as the Middle  Ages.  </P> <P> "What motivates otherwise normal people to don neolithic furs, medieval armor,  buck-ram shirts, or brain-tanned skins and dash into the time warp of living  history?" wrote fellow historical re-enactor Jay Anderson in his 1984 book  "Time Machine -- The World of Living History."  </P> <P> His answer: a desire to escape the hustle and bustle of 20th-Century life; a  "nostalgic preference for the past -- usually a particular epoch, and a  curiosity about the nitty-gritty nature of everyday life in a specific  historical period."  </P> <P> Polinsky belongs to the Brigade of the American Revolution, the largest group  in the nation specializing in 18th-Century living history. Founded in 1962, the  brigade is dedicated to re-creating the look and experience of common  Revolutionary soldiers. Its 1,700 members -- more than 200 of them from other  nations -- drill regularly, stage mock battles, march in parades and set up  weekend encampments.  </P> <P> At the bivouacs, members, their wives and children cast pewter, carve wooden  utensils, weave clothing and cook over open fires, all the while attired in  Colonial garb. Talk of contemporary issues is taboo, though they do talk about  sex in a bygone time and have "great" discussions of "period religion and  period politics," Polinsky said.  </P> <P> The history buffs are such sticklers for authenticity that even the stews,  beans and other foods they eat reflect 18th-Century fare -- up to a point.  </P> <P> "The park systems get upset with you if you start shooting their squirrels out  of the trees to make a stew," said Hank Kayser, 42, a Simi Valley operating  engineer who has doubled as a sergeant in an American regiment for the past 12  years.  </P> <P> Historians generally praise the brigade efforts to educate the public about the  texture and tastes of the revolution even if, as one said, "They're not  scholars. They're enthusiasts."  </P> <P> John Dederer, a professor of military and strategic history at Yale University,  relishes the atmosphere they create: "Just to see the black powder explode, the  fog of battle -- with even a small squad, the amount of smoke is just  incredible. It gives you a real feel for the period and a respect for the  toughness of the people."  </P> <P> Most of the brigade's 100-plus "reactivated" units nationwide replicate the  ranks of Americans. But there are British, Hessian and French regiments, giving  the Americans realistic-looking opponents at the mock battles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Everything Is Documented'  </P> <P> "We try to get away from the Hollywood image of what an 18th-Century soldier  looked like," said William Radford, an industrial supplies salesman from  Glenmore, Pa., and the brigade's national commander. "The equipment, the  uniforms, the clothing that the women wear -- everything is documented by more  than one piece of information."  </P> <P> Two of the units are in California, which was being colonized by the Spanish at  the time of the American Revolution. Both of them -- Kayser's nine-member  American Delaware Regiment and Polinsky's 33rd British Regiment -- conduct  twice monthly marching and musket drills at Los Encinos State Historic Park in  Encino.  </P> <P> There on Super Bowl Sunday, the American and British regiments -- in red, white  and blue -- precisely crisscrossed a parched field under sunny skies. The  backdrop included an orange grove, prickly pear cactus and a 1849 adobe house  that was once the homestead for a longhorn cattle ranch.  </P> <P> In a final drill before a dozen onlookers, the regiments took the field to the  staccato bursts of the American drummer, and, stone-faced, marched toward each  other behind bayonets menacingly extended on their muskets. This was not a  matter of "shoot when you see the whites of their eyes" -- the bayonet charge  stopped only when the opposing forces were yards apart.  </P> <P> Moments later, as the 20th Century noisily intruded overhead in the form of a  circling police helicopter, the Delawares chanted, "Hip, hip, huzzah!" and  dispersed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Modern-Day Birthday  </P> <P> The 33rd, meanwhile, dropped its military mien to celebrate a member's real  birthday with a modern cake on a picnic table.  </P> <P> The Californians have done programs at Knotts Berry Farm, appeared at Colonial  Williamsburg in Virginia and marched in Memorial Day and Veterans Day parades.  Members also speak to school and community groups; two are history teachers who  use their outfits and period equipment in class.  </P> <P> "Students learn so much more from them other than just reading," said Jeff  Garcia, 32, an American history teacher at Garfield High and a member of the  brigade's 33rd Regiment. At various time, he has shown up in his East Los  Angeles classroom dressed as a Civil War soldier, a mountain man and a World  War I combatant -- as well as a redcoat.  </P> <P> As a British recruit, he said, he can convey that there are two sides to every  conflict; the youngsters gain empathy for individuals from various historical  periods.  </P> <P> The Delaware Regiment was founded in 1976 by Kayser and four San Fernando  Valley area friends who were initially motivated by the Bicentennial. Several  are craftsmen who were drawn to a period when everything was still made by  hand.  </P> <P> The regiment they chose to replicate was a highly respected light infantry  company from Delaware. It was established by the Continental Congress in June,  1775.  </P> <P> "The Delawares are the only regiment in the entire Army that never broke on the  battlefield," said Don E. Dooley, a 20th-Century recruit from Huntington Beach  whose sense of pride and use of present tense befits an original regiment  member. "It's probably one of the two top units of the revolution."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unit Researched  </P> <P> When the men applied to join the brigade, they undertook a time-consuming  process of researching the unit, preparing a plan to re-create its clothing,  weapons and other artifacts. It took them 1 1/2 years to be admitted.  </P> <P> Documentation was found in libraries at the University of California, the  Smithsonian Institution, the Delaware Historical Society and the brigade's New  York archives.  </P> <P> The clothing is accurate to the thread count, Kayser said, explaining, "You  have to use a micrometer and a ruler and a needle to make sure that you can  match what is in the museum." He is an expert, working with his wife to make  historical costumes for exhibits and living history groups.  </P> <P> The Delawares' elaborate basic wardrobe: black shoes with a brass buckle; high  white wool socks supported by a black garter; blue wool breeches with pewter  buttons; a long-sleeve wool vest; a blue coat with a red collar and lapels; a  scabbard for the bayonet; and a distinctive high black leather Delaware hat  with a painted yellow insignia.  </P> <P> "It drives me crazy," said Dooley, 22, a city planning intern who admits to  harboring a near-obsession to obtain the right stuff. "I want to know exactly  what they looked like."  </P> <P> He said he plans to discard his $90 shoes because he found a cobbler who "makes  the shoe the way it's supposed to be made." He is seeking someone to sew his  wool socks because his pair's pedigree is unacceptable: They're machine-made.  </P> <P> Verisimilitude has its price. An enlisted man's outfit costs $1,200 or more to  make. Most unit members have several costumes. Polinsky, whose elaborate  British uniform is more expensive, values his outfits from the Revolutionary  War and World Wars I and II in excess of $7,000.  </P> <P> Members also carry British-, Italian- or Japanese-made reproductions of a Brown  Bess musket, accurate only within 100 yards. They start at $250 and run into  thousands of dollars.  </P> <P> Then there are the tents, utensils and personal gear that make up an  encampment. An industry has cropped up nationwide to supply historical  re-enactors with such items.  </P> <P> Collectively, the nine Delaware members and their six wives estimate that they  have spent $200,000 on uniforms and gear, Kayser said. Cross-country trips, of  course, have their costs.  </P> <P> Both units also pay annual dues: $22.50 for the Delawares, $30 for the 33rd.  The first $15 goes to the national brigade; the rest pays to publish monthly  newsletters and buy black powder.  </P> <P> </P> <P> All Walks of Life  </P> <P> The two California units have a professional cross-section, including two  research biologists, an economist, a banking executive, a plant foreman, a  dietitian, a truck driver, an aerospace engineer, a television producer and a  warehouse worker. They range in age from 25 to 60 -- most in their 30s and 40s  -- and travel from as far as San Diego to take up arms.  </P> <P> There are Latinos but no blacks. This may reflect the reality that, most  African-Americans were slaves in the Revolutionary Era, though some blacks did  fight in the war.  </P> <P> Not everyone familiar with the revolutionary re-creations approves of them. The  Delaware Regiment's leader, a San Fernando Valley man, asked that his name not  be disclosed because his employer "feels it's a waste of my time."  </P> <P> Polinsky acknowledged that the public perception of the hobby in some quarters  is one of yahoos running around shooting old guns.  </P> <P> In fact, the brigade has tough safety rules: Men cannot affix bayonets for mock  battles and muskets never are loaded with anything but blanks; they are  elevated whenever fired. Musket sparks and artillery mishaps have caused  injuries but no brigade member has been seriously hurt in recent years,  national commander Radford said.  </P> <P> On occasion, brigade participants are accused of glorifying war. Their response  is that tactical military demonstrations are only part of their activities.  They add that wars have been an important part of American history.  </P> <P> The Californians are a novelty in the brigade's ranks since most units are  based in the Northeast, where much of the Revolutionary War was fought. When  Dooley goes east for re-enactments, "People are always surprised when they hear  I'm from California. They say, 'They know about the revolution out there?' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Surrender at Yorktown  </P> <P> Recently he traveled to Washington Crossing, Pa., to participate in the annual  re-enactment of George Washington's Christmas Day crossing of the Delaware  River. Dooley would have prefered greater realism: crossing at night as  Washington did rather than at midday and amid snow and hail instead of under  the sunny skies that greeted the 1988 contingent.  </P> <P> Dooley and others who live history most cherish the moments that author  Anderson calls a "secular mystical experience" -- the feeling that they have  actually re-entered the 18th Century. For many, this occurred in 1981 at  Yorktown, Va., when 2,500 re-enactors restaged the Battle of Yorktown for  President Reagan and French President Francois Mitterrand.  </P> <P> For history teacher Garcia, it happened in 1987 at a re-enactment of the Battle  of White Plains in New York. After a weekend living in a wooded encampment, he  participated in a British bayonet charge, sans bayonets, at a line of Colonial  soldiers and canon.  </P> <P> "Everybody just got carried into that moment," Garcia said. "We were thrust  back into what possibly a charge have would have felt like."  </P> <P> Of course, here too, the practical limitations were significant: Garcia did not  face real bullets or canon fire as he raced across the field.  </P> <P> The brigade seeks to reflect the violence of war even if it does so without  bloodshed.  </P></p>

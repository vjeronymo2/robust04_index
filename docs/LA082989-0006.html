			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'CAN WE GO HOME AGAIN?'  </P> <P> Dennis McDougal's story ("Lynwood: Downhill on the Freeway," Part I, Aug. 20)  was timely, interesting and certainly pointed out the major changes occurring  in our region.  </P> <P> Although he focused on Lynwood, the former All-American city, other areas have  also undergone major changes. Overbuilding and clogged streets have all  contributed to an erosion of the quality of life.  </P> <P> I hope we will see more stories from The Times on changes in our cities and  areas.  </P> <P> Can we go home again?  </P> <P> CLIFF DEKTAR  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

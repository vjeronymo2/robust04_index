			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL TO START STATE AIRLINE GETS A SURPRISING BOOST  </P> <P> An unorthodox plan to put the state of California in the business of operating  its own passenger airline in competition with commercial air carriers took off  on its maiden flight in the Legislature on Tuesday.  </P> <P> In a surprise action, the Senate Governmental Organization Committee, known as  a graveyard for bills, narrowly endorsed the legislation by Sen. Art Torres  (D-Los Angeles) and sent it to an uncertain future in the Appropriations  Committee.  </P> <P> The bill would create a nonprofit corporation to run the state government's  proposed Golden State Air. Torres said the airline would chiefly connect  Northern and Southern California cities and provide "safe, convenient and  affordable" airline service.  </P> <P> Since the bill was introduced last winter, it has been widely scoffed at as  having no chance of becoming law. It is generally viewed as a legislative  needle to poke the airline industry into lowering air fares in California,  improving schedules and expanding service.  </P> <P> Defeat of the bill by the Governmental Organization Committee had been viewed  as a foregone conclusion. The Air Transport Assn., the national trade  organization of the airline industry, did not send a representative to testify  at the hearing.  </P> <P> "They didn't think we had a chance and they didn't even show up," crowed  Torres. "That's the kind of arrogance they have for the people of California."  </P> <P> Likewise, no representatives of consumers testified.  </P> <P> Later, Allan Wayne, an Air Transport Assn. lobbyist, said he saw no need to  testify because his organization had sent the committee a letter raising  questions and concerns about the substantial costs if the state created its own  airline. One Boeing 737-300 aircraft costs $30 million, he pointed out.  </P> <P> "We think the Legislature will find better purposes for the expenditure of  limited monies than for the massive start-up costs," Wayne said, insisting that  the industry was neither for nor against the bill. "We welcome the competition,  if (the state) can get the financing and proper certification from the (Federal  Aviation Administration)."  </P> <P> Critics have contended that since the airline industry was deregulated by the  federal government under the Carter and Reagan administrations, fares have  skyrocketed, safety has deteriorated, flights are inconvenient and  undependable, and some regions have inadequate service.  </P> <P> In the Legislature, anger directed at airlines has been stewing for years,  especially among Southern California lawmakers who commute between Sacramento  and their home districts as often as two or three times a week. Most pay a  discounted rate.  </P> <P> Last year, the state Public Utilities Commission reported that since  deregulation, air fares in California have increased an average 40% after  inflation.  </P></p>

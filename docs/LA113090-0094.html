			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SALDANA ATTACKER'S TRIAL FOR LETTER THREATS  BEGINS  </P> <P> The attacker in the near-fatal stabbing of actress Theresa Saldana began trial  Thursday on charges of sending death-threat letters to the movie star and her  rescuer.  </P> <P> Arthur R. Jackson, 55, faces six years in prison if convicted of sending the  letters to Saldana and Jeff Fenn, the water deliveryman who subdued Jackson and  held him for police after Jackson nearly stabbed Saldana to death in West  Hollywood in 1982.  </P> <P> In the letters, Jackson said it was his "divine mission" from God to kill  Saldana so that she could have a future heavenly rendezvous with him. The  Scottish drifter, who has a history of mental problems, entered the United  States illegally in 1982 to stalk the actress.  </P> <P> Jackson was convicted of attempted murder after the March 15, 1982, knife  attack outside her apartment. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison, which was  cut in half for good behavior. Authorities learned about the letters just weeks  before his scheduled June, 1989, release.  </P></p>

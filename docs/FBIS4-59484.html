			<p>BFN     [Text] Jerusalem, May 15 (AFP) -- The ex-PLO peace talks  spokeswoman Hanan 'Ashrawi explained Sunday [15 May] she had  turned down a job on the new Palestinian Authority not out of  opposition but to focus on a human rights groups she has set up.    "I'm not turning away from responsibility... I'm working on  something which I believe is important," she told AFP.    "I have a prior commitment to the Palestine Independent  Commission for Citizen's Rights ... and that's where I feel I  can be of most use.    "I feel that the National Authority should have people of  commitment, integrity and credentials. I have chosen where I  want to be and that is one way to participate in building our  institutions."    'Ashrawi said she had been asked several times, but  consistently turned down the offer.    "My refusal is not an opposition to the authority itself. I  have encouraged everyone to participate in different ways in  building our institutions. Everyone does not have to be in the  Authority," she said.    Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman Yasir 'Arafat  named her as one of 15 members to the new self-rule authority  for Gaza and Jericho in a list forwarded last week to Israeli  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin.    PLO chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th said the Authority would  be  ready to take up its duties on Wednesday, by when the transfer  of power in the autonomous areas is expected to be complete.    But 'Ashrawi is reportedly not the only one to have spurned  'Arafat.    Israeli television said 'Arafat had appointed two other  members Saturday -- Nabulus businessman Munib al-Masri and  university teacher Sari Nusaybah, a Middle East expert.    The appointments were formally approved in Tunis at a  meeting  of the PLO's executive committee which also nominated Yasir  'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO's Information Department, to the  authority, a committee member Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi told  AFP in Tunis.    However, sources close to 'Abd-Rabbuh said he had asked for  time to think about it.    'Ashrawi said her commission was now operational from the  West Bank town of Ramallah.    "The commission is operational already, but we have had some  technical problems such as setting up an office, so we are  working from my home for the moment."</p>

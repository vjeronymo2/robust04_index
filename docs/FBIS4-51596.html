In a resolution adopted at the rally, the students denounced  the criminal acts of the Kim Yong-sam clique, who branded the  workers' demand for wage hike as a group selfishness. The  students called on students and workers to join hands in the  struggle for the abolition of evil labor laws and the  government-controlled labor union.

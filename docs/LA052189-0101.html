			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RIOT TROOPS BLOCK SEOUL PROTEST; 1,000 ARRESTED  </P> <P> Riot police broke up protests and arrested more than 1,000 people Saturday  after the South Korean government deployed 17,000 troopers to block a rally by  dissidents calling for the fall of President Roh Tae Woo.  </P> <P> Thousands of riot troopers in combat fatigues and black helmets flooded central  Seoul, conducting street checks for radical supporters and guarding key  government buildings.  </P> <P> Police charged hundreds of protesters who tried to block streets and chant  anti-government slogans in the city center. Struggling protesters were taken  away on buses. Police said more than 1,000 people were arrested.  </P> <P> "Punish Roh Tae Woo!" and "Drive out the Yankees!" protesters yelled.  </P> <P> About 120 students courted arrest by lying down in one main street with their  arms and legs interlocked. Police hauled the students away as other protesters  screamed abuse, but there were no clashes.  </P> <P> Riot police also blocked protests in the cities of Chonju, Sungnam and Taegu.  Small protest marches were allowed in eight other cities after organizers  obtained police permission.  </P> <P> The United National Democratic Movement, the nation's main dissident alliance,  had called for a major protest in Seoul to push for President Roh's downfall  and to mark the anniversary of a May, 1980, uprising in the southern city of  Kwangju.  </P> <P> Police banned the Seoul rally on grounds that it was a threat to public order.  </P> <P> In other protests, about 500 people marched in Kwangju to call for Roh's fall.  The march was blocked by about 2,000 riot police in the city's main square, and  the protesters hurled eggs and rocks at troopers.  </P> <P> The Kwangju protest was the smallest since daily protests began May 11 to mark  the anniversary's uprising. Crowds estimated at up to 100,000 took part in  protests there last week.  </P></p>

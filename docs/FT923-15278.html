			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / ANC pulls back from sports boycott SOUTH AFRICA'S participation in the Barcelona Olympics and other pre-arranged international sporting events can go ahead as planned, the African National Congress (ANC) said yesterday. 'The decision will remain under view,' said the ANC press statement, which warned that unless the country's political crisis is resolved, it 'will consider a halt to all tours'. This cautionary note did not disguise the fact that the ANC, for the time being at least, has declined to use sport as a weapon. The news delighted white South Africa, possibly the mosts sports-conscious community in the world, although black South Africans are likely to have mixed feelings about the ANC's decision. mhe re-introduction of the ban on sporting contact may have seemed a straightforward way of punishing the government for the stalemate in constitutional talks, but there are several complications. Football, for example, is a predominantly black game here. Supporters were eagerly awaiting next week's scheduled visit of the Cameroon national side, and Crystal Palace, the English first division side. Most supporters wanted the visits to go ahead. Also at risk were the visits of the New Zealand and Australian rugby teams, and a cricket tour by India. A sports boycott cannot be turned on and off like a tap. Should the ANC wish to re-impose South Africa's sporting isolation, it would have faced a protracted round of lobbying and persuasion. Advocates of contact also pointed out that by the time this process was over, the constitutional stalemate might have been broken. In return for yesterday's go-ahead, the country's sports bodies agreed to express 'public support for peace and democracy, including a democratically elected constituent assembly'. They will also stage unspecified 'activities' during international fixtures 'which will promote peace and democracy'.</p>

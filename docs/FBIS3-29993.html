Of the amount, the government will supply  20 billion won or 40 percent from the Basic Industrial  Technology Development Fund. Chip makers such as Samsung,  Goldstar and Hyundai will take part in the project along  semiconductor equipment manufacturers. They will share costs  for the development of technology with chip equipment makers and  be obliged to purchase developed products. These steps are  featured in a comprehensive plan to groom the semiconductor  equipment industry disclosed by the Ministry of Trade, Industry  and Energy.    Even though Korea has emerged as the second largest exporter  of memory chips, the profitability of its semiconductor industry  has rather dropped because of its heavy reliance on imports of  chip manufacturing equipment.    At present, the localization ratio of semiconductor  equipment  stands at a mere 12 percent. According to the ministry, there  are some 80 chip equipment makers across the country with their  capital mostly less than 500 million won each. Because of their  weak financial status, they are unable to invest in the  development of new equipment. Making matters worse is their  high costs for management and financing. Last year, their  investment in R&amp;D (research and development) projects  accounted  for 4 percent of their turnover, compared with the average 8  percent for semiconductor equipment makers in the United States  and Japan.    Local production of chip equipment amounted to $14.5 million  last year, a mere 12 percent of the $12 billion worth demand and  a 1.7 percent of semiconductor production worth $851.2 billion.  In terms of technology development, Korea is only able to  manufacture simple semiconductor equipment used at research  institutes, while the United States, Japan and other advanced  countries enter the stage of mass-producing next generation  products.    The ministry said that the expansion in chip equipment  production can be covered by local demand because semiconductor  makers are increasing their investment in 4M DRAM (dynamic  random access memory) and 16M DRAM facilities. Their combined  facility investment last year rose 81 percent over 1992 to 2,000  billion won and it is expected to reach 3,000 billion won this  year.    If the four year-program is carried out as scheduled, local  production of semiconductor equipment will amount to $750  million in 1997, the average 36 percent increase a year.</p>

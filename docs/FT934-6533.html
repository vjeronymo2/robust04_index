			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: US banks renew assault on Germany - A driving force in this second invasion is Goldman Sachs In the 1970s and early 1980s a wave of US commercial banks invaded Germany amid a fanfare of publicity. Many left again soon afterwards having failed to penetrate the German banking market, leaving German businessmen unimpressed by the American 'talk first, action later' style of banking. This time, the invaders are the US investment banks, eager to capitalise on the perceived sleepiness of the German financial services sector. But this time, the investment banks argue, they are here to stay. 'We have extraordinarily long-time horizons,' says Mr Phil Murphy, one of the two Frankfurt-based partners in Goldman Sachs. 'We are in this for 50 to 100 years.' Goldman is the most aggressive and newest of the arrivals in Germany. Since it established its Frankfurt office in 1990 - until then it serviced its German clients out of London - staff have gone from zero to 120, doubling in the past year alone. The firm has recently taken a second floor in the Messeturm skyscraper and has won high-profile mandates. For example, advising Daimler-Benz on its mould-breaking listing on the New York Stock Exchange. 'We were late on the ground, but now we have our foot on the gas pedal more than anyone else,' Mr Murphy says. The London office - founded in 1968 and employing 1,300 people - remains Goldman's European headquarters. But Frankfurt is one of the firm's two fastest growing offices in the world, the other being Hong Kong. 'Our experience here shows you do not need GDP growth of 10 per cent a year (as in the thriving Hong Kong/south China region, in contrast to the recession-struck German economy) to run a successful investment banking operation,' Mr Murphy enthuses. 'We are extremely bullish about this market, across all divisions.' The bullishness, shared by other US investment banks who set up German operations in the mid to late 1980s, reflects several fundamental factors: An increased willingness on the part of German companies to appoint financial advisers, and foreign ones at that. 'The facts of life have changed for German corporates,' says Mr Murphy. 'The severity of the downturn is confronting them with new problems . . . people are seeking out new ideas and solutions.' Investment banks have advised on high-profile transactions - CS First Boston, for example, advised Krupp on its hostile acquisition of steel-rival Hoesch last year. Morgan Stanley advised Schering on the sale of its industrial chemicals operations to Witco of the US. A host of foreign advisers was involved in the complex transaction whereby Credit Lyonnais of France acquired control of the BfG Bank from the Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs insurance group. The capital markets are opening up. Foreign, largely US investment banks are winning mandates once the preserve of the big German banks. This is true for corporate cash-raising exercises - foreign banks muscled in as co-lead managers to big issues from Veba and Allianz this year - and for governments and para-statal organisations in the international bond markets. Salomon Brothers was co-lead manager to the World Bank's first D-Mark global bond. US investment banks have sole or joint lead managers of recent D-Mark Eurobonds from Belgium, Sweden and Argentina. Goldman was sole lead manager to a DM1bn (Dollars 588m) Eurobond issue from the Sudwestdeutsche Landesbank, the state bank for the Land of Baden-Wurttemberg. This opening up - on the domestic side at least - is driven by growing competition for capital in Germany. The costs of reunification have ensured that Germany has swung from being an exporter to an importer of capital. With the bulk of domestic savings due to be absorbed by government borrowings, the source of capital at the margin is the foreign investor. However, mighty institutions such as Deutsche and Dresdner Bank are in the domestic market but they do not have the placing power of the international investment banks. Germany has taken convincing, albeit belated steps to enhance the attractions of Finanzplatz Deutschland, Germany as a financial centre. One example is the second Financial Markets Promotion Law, approved by the German cabinet this month and to be enacted next year. This will make insider dealing illegal and create a regulatory framework for securities dealing. 'The move to outlaw insider dealing was a clear signal that Germany was serious about the development of its equity markets,' said Mr Murphy. Frankfurt has worked hard on developing dealing and settlement technology which makes securities trading more congenial for international investment banks. If technology and regulatory reform have helped woo the US investment banking community to Frankfurt, the buoyancy of German securities and currency markets has provided them with more tangible rewards. The bund market has risen spectacularly since the summer of 1992. The DAX index of 30 leading shares is up by nearly 30 per cent since the beginning of the year and currency and derivatives markets are in a frenzy. All of which has provided banks in Germany with bumper trading profits this year. Sceptics ask whether Goldman's commitment to the market place will falter once sluggish turnover levels return. Scepticism is compounded by Goldman's aggressive approach which some argue is a symptom of cultural differences between the Anglo-American approach to business and the consensus-oriented way in which corporate Germany operates. Criticism focuses on Daimler's full listing in the US, on which Goldman advised. The move shattered the consensus under which German companies agreed among themselves not to give into the Security &amp; Exchange Commission's requirement for greater financial disclosure. Daimler and Goldman are adamant other German companies will follow suit, but as yet there is no evidence of this. Volkswagen has pointedly chosen to raise money in the US via the US corporate bond market, saying it was not willing to make the disclosure associated with a full SEC-approved listing for its shares. 'Every country has its unwritten ground rules, and you can't ignore them,' comments the chief executive of a publicity-shy investment bank. The remark was directed at Goldman Sachs, but Mr Murphy is adamant that the bank is in Germany to stay - and that the rules of the game have changed.</p>

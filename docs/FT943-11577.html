			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Observer: Barking for bread With 50 companies in line for flotation, the seven members of Greece's capital markets committee, watchdog for the Athens bourse, are not heading to the beach. But their diligence goes unrewarded. They started work last December, following the passage of a new law giving them significantly sharper teeth, but the long-suffering regulators have yet to see a drachma in remuneration. To add insult to injury, the committee is still stuck in dingy, cramped offices in the economics ministry, even though it was given full independence and, theoretically, its own premises. Far from being a socialist ruse to block measures inspired by the previous conservative regime, the delay seems to be down to good old-fashioned bureaucracy. The decree defining the salary scale awaits the president's signature. So the ex-bankers, lawyers and university professors will be living off their savings for a while yet. Nothing gets signed in August.</p>

			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> CITY ADOPTS BROADER ANTI-GRAFFITI EFFORT  </P> <P> The City Council this week approved a new graffiti-removal program that  includes rewards of up to $300 for people who report those who deface public or  private property.  </P> <P> "This is a far more aggressive program than we've had in the past to deal with  the problem of graffiti in our community," said City Manager George Tindall.  </P> <P> This week's action broadens the city's existing graffiti-removal program. The  key points include:  </P> <P> A public relations campaign to promote the program through news releases, a  speakers bureau and information sheets with the city water bills.  </P> <P> * The establishment of an annual graffiti cleanup day in May and a graffiti hot  line number.  </P> <P> * New provisions in the municipal code for removal of graffiti from private  property with the permission of the owner.  </P> <P> * A reward system under which those who report graffiti will receive rewards of  up to $300 but limited to $1,500 a year for information leading to the arrest  and conviction of people applying graffiti. The funds for the rewards would be  donated by local civic and service groups. Tindall said about $1,300 has  already been raised for the program.  </P> <P> The plan is modeled on a similar program in Anaheim, where $500 rewards are  given. JAMES TORTOLANO  </P></p>

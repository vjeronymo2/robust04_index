			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Installment No 137 of the serialized memoirs of Xu Jiatun: </F> "Xu Jiatun's Hong Kong Memoirs"]    [Text] The Passing of the Basic Law (Part Two of Two) --  Liao Yao-chu Proposes Three Amendments, With Seven Dissenting  Votes Being Influenced by Li Chia-ch'eng    On the morning of the 14th [February 1990], Ji Pengfei  cheerfully told me that Britain had notified the [PRC] Foreign  Ministry that it had agreed to the [Hong Kong] legislature  having 18 directly-elected seats for 1991, and 20 by 1995.  Whereupon Liao Yao-chu [1675 3852 3796] immediately submitted  to the convention three amendments in writing on the draft's  "mainstream plan," i.e., he submitted the following three  amendments to the plan to be voted on at the convention: 1)  That the number of directly-elected legislative seats for 1995  be increased from 18 to 20. 2) That the counting of votes by  group be limited to motions and amendments to motions made by  legislators. 3) That the proportion of legislative members not  of Chinese ancestry be raised from 15 to 20 percent. Zhou Nan  immediately expressed support for this in a statement at a group  meeting. I thought that these three amendments "suggested" by  Liao Yao-chu had probably been agreed on by both the Chinese and  British, and sure enough, the draft was amended essentially  according to Liao Yao-chu's suggestions.    But the job of "persuasion" that Ji Pengfei had handed over  to me was very unsuccessful.    Li Chia-ch'eng took a negative approach to the counting of  votes by group. I discussed it with him three times, with Li  Chia-ch'eng persistently opposing it the first time, saying that  it could be considered the second time, but then saying again  that he could not endorse it the third time. Several of the  Hong Kong members of the Drafting Committee behaved in  accordance with Li Chia-ch'eng's approach, regularly  exchanging views with him during the course of the convention.  So unless we won over Li Chia-ch'eng's support, the negative  votes would not be limited to his alone. When I reported Li  Chia-ch'eng's attitude to Ji Pengfei, Ji finally sought out Li  Hou. But it was considered that even if the counting of votes by  group was voted against by those, such as Li Chia-ch'eng, it  might still win the necessary two-thirds majority for approval,  so that a few less votes would be no obstacle.    While Huo Ying-tung also dissented with the counting of  votes  by group, he did agree to support it after an exchange of views.  But he suggested to me that Article 142 of the Basic Law draft,  on "the Hong Kong SAR Government setting its own sports policy,  with private sports groups being allowed to continue according  to law to exist and develop," might have the "private sports  groups" part preceded by the two words previously existing,' in  order to emphatically safeguard the rights and interests of Hong  Kong's previously existing private sports groups. Huo Tung-ying  said that while he had suggested this view repeatedly, it had  not been paid attention to, about which he was very displeased.  So I reported this to Ji Pengfei, suggesting that he consider  Huo's view. Li Hou and Lu Ping were present at the time, and Li  Hou disagreed, holding that the existing words already had this  meaning. I said that: "This is simply a matter of words,  certainly not an issue involving principles, as it involves  simply the addition of the two words previously existing.' But  to Huo Ying-tung, it is not just a matter of words. As Huo  Ying-tung has said that this is not just his view alone, I  wonder if such a matter involving no principles might not  satisfy them?"    But my suggestion was not accepted. As the particular  responsibility for the drafting of the Basic Law belonged to Li  Hou and Lu Ping, and Ji Pengfei did not take a clear stand  either, Li Hou and the others still dealt with the matter  according to their own view. Their inability to deal flexibly  with even purely technical matters made it impossible for me to  meet with Huo Ying-tung again to give him a response.    I also exchanged views with several other Hong Kong members  of the Drafting Committee, discovering that their views  coincided roughly with Li Chia-ch'eng's.    When the draft proposals were voted on one by one at the  convention on the 16th, the balloting results were that all were  passed with majority votes. While the article on the counting  of votes by group got seven dissenting votes, it still passed.  And I guessed that these seven no votes were cast by Li  Chia-ch'eng and the Hong Kong members of the Drafting Committee  under his influence.    After the Basic Law draft was passed, Ji Pengfei feted the  whole Drafting Committee at the Beijing Hotel Guest House, where  those meeting with Ji Pengfei, Li Hou, Lu Ping, etc., were  jubilant, toasting and singing, with the whole place aflutter,  except for me, who was at a loss and distracted, so could not  share in the jubilation.</p>

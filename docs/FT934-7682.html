			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of Swiss Banking and Finance (7): Volume hits new highs - Derivatives WITH interest rates cut by half in the past year and share prices up 40 per cent, it is hardly surprising that Swiss franc derivatives markets have been booming in recent months. The Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange (Soffex) hit an all-time high volume on October 15, with 151,231 options contracts traded, and by the end of October, volume traded had surpassed last year's 15.1m futures and options traded. In the listed options market, trading volume is now more than SFr200m a day, and OZ Zurich Options and Futures, one of the most active specialists in this market, has just reported that its net income doubled in the first nine months to SFr21.5m. Over the counter volume has more than doubled too, according to Swiss Bank Corporation, the leading designer of tailor-made option packages. 'We have had a perfect environment,' an SBC derivatives specialist, said. Market participants have noticed a significant deepening of the markets, with not just the big Swiss banks, but also US investment banks, such as Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs becoming more highly active. One consequence of the buoyant conditions is that the competitive tensions among the three elements of the Swiss derivatives scene appear to have relaxed, with increasing recognition in the various camps that there is a role for everyone. It has also been a year of innovations. Since April, the top 50 warrants in the listed market have been traded continuously, and the list is adjusted weekly. Mr Balz Merkli, managing director of OZ, says the change has encouraged the big issuers to trade their warrants on the stock exchange rather than privately in the hope of joining the elite 50. In the OTC market, SBC raised eyebrows by introducing products linking syndicated bonds with equity derivatives. In October, for example, it led a SFr154m bond issue for the city of Zurich that was coupled with warrants for Zurich Insurance shares, leading some to wonder if the city was backing the insurance company or vice versa. 'The point is that you can sell these packages even to very conservative funds,' an SBC official said. At Soffex, the most welcome change was a 20 per cent average reduction in commissions early in April. The exchange, which celebrated its fifth anniversary in June, has continued to adjust its product offerings. Notably it withdrew an interest rate future on a synthetic bond when federal government borrowings became large enough to support a real bond future. The so-called CONF future, launched in June, 1992, has become a solid performer with roughly SFr700m open interest, and an option on it is to be launched next year. Soffex is also planning to introduce long-term share options within the next few months. Mr Otto Nageli, chief executive, says he is thinking in terms of two to three year contracts on the six top Swiss shares and the SMI index. Mr Nageli acknowledges that this move is not universally supported by Soffex members at the moment, and that it would put Soffex to an extent in competition with listed options on the stock exchanges. 'It is partially stepping into the quoted warrant area,' he said. But he argues that it would open up to medium sized members the possibility of making writing long term options, a business that is now restricted to the strongest banks. 'But Soffex cannot compete with its members. If they do not want it, it won't happen,' he said.</p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Closed skies over Europe THE HEALTH of the world airline industry has been a commercially delicate issue for years. It is now becoming very delicate politically as well. Last week's 'open skies' agreement between the US and the Netherlands, whereby US and Dutch airlines have unrestricted access to each other's airports, might seem an outbreak of common sense in a notoriously over-regulated industry. Viewed in a wider context, it is a step backwards. The history of air transport is bedevilled by ingrained notions of national interest. In reality, security of the skies and national flagship carriers are no longer live issues. But the vestiges remain. The typical national airline is state-owned and subsidised accordingly. The slots which give access to national airports are carved up on a nakedly anti-competitive basis. Meanwhile, the world airline industry is in financial crisis, partly as a result of deregulation. The solution lies in rationalisation and merger. Ultimately, the newly merged global carriers would benefit greatly from being true multinationals, sourcing their staff, aircraft and services freely from around the world. The counterpart is that they should operate in free global markets in respect of their customers. It is in this context that the EC is trying to assemble a common external policy on aviation by the end of this year, in time for the introduction of the single market. Member states accept the general principle, if only to strengthen their hand against corresponding blocs which are emerging elsewhere in the world, partly in response to the perceived threat of a Fortress Europe. But member states remain prey to atavistic twinges of self-interest. Germany and France are at loggerheads with the US over the claimed dumping of extra capacity by bankrupt US carriers operating under Chapter 11. The Netherlands has seen the opportunity of establishing itself as Europe's airport at the expense of its neighbours. Meanwhile, since any bilateral deals have to be struck before the arrival of a common EC policy, the US is luring individual states with the bait of access to its market while the opportunity lasts. It would be naive to deny that the EC's main motive in seeking a common policy is protecting its own interests. But if freedom of the skies is ever to be achieved on a global basis, the fewer parties negotiating it the better. And while the EC is deeply protective towards such industries as motors or electronics, there is little evidence that it feels quite the same way about airlines. Ultimately, the world industry needs to be put on an economically sensible basis. A common EC policy is a step towards that. But it is not a panacea. The continued use of subsidies to support state-owned European carriers is a legitimate grievance to non-EC competitors. The Europeans point in reply to the institution of Chapter 11, which allows US airlines to continue operating after they have gone bust. But while Chapter 11 may aggravate the industry's problems at the point of transition, it is a temporary expedient. If a US airline is truly not viable, it will go under eventually. Lufthansa and Air France will keep going for as long as their governments care to support them. In such a context, the US can scarcely be blamed for fishing in troubled waters. But until true liberalisation is achieved, a lot of people are going to go on losing a lot of money, Americans included.</p>

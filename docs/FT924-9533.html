			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Spencer's Temptation of St Anthony reaches Pounds 297,000: Saleroom SIR Stanley Spencer's painting 'The Temptation of St Anthony' sold for Pounds 297,000 at Sotheby's yesterday. It depicts the saint lying in a tomb surrounded by naked women - including the artist's wife Hilda - and was painted in 1945 for a competition organised by a Hollywood film studio for an art work to appear in the film Bel Ami. Max Ernst won the competition. Yesterday's price was below estimate but compares well with the Pounds 11,500 paid for the painting at Sotheby's in 1973 and suggests that the revival of interest in Spencer continues. Another work, 'Going to Bed', showing the artist, his wife and two daughters nestling down together, sold to Reed &amp; Lefevre, the London dealers, for Pounds 143,000 - well below the Pounds 200,000-plus forecast. The auction of modern British art did reasonably well, totalling almost Pounds 1.5m with 33 per cent unsold. There was an auction record for an Eric Gill sculpture: Pounds 66,000 paid for 'Mother and Child', sculpted in 1913. Another work to beat its forecast was 'Palm Palisade' by Graham Sutherland, which fetched Pounds 82,280. There were disappointments - important works by Sargent, Paul Nash, Burra and Ivon Hitchens failed to sell - but the room was full of mainly private collectors and when the sellers were flexible about reserves, the paintings often sold. 'Kelvingrove', by Stephen Conroy, the much promoted young Scottish artist, found a buyer at Pounds 16,500, against a low estimate of Pounds 18,000. A portrait of a woman by Gwen John made Pounds 26,400, against a low estimate of Pounds 30,000. A Lowry, 'The Orator', also sold below estimate at Pounds 49,500. Irish paintings were in demand and a set of four sketches by Jack Yeats went for Pounds 66,000. Sir Winston Churchill also transcended the recession in the art market. One of his landscapes doubled its estimate at Pounds 35,200.</p>

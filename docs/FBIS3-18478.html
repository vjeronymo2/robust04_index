			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The negotiations between Norway and the European  Union [EU] gained impetus yesterday when Sweden and Finland  agreed with Brussels on their conditions for entry. The  Norwegians have now agreed with the EU on the main outlines of  an agricultural settlement. Norway accepts the EU's farming  prices from the first day of its membership. The agricultural  producers, however, regard the settlement achieved as a total  defeat for Norwegian farming, reports Ulla-Maria Johansen from  Oslo:    [Johansen] Finland's negotiation settlement, in particular,  has speeded up Norway's membership talks, and yesterday the  government backed down from its decision to postpone the talks  until next Tuesday. As a result of the talks which resumed last  night, Norway and the EU reached agreement on the main lines of  an agricultural settlement. However, the agreement has not yet  been formally approved and details have not been made public.  According to statements by Agriculture Minister Gunhild  Oyangen, Norway has, however, accepted EU prices from the first  day of membership, the compensation to be paid to Norwegian  agricultural producers as well as the subsidy to be paid to the  food industry. In addition to the regions north of 62 degrees  latitude, the negotiations have achieved that frontier areas,  which have the same production conditions as the north, are to  be included in northern farming and EU subsidies.    The Norwegian parties have refrained from commenting on  information which has leaked about the agricultural talks as  long as formal approval by the two sides for the negotiation  result is still lacking. The farmers' central organization has,  however, already branded the agreement as total defeat and the  small farmers' central organization has described as it worse  than expected. The `No to the EU' movement, for its part,  demands a nine-month period for an EU debate before a  referendum, and according to the latest opinion poll, before the  talks on the agreement start, 28 percent of Norwegians are in  favor of EU membership, while 42 percent are against it.    The fishing negotiations also resumed in Brussels last night  and, according to Fisheries Minister Jan Henry Olsen, the two  sides have come closer to each other on the issue of EU  marketing freedom for Norwegian fish and fish products. There  has been no progress in other issues. The fishing negotiations  will continue today and one of the most problematic issues will  be Norway's demand to keep the fish resources north of 62  degrees latitude within national control. Norway does not want  to give the EU the right to decide on the fishing quota for  Arctic cod in the northern waters together with Russia. This is  Ulla-Maria Johansen in Oslo.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Fuel VAT could be permanent warn MPs BOTH LABOUR and the Liberal Democrats yesterday urged the government to retreat over the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel before European Community law made it impossible to reverse the move. The two parties warned that unless the government acted before April next year when the tax comes into effect, it would become a permanent feature. EC agreements prevent the removal of the tax from goods or services once a rate has been imposed. 'Time is running out for the Tories to see sense on VAT on gas and electricity,' Ms Harriet Harman, the shadow Treasury chief secretary, said. The Liberal Democrats said there was a risk that unless ministers reversed the move, the UK could be hit by a 'double whammy', with the government unable to end VAT on domestic fuel and unable also to resist pressure within the Community for an EC energy tax. Launching their party's proposals for environmental tax reform, Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, and Mr Simon Hughes, the environment spokesman, contrasted their proposals with the government's stance. They said that the Liberal Democrats favoured revenue-neutral measures, in which the money raised was put into compensation schemes for those least able to cope with high fuel bills, and invested in public transport. As well as a tax on energy, based broadly on the EC model, the party proposes transport taxes in the form of road pricing in urban areas, changes to vehicle excise duty, and a new system for taxing company cars. While the Liberal Democrats emphasise the difference between themselves and the government on this issue, however, the Tories have said they believe the plan for energy taxes undermines the Liberal Democrat campaign against the extension of VAT.</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Call for greater hospital efficiency DOCTORS SPEND two or three hours a day walking around hospitals rather than treating patients, according to research published yesterday, Alan Pike writes. A study of 10 National Health Service hospitals by Andersen Consulting, management consultants, showed that junior doctors walked six or seven miles in a typical shift. The research showed that an average of 10 staff are involved in a routine test, with a turnround time of 18 hours. In a five-day stay in hospital, patients would be likely to come into contact with 47 staff. Dr Nicholas Edwards of Andersen Consulting said: 'Critical processes could be simpler and involve fewer people.' He said junior doctors were forced to do an amount of travelling around their places of work which 'most people would take exception to in getting to work'. Andersen Consulting carried out the research to test the scope for patient-centred care in UK hospitals. It involves dividing hospital buildings into discrete units. All routine tests and treatment are carried out in the units, greatly reducing the movement of patients and staff around the hospital.</p>

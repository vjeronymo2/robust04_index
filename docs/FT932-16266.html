			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / US female auditors more moral than men, says study WOMEN IN US accountancy firms are more moral than their male counterparts but are less likely to reach senior positions which would allow them to influence the conduct of their firms, an academic study suggested yesterday. Female auditors in five of the six largest US accountancy firms were significantly more moral than men and were likely to make more ethical decisions as a result, two American academics told the annual academic conference of the British Accounting Association in Glasgow. The academics measured moral judgment by using tests which assessed the employees' responses to a series of fictional ethical accounting and auditing problems. Women in UK accounting firms and industry were sceptical about the claims yesterday. Ms Yve Newbold, Hanson company secretary, said women were undoubtedly more ethical 'but it doesn't follow that if you cheat you're more likely to get to the top'. Perhaps male and female influences were needed in business - 'the robust, creative accountants, and also the more ethical, cautious approach'. Mr Richard Bernardi of the State University of New York and Mr Donald Arnold of Union College analysed data gathered from psychological tests on 494 managers and seniors in accountancy firms. Mr Arnold said the women were more likely to be sensitive to signs of fraud and 'red flags' or problems thrown up by audits. He said they were more likely to blow the whistle to regulators when irregularities were discovered, and to interpret professional ethical codes of conduct by the spirit rather than simply the letter. Mr Bernardi warned that accountancy firms ran the risk of becoming less moral over time, because predominantly male partners with low moral values tended to promote like-minded individuals. He said the solution would be to either increase the promotion prospects for women into more senior positions, or to increase the retention by the firms of more moral male employees from the lower ranks. Ms Emma Lubbock, who has been a partner with Price Waterhouse for seven years, agreed yesterday that there were differences in the ways men and women worked, but said she had never seen any difference in ethical standards. Women tended to be less interested in office politics and more geared to results, she said. Ms Sheila Masters, a senior partner with KPMG, said she found the results of the research 'incredible'. There were no observable differences in the way men and women did their jobs. While there were few women currently at the top in accountancy, a new generation was coming through, she said. At the conference, Mr Bernardi called on accountancy firms to review hiring, evaluation, retention and promotion policies to assess any unwanted bias that existed in their organisations.

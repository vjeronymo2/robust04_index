			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEARING COULD DETERMINE FATE OF CRIBBS;  </P> <P> OUTDOORS: EXECUTIVE SECRETARY OF STATE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION PROBABLY WILL  BE FIRED.  </P> <P> Hal Cribbs, who will probably be fired as executive secretary by the California  Fish and Game Commission next week, is, arguably, the second most powerful fish  and game official in the state.  </P> <P> Only Pete Bontadelli, director of the Department of Fish and Game, has more  influence on wildlife matters.  </P> <P> The commission, which has scheduled a special hearing at 10 a.m. Monday,  reportedly blames Cribbs for ongoing problems with the Legislature. Nine bills  are pending that would alter or eliminate the commission's role in managing the  state's fish and game resources.  </P> <P> The commission's hearing, at which Cribbs will testify on his own behalf, has  triggered another hearing, hastily arranged by Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-San  Jose), chairman of the Senate Natural Resources and Wildlife Committee,  scheduled to start at 9:30 a.m.  </P> <P> Apparently, the purpose of McCorquodale's hearing is to determine the  relationship between the commission and the Legislature, as well as the DFG.  </P> <P> Mary Shallenberger, a staff aide to McCorquodale, said: "If he had any  confidence that the majority of commissioners had a strong background and a  genuine concern for the resource, he would probably be less inclined to get  involved. But given that the commission seems to be in such disarray, this is  to take a close look at what they are doing.  </P> <P> "We have heard rumors that Cribbs is being used as a scapegoat."  </P> <P> McCorquodale also scheduled a hearing by his committee on a similar subject  when the commission tried to fire Cribbs three years ago. He called it off when  the Assembly held one that led to no meaningful conclusions.  </P> <P> Cribbs refused the commission's latest unofficial request to resign two weeks  ago and, as an executive officer of an appointed commission, is entitled to a  public hearing before he can be fired.  </P> <P> The commission wasted no time in scheduling such a hearing, which looms as a  speedy trial followed by a quick hanging.  </P> <P> "The announcement is that I'm going to be terminated," said Cribbs, 53, the  commission's top full-time staff member since 1979. "This is not a good time in  my life. I've done a good job for them."  </P> <P> Cribbs, a wildlife biologist, would be entitled to a Civil Service position  with the DFG. Commission President Bob Bryant of Yuba City and commission  member Everett McCracken of Carmichael approached Cribbs after the commission's  regular meetings at San Luis Obispo May 18. Bryant asked McCracken to do the  talking.  </P> <P> "(Bryant) is a very sympathetic man," McCracken said. "All the commissioners  had agreed that's what we wanted to do."  </P> <P> However, only two could approach Cribbs without violating the Brown Act, which  requires the majority of a state agency to conduct its business in public.  </P> <P> Cribbs said later: "All they told me was, the intent was to improve  relationships with the department and the Legislature."  </P> <P> But Cribbs refused to resign, forcing Monday's hearing.  </P> <P> Cribbs is perceived as being left of the commission on environmental issues.  One recurring complaint is that he has aligned himself too closely with  Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress), whose campaign against inshore gill nets  has made her an enemy of commercial fishing interests in general and Bontadelli  in particular.  </P> <P> Introduction of the nine bills followed a report in January by the Little  Hoover Commission -- a state watchdog for government agencies -- that was  severely critical of the structure and performance of the commission and the  DFG.  </P> <P> Two commissioners said that legislators had complained to them about Cribbs'  interference, leading to an inference that firing Cribbs would turn down the  heat.  </P> <P> Edna Maita, senior consultant for the Assembly Committee on Water, Parks and  Resources that helped to draft the bills, said: "Whether (Cribbs) stays or goes  is not a bearing on these bills. These bills were put in by leading Republicans  and leading Democrats, and they were put in for the purpose of good government.  They have nothing to do with personalities."  </P> <P> The bills, none of which could become law before late summer, if then, are  far-ranging.  </P> <P> A package of three -- Assembly Bills 3158, 3159 and 3160 -- by Jim Costa  (D-Fresno) would transfer the commission's authority to the DFG, which would be  renamed the Department of Fish and Wildlife. AB 4039 by David Kelley (R-Hemet)  would establish separate nine-member advisory committees for sportfishing-game  and nonsportfishing-game species to be consulted by the commission before  adopting regulations.  </P> <P> Assembly Constitutional Amendment 51, by Robert Campbell (D-Richmond) would  specify the qualifications of commission members and have them appointed to  represent specific interests.  </P> <P> Senate Bill 2840 by McCorquodale would create a new Fish and Wildlife  Commission of 12 members serving four-year terms, instead of the present six,  with four each appointed by the governor, the Senate Rules Committee and the  speaker of the Assembly, instead of all by the governor -- and each would be  from a specified interest group.  </P> <P> Only one bill, ACA 52 by Richard Mountjoy (R-Monrovia), would strengthen the  commission, prescribing the qualifications of the DFG director and his top two  aides and directing that they be appointed by the commission, instead of the  governor.  </P> <P> That's the one the commission likes best.  </P> <P> Otherwise, the bills tend to strengthen the DFG at the expense of the  commission -- at a time when the department is cutting back operations because  of a $7.5 million deficit in its $151-million budget for the fiscal year ending  July 1.  </P> <P> Taucher, a former commission president, said he didn't blame Cribbs' conduct  for the bills and conceded: "We do need some restructuring. We have five  regions in the department. We need a commissioner from each region."  </P> <P> Taucher also said the commissioners should have open minds, not preset  convictions about hunting or other volatile issues.  </P> <P> Others say Cribbs is the main reason the commission ever got anything done.  McCracken said the commissioners, who meet about once a month, have relied  heavily on his guidance.  </P> <P> "We have to," said McCracken, a retired oil lobbyist. "We're just a part-time  operation. We depend on the staff a great deal."  </P> <P> Cribbs would probably be replaced, at least temporarily, by his top assistant,  Ron Pelzman.  </P></p>

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Arts: A new 'Hoffmann' from the Boston Lyric Opera Boston is where Sarah Caldwell presented Norma with Wagner's added aria, and Don Carlos with the passages that Verdi cut. (Also the American premieres of Montezuma, Intolleranza, The Ice Break, Taverner, Die Soldaten, etc.) Her grand Opera House, alas, is boarded up at the moment, her Opera Company of Boston in the red. But a younger company, the Boston Lyric Opera, keeps going, and maintains proper Bostonian tradition by presenting a new, fuller-than-ever-before version of The Tales of Hoffmann. Hoffmann has a textual history even more tangled than that of Carmen, Don Carlos, or Candide. In brief: Offenbach died while work was in progress; Carvalho gave the premiere (1881) without the Giulietta act; for Vienna, Guiraud wrote recitatives to replace Offenbach's mixture of recitative, melodrama (words spoken over music), and spoken dialogue. In Monte Carlo (1904), Gunsbourg and the composer Andre Bloch created a new Giulietta act, adding 'Scintille, diamant' and the Sextet, based on Offenbach melodies. And this became the standard version until Arthur Hammond, Felsenstein, Colin Graham, Bonynge and others sought to tidy and tighten the work, using the scanty sources then available. In 1976, 1250 autograph pages turned up in the Offenbach estate; Fritz Oeser used them for his edition, but added fresh corruptions of his own. Another 350 pages turned up at Sotheby's in 1984; they were used for Michael Kaye's edition, which had a partial premiere (with Domingo) in Los Angeles in 1988 and has been recorded by Philips. Further work, and the discovery of the 1881 libretto submitted to the censors, enabled Kaye to refine and amplify the edition, which had its premiere in Boston this month. Does it matter? Musically, Hoffmann, Offenbach's only shot at a serious opera, cannot (despite some pretty numbers) hold a candle to La Belle Helene or Orphee aux enfers. Its dramaturgy - discrete Hoffmann tales gathered into a frame of the Poet, his Various Loves, his Evil Genius, and his Muse-Companion - resists serious, consistent handling. Is Lindorf the villain? His music is sinister; he shatters Olympia, drives Antonia to death, steals souls and gets people killed in Venice. Or is he the Muse's accomplice, freeing the Poet from distracting entanglements? Is he a dark side of Hoffmann himself - an earlier Mittenhofer - who sacrifices people so that he can turn their suffering into art? Is the fourfold heroine - heartless beautiful doll, self-centred artist, passionate courtesan, great prima donna singing Donna Anna - Offenbach's compound portrait of Woman? Needless questions] Hoffmann works best as a tuneful divertissement with a teasing hint of earnestness, no more, at its core. Many people evidently do care about it; new productions keep turning up. There can be no 'definitive' version; Kaye's edition has alternative finales for Venice - one sung, the other spoken over music, and both by Offenbach - and alternative apotheoses. But directors can now make their choices from all the music that Offenbach left, not simply from what Guiraud made of it, and Bloch added to it, and Oeser (freely reorchestrating, transposing, adding) contrived. The revelation of the Boston performance was the easy, natural flow between speech, melodrama (speech over music), recitative unmeasured, measured recitative, and song. There was music unheard before: a new version of the Muse's first romance; a Giulietta chanson running up to high D; song for Stella and the Muse in the finale; in the apotheosis, a touching farewell from Stella-Olympia-Antonia-Giulietta, yielding Hoffmann to his destiny but reminding him that memories of her will play a part in it. The orchestration, thanks to the newly found pages, is now Offenbach's own. The Venice act was almost wholly new and made some sort of sense for the first time. It was a long evening. One felt that Offenbach would surely have cut. It would have seemed less long had the singers been lighter, more charming of timbre, verbally acute, less loud. John Fowler, the Hoffmann, headed for high notes, which rang out freely, but sang much else in a reinforced snarl. Patricia Racette, the heroine, was an entertaining, captivating Olympia, and a moving Antonia when she sang softly; but often she sang loudly and lost any limpidness. Stephen West, as the multiple villain, roared out on approximate pitches - a sad decline from his promising Sachs in Seattle a few years ago. All three should work for a while with Les Arts Florissants and discover that pure, forward declamation and unforced tone mean more than pumped-up volume. Stephen Lord, the Lyric's music director, conducted. He kept things going but pushed through some phrases that needed time to breathe. James Robinson's production included some silly ideas - the male choristers at Spalanzani's party were all bespectacled Hoffmanns, the women all dolls - but was generally acceptable. So was Richard Isackes set. About Caldwell shows one never used so tame a word as 'acceptable'. Whether of old or new operas, they were arresting. She may have been improvident, impractical, reckless; the musical execution was sometimes hit-or-miss; but she made Boston a fiery centre of American opera. May she soon be active again: without her (and without the Peter Sellars rival company once announced) there is less reason to visit Boston - except when something like this Hoffmann turns up. And even while hearing it, one thought what Caldwell and her company (who produced the Felsenstein version in the 1960s) might make of it.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Asian Aerospace (11): Worldwide chill reaches eastern parts - Kieran Cooke looks at the performance and prospects of the region's airlines First, the good news. The Asia Pacific region continues to be the world's fastest expanding market both for aircraft passengers and for aircraft sales. The International Air Transport Association predicts that passenger numbers in the region will double between now and 2000. By then, the Asia Pacific will account for nearly 40 per cent of worldwide passenger traffic. By 2010 that figure will be more than 50 per cent. In south-east Asia, passenger traffic is growing by about 8 per cent a year  -compared with under 4 per cent in Europe and 5 per cent in North America. On the sales side, Boeing predicts that at present rates of regional expansion, the Asia Pacific will surpass the US as the largest market for aircraft deliveries by early next century. Boeing says that of a total of 12,000 commercial aircraft needed over the next 18 years to accommodate growth and replace older aircraft, more than 30 per cent - valued at Dollars 245bn - will be delivered to airlines in the Asia Pacific. But behind all the rosy growth statistics is another story. While many regional carriers continue to outperform their counterparts in Europe and the US, 1993 was the year when the Asia Pacific was belatedly caught up in the chill of the worldwide industry recession. Profits sagged or disappeared: Cathay Pacific reported a 46 per cent fall in interim earnings last year. Malaysia Airlines' interim profit last year fell by 96 per cent, even though turnover rose by 4 per cent. Singapore Airlines (SIA), consistently one of the world's most profitable carriers, reported halfway profits last year down 15 per cent though, again, turnover had gone up by more than 10 per cent. All three carriers blamed recession in many markets and intense competition, plus adverse currency factors, for the profits slump. 'Considering the performance of the competition, we did not do too badly,' says Mr Cheong Choong Kong, SIA's managing director. Many regional carriers have been forced to cut back or reschedule aircraft deliveries. Thai Airways, Philippine Airlines, Garuda and Malaysia Airlines have all deferred or cancelled aircraft deliveries. Increased competition from carriers outside the region has hurt many regional airlines. Faced with tough conditions at home, carriers from the US and to a lesser extent from Europe have zeroed in on the lucrative Asia market. Asia's bigger carriers have also been hurt by competition from the region's new airlines, such as Eva in Taiwan and Asiana in South Korea. The region's big carriers have responded by unveiling frequent flyer programmes and improving levels of service. Passengers who have long complained that Asia has some of the most expensive air routes in the world are relieved to find carriers undercutting ticket costs. The region's carriers face other problems. Airport facilities in the Asia Pacific have not kept pace with the massive growth in passenger traffic. On some routes, passengers spend as much time getting to and from the airport as in the air. Several countries are now either expanding existing airport facilities, or building entirely new complexes. Airports are either being expanded or built at Tokyo and Osaka in Japan and at Seoul in South Korea. Hong Kong still hopes to have its new airport open by 1997. In Malaysia, work has started on a new airport outside Kuala Lumpur. In Thailand the existing Bangkok facility has been expanded and a new airport is being planned. But in the meantime, more congestion - and more frustration among passengers  -is likely. Iata says only two of the main air traffic 'hubs' in the region  -Taipei and Singapore - now have the facilities to cope with expected passenger growth. Other obstacles lay in the path of the region's expansion. There is an urgent need for Asia Pacific governments to standardise aerospace regulations and co-ordinate traffic control systems. And from the point of view of the region's carriers there is a constant need to seek cost-cutting measures. As the region's economies grow and people become more affluent, wages rise and cost advantages vis-a-vis carriers in the US and Europe will start to be eroded. Some carriers such as Cathay and SIA are further hit by rapidly escalating land costs. These two airlines have recently responded to the problems by moving some back office operations to more low cost centres overseas - Cathay to China and SIA to India.</p>

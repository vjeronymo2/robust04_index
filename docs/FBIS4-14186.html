			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Crown Prince Hasan Bin-Talal by Ashraf </F> Khalil in Amman; date not given]    [Text] [Khalil] What is your evaluation of the peace  process?    [Hasan] There have been various international moves and  initiatives following the Oslo accord between the PLO and  Israel. There are reports of a visit by U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher--the more important cosponsor of the  conference--to the region to promote the talks. To tell you the  truth, I know nothing about the visit. Regarding my evaluation  of the peace process, I believe that the current circumstances  resemble a no peace, no war situation. It looks like a  stalemate. We have not changed positions. I ask: What is the  use of the talks if they do not produce positive progress on all  tracks? The complete opposite is happening on the ground of  reality. Let me mention the Hebron massacre and the feelings of  sorrow and frustration it has left in the Arab world.  Naturally, this barbaric massacre against innocent people is a  reflection of the failure of the talks. It in turn pushes the  parties to the point of despair. That paves the way for more  unjustified acts of violence. Here, I want to return to the  basic issue, the issue of mankind and mankind's view of peace  and its benefits and gains. We are not ones to thwart the peace  process but we are searching for just and comprehensive peace in  accordance with UN resolutions.    [Khalil] What is your view of the region's future in light  of the negotiating process? Israel's ultimate aim is the  establishment of a regional bloc or a Middle East regime that  will redraw the landscape of the region. I believe, Your  Highness, you agree with me that Jordan is a sine qua non for  the Middle East market project in its first stage, the so-called  triangle, according to a book by Israeli Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres.    [Hasan] Yes, Peres says we need economic projects and  commercial dealings to protect peace. My response is that peace  will not thrive on forced relations between two different  economies when the rich side gets richer at the expense of the  economy of the poor. I believe Peres' projects need a clear  perspective. Our perspective in Jordan is that we should  shoulder our Arab responsibility within an Arab framework. Any  talk about a Middle East market that will achieve Israel's  economic ambitions is premature. We have not achieved peace  yet. So on what basis should I ask the Arab citizen to change  his feelings, agree to deal with it, and establish economic and  trade activity with it? This is a complicated process. Israel  must first of all prove its desire to live in peace by giving  the land back to its owners. It must cease its inhumane  violations and excesses against the inhabitants of the occupied  territories. It must refrain from attempting to erase the  character of Arab towns and Islamic holy shrines. In fact, we  have many reasons to reject this so-called Middle East market.  I wish to point out that it is not clear yet what the term  Middle East means.    So how can we form an economic grouping in a region with no  defined features, at least from the geographical point of view?  According to our concept, we ought to establish an Arab  grouping. We have the bonds of blood, religion, history, and a  common future. The agreements and recommendations of the summit  conference held under the aegis of the Arab League since 1957  approved the establishment of a Common Arab market. What  remains is implementation, which is not being done due to lack  of political will. You are aware of the pressure put on the  Arab League to end the boycott [of Israel]. However, in its  recent 101st session the Arab League reaffirmed its adherence to  the boycott decisions as one of the best bargaining cards in the  hands of the Arab negotiator. The Arab negotiator will not give  up this bargaining chip under any pressure or at any price.    [Khalil] In view of what you said about the Arab League and  your ambition to revive joint Arab cooperation agreements to  face Western-Zionist schemes to redraw the region's map, where  do you stand on the secretary general's call for reconciliation?    [Hasan] When that initiative saw the light in March last  year, I met with Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid. There was a notably  genuine desire among Arab intellectuals and writers to get over  the Gulf ordeal and welcome undertakings to patch up the schism  in Arab relations. The people as well are eager to restore the  unity of the nation's ranks. When it comes to states, only 13  out of 23 member states have consented to the initiative. Some  states had reservations about it due to bilateral problems,  although I am convinced that this is more reason for brothers to  get together and discuss matters rather than wait. Just as  Husayn said in an appeal to the nation's leaders, let us emerge  from the dark tunnel.    [Khalil] Since we are talking about mending fences, how far  have bilateral ties between Egypt and Jordan gone, particularly  in view of Egyptian Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi's expected  visit to Jordan on 26 April?    [Hasan] The visit is in the context of the meetings of the  Egyptian-Jordanian joint higher committee. We hope these  meetings will contribute to restoring normalcy to bilateral ties  between the two fraternal countries.    [Khalil] What about ties with the Gulf states?    [Hasan] We still believe that patience is our only hope for  an opening up or, in other words, for dialogue and for avoiding  hazards.    [Khalil] My last question is about the democratic experience  and the distance you have covered so far. Did the recent acts  of violence have an impact on that experience?    [Hasan] First of all, violence exists everywhere in the  world, primarily in the states that claim to have fully  democratic state institutions. Violence does not bother us in  effect, it enhances our belief in the need to further  consolidate our democratic practices. I admit, however, that  our democratic experience is not fully mature.</p>

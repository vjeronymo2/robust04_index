			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Insurer to sell Pounds 250m property portfolio Scottish Equitable, the life assurance and pension fund group, has put its Pounds 250m commercial property portfolio on the market following a decision to withdraw from property investment. 'We have taken a strategic decision to . . . invest in equities,' said Mr Roy Patrick, Scottish Equitable company secretary. The company believes property has underperformed equities over a period of 10 to 15 years. Scottish Equitable has allowed the percentage of property in its portfolio to drift down from 16 per cent in 1980 to its present 4 per cent. It said it was in no hurry to dispose of the property.</p>

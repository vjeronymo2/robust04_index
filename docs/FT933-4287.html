			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Reaching out for the sky screens / A look behind the figures in the improving results from BSkyB LAST WEEK when Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation was in London we had the glitz, the live boa constrictors, all the new subscription television channels and the headline claim that British Sky Broadcasting was in profit. Yesterday with Mr Murdoch back in Los Angeles, BSkyB, the parent company for Sky Television, released its financial results for the year to June 1993 in a much quieter vein and a raft of numbers and predictions about how the satellite market in the UK was moving. BSkyB announced an operational profit of Pounds 61.5m, a turnround of Pounds 108m on the year. Mr Murdoch's News Corporation holds a 50 per cent stake in the satellite venture and Pearson, owners of the Financial Times, holds 17.5 per cent. Turnover rose 63 per cent to Pounds 380m, 80 per cent of it coming from subscriptions to movie channels and the Sky Sports channel. The financial structure of BSkyB is complex, bordering on the byzantine. The operating figure is considered the most realistic basis for judging what is emerging from its start-up phase, however there was still a large pre-tax loss last year because of the interest charged on money invested by the founding shareholders. Last year's interest on external debt of Pounds 100m was Pounds 8m but there was also a notional interest figure of Pounds 130m on shareholder debt of Pounds 1.2bn out of the total of Pounds 1.7bn invested in BSkyB so far. Shareholder interest is accruing. The loans are convertible and could become equity to produce dramatic pre-tax profits if the shareholders decided this was more favourable than the present tax advantages. BSkyB was cash positive throughout the year, did not draw down Pounds 34m of available funding and will start distributing cash back to its shareholders from January. Apart from News Corporation and Pearson, the main shareholders are Chargeurs of France and the Granada group. Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at Goldman Sachs said after the presentation: 'I think it looks pretty good for the future. I think this is a very encouraging performance.' More important than how the shareholders treat interest payments is what is happening to subscription revenue, the future heart of the business now that BSkyB is almost exclusively a subscription service. Mr Gary Davey, deputy managing director of BSkyB, said that the company was now the leading satellite television company in the world after attracting 700,000 new paying subscribers in the year to the end of June. He was speaking on the day that Sky Sports was showing exclusive coverage of the England versus Poland World Cup qualifying game. Going beyond the financial year Mr Davey said that 100,000 new movie subscribers were signed up in August and that the total number of subscribers paying for at least one of the premium movie services had now passed 2m. BSkyB's internal research presented yesterday showed dish sales rising week on week from 11,000 a week in the first week of July to 22,000 a week in the last week of August. The claimed rise is at least partly reflected in the latest estimates of the size of the UK satellite market by BARB, the official broadcasting ratings organisation owned by the BBC and ITV. BARB said that there were 2.5m dishes, not including cable, at the beginning of August and 2.57m dishes in place by the beginning of this month. BSkyB also used BARB statistics to show that although 15.1 per cent of homes in the UK had satellites the figure for men aged 16-34 was 26.3 per cent and 24 per cent for children. Mr Davey also quoted TGI, an independent researcher, to back his claim that the Sky audience was not disproportionately down-market. The proportion of Sky homes with income below Pounds 9,999 a year was less than both the national average and that of ITV and Channel 4 viewers. Sky homes, the company said, with incomes between Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 24,999 and above Pounds 25,000 were all above the national average and ITV and Channel 4. After hearing the presentation Mr Blackley said there was a growing danger that BSkyB 'could become so dominant in the pay television market that cross-media ownership will become a serious political issue'. Yesterday BSkyB also confirmed that it would launch pay-per-view television  -charging for individual events - sometime next year, although it said a starting date had not yet been decided. 'We have the technology and we have the ambition,' Mr Davey said. A second Sky Sports channel will start in time for the English cricket team's winter tour of the West Indies and work continues on the possibility of launching a Sky arts channel sometime next year.  --------------------------------------------------------------------          BSKYB'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE (POUNDS M PER WEEK)  --------------------------------------------------------------------                                        Nov'90     Sep'92    Sep'93  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Subscription revenue                     1.2        4.9       7.0 Advertising &amp; other revenue              0.4        1.1       1.5 Total income                             1.6        6.1       8.5 Programming costs                        5.1        3.6       4.0 Overheads                                6.5        1.8       2.5 Total costs                             11.6        5.4       6.5 Weekly operating profit/(loss)         (10.0)       0.7       2.0  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

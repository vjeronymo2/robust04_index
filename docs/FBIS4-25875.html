			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by staff reporter Li Hsiao-ping (2621 4562 0393): </F> "Lu Ping on Need To Set Up Mechanism To Supervise Construction  Costs, Progress of Hong Kong New Airport"]    [Text] Beijing, 14 Jun (WEN WEI PO)--Lu Ping, director of  the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office (HKMAO) of the State  Council, said here today that the Sino-British Airport Committee  will continue to hold meetings this month to discuss financial  arrangements for the new airport, and that after China and  Britain reach an agreement on financial arrangements for the new  airport, a supervisory mechanism should be established to pay  close attention to construction costs and supervise the progress  of projects.    Lu Ping made these remarks when meeting with the delegation  of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions headed by Chairman  Li Chak Tim. He said that the differences between China and  Britain over financial arrangements for the new airport are  narrowing gradually and that China hopes to solve the problem of  financial arrangements first, and then discuss the draft  regulations of the Airport Authority. He reiterated that the  Chinese side is not demanding that the financial burden on the  future special administrative region (SAR) after 1997 not exceed  HK$5 billion, but according to the provisions of the Memorandum  of Understanding, the two sides must negotiate if it exceeds  that amount. At present, the Hong Kong government has financial  reserves of over HK$100 billion and the proceeds from the sale  of the land along the airport railway will far exceed the  originally estimated HK$40 billion. Therefore, it is not  difficult to resolve the financial arrangements for the new  airport, and I hope the British Hong Kong Government will inject  more money and reduce as much debt as possible. Lu Ping  stressed that after the question of financial arrangements is  resolved, it will be necessary to establish a supervisory  mechanism, and in keeping with the principle of "low costs and  high efficiency" -- as expressed in the Memorandum of  Understanding -- it is necessary to pay close attention to  construction costs so that costs will not rise continuously. At  the same time, it is necessary to supervise the progress of  projects and to strive to complete most of them before 1997.  Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the role of the  Airport Consultative Committee, and the Airport Consultative  Committee is also one of the channels. I hope that everyone  will have a cooperative attitude, and will earnestly and  properly resolve the new airport issue.    On the question of retirement insurance, Lu Ping said: The  Economic Panel and the Social and Security Panel of the  Preliminary Work Committee recently held meetings to discuss  this question. They held that the question of retirement  insurance for old people has a bearing on social stability and  should be resolved at an early date so as to guarantee that  people have something to depend on when they are old and so can  work with their minds at ease. The committee members held that  the retirement pension the British Hong Kong Government is  pursuing is subsidized welfare and that a comprehensive staff  retirement insurance system should be established first.  Therefore, they hoped that the British Hong Kong Government  would propose a comprehensive retirement insurance plan at an  early date, extensively solicit views from all quarters again,  and strive to settle the question before 1997. As for what form  should be adopted, the two panels of the Preliminary Work  Committee need to study the question further. However, most  committee members tend to favor setting up a compulsory  provident fund.    As for the question raised by members of the delegation that  workers find it difficult to find jobs during the transition of  Hong Kong's economic pattern, Lu Ping said: The Chinese  Government has always been rather concerned about this, and will  strictly control some departments and regions in their labor  services to Hong Kong so as to avoid an impact on the employment  of the Hong Kong work force. The plan to export mainland  professionals to Hong Kong is also under the HKMAO's direct  control. Lu Ping said: The future development of Hong Kong's  economic structure also should be based in industry because  industry really can create value. The reason the securities  markets of Tokyo, New York, and London are booming is that they  are supported by strong industries. So far, the Chinese side  has not considered discussing this issue with the British side.  But out of the long-term consideration for a smooth transition,  the Chinese side will put this question to the British side.    Lu Ping reiterated that the Basic Law already has clear  stipulations on the question of civil servants' pensions. The  future SAR's HK$25 billion of financial reserves plus over  HK$100 billion of land reserve already can meet the needs of  retirement pensions for civil servants in 1997. The pension for  civil servants after 1997 is guaranteed both by law and by the  financial status, so they can rest completely assured. The  Chinese side supports the setting up of a civil service  long-term service fund and is preparing to propose to the  British side, through the Joint Liaison Group, a considerable  increase in funds on the basis of the HK$7 billion so as to put  civil servants' minds more at ease. Moreover, the Basic Law  also has stipulated clearly that except for the 20 or more top  officials, all members of the civil service may continue in  their posts as long as they are willing to serve the SAR. It is  not necessarily true that the top officials cannot remain in  their posts, but they must be nominated to the executive chief  and be appointed by the central government. Some members of the  delegation proposed that the SAR Preparatory Committee issue a  notice in 1996 stating these views. Lu Ping expressed approval.    Speaking on property prices, Lu Ping said: The British Hong  Kong Government's current measures to curb property prices are  mainly to increase land supply. It will increase 15 hectares  this year and will increase another 55 hectares before 1997.  Moreover, it also has asked the Land Commission to increase an  additional 50 hectares of land as a reserve. Together, they  make up 120 hectares. This does not include the annually  approved land, the 58 hectares of land along the airport  railway, and the military land to be converted to civilian use.  In this way, land supply after 1997 will be more than 200 to  300 hectares. The Chinese side worries that this will lead to a  slump in property prices. Therefore, this question must be  negotiated through the Sino-British Land Committee and handled  carefully.    State Council HKMAO Deputy Director Wang Fengchao was  present  during the meeting.    In addition, asked by reporters today whether he would meet  with British Foreign Office Minister Alastair Goodlad on his  visit next month, State Council HKMAO Director Lu Ping said:  Goodlad is a guest from the Foreign Office and will meet with  people from the Foreign Ministry. His visit this time is not  intended for the Hong Kong issue, but to discuss Sino-British  relations and other international issues. Lu Ping said that he  would unavoidably have contact with Goodlad.</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Growth is not the only fruit: The economic upturn in Australia may prove difficult to sustain It is a long time since Australia called itself 'the lucky country'. After the post-1987 crashes of debt-laden entrepreneurs, the country has been struggling in the 1990s to cope with corporate restructuring to meet the challenge of lower tariff barriers, double-digit unemployment and low commodity prices. But in his annual budget speech recently, Mr Ralph Willis, the self-effacing treasurer, not only invoked the old 1960s label - a reference to Australia's vast resources, spread around a small population - but suggested that the nation was about to go one better. He talked of annual growth rates at, or above, 4 per cent for the next four years; of continuing low inflation; and of the budget deficit - ADollars 13.6bn (Pounds 6.5bn) in the current year - falling away to nothing by the late-1990s. All this, he suggested, was the product of a recharged economy and could be achieved with few government initiatives. Assets, such as the government's remaining stake in the Qantas airline, would be sold this year, raising ADollars 2.5bn. But there would be no increases in taxes or in the Medicare levy, Australia's national health surcharge. The biggest new expenditure item - a four-year jobs programme, designed to tackle an umemployment rate of 10.1 per cent and scheduled to cost more than ADollars 1bn in 1994-95 - would be funded by higher tax receipts resulting from the upturn in economic activity. 'Australia,' he concluded, in a rare flash of oratorical style, 'has probably never been better placed to achieve a prolonged period of high economic and employment growth.' Australians, not given to enthusiastic credulity, blinked. 'A gamble on growth', decided the newspapers. 'The budget's deficit figures and growth forecast are a total fudge,' de-clared Mr John Hewson, leader of the coalition opposition. So who is right - a mild-mannered treasurer, renowned for caution, or a wary public? In the post-budget round of seminars and speeches, Mr Willis has been anxious to spell out how unexceptional his predictions are. 'I'm not a gambling man and never have been,' he told Sydney businessmen. 'The growth forecasts were a realistic appraisal, provided we continue to play our cards right.' He pointed out that the Australian economy was already growing at an annual rate of 4 per cent, and that the nation had sustained growth rates of more than 4.5 per cent for several years in the 1980s. However, this upturn in economic activity is very recent, and many people are still trying to understand it. The 4 per cent rise in gross domestic product in 1993 was largely due to a spurt in the final quarter, when growth was 1.7 per cent. Even in the cities, recessionary fears are only just beginning to fade. While chic Sydney restaurants are well-attended, they are not packed. As one Melbourne-based economist put it: 'This doesn't feel like a boom.' Even Mr Willis admits that it will take a strong revival in business investment to push the growth rate up to the forecast of 4.5 per cent in 1994-95. The government's own figures predict that business investment will have grown by a miserly 1 per cent in the year to the end of June, yet Mr Willis is talking of a 14.5 per cent rise next fiscal year. Some observers claim this is unrealistic. 'It's ridiculous,' says Mr Stephen Kates, economist for the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Recent surveys of business confidence by the chamber have shown improvements in sentiment, but only to levels that are 'in general, satisfactory'. Mr Kates worries that real interest rates (adjusted for inflation) are rising, and that many companies face labour cost-related pressures - for example, on the superannuation front, as responsibility for pension funding is shifted to the private sector. In addition, profits growth in small and medium-sized companies may be lagging behind that in the quoted corporate sector. Critics also cite a tendency by Australian companies to invest offshore  - notably in Asia - and to continue to search for efficiency gains, rather than invest in new capacity. But there are more optimistic voices. Mr Paul Simons, chairman of Woolworths, one of the nation's largest retailers, describes the 14.5 per cent uplift in investment as 'not unrealistic'. His company's capital expenditure has increased from ADollars 150m in the early 1990s to ADollars 200m in 1994, and will head towards ADollars 250m next year. 'I don't think we're unrepresentative . . . There comes a time when you must catch up,' he comments. Mr Bill Shields, chief economist at Macquarie Bank, the Sydney-based investment bank, points out the turnround predicted by Mr Willis is 'not out of synch' with experience in the mid-1970s and 1980s. If business investment is one potential obstacle to the treasurer's objectives, a second question mark hangs over the current account. In the past, Australia has tended to lurch from boom to bust, and part of the problem has stemmed from instability on the balance of payments front, as imports have shot up. This could be a worry for the government once again: if business investment surges too late, and all at once, imports (of capital equipment and the like) are likely to get sucked in, and the balance of payments position could go badly out of kilter. The test will be whether Australia's efforts to create a competitive, internationally focused manufacturing sector really have developed a stronger export base. Third, there is the question of whether low inflation can be maintained, particularly if labour costs rise. For the past 10 years, Australia has had a centralised 'wages policy', thanks to a series of accords between the ruling Labor government and the unions. The current accord is still in place, but government efforts to encourage enterprise bargaining - that is, wage agreements struck at individual company level - mean an increasing number of workers fall outside this centralised framework. While decentralised wage agreements can help to contain labour cost inflation, because ailing or inefficient industries are not obliged to pay a centrally agreed wage rise, it is unclear whether workers will be more aggressive in their demands if prosperous companies start to award more substantial pay increases. At the end of the day, few commentators claim that the treasurer is wrong, just that his scenario makes crucial assumptions. If the economy fails to meet growth expectations, perhaps because business investment is sluggish, Mr Willis's strategy would go awry. In that case, the government's deficit reduction target would be met only through tax increases or fairly big cuts in spending. For political reasons, the former is more likely - and that would not be so lucky.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special report" by Roberto Cabada from the "Evening </F> Information Review" newscast]    [Text] There are no problems in relations between Uruguay  and Cuba. We are working toward strengthening those relations,  Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu said following a meeting  with his Cuban counterpart Roberto Robaina.    Abreu said relations between Havana and Montevideo center  around trade, politics, and cooperation. In that sense, he  confirmed his government's plans to expand trade relations with  Cuba and to seek common political positions in international  law, such as self-determination, nonintervention in the internal  affairs of nations, and the peaceful solution of internal  conflicts, principles that now exist in bilateral relations  between Uruguay and Cuba.    Cuban Foreign Minister Robaina gave Abreu a broad  explanation  on the steps Cuba has taken to find a viable national economic  model. Both foreign ministers agreed that Havana's debt with  Montevideo, estimated at $33 million, should be frozen. They  also agreed that a climate of dialogue, initiatives, and  prospects should be promoted that will permit, for example, the  reactivation of the Uruguay-Cuba commercial commission and the  visit to Cuba of a group of Uruguayan businessmen interested in  commercial activities. The invitation was formally extended a  few hours after Robaina met with members of the Uruguayan  Industrial Chamber of Commerce. Today's agenda for the Cuban  delegation included meetings with organizations for solidarity  with Cuba and leaders of the main political parties.    Uruguayan journalists have followed Robaina everywhere.  Today, all the newscasts as well as the [words indistinct]  radio stations and daily EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO ran exclusive  interviews. The main news on Montevideo's channel four was  Robaina strolling through the streets of the capital and being  greeted by taxi drivers, students, or newsboys as they  recognized him.</p>

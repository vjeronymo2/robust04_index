			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of North American Business Travel (13): Atlanta draws relocators ATLANTA, THE American South's business capital, seems within reach of its long-held goal: to become an international city. It is the site for the 1996 Olympic Games, and it hopes that the occasion will finally bring it world attention and status. The city is busy gearing up for the Games, which will bring thousands of international visitors and have an overall economic impact of more than Dollars 3.5bn. Each year, 2 million foreign visitors already pass through Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport, one of the world's largest and busiest. It is also a top US convention city, hosting such major trade shows as 'The Super Show' for sporting goods manufacturers, which drew 96,000 people last February. A combination of gentle southern traditions and energetic 'Yankee' drive, Atlanta seems in many ways the best of both worlds. Its metropolitan population has swelled to 3m. Although the majority are not Atlanta natives, many quickly acquire the contagious local southern drawl. While other cities are still struggling to emerge from recession, Atlanta in recent months has registered the strongest job growth in the US. With relatively lower costs of business and living, it has recently drawn big corporate relocations such as United Parcel Service and Holiday Inns, and large non-profit organisation relocations such as the American Red Cross. Atlanta, the cradle of the US civil rights movement, is also notable for its harmonious racial relations. It was the home of Martin Luther King Jr; and the Martin Luther King Center for the Study of Non-Violence, which houses an important collection of his papers, is there. Mayor Maynard Jackson, who is black, will not seek a fourth term this year, but is likely to be suceeded by another black politician. The city's amenities are also drawing cards. Nestled in rolling hills with many trees, parks and gardens, Atlanta is a physically attractive place. Although visitors can find traditional southern cooking, there is also African, Vietnamese, Cuban, Indian and Italian fare, among others. Golf, tennis and other recreational activities are easily accessible within the city.</p>

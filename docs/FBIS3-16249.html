			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Yevgeniy Popov article: "Phantoms Swooping in the Fog"] </F>   [Text] The name of the Bosnian town of Maglaj has been  making the headlines in the world press in recent days. In  Serbian the word "magla" means gloom or fog. Magla -- fog --  features in many extremely colorful popular phrases relating  most directly, unfortunately, to the present stage of the  protracted Bosnian conflict. People who have lost their  composure are described by the Serbs as having "fog descending  over their eyes." Fleeing cowards are described as having fled  into the fog, and people who behave unthinkingly and  thoughtlessly and take a leap into the unknown, as "plunging  into the fog."    As BBC radio reported, "twice in the last eight days UN  forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina have been ready to launch air  strikes against Serb positions."    World opinion is being purposefully and methodically  prepared  for another escalation of the Bosnian military conflict. This  is being done, to use the Serb expression, under cover of a  "diplomatic fog" -- talk about peace-making and about how  allegedly it has finally proved possible to achieve a  breakthrough at the peace talk among the conflicting parties.    Yet there are only separate Muslim-Croat talks, which it  would be more correct to describe as a conspiracy aimed against  the Serbs. After Washington, where U.S. Secretary of State  Christopher managed to bring the Muslims and Croats together by  promising U.S. dollars to cement their still extremely  problematic alliance, more detailed consultations shifted to  Vienna. According to recent reports, an agreement has been  reached on dividing Bosnian lands into Swiss-type cantons.    The Serbs have nothing against a Muslim-Croat federation,  which could eventually become a confederation with Croatia,  provided only that it is not the intention to form the new  cantons at the expense of Serbian lands. But Muslim leader Alia  Izetbegovic is already making absolutely overt demands of the  Serbs for territorial concessions in favor of the nascent  federation!    At the same time the cynical U.S. and NATO blackmail of the  Serbs is growing all the time. It is in this context that we  should view both the recent act of piracy by the Phantom  aircraft which downed four Chaykas in the skies over Banja-Luka  and the recent combat air patrols by NATO bandits [stervyatnik]  over Maglaj.    As world news agencies have reported, British Lieutenant  General Rose, commander of UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  asked Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's representative  in the former Yugoslavia, for authorization to launch air  strikes against Serb positions and was given it. After which  Phantoms made combat flights into the Maglaj area, although they  were unable to carry out the mission because of bad weather.    Maybe the most monstrous thing in this episode is Russian  diplomacy's latest act of treachery toward the Serbs. Kozyrev's  department is behaving as if nothing extraordinary has happened,  and in recent days presidential envoy Vitaliy Churkin has even  made statements which essentially constitute pressure on the  Bosnian Serbs.    The fog surrounding "Yeltsin's Balkan initiative" is  gradually dispersing, and on the eve of Kozyrev's meeting with  Christopher in Vladivostok the British newspaper THE TIMES made  a prediction which, unfortunately, looks extremely plausible:  "It looks like the Americans have concluded a new Yalta  carve-up with Moscow." In which case, the newspaper concludes,  "one can only sympathize with the Serbs." It would be more  correct, however, to say that sympathy should be extended not  only to the betrayed Serb people but also to us Russians, since  the Phantoms currently swooping over Maglaj are in fact also  ready to open fire on Russia's interests!</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / International Company News: Monks loses battle for Sears, Roebuck board seat MR ROBERT MONKS, leader of the battle to reform American corporate governance, has lost his bid for a seat on the board of Sears, Roebuck, the giant US retailing and financial services company. A preliminary count from the company's annual meeting yesterday showed that the management's slate of three candidates had won. Mr Monks vowed to try again next year. Mr Edward Brennan, Sears, Roebuck chairman, claimed Mr Monks' concerns 'were more with corporate America than with Sears'. 'Our opposition to Mr Monks was based upon our belief that our principal responsibility to shareholders is to improve our financial performance so that we might enhance the value of their investment, not to use the Sears boardroom as a forum for Mr Monks' personal agenda,' he said. Mr Monks efforts, however, reflect serious shareholder discontent. Mr Brennan faced many shareholder complaints yesterday, ranging from poor service in stores to disappointing financial performance. The chairman admitted the 1990 results were 'unacceptable,' but said they underscored the improved first-quarter performance this year. He also pledged that 1991 would be a better year overall given that the company had deeply cut its costs and that the economy was expected to emerge from recession. Sears, Roebuck's 1990 net income was Dollars 902m, or Dollars 2.63 per share, down from Dollars 1.5bn, or Dollars 4.30 in 1989. Cost-cutting helped first-quarter 1991 net income to grow to Dollars 202.7m, or 59 cents per share, up 91 per cent from Dollars 106.3m, or 31 cents, from 1990. Highlighting the first-quarter results, however, was only 'trying to put the best face on things,' according to Mr Lawrence Spitzer, an individual shareholder. 'Brennan has his back against the wall,' he said. Mr Brennan, who is not only chairman and chief executive of Sears, Roebuck, but also chief of its troubled merchandise group, came under fire from Mr Monks for concentrating so much decision-making power in his own hands.</p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WANTED: A NEW HOUSING DIRECTOR  </P> <P> Leila Gonzalez-Correa has resigned as executive director of the Los Angeles  Housing Authority after accusations of cronyism, breaking promises and trying  to impose gag orders not only on staff members but also on complaining tenants.  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley and the city's housing board have their second chance in four  years to find a strong, skillful and sensitive leader who can make life at  least bearable, and, in many cases better, for poor families who live in the  city's 21 housing projects and 22,000 federally subsidized leased apartments  administered by the authority.  </P> <P> A lawyer with housing experience, Gonzalez-Correa came to her tough job with  good credentials. She was hired 2 1/2 years ago to direct the troubled housing  agency after another controversial executive director, Homer Smith, resigned  under criticism of poor management practices, including a failure to follow the  required competitive bidding process. When Gonzalez-Correa tackled glaring  problems in the city's 35,000 low-income housing units, she quickly got into  similar trouble.  </P> <P> She awarded contracts exceeding $10,000 to acquaintances without seeking  competitive bids. She refused to inform the housing board about major projects.  Her proposal to sell the Jordan Downs project in Watts to private developers  ultimately cost the housing agency $5 million in scarce federal improvement  funds. She alienated tenants by making promises she couldn't keep and by  excluding them from decisions that directly affected their lives. Finally, she  tried to forbid housing authority staff and tenants from speaking publicly  without permission, prompting the mayor to issue a strong rebuke last week.  </P> <P> The mayor and the housing board now will look again for an executive director  with housing experience and strong management skills to run a large and complex  public agency with 750 employees, a budget of $135 million and 96,000 tenants.  </P> <P> But the job involves more than taking care of the buildings, collecting the  rent and trying, often in vain, to evict troublemakers. The new director must  serve the tenants, typically the poorest of the city's low-income families,  many of them impoverished single mothers trying to raise families in a safe and  decent environment  </P> <P> Until a new housing executive director is selected, Gary Squier, the mayor's  housing adviser, will serve in the job. Squier, pragmatic and accessible, knows  low-income housing and he knows how City Hall works. He will start today to  rebuild the tenants' trust in the housing authority.  </P> <P> Mayor Bradley and a more demanding Los Angeles Housing Authority Board of  Commissioners must find a first-rate housing director and strongly insist that  the housing chief translate sound ideas into better lives for thousands of poor  families.  </P></p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Cosmetic surgery cuts a dash with China's new face: How a change in attitudes in the People's Republic lets women alter their looks MORE Chinese want wider eyes and bigger noses and are subjecting themselves to cosmetic surgery. Surgeons performing the operations, excising part of the upper eyelid and inserting a silicon strip in the nose, say the aim is not to look more western. But to many young Chinese western standards of beauty are part of a revolution in style which has come with a taste for hamburgers and Kentucky Fried Chicken, rock and roll, imported designer sunglasses and jeans. At Shanghai's 9th People's Hospital 2,000 cosmetic surgery operations were performed last year. The hospital has a waiting list of another 2,000 and there were an estimated further 1,000 operations in other Shanghai hospitals, a tiny number in a city of nearly 14m people, but growing. Most are for eye rounding and nose augmentation, but the hospital's plastic surgery department also offers face lifts, stomach tucks, breast enlargement and lyposectomy, sucking surplus fat from the body. Patients are overwhelmingly female and local. Lured by the low cost more are coming from Hong Kong, Macao and south east Asia. For around Dollars 11 a local patient can have both eyes widened. A nose costs Dollars 14. Overseas Chinese and Hong Kong compatriots pay 10 times as much, but the price is still attractive. Professor Wei Wang, director of the plastic surgery department, expects to put it up to Dollars 50 by the end of this year. In the 1950s cosmetic surgery was forbidden by the government. In the cultural revolution self-beautification was bourgeois, decadent and dangerous. 'We just asked Deng Xiaoping if it was alright to go ahead,' said Professor Wei with a chuckle. Since 1982 the department's surgeons have performed 500 face lifts. Cosmetic surgery was approved after the fall of the gang of four, according to Professor Guan Wen Xiang, head of the hospital's research institute into plastic and reconstructive surgery. Standards of beauty change in China as everywhere else. In the Tang dynasty fat was fashionable. For centuries tiny feet were seen as beautiful, many women being crippled by the cruel custom of foot binding. The westerner has long been mocked as a Big Nose but Chinese fashion now dictates that the small, flat Chinese nose is enlarged with silicon - 'but not like yours', Professor Guan added hastily. In the shapeless 1970s curves were taboo and the Chinese female figure in its Mao jacket looked little different from the Chinese male. Women such as Wang Ling, sitting on her bed at the 9th People's Hospital after having her breasts enlarged with silicon implants, are now embarassed by their lack of curves. 'My husband is a businessman and he wanted satisfaction,' she said. 'He wanted me to look good socially.' In the bed opposite Lu Feng Hua, 40, is about to spend Dollars 250 on a face lift. All the way from Inner Mongolia where she practices traditional Chinese medicine, her tight smooth skin shows a few laugh lines at the eyes and frown lines across her forehead, but nothing to warrant a face lift. Of 8,000 patients seen last year by the plastic surgery department, 25 per cent were about 'making people look more beautiful and younger than they are,' as Professor Guan puts it. The rest were seen for disfigurement by burns or congenital deformity.</p>

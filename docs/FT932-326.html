			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Strong overseas demand for first sterling deal from Osaka Gas TWO sterling deals, for Sweden and Osaka Gas, were the main focus of attention in a lively session yesterday. Weekend newspaper reports boosted positive sentiment on the pound, which followed through into the gilt and Eurosterling bond markets. The Osaka Gas deal, which was widely marketed last week, caught investor interest, partly because it was its first issue in the sterling bond market. Dealers said the deal was rapidly sold out. According to the lead manager, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, demand for sterling paper from overseas meant that the deal was heavily oversubscribed. However, placement was concentrated among UK investors, as Osaka Gas designed the issue to expand its investor base in the UK. The company raises a large proportion of its debt in the Eurobond market, and has already tapped the French franc, dollar, Euroyen and D-Mark sectors. The Pounds 150m, 10-year issue was priced to yield 40 basis points over the comparable gilt, which dealers said was an attractive level for a utility-rated AA2 by Moody's and AA- by Standard and Poor's. By the end of the day, the spread had tightened to 38 basis points over the gilt yield. Mr Yasuo Ryoki, senior assistant manager of the finance department at Osaka Gas, said the deal had been swapped into fixed-rate yen at a level that was 'very competitive' with the Japanese long-term prime rate. He said his company would launch a small Euroyen deal today. Sweden's Pounds 350m seven-year issue met a slightly less enthusiastic response, though it also benefited from demand for sterling bonds, and from improving sentiment on Sweden's credit-worthiness. Last year, when the Swedish kronor was devalued amid currency turmoil and the country's economy was widely perceived to be in severe difficulty, spreads on Sweden's Eurobonds widened dramatically. They have, however, improved steadily since the start of this year. For example, Sweden's recent Ecu500m, seven-year deal, launched at 5 basis points over the comparable Ecu OAT, is now trading at 14 basis points below. While some of Sweden's debt fell prey to asset-swappers last year, this deal represents floating-rate funding of around Libor flat, according to dealers. Dealers said the seven-year maturity was attractive, since there had been a lack of paper in that area of the yield curve this year. According to co-lead manager JP Morgan, there has been Pounds 5.8bn of five-year paper, Pounds 4bn of 10-year paper, and just Pounds 600m of seven-year paper to date. Nevertheless, the pricing of the deal was perceived as slightly aggressive at a launch spread of 33 basis points over the 9 per cent gilt due 2000. In the dollar market, Tokyo Electric Power Company launched a large Dollars 1bn, 10-year issue via Goldman Sachs. Dealers reported strong demand from eastern Asia but said European investors had been distracted by speculation about European interest rates and currencies, and were not currently focusing on the dollar sector. Goldman took the lion's share of the deal, which was launched at 36 basis points over the 10-year US Treasury. In the D-Mark sector, Turkey launched a DM500m deal, increased to DM750m, via DG Bank. The deal was priced at 220 basis points over the comparable Bund. Peugeot Finance International has announced a Pounds 100m Euro commercial paper programme, with a multi-currency option. The programme is rated A1 by Standard &amp; Poor's.</p>

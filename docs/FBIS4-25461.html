			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter He Tianwen (0149 1131 2429)] </F>   [Text] Guiyang, 8 Jun (XINHUA) -- According to information  released by a national seminar on aiding the poor through  transportation and communication projects held by the Ministry  of Communications in Guiyang recently, the state will invest 1  billion yuan annually -- for a seven-year period starting this  year until the turn of the century -- to provide relief in the  form of jobs on key highway construction projects in 21  provinces and autonomous regions in west-central China to change  the backwardness of impoverished areas.    Since reform and opening up, particularly since the  mid-eighties, transportation and communication departments have,  with the full support of the state, built more than 44,000 km of  new highways which were up to prescribed grades and standards,  and more than 42,000 km of new roads for use by farm machines.  They have repaired more than 64,000 km of off-grade highways,  built over 8,500 new bridges, harnessed more than 700 km of  waterways, and connected over 1,500 towns and townships and more  than 10,000 administrative villages by highways. These projects  have played an important role in developing the economy of  poverty-ridden areas and in solving people's food and clothing  problems.    Nevertheless, more than 1,700 towns and townships and over  17,000 administrative villages nationwide have not yet been  connected by highways and thus are inaccessible by car. Most of  these townships and villages, which are not connected by  highways, are located in poor areas in west-central China.  Accordingly, the State Council has decided to use newly  allocated work-relief funds this year, mainly to launch  communications projects in impoverished areas. Working around  the central task of economic development, the state will build  roads leading to townships, interconnected highways, highways  leading to rural trade fairs and commodity distribution centers,  and "truncated" highways [highways cut short and diverted to  other directions], while paying equal attention to the problem  of drinking water for human and animal consumption in areas with  serious water shortages.    A relevant responsible person from the State Council's  Leading Group for Aid-the-Poor Projects noted: The state's  investment of massive work-relief funds to improve  communications conditions in poverty-stricken areas is an  important part of our country's key "87" aid-the-poor program [a  program under which 80 million households will be lifted out of  poverty within seven years]. Therefore, we should genuinely  stress investment returns, ensuring that every road which we  start building will be completed, and that every road which we  build will lead to prosperity. We must not rush headlong into  action and start projects indiscriminately.</p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Construction Contracts: Bypass scheme A Pounds 15m contract to remove one of the last remaining traffic bottlenecks and open up a faster route through Cornwall and the West Country, has been awarded to TARMAC. A new bypass scheme diverting the A30 and A39 trunk roads in mid-Cornwall and relieving the villages of Indian Queens, Fraddon and St Columb Road, is to be carried out by the company's major projects division. The new 5.4 kilometre section of the A30 between Penhale and Goss Moor will provide another stretch of dual carriageway in the overall plan for a faster route from the M5 at Exeter through Devon and Cornwall.</p>

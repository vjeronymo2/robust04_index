			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Rugby edges ahead to Pounds 30.5m - City pleased with interim results from two construction companies SHARPLY reduced net interest income offset higher operating profits in the first half at Rugby Group, which supplies cement, joinery, steel and glass to the UK, European and US construction industries. As a result the group reported only a marginal gain in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 30.2m to Pounds 30.5m, in the six months to June 30. Earnings per share improved to 6.91p (6.86p) and the interim dividend is unchanged at 2.85p. Despite the flat pre-tax profits Rugby's shares gained a further 17p to close at 279p yesterday. Operating profits increased by 10.5 per cent to Pounds 30m (Pounds 27.1m) on turnover which grew by 27 per cent to Pounds 360.8m (Pounds 283.7m). However, net interest income fell to Pounds 493,000 from Pounds 3.06m, reflecting the impact of lower interest rates on sterling deposits. At the end of June the group had net cash of Pounds 13.5m (Pounds 12.4m). Rugby, which is Britain's third largest cement manufacturer, said despite some slight signs of a recovery in the UK, the construction industry remained depressed and cement sales and profits were both lower. Cement sales fell by 8 per cent to Pounds 58.3m (Pounds 63.3m) and operating profits dropped by 15 per cent to Pounds 8.79m (Pounds 10.3m). However John Carr, the group's UK-based joinery business, posted modest growth, particularly through recent acquisitions, and managed to lift its operating profits by nearly 4 per cent to Pounds 7.27m (Pounds 7m) on turnover ahead 16 per cent to Pounds 64.5m (Pounds 55.6m). Overall UK operations accounted for Pounds 180.3m (Pounds 149m) of group turnover and Pounds 18m (Pounds 17.3m) of operating profits. Mr Geoffrey Higham, chairman, said the Australian results were 'much improved as the economy recovered,' as was the case in the US. However, conditions in continental Europe were less robust although the joinery act-vities continued to advance. COMMENT Rugby is a well-run company with a solid balance sheet that has proved it can manage costs and make profits in even the worst of times, and has thoroughly deserved its premium rating to date. But the management knows it needs to make a large acquisition soon in order to make better use of its cash balances. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 61m look possible this year producing earnings per share of 14.1p. Yesterday's share price jump puts the stock on a forward multiple of nearly 20. It is too late for recovery plays, so Rugby may have to take a few more risks to justify its rating in the future.</p>

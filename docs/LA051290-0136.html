			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASTOR ADVISES CHURCHES TO LIGHTEN UP  </P> <P> A Baptist minister said church officials should quit complaining about  declining membership, stop telling the faithful "thou shalt not" and start  having some fun instead.  </P> <P> Anthony Campolo, president of Evangelicals for Social Action in Pennsylvania,  offered the advice this week to 1,300 participants at the National Evangelism  Workshop.  </P> <P> The Bible is not as humorless as many churches portray it, Campolo said.  </P> <P> "Jesus said the kingdom is like a wedding reception and he's the bridegroom.  Jesus was Jewish, which is almost as good as Italian," he said. "They know how  to throw a wedding."  </P></p>

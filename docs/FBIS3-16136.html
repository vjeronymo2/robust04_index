			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Cristian Nita dispatch from Chisinau] </F>   [Text] Moldovan President Mircea Snegur left today for an  official visit to Brussels, where he will sign the general  documents on Moldova's adherence to Partnership for Peace.    Just before leaving, President Mircea Snegur made the  following statement to the correspondents:    [Begin Snegur recording] This visit to Belgium is part of  our foreign political activity, belonging among the events  scheduled to take place in 1994. Its main goal is to sign the  Partnership for Peace plan, since that partnership ensures  security and stability in Europe within the new circumstances  that emerged after the collapse of the socialist bloc and the  Soviet Union. Moldova is a small and peaceful country that does  not represent any danger whatsoever for anyone. Moreover, as  you may know, the people have decided [in the 6 March public  opinion poll] that we should promote a policy of neutrality;  therefore, we need certain guarantees, and such guarantees are  offered to us by Partnership for Peace.    In the same context, a meeting is scheduled to take place at  the headquarters of the Western European Union [WEU] to discuss  the same issues of security and cooperation in Europe.    We consider our meeting at the European Union headquarters  as  very important because we want to conclude a partnership and  cooperation accord with that economic union. Negotiations will  be initiated as soon as possible; thus, it is necessary to pay a  visit to the European Union.    Finally, we will approach aspects of our bilateral relations  with Belgium because we need to discuss the bilateral documents  that are being prepared for signing.    Thus, my three-day visit will actually consist of a one-day  visit to Belgium, another day will be consecrated to NATO in  view of the Partnership for Peace plan, and the third one to my  talks at the European Union.

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries recover as fears of tax cut fade AFTER worries about a possible announcement of new tax cuts by President Bush had depressed US Treasury prices in early trading, the market rallied in the afternoon yesterday although trading activity remained light throughout. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond had recovered from its early losses and was up  3/32 at 99 1/8 , yielding 7.317 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged at 100 13/32 to yield 4.013 per cent. Since last Thursday, when Mr James Baker, the new chief of staff at the White House, said tax cuts should be a central plank in President Bush's re-election campaign and second term, enthusiasm for bonds has been tempered by fears that if taxes were eventually cut, economic activity might revive, inflationary pressures pick up and the Federal budget deficit widen further. AUSTRALIAN government bonds ended the day mostly firmer, although shorter-dated debt issues fell on signs that the market may have to wait a while for the next cut in interest rates. The government bond market climbed following Tuesday evening's government budget and comments from the Treasurer, Mr John Dawkins, suggesting further cuts in interest rates would occur provided inflation remained under control. However, short-dated issues were thrown into confusion by reports yesterday that Mr Dawkins had said no further rate reductions were planned. Dealers warned Mr Dawkin's contradictory comments were probably aimed at stabilising the Australian dollar, which has weakened against the US currency. In the futures market, September three-year contracts dropped to 93.16 from a high of 93.40, before ending at 93.28. The contract closed at 93.23 on Tuesday night after the budget. An Australian Treasury official was reported as saying the government was considering the issue of new Treasury bonds with lower coupons and longer maturities. According to the budget statement, the government needs to raise about ADollars 16bn through Treasury bond issues in the 1992/93 fiscal year to help fund its forecast budget deficit of ADollars 13.39bn. The government has indicated it plans to hold smaller bond tenders of about ADollars 750m at regular two-to-three week intervals. JAPANESE government bonds continued to climb yesterday as Tokyo stock prices fell further at the start of trading, leading to hopes of an easing in interest rates. However, as the Nikkei share index recovered later in the day to close up 341.33 points at 14,650.74, bond market participants took profits, wiping out most of the day's gains. The benchmark No 129 opened with a yield of 4.71 per cent and moved to 4.655 per cent before closing in Tokyo at 4.70 per cent. FRENCH government bonds weakened on concern over the future of European economic and monetary union. Dealers said the market was nervous ahead of the release last night of two polls on the Maastricht Treaty which were expected to show a drop in support for ratification of the Treaty. The Matif futures contract edged up from 105.58 to 105.62 while cash bonds ended lower or unchanged. German government bonds traded in a narrow range ahead of today's Bundesbank Council meeting and the possible release of the July money supply figures. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 87.65 and ended unchanged after trading between 87.54-87.67. Dealers said the Bundesbank's tender allocation yesterday was seen as neutral for the market. The Central Bank added DM4.2bn in funds to the money market, helping to dampen speculation about a possible rise in the Lombard interest rate at the Bundesbank's meeting today. STERLING'S weakness in the foreign exchange markets depressed UK government bond prices, with the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 slipping from 103 3/8 to 103 9/32 . The Liffe gilt futures contract inched up from 97.12 to 97.15.</p>

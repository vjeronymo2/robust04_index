The oil  will be sold at the normal international price and there will be  no compensation or barter mechanism, the report adds.    Another report from Bogota adds that the Barranquilla  Municipal Council has condemned the U.S. blockade against Cuba,  and that Barranquilla and Matanzas will soon be declared sister  cities for possible cooperation. Cuban Ambassador to Colombia  Jesus Martinez also paid a visit to Barranquilla. He learned  details about the project to declare Barranquilla and Matanzas  sister cities and that this will probably take place when  Barranquilla Mayor (Bernardo Hoyos) visits Cuba by mid-March.  The ambassador held a lengthy conversation with the Barranquilla  mayor.    Ambassador Martinez also held meetings with the governor of  Atlantico Department, (Gustavo Bell), businessmen, health  officials, university students, and professors. During the  meetings they discussed prospects for cooperation in different  fields, many of which will be included in the declaration of  sister cities. These cooperation prospects will be developed  mainly in sports and cultural, touristic, and scientific  activities.</p>

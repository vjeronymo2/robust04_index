			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Philippe Reinhard: "Mitterrand: Minimal </F> Support for Rocard"]    [Text] Michel Rocard will probably never be president of  the Republic. Francois Mitterrand, who twice thwarted his  ambitions only to appropriate the position himself, will do  everything he can to prevent [Socialist Party First Secretary]  Rocard from succeeding him -- and Mr. Mitterrand retains his  full capacity for making a nuisance of himself. In Tuesday [10  May] night's televised interview, the president of the Republic  did not attack his former prime minister. He did worse: He  ignored him.    People had been wondering about Francois Mitterrand's stance  with regard to the European elections. Members of his entourage  had dropped hints about his preference for Bernard Tapie, which  had caused an outcry at "rue de Solferino" [Socialist Party  headquarters]. This suspicion of betrayal had grown so much  that the president felt the need to pretend to be scolding his  staff upon his return from Central Asia. So everybody had to  hear that the Socialist president supported no other list than  the Socialist Party's.    Unfortunately for Michel Rocard, during Francois  Mitterrand's  interview with Paul Amar and Patrick Poivre d'Arvor, the  president proved unable to put an end to the rumors. On the  contrary, he gave them a new lease on life. To be sure, he  indicated he would vote for the only list that is both "European  and Socialist" and that, as far as he knew, there is only one  such list. But at no cost would he let himself simply say that  he supported Rocard's list. As if even saying Michel Rocard's  name would hurt his mouth.    While the president had praise for Philippe Seguin [National  Assembly speaker], he mustered only minimal support for Michel  Rocard. To say the least, he did not appear entirely convinced  of the legitimacy of his successor's position at the helm of the  Socialist Party. Thus he spoke of the Socialist Party's  "current managers." One could hardly have been more reserved  with respect to Michel Rocard himself.    The president of the Republic was not only coldly malevolent  with respect to Mr. Rocard; he also lavished his praise on  Bernard Tapie, the Socialist's greatest foe in the 12 June  European election.    Mitterrand, who seems to have a special taste for canine  metaphors, refuses to "howl with the pack." He portrays Mr.  Tapie as a left-wing man and commends his merits as a sports  club manager and [former] minister. He even had rather  encouraging words for him: "He is a man of exceptional energy;  but above all, I note that he has chosen the side that we may  term progressive." Rocard would probably have been satisfied  with lesser compliments.    The president went even further on the subject of the  impending presidential election. He clearly indicated that he  would not take a stand before the second round of voting. And  above all he noted that Michel Rocard's candidacy remained to be  "confirmed" by the Socialists. And to add insult to injury, he  said he expected the winner to be a right-winger. He could  hardly have been more malicious toward the Socialist Party's  "natural" presidential candidate.    This behavior does not seem to affect Michel Rocard,  however,  who said yesterday on France-Inter radio that he was quite happy  with this rather ambiguous support. Socialist Party Treasurer  Pierre Moscovici, in a commentary made on RMC radio on the very  night of the telecast, was more explicit. He explained that the  less support Mitterrand gave to Rocard, the more likely the PS  list would be to succeed. Nevertheless, Socialist officials  cannot hide from the fact that a failure in the European  election (less than 20 percent of the votes) would inevitably  ring the knell of Michel Rocard's presidential ambitions.    Francois Mitterrand, who remains one of France's best  experts  in electoral matters, knows this. If he decided to obliterate  this man who has been his foe for the last 30 years, it is  because he is not one to forgive offences, and also because he  would like to be able to hand over his position to a left-wing  man. And he is so certain that this man cannot be Rocard that  he does everything he can to eliminate him.</p>

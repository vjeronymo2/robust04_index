			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 23, IRNA -- A senior official at the  National Iranian Oil Company [NIOC] said that the oil price  increase of the past few weeks is a result of temporary  difficulties and optimistic prospects for the rest of the year  seem faint.    Head of the company's international relations Ghanimifar  Mohabat Ghanimifar, in an interview with the English daily  `TEHRAN TIMES' which appeared Monday, noted that OPEC and  non-OPEC members have cooperated closely in order to stabilize  prices so that neither producers nor consumers incur losses.  The extreme winter conditions in the northern hemisphere have  lowered oil reserves in industrial nations of the west including  the United States, he added. Since many western countries are  slowly recovering from recession and economies seem to be  speedily improving, the demand for oil is bound to increase,  Ghanimifar remarked. "Furthermore", he said "OPEC countries  have been producing according to agreed-upon quotas during the  past few months, as a result of which markets have not been  flooded with supplies".    The approach of Saudi Arabia and Iran after certain OPEC  sessions has been constructive and had definitely contributed to  price increases in international markets, he continued.    Referring to fighting in Yemen, political unrest in Nigeria  and low North Sea reserves as elements affecting the market,  Ghanimifar said that the stock market speculations and share  sales may have been another reason for the price hike. Consumer  countries are worried that the agreement reached between OPEC  and non-OPEC producers could result in producers' monopolizing  the market which was rejected by Ghanimifar. He also mentioned  that in the very near future, Iraq will once again be able to  sell oil and saturate the market at which point greater  cooperation on adjusting and staying within quotas will be  needed.    He concluded by suggesting that cooperation between the oil  producers should be initiated long before the market begins to  dictate its terms on prices.</p>

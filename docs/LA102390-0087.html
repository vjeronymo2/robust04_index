			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Bar Assn., Business Groups Agree: Colorado businesses will try to slash legal  costs and reduce off-the-job time losses by attempting negotiation and  mediation before taking their disagreements to court, under a newly introduced  program.  </P> <P> The program, called "Colorado Pledge," is an agreement by the bar association,  the Greater Denver Chamber of Commerce, the Colorado Assn. of Commerce and  Industry and the National Federation of Independent Business, Conover told  reporters. "We hope it will show to you a side of lawyers that is not  frequently enough publicized -- a side of lawyers that solves problems and  helps clients solve problems not in the courtroom arena," Bar Assn. President  Jerry Conover.  </P></p>

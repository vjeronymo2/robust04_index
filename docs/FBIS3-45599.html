At the meeting, Public Security Minister Tao Siju conveyed  central leading cadres' important instructions on enhancing work  on public security and politics and law. Vice Public Security  Minister Tian Qiyu delivered a report on the situation  confronting the current public security work and on future tasks.    Last year, thanks to the efforts of all, various levels of  public security organs accomplished well their duty of  maintaining stability, of cracking down on enemies, of punishing  criminals, and of protecting the people. In January-November  period last year, the nation's public security organs cracked  over 1.04 million of various criminal cases; recovered 4.8  billion yuan worth of money and goods; scored remarkable results  from extensively launching the drive to crack down on criminal  gangs, on hunting down fugitives, and on solving major cases;  successfully investigated into and handled a large number of  major economic fraudulent cases; and helped the state prevent  economic losses worth $130 million, or 400 million yuan.    In analyzing the current situation of social order,  participants at the meeting were of the view that the social  order at present is normal and that the normal social order has  produced a reassuring effect on reform, opening, and on  developing the economy. However, the number of criminal cases  still shows a rising trend, particularly the number of major and  serious cases. Social order in some regions is not good;  criminals run rampant; and the masses lack a sense of security.    Participants at the meeting called for continuously  upholding  the policy of "severe crackdown on crimes" and for continuously  exerting utmost efforts to stem the rising momentum of criminal  cases. They called for concentrating efforts on "cracking major  cases, cracking down on criminal gangs, hunting down fugitives,  working out measures suited to local conditions, launching  special campaigns, and carrying out special management over  social order. As in regions where the security problem is  serious, it is necessary to organize forces and to carry out  unified action with the main efforts concentrated on cracking  down on homicides, robberies, thefts, and organized crimes. In  addition, special attention should be paid to cracking down on  evil forces in cities and rural areas and to resolutely crack  down on fraudulent economic activities of a criminal nature.    Participants at the meeting pointed out the current need to  stress raising crime-investigation and crime-cracking levels; to  crack more criminal cases; to crack major cases; to strictly  enforce the law; to severely and quickly punish criminal  elements by fully employing existing legal weapons; to  resolutely rectify acts of imposing fines instead of meting out  prison terms, of bending the law for the benefit of relatives or  friends, and of downplaying the seriousness of cases.    Participants at the meeting were also of the view that since  this year will witness the introduction of the most reform  measures over the past decade, there will be some issues that  will impact social stability. Properly handling various matters  arising out of the contradictions among the people is a major  and pressing theme for public security organs under the new  situation to correctly handle the problems of contradictions  among the people. It is necessary for public security organs to  do a good job of explaining state policy among the people in  active coordination with relevant departments, help timely solve  problems brought out by the masses that should and can be  solved, and help them reduce contradictions. At the same time it  is necessary to resolutely crack down on hostile elements bent  on beating, smashing, and robbing, as well as those instigating  contradictions among the people.    Tian Qiyu said it is necessary to get actively involved in  comprehensive management of social order; to enhance various  preventive measures; to strengthen building of public security  stations, in particular those in rural areas; to establish  healthy grassroots organizations involved in protecting social  order and to make sure that these organizations fulfill their  role of protecting social order. Tian Qiyu called for an active  studying and exploration of methods to control transient  population. He proposed reorganizing, consolidating, and  strengthening crime-prevention and social order management teams  and to bring into play their important roles of maintaining  social order. It is necessary to vigorously launch the "small  security zone" activities, to do a good job in assisting and  educating persons who have been released from prison after  serving their terms and persons who have been released from  reform-through-labor institutions; and to actively explore new  ways to enhance security in enterprises under the new situation.  More and effective efforts should be made in the work of  eliminating evil phenomena in society.    Tian Qiyu stressed the need to further carry out the  anticorruption struggle. He said that at present, particular  attention should be paid to enhancing education among all the  public security cadres and personnel on the purpose of the  anticorruption struggle, on moral standards, on the mass line,  on enhancing the mass concept, on firmly establishing the idea  of doing all for the people and of relying on the people while  forging closer ties between the police and the people. Finally,  he called for continuing on-the-job training activities in a  down-to-earth manner and for striving to raise the professional  and law enforcement levels of the broad mass of public security  cadres and personnel.</p>

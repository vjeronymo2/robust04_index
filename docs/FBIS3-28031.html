			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 2 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam  puppet clique is reportedly spreading a false rumor through  subsidized papers of South Korea that Russia is going to pay off  the "loans" in such a manner as supplying military technology to  South Korea.    The falsity of this is well proved, first of all, by the  refutation of Russia.    A radio of Russia January 29 said military materials "are  being distorted continuously" in South Korea. "There is no  contract on paying off the loans with something like military  technology," it quoted the Russian Foreign Ministry as saying.    This notwithstanding, the puppets are now spreading lies,  fully indicating what despicable political swindlers and  offscourings without elementary human morality they are.  Falsity, fabrication and deception are intrinsic habits of the  Kim Yong-sam traitorous group wearing the "civilian" veil. It  is really foolish to forge "relations" and have dealings with  such persons, expecting something from them.    Their false propaganda is aimed at inveigling Russia into  the  frantic anti-DPRK campaign it launched in league with outside  forces under the pretext of the non-existent "nuclear problem"  of the DPRK. This is not only a political mockery of Russia but  an intolerable, undisguised challenge to the DPRK.    The Russian radio said "it seems that somebody wants to  inveigle Russia into the complicated situation of the Korean  peninsula." This is out of due concern. If Russia was embroiled  into the situation of the Korean peninsula which has been  brought to the brink of war by the reckless moves of the U.S.  imperialists and their lackeys, the situation would be rendered  all the more complicated.    Anybody must not do something obstructive to a fundamental  solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and its  peace and peaceful reunification, but do something benefitial to  them.    The South Korean puppet clique is obviously scheming to  label  Russia as a war conspirator by inveigling it into the dangerous  developments which may lead to a new war on the Korean peninsula.    It must give up reckless moves of war and confrontation  aimed  at slaying the fellow countrymen in the North with the backing  of outside forces, and promptly stop fooling and doing harm to  others.</p>

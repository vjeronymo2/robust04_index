			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: US software purchase for Micro Focus Micro Focus Group, the Berkshire-based computing services company which has seen its share price slide sharply over the past year, is to pay up to Dollars 13.5m (Pounds 8.9m) to acquire Burl Software Laboratories, a North Carolina software house. The deal calls for the exchange of between 400,000 and 800,000 of Micro Focus ADRs and possibly some cash. It will be treated as a pooling of interests under US accounting rules. Micro Focus, a developer of software for personal computers which makes large scale software easier to write, has seen the value of its shares fall from Pounds 30 to less than Pounds 10 on fears that growth was slowing. Excellent first quarter results partly reversed the trend. Yesterday the shares stood at Pounds 10.78p. Burl, established two years ago, now has 12 employees and negligible assets and profits. It makes a software tool for the analysis of existing systems written in Cobol.</p>

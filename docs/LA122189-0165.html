			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RELIGIOUS LEADERS URGE COUNCIL TO OK ETHICS  PLAN  </P> <P> A coalition of religious leaders, concerned that a proposed city government  ethics package may be gutted, called Wednesday on the Los Angeles City Council  to accept the plan in its entirety and vowed to present it to voters if the  council fails to heed their advice.  </P> <P> The 15 religious leaders were introduced at a news conference by Mayor Tom  Bradley, who said they had requested a forum to make their appeal. Bradley,  whose acceptance of payments from two financial institutions in exchange for  serving as an adviser or director helped spawn the proposals, then left without  accepting questions.  </P> <P> The ethics package, if approved, not only would outlaw the financial  transactions that drew Bradley into controversy, but would also prevent the  earning of outside income, all gifts and honorariums, and would order the  public financing of city political campaigns. An ethics commission would  monitor the behavior of city officials.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 5 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Minister of  Agriculture Liu Jiang said here today that China's rural economy  last year was better than expected.    Speaking at a national conference on rural work, the  minister  said that China produced more grain, meat, milk, eggs and  aquatic products last year than in the previous year, but less  cotton and sugar.    Liu said China achieved a bumper grain harvest last year,  with the total grain output exceeding 450 million tons.    He said the total output of meat, milk, eggs and aquatic  products increased by 5.5 percent, 6.4 percent, seven percent  and 10 percent, respectively, over the previous year.    The total output and profits made by China's rural  enterprises, which accounted for about one-third of the gross  national product (GNP), both grew by at least 40 percent, said  the minister.    The average per capita net income of China's farmers totaled  880 yuan (about 151 U.S. dollars), representing a real increase  of two percent over the previous year after inflation.    He attributed the progress to the policies and measures made  by the central government to boost agricultural production and  rural economy, and favorable weather for crops.    "Problems hindering the development of agricultural  production still exist," said the minister.    He said some problems are outstanding, such as persistent  low  profits for farming, particularly for grain and cotton  production.    He stressed that increases in farmers' income remain slow,  adding that these increases are falling behind the growth rates  for agricultural production and rural firms.    "a contrast between farmers' income and urban residents'  income, which rose by 10 percent, is striking," said the  official.    In addition, the country's agricultural technology extension  network and research should be improved, said the minister,  adding "the means of the central government's macro-control over  agriculture is not adequate, and the foundation of agriculture  remains weak."    He explained that the investment in agriculture is  inadequate  and a great area of cultivated land was used for industrial  development and other purposes.    Talking about the growing pressure from surplus rural  laborers, the minister said the surplus labor forces numbered  about 100 million in 1993, an unemployed force which is growing  at an annual rate of 13 million.    Liu said the vast number of surplus laborers hinders the  increase in farmers' income, postpones the process of  agricultural modernization, and also causes some social problems.</p>

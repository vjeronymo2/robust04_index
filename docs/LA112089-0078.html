			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEKOOSA TO WEIGH NEW $3.8-BILLION GEORGIA-PACIFIC BID;  </P> <P> TAKEOVERS: THE PAPER PRODUCTS FIRM EARLIER REJECTED A $58-PER-SHARE OFFER. NOW  IT WILL DISCUSS A SWEETENED DEAL.  </P> <P> Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. has agreed to hold a special meeting of its  directors to discuss Sunday's offer by Georgia-Pacific Corp. to increase its  unwanted bid to buy the paper company.  </P> <P> Georgia-Pacific raised its cash offer for Great Northern's outstanding shares  from $58 a share, or a total of about $3.1 billion, to $63, or a total of $3.8  billion. Great Northern has consistently rejected the takeover attempt.  </P> <P> The new bid was contained in a letter from Georgia-Pacific Chairman T. Marshall  Hahn Jr. that was delivered Sunday to Great Northern Chairman William R.  Laidig. The offer represents a 63% premium above Great Northern's share price  prior to Georgia-Pacific's original buyout offer of Oct. 31, Georgia-Pacific  said.  </P> <P> Great Northern shares closed Friday at $61, down 12.5 cents in consolidated New  York Stock Exchange trading.  </P> <P> Great Northern, a paper products company based in Norwalk, Conn., had said the  original offer was too low, possibly illegal and could create a disastrous debt  load on the combined company.  </P> <P> Hahn also demanded a special meeting of Great Northern shareholders and urged  Laidig to meet with him personally to discuss the proposal.  </P> <P> "We are prepared to consider an additional increase in price if you come to the  negotiating table early and demonstrate to our satisfaction that greater value  exists," he wrote in the letter, which was disclosed by Georgia-Pacific.  </P> <P> Great Northern officials issued a statement later Sunday saying they would hold  a special meeting of the company's directors Tuesday to "consider and review  the terms of the revised Georgia-Pacific offer."  </P> <P> Georgia-Pacific spokeswoman Gail Smith, reading from a statement, said the  giant, Atlanta-based forest products company was "pleased that they're acting  so expeditiously. We are hopeful they will exercise their fiduciary  responsibility and respond positively to our very attractive offer."  </P> <P> Also Sunday, Georgia-Pacific extended the Nov. 29 expiration deadline for its  offer to midnight Dec. 4.  </P> <P> Hahn said in his letter that Great Northern's contention that the takeover  would subject the company to excessive debt was groundless. He said the $3.8  billion in incremental debt required to finance the offer could be handled by  the combined company without a restructuring or loss of jobs.  </P> <P> "In fact, the combined company will be stronger and better able to meet the  challenges of our industry, provide jobs and compete in the global marketplace  than our two companies continuing on a stand-alone basis," he wrote.  </P> <P> Georgia-Pacific had revenue of $9.5 billion last year from sales of paper,  other forest products and building materials. Great Northern, with 1988 sales  of $3.6 billion, makes paper, cardboard and envelopes.  </P></p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Johnson Matthey edges up 3% JOHNSON MATTHEY, the precious metals group, lifted pre-tax profits for the half-year to end-September by 3 per cent from Pounds 32.2m to Pounds 33.2m and is showing confidence about the second half by raising its interim dividend from 3p to 3.2p a share. 'We have shown we can generate profits growth even in these difficult times and I am sure this growth will be even sharper when the world's major economies finally emerge from recession,' said Mr David Davies, chairman. But he said there was no sign yet of the world-wide recession coming to an end. JM's share price, which was up by 9p on Wednesday, rose another 4p to 468p after the news yesterday. The group also reported: An extension to its exclusive marketing contract with Rustenburg of South Africa, the world's biggest platinum producer, taking a relationship that started in the 1920s well into the next century. The completed sale of its 50 per cent stake in the Tanaka Matthey former joint venture in Japan. This raised about Pounds 20m and produced a pre-tax profit of roughly Pounds 4.5m. The proceeds will help finance a new Dollars 60m (Pounds 39m) car catalyst technical centre in Japan with Japanese management. It had won a four-year contract to supply Honda in North America with an annual 1m car anti-pollution catalysts. Mr Richard Wakeling, chief executive, said this contract was won because JM had advanced technology to offer and would double to 18 per cent the company's share of supply of catalysts to Japanese car makers. JM would add a new production line to its catalyst plant in Philadelphia for the Honda business. Mr Wakeling said JM's Pounds 80m, three-year rationalisation programme was almost at an end and there would be no more charges in this respect. Cost savings were running at Pounds 18m a year and in six to nine months would be an annual Pounds 22m to Pounds 23m. JM will continue to spend heavily on research and development - about Pounds 20m has been allocated this year. It will concentrate mainly on the autocatalyst, electronics materials and biomedical businesses. Mr Davies said the highlight of the first half was the excellent performance of the catalytic systems division, where operating profits rose to Pounds 12.9m (Pounds 10.6m). Turnover fell from Pounds 918.9m to Pounds 895.1m, but Mr Davies suggested net revenues were the true indicator of the level of business. These rose from Pounds 150.1m to Pounds 152.8m. Earnings per share rose to 12.1p (11.5p).</p>

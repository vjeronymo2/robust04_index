			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Gardening: The sure way to extended growth - Feed your plants regularly and they will last right through into the autumn NON-ENTHUSIASTS sometimes complain that gardens are two-month wonders which look fine in April when hundreds of narcissi have been tipped out into the grass, and even better late in June when the old roses are in full spate. Those same roses soon lose their leaves and look wretched. By autumn, gardeners already are talking of autumn colour; but it can be seen in woods and hedgerows without the need to worry over staking a young parrotia. Non-gardeners have to be unjust: otherwise, they might surrender to what they recognise. My aspirations are exactly contrary to theirs: I want to prolong and extend by extracting as many weeks as possible out of the year. Long seasons are a work of art, combined with cunning. This year, I am particularly conscious of an under-used weapon in our seasonal armoury: if you want to extend it, feed it. The wet autumn might have helped them, but artful feeders should still be enjoying sweet peas, swathes of flower on penstemons, a second flicker on phloxes, an afterglow on several delphiniums, and a willingness in anything half-hardy to flower flat out until the frost. If your season has tailed off, you gave up the battle too soon: you also need the gadget which I acquired, belatedly, at this July's Hampton Court show. Feeding is no longer a matter of lugging watering cans to and fro and trying to drench a border with the right dose. Nowadays, you can do it all by hose, as I have been far too slow to realise. Fertiliser firms sell a special spray attachment with a glass which can be filled with the right measure of their product. It locks on to the hose and can be pulled round the garden, fertilising while you spray water through its adjustable head. No longer do we need to wonder how many litres the old gallon can will hold, or how many grams and fluid ounces amount to an old British tablespoon. The hose head is filled with fertiliser to the level of the arrow marked on its side; it sticks on the hose, and the water flow will take up the fertiliser and add it to the evening watering. We all talk as if plants like to eat: in fact, they can only drink, absorbing their chemicals through moisture in or around the soil. Spray feeding is a drenching which is true to a plant's needs. All summer, I have found it a therapeutic business, walking round the garden with a spraying hose which is said to be doing good. Over-keen gardeners are prone to a natural mistake: impatience. Wanting quick returns, they increase the dose, step up the volume, and think they are forcing their plants to put on far more growth in a year. Their natural modern ally is the high-nitrogen fertiliser called Miracle Gro, the darling of front gardens. This modern Miracle certainly puts a bomb under anything with green growth but, in my view, it is an extra, not a staple. Heavily-miracled plants end up with more green growth than flowers, more greenfly, and less of a solid base with which to face the winter. They are over-forced. For the garden's enduring backbone, I continue to swear by Phostrogen. Little and often is the Phostrogen principle and, as a result, my Pounds 12 bucket of the stuff has lasted since mid-summer and prolonged almost anything it has touched. It remains excellent value. Phostrogen's makers now sell a hose-head fitting which is the ideal Christmas present for gardeners who have everything except a garden with as many late flowers as mine in mid-October. The simple head will lock on to any diameter of hose and, if you are quick to work out the open, close and fill positions on the grip above the glass, you will not end up with such a heavily-fertilised pair of gardening trousers as I contrived in the first two weeks of operation. I write about it now because I have seen the evidence. Earlier this summer, I picked on the advice of a leading female head gardener who advised that we should all feed our plants in urns and big pots very heavily in order to prolong them throughout the winter. Having obeyed her, I can confirm that she is right. After two months' regular Phostrogening, I still have huge sprays of flower all over the scented heliotropes, a steady glow on the dark blue salvias, and a continuing crop on the dark pelargoniums. When you begin to spray little and often, you will naturally start to wonder if it is really worthwhile. I am writing this article with the answer before my eyes. Plants which have been fed steadily are still flowering freely: those which were not fed have packed up. I am not so concerned with the doubting gardeners: I am more interested by doubting scientists. Some of them argue that spray feeding is ineffective because it aims at the plant's leaves. Some of the spray evaporates and much more of it misses the target. In absolute terms, they may be right, but much of what misses hits the earth and reaches the roots and, in the right conditions, it is not wasted. Those conditions are two: the earth itself must be damp so as to absorb the spray, and there should not be such a strong heat that the fertiliser disappears in a haze. The moral of the scientists' case is that we should spray in the evening when the sun is low and the ground already is damp, if necessary from an earlier watering. When philosophers were arguing that matter existed only in the mind, Dr Johnson simply kicked a stone and remarked that he 'refuted them thus.' I think the experts are wrong because they have not watched my fuchsias. Since early July, I have drenched them in Phostrogen and, since August, I have not drenched my trousers at the same time. They set two crops of buds and then, as standard bushes in pots, they have set and opened a third now. They love fertiliser and a damp atmosphere, especially over those leaves that greenflies otherwise adore. This autumn has provided the damp - but I have provided the fertiliser. My postscript to this season's flowering is that next year you, too, should equip yourself to fertilise while you water by hose. October, I promise you, will not look the same again.</p>

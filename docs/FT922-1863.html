			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / BR's annual losses set for sharp rise to Pounds 150m BRITISH RAIL will announce next month that its losses for the year to March have increased to Pounds 150m compared with Pounds 10.9m in the previous year. The latest losses, which are worse than expected, will make it much more difficult for the government to stimulate private sector interest in its plans for BR's denationalisation. Recession is largely to blame for the poor results. Revenues in all passenger sectors have fallen, partly because commuting has declined with the growth of unemployment and partly because fewer people are travelling for leisure or shopping. InterCity, which has been profitable for the last five years and is unsubsidised, is believed to have made an operating profit of barely Pounds 5m compared with Pounds 49.7m in the previous year. The two subsidised sectors - Network SouthEast, which lost Pounds 154.9m last year, and Regional Railways, which lost Pounds 503.4m - will report heavy increases in their losses, although these will be mostly offset by bigger government grants. The freight side has also performed badly. Although Trainload Freight, the bulk freight business, is expected to turn in a profit, losses at Railfreight Distribution are thought to have risen above 1990-91's Pounds 152.3m. Overall, operating losses after government subsidies are believed to have increased from the previous year's Pounds 26.4m to more than Pounds 100m. The bottom-line loss of Pounds 150m results from a heavy increase in the interest charge and a halving of the contribution from property profits. The figures have important consequences for the government's privatisation plans because they remind potential buyers of the acute vulnerability of the railways to swings in the economic cycle. The government plans legislation this autumn paving the way for passenger train operations to be franchised out to the private sector and for the freight operations to be sold outright. In the wake of the latest figures, however, the private sector could prove reluctant to take an interest in BR passenger service franchises unless profits are assured by generous subsidies - an arrangement the Treasury is unlikely to favour. The freight losses, meanwhile, make it highly improbable that an outright buyer will be found for Railfreight Distribution. It is more likely that the private sector will 'cherry pick' the few profitable freight services, leaving the remainder to close down.</p>

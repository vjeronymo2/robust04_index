			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Dai Songcheng: "Foreign Capital Paves </F> Way for Roadworks"]    [Text] China is attracting foreign investment and  co-operation in building four trunk loads linking the country's  east with the west and the north with the south.    The arteries will run from Tongjiang in Heilongjiang  Province  south to Sanya in Hainan; from Beijing south to Zhuhai in  Guangdong; from Lianyungang in Jiangsu west to Huoerguosi in the  Xinjiang Uygur autonomous Region; and from Shanghai west to  Ghengdu in Sichuan.    They are expected to be completed by the year 2000,  according  to Minister of Communications Huang Zhendong.    The roads, with a total length of 140,000 kilometres, will  go  through more than 20 provinces and autonomous regions and link  more than 100 major cities and important hubs.    Huang told the China Bidding Magazine that by the year 2000,  China's roads will stretch 1.2 million kilometres, of which  18,500 kilometers will be of high grade.    To speed up the construction of roads, which are still the  lifelines of the country's communications system, China is  poised to encourage more foreign investment and co-operation,  Huang said.    The minister said a big influx of overseas capital is  expected this year as investors from the United States, Canada  and Western Europe swarm in seeking business opportunities.    "China not only welcomes foreign investors to co-operate  with  Chinese partners to invest in, construct and operate the roads,  but also supports foreign involvement in the development of  communication infrastructure through the `Build, Operate and  Transfer' arrangement," Huang said.    "Build, Operate and Transfer" refers to a scheme in which  foreign businessmen invest in the construction of a project,  manage it for a fixed time, then hand over management and  ownership to Chinese hands.    Huang said foreign investment has helped China build 1,700  kilometres of roads, of which 370 kilometres are expressways or  high-grade roads.    From 1991 to 1996, another 1,600 kilometres of highways and  high-grade roads are expected to be completed with foreign  co-operation. During this period foreign investment will also  help build 3,000 kilometres of roads in rural areas and ordinary  roads, Huang said.    Meanwhile, 23 provinces, municipalities and autonomous  regions have used or will use loans from international financial  institutions and foreign governments to build 7,000 kilometres  of roads.    The total value of these loans amounts to about $1.7  billion.    In addition, Huang said that the construction of ports,  which  was opened to foreign investors before road work, has also  absorbed significant foreign investment.    To lure more overseas capital, he said, China now allows  foreign investors to co-operate with their Chinese partners in  building and operating public wharves, loading and unloading  cargo, and leasing docks.    They are also allowed to build wholly-invested special  channels and docks that are limited to the use of the owners.    Huang said that by the end of 1992, $1.66 billion in foreign  capital had been used in building 29 ports. Of the 29 projects,  nine have been completed.    Huang said that by 2000, China will have 1,100 berths of at  least medium size, of which 650 will be in deep water.</p>

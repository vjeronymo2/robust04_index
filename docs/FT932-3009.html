			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: David Lloyd Leisure beats forecasts DAVID LLOYD Leisure, the tennis court and health club group that floated earlier this year, exceeded its forecasts by returning interim profits ahead 84 per cent. Pre-tax profits jumped from Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 1.94m on sales up 33 per cent at Pounds 8.75m. The large increase resulted from the inclusion of five new tennis and fitness centres that were not on stream in the first half of last year. Mr David Lloyd, who launched the group after running similar centres in North America, said the group was ahead of schedule for the opening of its latest club in Glasgow. Profits from existing clubs grew by about 7 per cent, held back by less than usual growth in profits from bowling. Mr David Gray, finance director, said the main growth would continue to come from the introduction of new centres which brought with them an immediate increase in memberships. The group plans to introduce two new clubs a year. Earnings per share rose from 2.8p to 4.1p. As forecast there will be no interim dividend; first payment will be at the end of the first full year. Mr Lloyd said that profits were normally heavily skewed towards the second half of the year but, because of the introduction of the new centres, that would not be so marked this year. Nevertheless, the group was on target to hit the Pounds 5.5m pre-tax profit forecast made at the time of the flotation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jagodina, 9 Mar (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, the  president of the Assembly of the Srpska republic, said today  that by first offering a draft solution on the basis of the  Owen-Stoltenberg plan and then failing to meet its obligations  from the draft, the European Union had wasted its chances of  playing a more active role in the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis.    The Serbs were asked to agree on 33.3 percent of the  territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina for the Muslims; to allow  the replacement of the Canadian battalion in Srebrenica; to  withdraw heavy weapons from around Sarajevo; and to allow the  opening of Tuzla airport, while in return the EU would do its  utmost to ensure that the sanctions imposed on the Serb people  were lifted as a matter of urgency, Krajisnik told Jagodina  Radio today.    We have met all our commitments but the EU has done nothing  to lift the sanctions. The EU alone is to be blamed for losing  our trust and its reputation, and from now on any EU proposal  will be met with a large amount of reservation, Krajisnik said.    On the other hand, Washington's proposal for a federation  and  confederation of Muslims and Croats and speculations about the  Serbs joining the Muslim-Croat agreement indicate, to say the  least, an inability to view the situation on the ground  realistically, Krajisnik said, and went on to add:    It is only by pressure that a federation and confederation  of  Croats and Muslims can be set up; however, not even force can  secure Serb participation.    In view of the above I think that the most logical way  forward would be to sum up the negotiations so far, to decide if  the Owen-Stoltenberg plan is dead, and to convene a new  conference in which all three sides would take part and at which  fresh proposals for territorial divisions between the three  national communities would be submitted, Krajisnik said and went  on to stress:    It is only the issue of territories that can be discussed  realistically since we have already committed ourselves to a  union of three independent states in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  Krajisnik said in conclusion.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: TWA loses another top executive Trans World Airlines, the US airline struggling to regain financial strength after emerging from bankruptcy protection last November, yesterday announced that its vice-chairman had quit. Mr Robin Wilson, 57, is the second vice-chairman - and the fifth top executive - to leave TWA this year. An earlier one, Mr Glenn Zander, resigned in January, shortly after TWA had announced that speculation about his departure was unfounded. TWA has also lost a chairman, Mr William Howard, who lasted only a few months before stepping aside; a senior vice-president for marketing, Mr Robert Cozzi; and a chief financial officer, Mr Richard Shuyler, who quit unexpectedly last month to join a small cargo airline without waiting for a replacement to be named. TWA last night said it had appointed Mr Mark Coleman, vice-president and general manager of Avis Wizcom International, as its new senior vice-president for marketing. Mr Jeffrey Erickson, who joined TWA as president and chief operating officer in April, said: 'We're pleased that the TWA team is coming together, and we're getting the people we need to build TWA's future.' Last week Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, downgraded its rating on TWA's debt to triple-C, and revised its rating outlook from developing to negative. It cited weaker-than-expected revenue generation and the prospect of a risk to liquidity this winter.</p>

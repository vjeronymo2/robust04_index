			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Hanging On to the End in Hong Kong"] </F>   [Text] Britain and China yesterday came to the end of the  line three years before Hong Kong is handed back. Abandoning  all hope of an agreement with Beijing Chris Patten has invited  the Legislative Council (LegCo) to decide Hong Kong's own  political future. In publishing his second-stage bill today on  democratic reform, Mr Patten signals his reasonable conclusion  that negotiations with Beijing in the past year have achieved  very little and that the timetable for the 1995 elections can no  longer be delayed.    His action will be viewed by the Chinese government as a  hostile act which finally demolishes the spirit of Anglo-Chinese  cooperation in which the 1984 Joint Declaration was agreed. The  hope must be that Beijing will show restraint and take a cool  look at what has emerged by 1997, not before. But imperial  pride has been wounded and China may well be tempted -- in the  familiar phrase -- not to "stand idly by."    There is a sense in which the Chinese government can fairly  say that it has been misled by Britain over a number of years.  The British white paper claims that democracy was not  introduced earlier to Hong Kong because "the community had other  priorities." Certainly the Beijing massacre stimulated a much  more passionate pro-democracy demand. But the Hong Kong  government had already shrugged off mounting local pressure from  1984 onwards for electoral reform, leaving too much to be done  too late and too provocatively. Even after Tiananmen Square, Sir  Percy Cradock's secret mission to Beijing on behalf of Mrs  Thatcher encouraged China to believe that further political  change would continue to be based upon clear "understandings."  Chris Patten then shattered the familiar rules of the game like  a typhoon from nowhere.    He was certainly right to do so. A large section of Hong  Kong opinion would have been demoralised if a new governor had  continued to defer to Beijing. Today Hong Kong opinion remains  remarkably solid: the decision to go ahead arouses more relief  -- that the uncertainty is over -- than alarm at what China may  do. But beyond the principle, Mr Patten's tactical judgment on  how to deal with Beijing has not always been so sound.  Diplomats may say too little: politicians tend to the opposite.  Voicing opinions about the future of the Chinese Communist  Party is not the most tactful activity for the last governor of  Hong Kong.    The LegCo now has the task of debating Mr Patten's original  1992 proposals. It may end up by incorporating some of the  concessions offered by Britain to China in last year's long  negotiations. Perhaps there is a feeling in some diplomatic  quarters that this might be a better idea. But those  concessions only made sense as long as China agreed to a  "through train" formula which would guarantee that the  legislators chosen in 1995 could "ride through." Beijing  objected to this more than anything. A watered down package  will please no one. Hong Kong has already endured a rough ride  with impressive calm: it should hang on now to the end.</p>

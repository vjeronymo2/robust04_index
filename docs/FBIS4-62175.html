			<p>BFN     [Text] The Council of Europe "played up" to the  representatives of the Baltic states, first of all to Estonia,  when it linked Russia's membership in it to the withdrawal of  Russian troops from the Baltic countries, a senior member of the  Russian Foreign Ministry told Interfax.    According to him, the Council of Europe "is not quite  impartial" in its attitude to the presence of Russian troops in  the Baltic countries.    In comments on the statement by Belgium's Foreign Minister,  Willy Klaas, to the effect that the presence of foreign troops  in sovereign states against their will violates the basic  principles of the Council of Europe, the diplomat said: "We have  repeatedly explained to our partners in the Council of Europe  that this is a historic reality. Russia never deployed its  troops in the Baltic countries. Stalin and other Soviet rulers,  not the leaders of the Russian Federation, should be blamed for  it."    According to him, Russia "displayed good will", when it  placed the former Soviet troops deployed in the Baltic republics  under its own jurisdiction in February of 1992, and began to  withdraw them gradually. "It would have been interesting to  watch the Baltic states' reaction, if we had not done so (as a  matter of fact, we did not have to do it). They would have  obtained on their soil armed men for whom no one is  responsible," the diplomat said.    "We shall remove our troops from Estonia in the near future,  agreement or no agreement. As regards Latvia, this problems has  been almost resolved. Even if Russia's membership in the  Council of Europe is delayed for a couple of months, it will not  be too momentous for us, since the issue of time is not of  fundamental importance," he stressed.    At the same time, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman  Mikhail Demurin said in Moscow today that the leadership of the  Council of Europe had spoken in favor of the rapid acceptance of  Russia.    He said that Russia could become a full member in the first  half of 1995.</p>

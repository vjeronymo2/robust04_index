			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABC PUTS THE LID ON JACKIE MASON AND 'CHICKEN SOUP';  </P> <P> TELEVISION: DESPITE ITS ENVIABLE TIME SLOT FOLLOWING HIGHLY RATED "ROSEANNE,"  THE CONTROVERSIAL SITCOM LOST A THIRD OF ITS LEAD-IN AUDIENCE AND TOOK A  DRUBBING FROM CRITICS.  </P> <P> You're a programming executive at ABC and you're wondering what to do with your  new show, "Chicken Soup." Let's see. It's the highest-rated new show of the  season, ranking consistently in the top 15 each week.  </P> <P> You decide to cancel it.  </P> <P> That's exactly what ABC did Tuesday, pulling the plug on the high-rated Jackie  Mason-Lynn Redgrave sitcom about a romance between an Irish-Catholic woman and  a Jewish man.  </P> <P> But the cancellation was not as far-fetched as it might seem on the surface  and, in fact, came as no surprise to the show's producers or TV industry  observers. The ratings were misleading; the show was a flop.  </P> <P> With the most enviable time slot in television behind the top-rated "Roseanne"  on Tuesday night, the audience drop-off for "Chicken Soup" was unacceptable to  ABC executives. Every week, millions of "Roseanne" viewers would change the  channel as "Chicken Soup" came on. Last week, "Chicken Soup" lost one-third of  Roseanne's audience -- more than 7.2 million households.  </P> <P> Had the series been a critical success, the network might have kept it on the  schedule, perhaps moving it to another time period, industry executives said.  But the show had taken a drubbing from the critics and had been criticized by  Jewish organizations as supporting unfair stereotypes. In addition, Mason was  criticized for racial remarks he made while campaigning for New York mayoral  aspirant Rudolph Giuliani.  </P> <P> Replacing "Chicken Soup" at 9:30 p.m. on Tuesdays, beginning Nov. 21, will be  "Coach," a second-year sitcom starring Craig T. Nelson as a college football  coach.  </P> <P> ABC Entertainment President Robert Iger praised the show and it makers in a  statement released Tuesday. But he added, "We feel obliged competitively to  maximize the strength of our programming in that time period, since Tuesday  night is our key night. Clearly we're disappointed that 'Chicken Soup' did not  fulfill that objective."  </P> <P> The network's executives were under strict orders not to discuss the  cancellation Tuesday. But they had maintained since the show's debut Sept. 12  that they were waiting to see if it would catch on.  </P> <P> "Chicken Soup's" odd status of getting axed despite solid ratings -- it ranks  13th among the 92 prime-time series that have aired on the four networks this  season -- was not unprecedented. In fact, it followed the strikingly similar  circumstances of "Bridget Loves Bernie," a 1972-73 sitcom about the romance  between a Catholic woman and a Jewish man. Although that program ranked fifth  for the year, attracting 39% of the audience, CBS canceled it, saying that it  was losing too many viewers from "All in the Family," which preceded it and  which was drawing 53% of the audience.  </P> <P> ABC informed "Chicken Soup" executive producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner of  the cancellation at a meeting Monday. They, in turn, notified the cast and  crew.  </P></p>

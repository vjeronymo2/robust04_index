			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / International Company News: Increase at UBS brings bigger dividend Union Bank of Switzerland, Europe's most highly-valued bank, has posted a heavy 68.9 per cent rise in 1993 consolidated net income, to SFr2.27bn (Dollars 1.6bn). It attributes the surge to booming securities markets and a big inflow of investment funds. The directors are proposing a 10.3 per cent rise in dividends, plus the right to buy one new bearer or registered share at par for every 100 held. Mr Robert Studer, chief executive, said he did not expect this year's profit before bad debt provisions and taxes to equal the SFr5.27bn made in 1993. However, net income could be higher, if provision requirements declined, as expected, from the extraordinarily high levels of the past three years. UBS bearer shares fell SFr38 to SFr1,413 in Zurich following the results, which were at the low end of market expectations. However, the group was still valued at SFr37bn, well above the SFr32.3bn of Deutsche Bank, the former European leader by market capitalisation. Income trends seen at the interim stage continued, with trading in securities and currencies showing by far the greatest growth, 73.5 per cent, to SFr2.9bn. Income from services gained 27.8 per cent to SFr4.04bn. Among the services, income from investment counselling and asset management was up 30 per cent to SFr3.2bn. Net interest income was up only 6.2 per cent to SFr3.6bn. Customer loans grew only 4.3 per cent, as more turned to the capital markets for their needs. Operating expenses jumped 19.1 per cent, to SFr5.7bn, mainly because of performance-related pay and early retirement schemes. Provisions for bad loans advanced 22 per cent, to SFr2.2bn, mainly due to the recession in Switzerland. Total assets at the end of 1993 stood at SFr311.3bn, up a brisk 16.7 per cent. This was attributed to a 118 per cent jump in the securities trading portfolio, to SFr50bn. Capital and reserves totalled SFr21.7bn. After dividend payments, the BIS capital ratio will be 10.2 per cent. Return on equity was 11.5 per cent, above the group's mid-1990s target of 10 per cent.</p>

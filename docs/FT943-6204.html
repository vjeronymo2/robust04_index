			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Rover leads rise in car output with 20% surge Rover, the leading UK carmaker, increased vehicle production 20.8 per cent year-on-year in the first six months of 1994, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders says. Overall UK car output rose 1.2 per cent in the first half to 751,717 from 742,969 in the same period a year ago, but the society forecasts that growth in production will accelerate during the second half of the year. Higher output by Rover, a subsidiary of BMW of Germany, together with the build-up of production by Toyota and Honda at their UK assembly plants, helped to offset declines at Ford, Vauxhall and Peugeot and a sharp fall in production at Nissan. The rise in Rover car and commercial vehicle output - to 251,947 from 208,521 a year ago - has been helped most importantly by the introduction of its Rover 600 executive car range, launched in spring last year, as well as by rising sales of the Land Rover Discovery. The company has announced it is investing Pounds 68m to expand Discovery production by 20 per cent to 1,500 a week during the autumn. Production at Nissan's Pounds 900m Sunderland plant fell by a third during the first half of the year to 93,000 from 141,000 in the same period a year ago. The company was forced to halve production for nearly four months until early March with the elimination of its second shift in order to cut stocks and to bring output into line with sharply lower demand in continental Europe. Production at Toyota's Pounds 700m assembly plant at Burnaston, near Derby, which began at the end of 1992, was almost tripled in the first half this year to 43,000 from 15,000 a year ago. The plant, which will have an eventual capacity of at least 200,000 cars a year, is expected to produce more than 90,000 cars in 1994. Production of commercial vehicles began to recover from recession during the first six months, albeit from a very low level. Output in the first six months, at 116,692, was 10.2 per cent higher than a year ago. Commercial vehicle output has been in a state of almost continuous decline since 1969 when it peaked at 466,000. Production fell 22.2 per cent last year to 193,414, the lowest since 1948.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- BIG INCREASES FOR HONDA AND TOYOTA  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Vehicle production               1994          1993           1994/93 in the UK                      Jan-June      Jan-June         % Change  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- CARS Total                           751,717       742,969           +1.2 Rover (BMW)                     239,352       199,914          +19.7  -   cars***                    206,912       176,626          +17.1  - Land Rover                    32,440        23,288          +39.3 Ford group                      164,564       177,995           -7.5  -   Ford                       150,576       163,628           -8.0  -   Jaguar                      13,946        14,331           -2.7  -   Aston Martin                    42            36          +16.7 General Motors group            149,756       153,345           -2.3  -   Vauxhall                   127,525       132,492           -3.7  -   IBC Vehicles (GM/Isuzu)**   22,231        20,853           +6.6 Nissan                           93,194       140,713          -33.8 Toyota                           43,120        15,300         +181.8 Peugeot                          38,965        40,355           -3.4 Honda                            19,780        13,014          +52.0 Rolls-Royce (Vickers)               712           559          +27.4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- COMMERCIAL VEHICLES Total                           116,692       105,853          +10.2 Ford                             77,761        72,249           +7.6 Rover (BMW)                      12,595         9,207          +36.8  -   car-derived vans             1,620           967          +67.5  -   Land Rover                  10,975         8,240          +33.2 General Motors group              9,923        12,038          -17.6  -   Vauxhall                     7,124         6,915           +3.0  -   IBC Vehicles (GM/Isuzu)*     2,799         5,123          -45.4 LDV                               5,860         4,664          +25.6 Leyland Trucks                    3,869         2,351          +64.6 Iveco (Fiat)                      3,387         2,740          +23.6  -   Iveco-Ford                   2,857         2,363          +20.9  -   Seddon Atkinson                530           377          +40.6 ERF                               1,399         1,112          +25.8 Dennis (Trinity Holdings)           790           635          +24.4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Medium vans sold in Europe variously under Vauxhall, Isuzu, GME and Bedford names. **Opel/Vauxhall Frontera. ***Includes Honda Concerto.

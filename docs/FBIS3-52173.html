			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yehuda Tzur] </F>   [Text] An unsigned underground leaflet addressed to  regular and reserve IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers,  calling for action against what it terms "the takeover of the  IDF, which works in the service of the left wing, by the left  wing," has been recently published by extreme right-wing  circles. Thousands of copies have been distributed to soldiers  by a body calling itself The Popular Committee -- the IDF  [Hava'ada Ha'amamit -- Tzahal]. The leaflet says: "We, a group  of reserve officers and soldiers, have decided to organize  against this trend. We appeal to anyone who is ready to take  action and to anyone who has information about such phenomena,  asking him to contact The Popular Committee -- the IDF, which is  a body affiliated with recently established action committees  that monitor the political exploitation of state organizations  and state budgets. We need every piece of information and are  willing to help soldiers who want to fight against the  phenomenon."    The soldiers are requested to send their information to  Jerusalem post office boxes whose numbers are listed in the  leaflet. According to the leaflet, the IDF is ceasing to be a  popular army and becoming an army in the service of the left  wing. The leaflet notes that the troops orders drafted by the  chief education officer and disseminated in every army sector  infuriated the right wing. Furthermore, reserves troops  beginning a tour of duty receive instructions in which settlers  are presented in one category with terrorist organizations, it  says.    It goes on to say that IDF generals and other senior  officers, who oppose the peace process, are not allowed to voice  their views, while dovish senior officers are constantly  permitted to do the same. The latter include Major General 'Uzi  Dayan, Brigadier General Yomtov Sami', Brig. Gen. Doron Almog,  Southern Command Commander Matan Vilna'i, "and the worst was  when that general who holds plainly left-wing views, Major  General Shahaq, the deputy chief of staff, went to Oslo to make  gestures and concessions to terrorists."    The leaflet adds that "it is no wonder that in such an  atmosphere, the introduction of a Torah scroll into a place as  sacred to Judaism as Joseph's Tomb in Nabulus is seen as  provocation by the leftist-Arab government, and that IDF  soldiers are ordered to bar the celebrations in the midst of  Hanukkah. It is no wonder that in such an atmosphere, IDF  troops are summoned to block the way to Joseph's Tomb although  it involves a desecration of the Sabbath."    The leaflet further says that while the IDF was reluctant to  appoint Dani Nave as its spokesman, it did appoint Avi Bnayahu,  "who works for the left-wing 'AL HAMISHMAR newspaper, promoting  him to colonel. The IDF Radio is a left-wing bastion and a  training ground for future left-wing reporters, and [IDF Radio  director] Moshe Shlonsky, who was brought in from that left-wing  television, is running the place as if it was a private Peace  Now estate, and an announcer who said on air that Rabbi Levinger  is the murderer from Hebron has kept his job, receiving a mere  reprimand."    MAPAM [United Workers Party] Chairman Hanan Erez has warned  against the attempts by anonymous radical circles going under  the name of The Popular Committee -- the IDF, to exploit the  army, undermining its standing and the public confidence in it  and its senior commander through their efforts to sabotage the  peace process.    Hanan Erez called on Ori Or, chairman of the Knesset Foreign  Affairs and Defense Committee, to take immediate action against  the dangerous phenomenon.</p>

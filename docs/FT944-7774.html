			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Strong demand for TeleWest places Pounds 1.8bn value on group Shares in the flotation of TeleWest Communications were six times subscribed and have been priced at 182p, valuing the UK cable television company at Pounds 1.8bn. During preliminary trading in London and New York yesterday, ahead of the issue of shares, there was strong institutional interest and deals were done at a modest premium with the price going up to 195p at one point before easing. Mr Alan Michels, TeleWest chief executive, said he was pleased at the price and 'real pleased that demand was equal between the UK and the States'. TeleWest, a 50-50 joint venture between TCI of Denver, the largest US cable operator, and US West, the regional telephone company, will be the first UK cable company to join the London Stock Exchange. Dealing is expected to begin in London and the Nasdaq exchange in New York on November 30. The 182p pricing, or Dollars 28.50 per American Depositary Share, equals 10 ordinary shares. Of the Pounds 1.8bn valuation on TeleWest's equity, Pounds 1.5bn is ordinary share capital. The pathfinder prospectus suggested a price range of 165p and 190p with a total value for the company of between Pounds 1.61bn and Pounds 1.86bn. At the offer price the net proceeds are around Pounds 360m. Commenting on the response, Mr Michels said: 'The institutions now have a much better understanding of the cable commercial model. They know they are not going to get any income this year but I think we are building a very valuable business.' It is not clear what impact the TeleWest float will have on the much larger flotation of British Sky Broadcasting. The satellite venture, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a 17.5 per cent stake, has more subscribers than cable and a larger revenue stream but less scope for offering services other than entertainment. TeleWest has to spend a further Pounds 1bn to complete its UK networks and is unlikely to be profitable before 1998. The company owns and operates 16 cable franchises while affiliated companies own a further seven.</p>

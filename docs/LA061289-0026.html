			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACK-TO-BACK FIRES DAMAGE ANALYST'S PRIMAL INSTITUTE  </P> <P> The Primal Institute, the West Los Angeles headquarters of psychologist Arthur  Janov, who attracted national attention in the 1970s with his theory that  "primal screaming" can cure childhood neuroses, was ravaged Sunday by  back-to-back fires, one of which has been ruled arson.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Fire Department officials said the blazes, which caused an  estimated $475,000 in damage and injured a firefighter who was struck by a  broken hose, began in different parts of the building at 2215 S. Colby Ave.  They were unrelated, firefighters said.  </P> <P> "The other fire was out," said Battalion Chief Chuck Merriman, whose  firefighters fought the second blaze. "We don't leave them before they're out.  It's very suspicious."  </P> <P> Authorities said the first blaze, which broke out at about 12:30 a.m. and was  brought under control within half an hour, was deliberately set by an arsonist.  </P> <P> The second fire, reported at 6:55 a.m. and put out shortly before 8 a.m., has  been labeled "suspicious," and arson investigators said Sunday that they found  flammable liquids, indicating that fire may have also been deliberately set.  </P> <P> Officials said they know of no motive for the fires, and no one from the Primal  Institute would comment Sunday.  </P> <P> A woman who firefighters identified as Janov's wife declined to be interviewed.  </P> <P> Janov, himself, could not be reached. The psychologist developed primal therapy  in 1967 and his book, "The Primal Scream," gained acclaim four years later when  hundreds of people, including former Beatle John Lennon and actor James Earl  Jones, adopted his theories in an attempt to unearth their childhood neuroses  by venting their rage through screaming.  </P></p>

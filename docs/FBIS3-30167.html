On the occasion of this historical day, the national  agricultural conference will be magnificently opened in  Pyongyang, the revolutionary capital, amid the great interest of  all the people and agricultural workers. This conference will  be a rally of victors vigorously demonstrating the greatness and  invincible vitality of our party's program of socialist rural  construction, and a new milestone in developing our country's  socialist rural economy onto a higher stage.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song sent a historical  letter, "For the Ultimate Solution of the Rural Question Under  the Banner of the Socialist Rural Theses," to the national  agricultural conference. In the letter, the respected and  beloved leader proudly summed up the victorious achieved by our  party and people in the struggle to implement the rural theses,  and presented a militant task to bring about a new upsurge in  the rural construction.    This letter is a banner of struggle which makes it possible  to achieve a historical victory in ultimately solving the rural  question which is the most difficult problem in socialist  construction. On the day of the 30th anniversary of the  publication of the rural theses, we have once again received the  great classical work which brilliantly elucidates the future of  our socialist farms. This is a great happiness for our people  and agricultural workers.    Our people and agricultural workers are looking back with  pride at the historical course that achieved great victory and  change in the socialist rural construction under the leadership  of the party and the leader. The socialist rural theses  published 30 years ago, was a historical event greatly  significant for the revolutionary struggle of our people for the  victory of the chuche socialist cause.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il pointed out: The  "Theses on the Socialist Rural Question in Our Country,"  provided by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is our party's  program of the rural construction, and a magnificent blueprint  to ultimately solve the rural question.    Correctly solving the rural question is a fundamental  problem  related to the success or failure of the socialist cause. The  work to firmly consolidate politically, ideologically,  materially, and technically the socialist system and to achieve  complete victory in socialism are greatly dependent on how to  solve the rural question.    From the early days, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song  put  great emphasis on the question of farmers and agriculture and  put forth all his energy to solve it. He published the rural  theses at a historical period when it was imminently demanding  to elucidate the correct road in the socialist rural  construction. Thus, he gave a complete explanation in this  important question of the era.    The rural theses is a chuche-oriented rural construction  program which wholly elucidates all theoretical and practical  problems that arise in the socialist rural construction such as  the essential content of the socialist rural question, the  fundamental principle in solving it, and the basic task and  method to carry out the rural construction.    With the presentation of the rural theses, the road to  industrialize and modernize agriculture, revolutionize and  achieve working classification of the farmers, and to create  farms, which were dominated by century-old backwardness, into  abundant and civilized socialist farms, were clearly elucidated.  The publication of the theses was an event of the era which  provided a shortcut in constructing a classless society and a  completely successful socialist society which man had so  earnestly desired.    In the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's ideological and  theoretical achievements, he pioneered a new turning point in  the socialist construction theory because he put forth a  magnificent program in the socialist rural construction from the  early days, and embraced faith in socialism to the world's  revolutionary people. This cannot by any means be weighed at any  cost.    The 30 years from the time of the publication of the theses  up until the present were 30 years of victory and traits in  which the most brilliant examples were created in solving the  socialist rural question.    The circumstances of our socialist construction in the past  were not smooth at all. We accelerated socialist rural  construction under a difficult condition in which the nation was  divided and the imperialists' vicious aggressive maneuvers  prevailed. However, thanks to the great rural theses, our  people and agricultural workers could brilliantly resolve  difficult and gigantic tasks raised in socialist rural  construction.    The great vitality of the rural theses has been fully  demonstrated in the fact that our socialist rural economic  system has been firmly consolidated politically, ideologically,  materially and technologically.    As the result of brilliant implementation of the three lines  of the revolution--ideological, technological and cultural--put  forward by the rural theses, our peasants' political and  ideological outlook and our farms' material and technological  foundation have been changed beyond recognition.    Today our agricultural workers, assuming the chuche  idea--our  party's great revolutionary ideology--as their firm faith, have  been united with the party and the leader [suryong] more firmly  than ever, and are highly displaying the noble fine communist  customs.    Even amid antisocialist maneuvers unprecedentedly  intensified  by the imperialists and reactionaries in recent years, our  agricultural workers firmly defended the agricultural front by  absolutely trusting only the party and the leader without a  slightest degree of wavering. This clearly demonstrates their  noble spiritual and moral outlook.    The great changes effected in our peasants' ideological and  mental world and work-style are the most precious achievement  incomparable to several million tons of grains.    A great advance was registered in implementing the rural  technological revolution through the struggle to carry to  accomplishment the rural theses. The task of introducing water  utilization system and electrification was realized a long time  ago, and the task of mechanization and chemicalization was also  achieved. As the result, the historic task of rural  technological revolution set forth in the socialist rural theses  has been accomplished basically.    Last year, in the wake of the 30th anniversary of  publication  of the theses, we attained a unprecentedly good harvest by  overcoming serious phenomena of abnormal weather. This clearly  proves how mighty the material and technological foundation of  our farms is.    With brilliant achievement of tasks of rural cultural  revolution, the peasants' civilized life has been brought into  full bloom and our farms became more look like cities in the  cultural field.    The political, ideological, material and technological  foundation which our people provided amid the struggle to carry  to accomplishment the rural theses is very firm. Today socialism  takes deep root in our farms and became something indispensable  to the life of our agricultural workers.    The great vitality of the rural theses has been clearly  displayed in the fact that an epoch-making turn was effected in  our people's historic advance to achieve the complete victory of  socialism. Achievement of complete victory of socialism is a  strategic goal which we must attain without fail in socialist  and communist construction. The key to accomplishing this task  is to remove the class difference between the working class and  peasants by solving rural problems.    Industrialization and modernization of agriculture and  revolutionization and classization of peasants have been  vigorously pushed ahead under the banner of the theses. As the  result of this, the differences between cities and farms were  drastically reduced. In addition, the standard of management and  operation in cooperative farms came closer to the advanced  management standard of industry. Thus, material and  technological means in ownership by all of the people came to  have overwhelming weight in agricultural production.    All this illustrates that the condition is becoming mature  for gradually turning cooperative farms in our country into  farms owned by all of the people.    We have already solved basic problems in socialist rural  construction. We can proudly declare that we have now occupied a  lofty peak looking at final solution of agricultural problems.    The socialist rural theses also displayed great might in  fully demonstrating the superiority of socialism of our own  style by smashing the imperialists' antisocialist maneuvers.    The imperialists and reactionaries have historically  carried out vicious slanderous and smear campaigns against the  socialist rural economic system which was established by  reflecting the aspirations and desires of the popular masses.    Taking advantage of the collapse of the socialist system in  some countries, the imperialists carried out antisocialist  maneuvers more viciously. The great victory we attained in the  struggle to accomplish the rural theses in the past 30 years  proved that antisocialist sophism disseminated by the  imperialists is a total falsehood.    The socialist rural economic system in our country is a most  superior rural economic system of our-style which has embodied  the chuche idea and is a most solid and vigorous rural economic  system that is advancing along the road of socialism based on  collectivism.    With the brilliant embodiment of the rural theses,  agricultural production constantly developed and the peasants'  independent and creative life fully bloomed in all domains of  politics, economy, and culture in our country. Through the  reality of socialism, people came to believe firmly that only  socialism can achieve the peasants' long-cherished desire.    Indeed, the socialist rural theses put forward by the great  leader are an immortal militant banner which enabled us to  strengthen our-style socialism into an indomitable stronghold  and which provided us with a firm guarantee for the final  victory of socialism. The great victory and achievements we  attained in the struggle to carry to accomplishment the rural  theses in the past are a brilliant fruition of the wise  leadership of the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song.    Traces of the leadership of the great leader, who led the  rural economic work with tireless and sleepless energy, are  embroidered on the road of socialist economic construction in  our country.    By always putting forward the agricultural front as one of  the major offensive fronts in socialist construction, the  respected leader personally became the commander and brilliantly  resolved all problems--large or small--raised in rural economy  and agricultural production.    By constantly giving on-the-spot guidance to farms  throughout  the country, he created the chuche agricultural method--a most  scientific farming method suitable to practical situation in our  country--and led our agricultural workers to implement the  party's agricultural policy. The energetic guidance of the  respected leader was a source for us to effect an epoch-making  advance in agricultural production.    The guidance of the party and the leader over socialist  rural  construction has been consistent with firm principles. The  principle of giving priority to the ideological revolution,  which the great leader consistently maintained; the principle of  strengthening the guidance of peasants by the working class, the  support for agriculture by industry, and support for farms by  cities; and the principle of strengthening the party's guidance  on rural economy, worked as the banner consolidating our  socialist rural positions into indomitable strongholds.    Even in recent years when the imperialists' antisocialist  maneuvers were carried out more disguisedly, the party and the  leader led us so that we can highly demonstrate the superiority  of socialist collectivist economy by firmly maintaining the  principle of socialism in management and operation of rural  economy without a slight degree of wavering. This is a brilliant  achievement made by the party and the leader in rural  construction.    The entire course of socialist rural construction in our  country eloquently shows that only by the great party and the  great leader with uncommon wisdom, outstanding leadership and  firm principle, can the socialist rural problems be brilliantly  resolved without a slight deviation and vicissitudes.    Today we are faced with the honorable task to consolidate  and develop our country's socialist rural economic system and to  effect a new upsurge in farm production, based on the great  victory we achieved in the socialist rural construction.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught in his recent  letter: All functionaries of the agricultural sector and working  people should vigorously accelerate the socialist rural  construction with exalted faith, upholding the banner of the  socialist rural theses. We should, above all, deeply bear the  great pride in having the most correct program [kangnyong] for  the socialist rural construction and should stoutly carry out  the struggle to implement it.    The ideological and theoretical policy linked with the great  rural theses is our firm guideline for today and tomorrow. All  party members and working people should stoutly struggle, being  deeply aware of the fact that they can make a new upsurge in the  rural construction and farm production only when they advance  along the single road elucidated by the theses without  deviation. By doing so, they should endlessly glorify the  leadership achievements that the great leader have made without  sleep or rest for a long time in solving socialist rural  problems.    All party members and working people should learn in depth  the great leader's historical work, "For an Ultimate Solution to  Rural Problems Under the Banner of the Socialist Rural Theses,"  make it their bones and flesh, and stoutly carry out the  struggle to implement programmatic tasks presented in the work.    In order to implement the heavy task faced by the rural  economy today, it is important to intensify and develop the  three revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--in  accordance with the demand of the socialist rural construction  in a new stage.    We should intensify indoctrination of the agricultural  working people on principles of the chuche idea and should  effectively carry out ideological indoctrination, including  class and collectivism indoctrination, for them so that they can  arm themselves firmly with our party's revolutionary ideology  and the chuche idea and can firmly establish a revolutionary  view of leader.    By doing so, we should make all agricultural working people  become resolute fighters who devotedly struggle to protect and  defend the socialism of our own style under any situation, with  firm faith in the victory of the socialist cause.    We should consolidate the results achieved in irrigating,  using electronics, mechanization, and the application of science  in rural areas and fully demonstrate the might of the results as  well as thoroughly implement the chuche farming method, so that  we can further develop all domains of farm production, including  grain production.    All agricultural working people should achieve, without  fail,  the high goal of grain production presented by the party this  year, the first year of the adjusting period [wanchunggi], by  greatly displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and  fortitude, upholding the party's agriculture-first policy.    We should continue to concentrate great efforts in elevating  the agricultural working people's technological and cultural  levels and making our rural areas more civilized, in accordance  with the demand of the intellectualization of the entire society.    We should vigorously carry out the three revolutions in  rural  areas, strengthen our support for rural areas, and constantly  improve and intensify the guidance and management of rural  economy, so as to brilliantly implement the historical task of  turning the cooperative property into the all-people property  [hyoptongjok soyurul choninminjok soyuro nomginun yoksajok  kwaop] in the future.    It is important to enhance party organizations' militant  functions and role in order to constantly consolidate and  develop our socialist rural economic system and to vigorously  accelerate the agricultural production.    All rural party organizations should intensify ideological  indoctrination of a broad range of agricultural working people,  unite them more firmly around the party, and actively agitate  the masses to implement our party's agriculture-first policy and  the chuche farming method.    Party organizations should actively help and lead all  functionaries of the agricultural economic sector, so that they  can deeply bear their honorable duties and missions for the  party and the revolution, constantly revolutionize themselves,  and vigorously push ahead with the work of implementing the  rural theses at the front of the masses.    The socialist rural construction, which has entered a new  higher stage today, has the endlessly bright future. We will  brilliantly achieve the ultimate solution to socialist rural  problems in the near future, as long as the great leader Comrade  Kim Il-song, who is leading the chuche socialist cause along the  single road of victory, stands at the forefront, and as long as  the glorious Workers Party of Korea leads us.    Let us all stoutly struggle to achieve the ultimate solution  to socialist rural problems and to consummate the chuche  revolutionary cause, firmly united around the party Central  Committee headed by the respected and beloved Comrade Kim  Il-song.    Hurrah for the 30th anniversary of the publication of the  great socialist rural theses!</p>

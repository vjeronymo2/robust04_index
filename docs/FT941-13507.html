			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Beckman Instruments to cut jobs Beckman Instruments, the US maker of laboratory instruments, is to cut jobs by 800 worldwide, Reuter reports from Fullerton. The company warned that more jobs would be affected as the company consolidated facilities and functions. The company, which announced a reorganisation last October, recorded a net loss for 1993 of Dollars 37.6m, or Dollars 1.35 per share, compared with net income of Dollars 43.8m, or Dollars 1.53, in 1992. It said the reorganisation would be funded by a Dollars 135m before-tax restructuring charge to be taken over two years, including a Dollars 20m charge to be taken in 1994. The rest of the Dollars 135m restructuring charge was taken in 1993, and included Dollars 4m for non-cash items. Beckman said annual before-tax savings from the plan were expected to be about Dollars 25m in 1994, rising to about Dollars 45m in 1995.</p>

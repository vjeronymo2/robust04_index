			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Tory peer quits school tests council LORD Skidelsky, a Tory member of the assessment council which sets the national curriculum tests, yesterday resigned from the body, accusing the Department for Education of a 'bunker mentality'. His move attacks the review of the national curriculum by Sir Ron Dearing, which was announced last month by Mr John Patten, the education secretary. Two teaching unions have imposed boycotts on the tests, while a third, the National Union of Teachers, is expected to follow next week. Lord Skidelsky, an SDP life peer who last year took the Tory whip in the Lords, said: 'Over the last 12 months the efforts of myself and others to get the problems of an incoherent testing system decently discussed have been frustrated by the bunker mentality of the Department for Education. Now the unique chance opened up by the teachers' boycott for a coherent, independent review of the main issues is being thrown away.' Sir Ron, chairman of the Schools Examination and Assessment Council, last week announced a task force of six to assist him with the review. But Lord Skidelsky, a member of the council since last August, believes Mr Patten should have created a 'properly constituted review committee of high calibre, controlling its own procedures and report'. Instead, according to Lord Skidelsky, 'the main lines of inquiry have been decided by Sir Ron and a few colleagues without any prior consultation with his colleagues'. Mr Patten said he regretted Lord Skidelsky's decision, but added: 'He has very firmly held views on testing and I hope he will make them known to Sir Ron Dearing whose independent review has been so widely welcomed.' The department added that several members of Sir Ron's task force were 'not necessarily politically subservient to the department'. Mr John Major and Mr John Smith clashed over the tests for the second time in a week, with the prime minister again rejecting the Labour leader's demands that they should be withdrawn. Mr Smith asked why private schools were being exempted from the tests if they were so important. Mr Major said it was the public sector for which the government had direct responsibility. In the private sector results had been 'very good' and many schools had their own tests. He accused Mr Smith of being prepared to 'join forces with those who want industrial militancy to end the tests'.</p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. TO GIVE ADDICTS AIDS KITS OF CONDOMS, BLEACH  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved distribution of  bleach and condoms to fight the spread of AIDS among drug users.  </P> <P> The action was requested by Mayor Tom Bradley, who called it "a matter of human  decency."  </P> <P> The council set aside $25,000 to finance the bleach-and-condom program until  the fiscal year ends on June 30.  </P> <P> The money will pay for about 60,000 AIDS prevention kits, each containing a  bottle of bleach for sterilizing needles, one or more condoms and an  informational flyer about AIDS.  </P> <P> "By making bleach and condoms readily available to those most vulnerable, we  can help eradicate this scourge," Bradley said Tuesday in a letter to  Councilman Joel Wachs, who sponsored the measure.  </P> <P> The bleach-and-condom kits will be distributed by five drug-abuse agencies in  locations around the city, said Dave Johnson, the city's AIDS coordinator.  </P> <P> "This is a street outreach program," Johnson said. "People will be taking the  kits out to where the addicts are."  </P> <P> The proposal encountered virtually no opposition from council members, who  approved it without debate. However, they reopened the matter after an angry  outburst from people in the audience who demanded a chance to speak.  </P> <P> John Coulthard, a spokesman for an activist organization called The Facts, said  the program will encourage intravenous drug use. "This is not the type of  message the City Council should be sending," he said.  </P> <P> In February, New York City Mayor David Dinkins halted a program to distribute  clean needles to drug users after complaints that the program abetted drug use.  The Los Angeles program does not include distribution of needles.  </P> <P> "Where's the evidence that this project will even work?" said Brian Misuraca,  another member of the Sherman Oaks-based group.  </P> <P> The comments drew a sharp response from Councilman Robert Farrell, whose  district includes poor areas of South Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "These white boys aren't going to die," Farrell said of the program's critics.  "The facts show that white boys like that have sufficient money in their  pockets and they have sufficient education and whatever they've got going. . .  .  </P> <P> "If they are sick they will buy the medication, they will make the personal  choice because they know what to do. They have been blessed by being  middle-class persons."  </P> <P> Councilman Richard Alatorre called the protesters "somewhat narrow-minded" and  said AIDS is a "crisis of astronomical proportions" in poor areas.  </P> <P> Bradley, in his letter, had anticipated criticism and noted: "It is disturbing  to me to see the senseless opposition to this proposal that will help us save  lives."  </P> <P> Johnson, the AIDS coordinator, said the private, nonprofit agencies to be used  in the program already are running outreach efforts of their own for  intravenous drug users. He said some of the agencies have provided bleach and  condoms occasionally out of their own funds.  </P> <P> Another $50,000 has been requested for bleach and condoms in the 1990-91 fiscal  year, as well as $450,000 for other AIDS prevention and education programs,  Johnson said.  </P> <P> AIDS generally is spread by the sharing of needles by drug addicts and through  sexual contact. The informational pamphlets in the kits will have instructions  for sterilizing needles with bleach so that addicts don't transmit the virus to  each other. The condoms are intended to prevent the spread of the virus to  sexual partners.  </P> <P> Compared to other cities, Wachs said, Los Angeles has a substantially lower  rate of AIDS-infected drug addicts. Unless steps are taken now, "the spread is  going to be enormous," he said.  </P> <P> "We have a real smoking gun here," Wachs said. "We have a really explosive  situation of a potential increase in the community of drug users. People have  had their heads in the sand."  </P> <P> The agencies that will distribute the kits are El Centro Del Pueblo in the  Hollywood and Silverlake areas; El Centro Human Services in East Los Angeles;  El Proyecto Del Barrio in the San Fernando Valley; Women and AIDS Risk Network  in South-Central Los Angeles, and Los Angeles Centers for Alcohol and Drug  Abuse in the downtown and Skid Row areas.  </P> <P> The council also approved a $60,000 appropriation for other AIDS-fighting  measures, including a centralized information and referral service, an early  treatment and awareness program in racial and ethnic minority communities, and  a public awareness campaign in South-Central and East Los Angeles.  </P></p>

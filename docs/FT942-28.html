			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (4): Once bitten, twice shy - Japan earns high marks from OECD watchdog Japan's chemicals industry can take some - but not all - of the credit for the country's better than international average progress in curbing pollution. A recent study of Japanese environmental performance by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development praises the country for its 'remarkable' achievement in reducing air pollution, from industrial plants, cars and power stations. 'These successes have proved that environmental policies and economic development can be mutually supportive,' says the study, one of the first fruits of a 1991 OECD decision to run environmental checks on all its members. Far from damaging industrial competitiveness, rigorous curbs on air pollution have benefited car and pollution control equipment producers, says the report. Yet the study gives Japan below average marks for its performance on industrial waste, where the chemicals industry plays a larger part than most, and dependence on agricultural chemicals. Over the past 20 years, Japan has shown the highest average growth of any member of the group of seven rich industrialised nations, even counting the blow to its economic record inflicted by the recent recession. Yet it has also over this period more than halved sulphur dioxide emissions and nearly halved nitrous oxide pollution. That is the best performance of any member of the OECD, says the study. Industrial processes account for between 40 per cent and half of air pollution in Japan. The OECD attributes this impressive track record to Japan's tough regulations, such as those on car exhausts and factory chimneys, plus the high technological standards of the water and air cleansing equipment industries. This is the reward for the 3.4 per cent of total capital formation that Japanese industry invests in pollution control, described by the OECD as among the highest in the industrialised world. Private companies account for the lion's share of this spending. Within this, however, the chemicals industry spends far less than its foreign competitors. Japan's chemical companies invested four per cent of annual turnover on the environment in 1991, according to European chemicals industry figures, compared with 10 per cent by their US counterparts and 12 per cent by European chemical producers. Japanese companies also dump more industrial waste as a percentage of gross domestic product than the OECD average, a mark of its relatively lax industrial waste policy. It remains among the biggest users of agrochemicals in the OECD, a mark of the need to maximise yield from scarce farmland. That said, Japanese chemicals companies have made spectacular progress since the traumatic environmental disasters of the 1950s and 1960s, which still dog the industry's reputation. Cases such as the Minamata disaster, where mercury was pumped into the sea off southern Japan poisoning the people of a nearby fishing village, or the Yokkaichi air pollution scandal, in which residents of an industrial town in central Japan were made ill by air pollution from chemical plants, spurred industry and government into action faster and earlier than their western counterparts. Those disasters led to tough legal controls on water and air pollution and also taught industry that the costs of compensating victims far outweigh the cost of prevention. Chisso, the chemical company responsible for Minamata, could have avoided the mercury disaster, if it had spent Y100m annually on pollution control, estimates the government's environmental protection agency. Instead, Chisso is still faced with an annual compensation bill of Y11.9bn, 100 times the cost of prevention, it says. As a result of the post-Minamata lesson, chemical accidents or labour injuries in the Japanese chemicals companies are today low by international standards. The average number of lay-offs lasting more than a year, caused by injury, was 0.5 per 1m working hours in 1992, according to the Japan Chemical Industry Association. While the record has been good over the past 20 years, Japanese environmental policy has barely evolved since the post-Minamata period, argue critics such as Mr Ian Austin, the Tokyo-based director of Japan business development at Dames &amp; Moore, the US environmental consultancy. The outstanding example is the fate last November of the environmental protection bill, watered down in response to pressure from business lobbies, unwilling to take on extra costs at a time when the yen's strength is harming their competitiveness. The bill contained a general commitment to a health environment. But the government quietly shelved two controversial provisions, contained in early drafts and supported by the environment agency, for a tax on carbon dioxide emissions and obligatory environment reports on new industrial projects. The ministries of international trade and industry, transport, and construction ministries, successfully lobbied for the removal of those clauses on the grounds that they would hamper investment in new plant and further stimulate the already worrying shift of industrial production out of Japan to cheaper foreign locations. A Miti advisory panel warned that a carbon tax would provoke an 'international migration of industry'. Instead, the new law calls on 'businesses to assess the environmental impact of a project and take proper consideration to conserve the environment'. It also says that the government should 'make efforts to obtain the understanding and co-operation of the people' when it sees the need to introduce a carbon tax. Such a tax is certainly not on the agenda of the present government. This is not surprising, since Japan has yet to recover from the most severe recession in the period since the Minamata disaster produced its salutary awakening of environmental policy. It could be a sign of how environmental policies take second place to economic survival during tough times.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Izudin Durakovic report] </F>   [Text] In the Gracanica Operations Group zone, the chetniks  are not changing their tactics. They are still taking advantage  of the night to bring in new manpower reinforcements and to  [word indistinct] the arsenal of weapons in order to pound our  defense lines, as well as to [word indistinct] set off into new  infantry assaults that are successfully repelled by the heroes  of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Although they failed to cause the slightest disorder or  disorganization among our fighters, (?yesterday's) missiles,  which have not been used on this section of the battlefield  before, show that the chetniks are using their last trump cards  to [word indistinct] the security zone around Doboj.    During the night, in the zone covered by the 109th Doboj  Brigade and the 111th (?Gracanica) Brigade, apart from activity  with various weapons of diverse calibers, the chetniks brought  to the regions of (?Svjetlica), Radic, and [word indistinct]  dozens of trucks with new chetnik forces and equipment. This  certainly represents the latest replacement of forces that were  crushed by our fighters during the chetnik eight-day infantry  assaults on our defense lines.    In the shelling of civilian districts of Klokotica,  Brijecica, Lukavica, and Lukavica Rijeka, eight people were  seriously or lightly wounded yesterday, while the material  damage is huge.    As I report, the chetniks are intensively shelling our  defense lines, which is only a preparation for (?mindless) new  infantry assaults. The great fighters of the 109th Doboj  Brigade and the 111th Gracanica Brigade are firmly maintaining  our defense lines and are determined not to permit chetniks  [words indistinct].</p>

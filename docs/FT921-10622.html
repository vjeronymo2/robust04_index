			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Labour considers redefining PSBR THE Labour party is consid-ering redefining the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) to exclude funds raised for some types of investment in transport and housing. The party is also exploring ways of improving public bodies' access to private funding, including making it easier for local authorities to raise finance directly from the capital markets. The aim would be to allow an incoming Labour government to increase spending on transport and housing without raising the PSBR, a key indicator of government economic performance. The Tories immediately accused the opposition of intending to 'cook the books', and called the plan the latest Labour economic fiasco. Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, said: 'Yet again Labour's economic policy has been seen to be full of holes . . . Labour would employ the Arthur Daley approach to book-keeping.' Labour's two-pronged approach may eventually have broader applications. One senior Labour politician suggested yesterday that access to joint public and private financing could be granted more freely without undermining the prudential approach to public spending that the party is seeking to convey. The party denied any link between its spending plans and proposals to make the UK's public accounts more transparent, saying the two had 'no connection whatsoever'. Labour Treasury frontbenchers insist that the only new expenditure which will be sanctioned immediately after an election would be on child benefit and state pensions. But the party is keen to find ways of increasing investment in public services which would not count as public expenditure in many other European Community countries. One potential source of finance would be local authorities' Pounds 8bn of capital receipts from council house sales. Mr Clive Soley, Labour's housing spokesman, repeated yesterday, during a debate organised by Roof magazine, the party's promise to release more of these funds for housing. Challenged by Sir George Young, housing minister, on whether this would count as additional public expenditure, Mr Soley said the definition of public sector borrowing would be changed to exclude certain types of expenditure - including recycling of capital receipts into housing investment. Mr Soley was at pains to stress that Labour merely intended to bring 'restrictive' public accounts conventions in the UK broadly into line with European practice. Labour later disowned his remarks, saying Mr Soley had been wrong to suggest that PSBR definitions would be changed to accommodate the release of capital receipts. The EC is expected to develop standard measures of performance - including for government borrowing - under the rules for governing economic convergence in the treaty for economic and monetary union. Labour is also considering separating current spending from capital investment in a further reform of traditional public accounts conventions. Both forms of expenditure are currently lumped together within the PSBR. On the spending side, Labour is contemplating extending the right of local authorities to raise long-term finance by issuing municipal bonds. The party stresses, however, that bonds would only be used to provide local authority financing 'at the margin'. Education pledge, Page 10</p>

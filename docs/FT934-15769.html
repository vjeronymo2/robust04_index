			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Markets: Whitbread's guessing game - The Bottom Line WHITBREAD'S restructuring this week has stirred investor interest in the regional brewers and pub companies. With the takeover of its associated Whitbread Investment Company (WIC), the national brewer will acquire stakes in a dozen of the regionals. The question is: what will it do with them? All Whitbread has said so far is that it will 'undertake a thorough and careful review of the options for the investments' in consultation with the companies. Those options include selling the investments to raise cash, retaining some of them to underpin trading links, or using them in some cases to launch a full takeover bid. Decisions will have to be made on the stakes in Boddington, the Cheshire-based pub retailer, and Marston, Thompson &amp; Evershed, the Burton-on-Trent brewer, within six months of the WIC acquisition. Whitbread will hold about 21 per cent of the shares in each of these groups and, to comply with the government's beer orders, will have to reduce the holdings to less than 15 per cent or free several hundred more of its own pubs from exclusive beer supplies. Second-guessing Whitbread's intentions has already lifted the shares in the past two days: Boddington by 8p to 268p, and Marston by 14p to 280p. Each could have acquisition attractions for Whitbread after the disappointment of losing Grand Metropolitan's Chef &amp; Brewer pubs to Scottish &amp; Newcastle. Boddington, which sold its breweries and eponymous beer brand to Whitbread when it quit brewing in 1989, has nearly 500 pubs as well as leisure hotels. Marston has nearly 900 pubs and Whitbread already distributes its Pedigree bitter, one of the strongest regional beer brands. Their regional strengths, Boddington in the north-west and Marston in the midlands, would complement Whitbread's position in southern England. If it decides to use its greater freedom to make acquisitions in the pub sector - braving the inevitable interest of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission - there are few better packages available. Whitbread's stakes in the other regionals would seem to have less intrinsic interest for the group apart, in some instances, from helping to smooth the supply of its beers into their pubs. But their disposal could enliven the sector. If the 12 per cent stake in Morland comes on to the market, it could re-awaken the interest of Greene King, which is sitting on 29.3 per cent of the Thames Valley brewer after its unsuccessful bid last year. And Brakspear, the Oxfordshire brewer, the controlling family of which bought a chunk of its shares from WIC last year, now faces the disposal of a second tranche. With the potential sale of more than Pounds 100m of shares in regionals from Vaux (Pounds 22.5m) and Greenalls (Pounds 12.7m) in the north, to Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley (Pounds 6.4m) in the midlands and Fuller, Smith &amp; Turner (Pounds 5.9m) in the south, the sector will come under keen scrutiny. It will reveal some promising changes since the MMC shake-up of the industry  -not least, a strategic return to the core business of brewing and pubs after some wild excursions into such activities as computers and carpet-cleaning. The regionals, in general, have made good use of the opportunities afforded by the MMC to strengthen their pub estates and, with the renaissance of cask-conditioned ales, their beer brands. 'They have provided shareholders with an impressive rate of growth over the past four years,' says Michelle Proud, analyst at NatWest Securities. 'The average rate of compound growth in earnings during this period has been 9 per cent - significantly better than that of either the market or of the major brewers. 'No fund manager is likely to have lost sleep with investments in the regional brewers.' So far, pub retailers have done better than the integrated brewers, but the balance could be changing as the recession recedes. Those companies which remained in brewing, have strong ale brands and an expandable, well-run, managed pub estate can now expect higher rates of growth.</p>

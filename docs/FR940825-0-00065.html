			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> IDEQ is claiming a five percent credit for the Pinehurst wood smoke public awareness program. This credit is based upon the increased effectiveness of the public awareness program since 1991, the fact that Pinehurst is a small town (population 1,722 in 1990)_which makes it relatively easy to keep in contact with the citizens, and the fact that IDEQ has hired a Pinehurst wood stove advocate to work on increasing the public's awareness of the availability of cleaner-burning residential heating devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Considering IDEQ's aforementioned reasons for claiming a five percent emission reduction credit (which equals a PM&hyph;10 emission reduction of 10.8 lbs/day, and a 24-hour PM&hyph;10 ambient reduction of 4 &mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), EPA is accepting the five percent credit requested by the IDEQ.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Uncertified Wood Stove Change-out Program. IDEQ is in the process of replacing 90 uncertified wood stoves in the Pinehurst nonattainment area with cleaner heating devices. The uncertified wood stoves are replaced as part of a combined Federal assistance grant, and State and local loan program. Ninety grants ranging from $500&hyph;$1,750 each will be offered to the residents of Pinehurst as financial incentive to replace their uncertified stoves with natural gas furnaces, pellet stoves or phase II wood stoves. In addition, 50 of these participants will be offered low interest loans, up to a maximum amount of $1,500 per homeowner, using Idaho Department of Water Resources (IDWR) funds. These loans will cover the additional costs of upgrading the qualifying resident's heating system, including the cost of installation. IDWR will allow the loans to be paid back over a five-year period. The combined grant and loan program will be administered by the Northern Idaho Community Action Agency (NICAA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is estimated by IDEQ that the combined grant/loan program will replace 90 uncertified wood stoves with 40 natural gas furnaces, 25 pellet stoves and 25 phase II wood stoves. This change is projected to result in a PM&hyph;10 emission reduction of 43.4 lbs/day (which equals a 17 &mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  24-hour PM&hyph;10 reduction) in the Pinehurst nonattainment area (based upon a 100%, 95% and 55% emission reduction credits for replacing uncertified wood stoves with natural gas furnaces, pellet stoves and phase II wood stoves, respectively; a 0.56 lbs/day PM&hyph;10 emission rate for a uncertified wood stove in Pinehurst; and the determination that a PM&hyph;10 emission rate of 393 lbs/day equals a 24-hour ambient PM&hyph;10 concentration of 150 &mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at Pinehurst).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, IDEQ is estimating that the wood stove change-out program will reduce PM&hyph;10 emissions from residential wood combustion devices in Pinehurst by 16.5 percent (or 43.4 lbs of PM&hyph;10 reduced/day divided by 263.8 lbs of PM&hyph;10 emitted on the worst case day in 1994). EPA believes that the program will reduce PM&hyph;10 emissions in the Pinehurst nonattainment area because the program is receiving broad based support and has secure funding sources. Therefore, EPA is accepting the 16.5 percent PM&hyph;10 emission reduction credit that IDEQ claims will result from implementation of the wood stove change-out program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Home Weatherization Program. Wood stove emissions can be reduced slightly through comprehensive weatherization programs that result in a reduction of the amount of fuel utilized. The Idaho Economic Opportunity Office offers free weatherization assistance to low income families. This assistance takes the form of an energy audit, which may result in insulation, weather stripping and heating system improvements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Home weatherization improvements will be applied to all 90 households in which wood stove change-outs occur, using loans and grant money from Idaho Department of Water Resources, Farmers Home Administration, Washington Water Power and North Idaho Community Action Agency's Weatherization Division. At least 30 other homes will be targeted for weatherization improvements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's Guidance Document for Residential Wood Combustion Emission Control Measures, September 1989, generally recommends less than a five percent credit for home weatherization programs. However, IDEQ is claiming an eight percent credit for the Pinehurst home weatherization program for the following three reasons: a. Pinehurst has a higher than normal percentage of older, uninsulated homes; b. Shoshone County, which contains Pinehurst, has a high percentage of low income households, who in the past were unable to afford weatherization; and c. Pinehurst's cold winter climate results in a high number of heating degree days, which enables a home weatherization program to have more impact than it would in an area that possesses a warmer winter climate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The eight percent reduction claimed from the program is only equivalent to a PM&hyph;10 decrease of 3.5 lbs/day (which equals a daily ambient PM&hyph;10 reduction of 1 &mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Therefore, this program will have only a slight impact on PM&hyph;10 levels during worst case days. Nonetheless, in light of IDEQ's reasoning that homes in Pinehurst are in need of weatherization, and that weatherizing 120 homes will result in lower fuel consumption and correspondingly less PM&hyph;10 emissions in the Pinehurst nonattainment area, EPA is accepting the eight percent credit claimed by IDEQ.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

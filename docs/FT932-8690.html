			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Figuring out failure When countries go into recession, few economic statistics are followed with greater interest than the data for business failures. When they recover, a decline in insolvencies is usually seen as proof that the worst is over. But how much do we know about business failure? How comprehensive or accurate are the figures? Despite considerable academic research, we have only a limited understanding. This was one of the key conclusions of a Review of Research on the Factors Influencing the Death of Small Firms*, presented at a seminar last Friday by David Storey, director of research at the Warwick University Small Business Centre. While 'failure' is often taken to mean disaster and financial loss, many businesses appear in the statistics when they have simply been sold or the owner has retired. None of the statistics commonly used - VAT deregistrations, business insolvencies, personal bankruptcies - tells the whole story and, worse still, they frequently show conflicting trends. Researchers generally agree that small, young companies are particularly vulnerable and that companies which do not grow are less likely to survive. But even such apparently obvious measures as profit do not automatically link to success or failure. Nor is the sector in which a business operates a significant factor in whether or not it survives (despite the fondness of bankers for red-lining specific sectors). It has also proved difficult to relate personal characteristics to success or failure, while the impact of external economic shocks, such as changes in interest rates, is not clear-cut. It may be of some consolation to business owners battling with the uncertainties of the 1990s that conditions in the 19th century, often depicted as the golden age of the established family firm, were very much the same. Relatively few companies grew to a ripe old age, even then. *Researched as part of a small firms study financed by the Economic and Social Research Council to be published later.</p>

			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: WEST COVINA;  </P> <P> COUNCIL OKS HOUSING LIMIT  </P> <P> The City Council on Monday tentatively approved an ordinance to tighten  regulations on building second units on lots zoned for single-family homes.  </P> <P> The changes would impose a size limit of 640 square feet for second units and  would require that the property owner occupy at least one of the units.  </P> <P> Councilman Brad McFadden dissented in the 4-1 vote, arguing that a maximum of  800 square feet was preferable. He added that he didn't believe in restricting  property rights.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission initiated the revisions in July. "People were building  normal-sized homes, sometimes bigger than existing homes," Planning Assistant  Brad Dunlap said. Planning Director Patricia Haley said in a report that  neighbors were increasingly concerned about noise, traffic and loss of privacy.  </P> <P> Last year, the city received seven requests to build second units and has  received one this year. The council will vote again on the ordinance March 12.  If approved, the law would take effect 30 days later.  </P></p>

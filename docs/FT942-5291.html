			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Jakarta investment row Indonesian ministers, journalists and publishers have expressed stiff opposition to the relaxation of rules on foreign investment limits. Presenting their case against the new policy which was introduced last week, they complained the move would endanger Indonesian values by allowing foreigners to influence public opinion. 'If (this is allowed) we can no longer use the media to fight for the country,' Mr Harmoko, minister of information, was quoted saying in the national press. 'We will be under the control of foreigners.' Mr Harmoko said a law stipulating that only Indonesian citizens may own publications may be enough to thwart any attempts to open the media to foreigners. The debate gave credence to criticism that government departments and ministries do not consult each other when formulating policies. Mr Harmoko's statements come only two days after the government announced it was slashing limits on foreign investment and foreign equity ownership in an effort to compete with neighbouring Asian economies offering more attractive investment policies. Foreign investment in Indonesia dropped to Dollars 8.4bn (Pounds 5.6bn) in 1993 from Dollars 10.3bn a year earlier.</p>

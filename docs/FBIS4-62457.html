			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and Konstantin </F> Pribytkov]    [Text] Geneva, 14 May -- Russia is actively involved in  preparing the final document of the summit of the seven leading  countries in the West and the Russian Federation, which will be  held in Naples in July.    Andrey Kozyrev told journalists in Geneva today that the  first consultations of representatives of foreign policy  departments was recently held in Italy. Deputy Foreign Minister  Sergey Lavrov took part in them on the Russian side. "The  sessions were positive, we have already put forward our  proposals regarding the text of the document, and other  countries have also presented their proposals," the head of  Russian diplomats said. "Thus, practical work is under way to  draw up the final document of the `G-8' regarding issues of the  world's security policy. I think we are on the right track  here."    Commenting on the process for linking Russia to the new  export control system intended to replace Cocom [Coordinating  Committee for Multilateral Export Controls], the minister  observed that in that respect the dialogue had not yet reached  the necessary level. Russian experts "are not as yet directly  involved in the work, although we do have assurances from the  American side." "Additional complications have arisen" in this  regard. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov  recently met his counterparts from the United States. The same  question was discussed today during a conversation with Warren  Christopher. "It was confirmed once more that the next meeting  of experts to draft the new COCOM regime will take place with  the direct participation of Russia," Andrey Kozyrev pointed out.  "I said quite unequivocally: We shall be simply unable to join  in a regime that has been drafted without our equal  participation."</p>

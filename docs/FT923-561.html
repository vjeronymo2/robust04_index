			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Moscow faces policy attack from centrists THE Russian government faces a concerted push over the next two weeks to replace its policies, and probably most of its ministers. Mr Arkady Volsky, head of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs and one of the most powerful figures in the centrist Civic Union bloc, said at the weekend that the government's programme was 'advantageous only to the International Monetary Fund'. He said the Civic Union would in the next 10 days present a programme entitled Liberal Reforms and Strong Power, proposing administrative control of the market and the creation of a 'Euro-Asiatic' union of six or seven of the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The centrists' tactics, to propose a return both to a modified command economy and a scaled-down union, is a direct challenge to the government of Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, which came to power to institute rapid market reform in a Russia shorn of former union entanglements. The publication of this new programme - backed by many of the parliamentary parties, business groups and trade unions, and co-led by General Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president - will coincide with the meeting of the CIS heads of state in Bishkek, capital of Kyrgyzia, postponed from last Friday to October 9. Meanwhile, Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, warned at the weekend that oil production - the export lifeblood of Russia - would drop next year to about 340m tonnes from an estimated 397m this year, and possibly as low as 320m tonnes. Exports would fall from about 60m tonnes this year to about 45m tonnes, he said. Reuter adds from Moscow: The central Asian state of Turkmenistan will renew gas supplies to Ukraine after the two former Soviet republics resolved a six-month dispute over pricing, Interfax news agency said yesterday. Turkmenistan will supply Ukraine with 8bn cubic metres of gas in the last quarter of 1992 and 28.4bn next year. Ukraine will unblock supplies of food and other products suspended in February.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Letter: Pensions trustees and fiduciary duty Sir, Many of us, particularly those involved in the law, were interested to read the article by John Plender on the case relating to trustees and the difficulty in pursuing them for negligence ('A question of trust and security', June 9). Mr John Quarrell is of the view that 'it is almost impossible to pursue a trustee for negligence when it comes to investment'. That may indeed be so. Should a trustee make what would appear to the layman to be a 'bad' investment, there is almost certainly no negligence. Nevertheless, circumstances can arise which could be just that. An example is, if expert professional advisers have given strong advice to the effect that an investment in X would be disastrous for stated reasons and the trustees nevertheless go ahead and invest. In such a case there must surely be a strong argument in favour of negligence by the trustees. It is important, however, to look further and consider not only negligence. Trustees may be in breach of fiduciary duty. In the Melton Medes case, although still under review, that is nevertheless an allegation which I should anticipate might be made. A conflict of interest can often give rise to a breach of fiduciary duty. If a trustee put the affairs of either himself or maybe his company before the proper requirements of his beneficiaries, it is a breach of fiduciary duty. For example, assume a trustee receives advice that he should invest in a particular property development and, at the same time, his company would be well advised to do so. If the trustee ignores the investment entirely for his beneficiaries and invests wholly for the company, there is a distinct risk he would be in breach of fiduciary duty. The point I wish to make is that all is not lost for beneficiaries, and trustees still have to look to their laurels. David Caruth, 169 Queens Gate, London SW7 5HE</p>

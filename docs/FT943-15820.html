			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Lufthansa returns to the black at midway A combination of cost-cutting and increased revenues helped Lufthansa make pre-tax profits of DM100m (Pounds 40m) in the first half of 1994, the airline said at the group's annual general meeting in Berlin. This is the first time the airline has made a first-half profit in five years. Mr Jurgen Weber, chairman, said the second half-year was traditionally better than the first and he was confident the airline would pay a dividend for 1994. Ordinary shareholders last received a payout in 1989. The chairman also spelt out details of the airline's privatisation plans, saying Lufthansa hoped to hold the first tranche of a planned two-stage rights issue this year, although the one-for-four issue of 7.6m new shares could be postponed until next year if market conditions were unfavourable. The second tranche is set to take place in the spring of next year. The government, which holds a direct 51.4 per cent stake in Lufthansa, will not take up its entitlement to new shares. In a separate transaction, it will also sell off 2.3m shares. The effect of these measures would be to reduce the government's stake in the airline to about 35 per cent, analysts said. The first stage of the rights issue is likely to be held at DM160 per share or a discount of 20 per cent to the prevailing share price. This will bring in DM1.2bn for the airline which repeated its complaint yesterday about being poorly capitalised: after years of heavy losses, the ratio of equity capital to debt stands at 17 per cent, less than half the level at the end of the 1980s. The DM100m pre-tax profit - reported by the Lufthansa parent company in the first six months - compares with a loss of DM221m in the same period last year, and follows a loss of DM82m in the first three months of the current year. Without giving any details, Mr Weber said the airline also broke even at the operating level in the first six months of 1994, and that sales and capacity utilisation had also increased. The target for the year as a whole had been reached in the first six months, he said. The increase in profits reflects the airline's pre-privatisation rationalisation which last year raised productivity by 15 per cent and reduced costs by 10 per cent. A second phase of rationalisation and restructuring, planned for next year, is likely to improve Lufthansa's earnings by DM500m-DM700m a year, Mr Weber stated.</p>

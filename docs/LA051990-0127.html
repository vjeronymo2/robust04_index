			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NCAA SOFTBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> TITANS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ERRORS TO EDGE LONG BEACH  </P> <P> Joy Tiner's bases-loaded, bloop single in the top of the eighth inning gave the  Cal State Fullerton softball team a 3-2 victory over Cal State Long Beach  Friday night in the first game of a best-of-three NCAA regional series.  </P> <P> The teams will meet again at 1 today at Fullerton, and a second game will  follow if necessary. The regional winner earns a berth in the College World  Series, which begins Wednesday in Oklahoma City.  </P> <P> A crowd of about 400 at Titan Field saw Fullerton (45-21) take advantage of two  49er errors in the eighth. Carey Hess reached first on pitcher Mary  Letourneau's fielding error, and Mich DeBree reached when first baseman Kellie  Kane mishandled her bunt.  </P> <P> The Titans loaded the bases when Kane's throw to third on Charlotte Wiley's  bunt wasn't in time to force Hess. Long Beach reliever Ruby Flores came on to  get Missy Coombes to line to left field for the first out, but Tiner, who also  had an RBI single in the fourth, placed a soft single over shortstop Kim  Kostyk's head for the game-winning run.  </P> <P> Fullerton pitcher Ann Van Dortrecht, who improved to 29-10, retired the 49ers  (45-17) in the eighth with the help of an outstanding defensive play by  shortstop Wiley. Lisa Pedersen's hard grounder caromed off Van Dortrecht's  glove and toward Wiley, who made a bare-handed grab and fired to first in time  for the second out.  </P> <P> Steffani Everett, who had three hits for Long Beach, singled to center, but Gia  Wilkerson popped to short to end the game.  </P> <P> "There have been tough games all year between the two of us, and this was just  another one," said Fullerton Coach Judi Garman, whose Titans had lost four of  five games to the 49ers, all by one run. "It's nice to win the first game of  the series, because now the pressure is on Long Beach."  </P> <P> Fullerton, ranked fifth in the nation, scored once in the fourth when Wiley  singled to left and advanced to second when the ball got past left fielder  Wilkerson. Wiley reached third on a groundout and scored on Tiner's single to  right.  </P> <P> But the fourth-ranked 49ers came back in the bottom of the fourth, scoring  twice to take a 2-1 lead. Wilkerson singled and scored on Carrie Smith's  double, and Smith scored when Titan left fielder Buffy Sanchez couldn't handle  Heather Illsley's low liner.  </P> <P> Fullerton tied the score in the sixth, when Hess doubled, was sacrificed to  third and scored on Wiley's single to center.  </P></p>

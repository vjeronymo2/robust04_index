			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / International Company News: Alcatel tries to keep Turkish unit afloat Alcatel BV, a Belgian subsidiary of the French telecommunications group, is negotiating a Dollars 150m loan to the Turkish government in an attempt to keep its Turkish subsidiary afloat. The loan would allow the PTT, the Turkish state telecoms company, to settle its TL4,000bn (Dollars 120m) debts to Teletas, Alcatel's 65 per cent owned subsidiary. Senior Belgian Alcatel executives were in Turkey on Friday trying to win backing for the scheme. Teletas's troubles highlight the problems of companies dependent on government contracts in the face of the economic downturn. Teletas derives 95 per cent of sales from the PTT. The collapse of Teletas, which was spun off from the PTT in 1988, would further undermine international confidence in Turkey's proposed programme of privatisations. Turkey has mandated S. G. Warburg to sell convertible bonds in the PTT, as a first step towards floating it. The government hopes to raise Dollars 3.5bn this year alone, selling stakes in petroleum refining and distribution groups, a steel concern and THY, the national carrier. Last month, Teletas sought court protection from creditors, owing TL2,743bn to 34 foreign and Turkish banks. The crisis caused the resignation of the Teletas president Mr Sakip Sabanci. With Akbank, the Sabanci family bank, one of the largest trade creditors of Teletas, Mr Sabanci indicated he wanted to shelter from allegations of conflict of interest. Three Turkish banks, Demirbank, Vakifbank and Alternatifbank, hold liens against company assets. The remaining creditors, of which Societe Generale, the French bank, has the largest exposure, are unsecured. If less than 75 per cent of creditors agree to Teletas's proposed rescheduling, the court will force the company to declare itself bankrupt.</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Chicken sexers revive a lost art THE EUROPEAN Social Fund is giving grants to train long-term unemployed men and women in a lost art - sorting out the males from the females among day-old chicks. The skills are in such demand that 30 trainees on eight-month part-time courses, have been offered salaries of Pounds 15,000 a year if they successfully complete the training. An experienced sexer can earn up to Pounds 40,000. Qualities required for the job include concentration and the manual dexterity to part the feathers of up to 1,200 chickens an hour. 'It is very tiring,' said Mr Tom McGuckin, project manager. 'Many workers can only manage a three-and-a-half-day week.' Chickens need to be sexed so they can meet customer requirements - males for fattening-up and females for laying eggs. The skill of sexing has been in decline in Britain, and poultry breeders have been hiring Japanese or Korean workers. 'Up to now there have been no training facilities in the UK,' said Mr McGuckin. Poultry breeders have tried to separate males and females by mechanical means, but they are having to stop because of animal welfare laws. Years ago, there was a four-year apprenticeship for the job. Eight months, said Mr McGuckin, was not a long time in which to learn the job and be able to perform it at speed. 'Chickens are not like human beings.' he said. 'There is no obvious way of telling the sex of a chick at that age. It takes time to recognise the differences.' There were more jobs on offer than students, he said.</p>

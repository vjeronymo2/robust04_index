			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Observer: Pull the udder one Small farmers of Germany's Saxony and Thuringia can be forgiven for complaining that they have been milked during their first brief taste of capitalism. Two years ago, a sizeable dairy based near Dresden called Sachsenmilch became the first east German company to attain a listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Glowing proudly, Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest, and an old hand in the east, closed the offer two days early because of the flood of demand led by local farmers. It seemed nothing could go wrong. The cows were plentiful, east Germans loved the milk, and Stuttgart's Sudmilch, Germany's leading dairy group, was the majority shareholder. Deutsche had lined up over DM260m (Pounds 100m) for a new dairy and up-to-date machinery. Then things started to turn sour. The bankers insist they poured over the accounts pre- and post-listing, finding at that stage no trace of the existence of what turned out to be a second contract, as a result of which Sachsenmilch's former manager, Wolfgang Weber, overran his budget, possibly by as much as 40 per cent. The bank bleats that officials simply withheld information. But some Saxons are now saying Weber's hectic social life should at least have prompted closer scrutiny of how the dairy itself was run. With Weber now pursuing other interests in Paraguay, it is small wonder Deutsche is frantically trying to save the dairy and keep its reputation in eastern Germany afloat.</p>

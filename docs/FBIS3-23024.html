[passage omitted]    In late December 1993, the personal representative of  Abdullah Ocalan, Zahir Bardani, met with political leaders of  Armenia in Echmiadzin. The representative of Armenians of  Nagorno-Karabakh, Levon Melik-Shakhnazarov attended the meeting  as well. As a result of the meeting, the KWP headquarters was  partially moved to Armenia and 660 Kurdish soldiers appeared in  Armenian units fighting against Azerbaijan.    But cooperation of Armenians and Kurds began long before the  meeting in Echmiadzin. Since 1988, Kurdish soldiers have been  training together with Armenian terrorists from "ASALA"  [Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia] in Cyprus.  Soon, Abdullah Ocalan gave $1.2 million to build an additional  base for the training of Armenian and Kurdish soldiers.    Earlier, Western journalists having visited Armenian regions  neighbouring Turkey, reported that there were 21 bases training  Kurdish soldiers. According to the same sources, the Kurds have  been conducting subversive acts in Turkey from those bases.</p>

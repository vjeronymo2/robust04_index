			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Clocks, Watches &amp; Jewellery: The Swiss makers fight back - Fashion and tradition dominate the top end of the market THE watch industry has undergone considerable change over the past 15 years. Production has more than doubled to around 730m units, with digital quartz (LCD display) and analogue quartz (hands display) taking the lion's share. But the centre of production has switched from Switzerland to Hong Kong and Japan, which between them account for two-thirds of output. All is not lost for Switzerland, however; increasing demand for luxury watches led its sales to rise by 10 per cent last year, to capture half the market by value. The most significant change has been the sharp decline in the production of middle and low-priced mechanical watches following the introduction of the battery-powered quartz timepiece. Quartz destroyed the theory that more expensive equals more accurate. Cheap, stylish and reliable Japanese quartz watches forced the Swiss to re-think strategy. They countered with the Swatch, which re-defined consumer perception by producing multi-coloured, fashionable and affordable watches. Some of the earlier models are now collectors' items. Swatch is also believed to be introducing a mechanical watch which will be launched next year. However, there has been a renewal of interest in the more traditional mechanical timepiece, particularly in Japan, where Swiss makes such as Blancpain and Audemars Piquet are extremely popular. Production of luxury and mechanical timepieces is very profitable and Japanese makers are keen to compete. But Swiss manufacturers still dominate the luxury watch market, through companies such as Piaget with traditional jewelled watches and Breguet with fine timepieces. As John Lloyd Morgan, sales director of Chaumet, the main Breguet stockist, explains: 'Fashion does not play a significant role. Breguet watches are the rarest of hand made watches and so are not perceived as items of jewellery, but as fine time pieces'. This year's worldwide Breguet exhibition and the relatively successful auction of more than 200 Breguet watches and clocks going back over two centuries has made antique watches more highly sought after. Geofrey Ashworth, managing director of International Watch Company UK, explains the swing back to mechanical watches. 'People have this constant search for the finer things in life. Men can't wear jewellery so watches are an area where they can indulge themselves'. Fashion continues to influence design in the middle range of the market. Raymond Weil started quartz watch production 14 years ago and now claims to be the fourth biggest producer in Switzerland. His marketing strategy is to place the emphasis on fashion. With a shape and a style for everyone, the new line offers round cases with diamond bezels in steel or 18 carat gold, with corresponding bracelet links. Corum is also at the forefront of fashion and is marketing an unexpected combination of circle and rectangle in its recently-launched Symbiose quartz model. It has also just produced 'Meteorite Mars', a platinum watch with a dial carved in rock from Mars. Other manufacturers respond to nostalgia. Jaeger-leCoultre celebrated the 60th anniversary of its Reverso watch, with its skeleton back, by reproducing the watch in a rose-gold case. TAG-Heuer has created its own niche in sports watches, and has enjoyed a substantial growth in sales. According to Neil Duckworth, managing director of Duval, its distributors, TAG-Heuer last year accounted for 700,000 units worldwide. In the first three months of this year it recorded a 47 per cent increase in growth in the UK alone. But the most prominent trend is the chronograph. As Susanne MacDonald of London's Watch Gallery explains, 'almost all the show cases here house a chronograph with one or more representing each brand'. Where a brand is unable to incorporate a chronograph, it often positions the date and second hand in dials to resemble one. Even Swatch has its own chronograph, which reached something approaching cult status in Italy and produced excellent sales. As Julia Ogilvy at Garrard points out, 'in Italy they are chronograph mad - even ladies wear them. The watch has become an essential part of their wardrobes.' There has been a trend away from steel and gold to other metals, such as platinum and titanium. Alfred Dunhill last year launched the Dunhill platinum elite, and is developing an exclusive dress range with a skeleton watch: its clear sapphire glass front and its back reveal the intricate, hand-engraved automatic movement. Even something as technical and practical as Breitling's 'Old Navitimer', a mechanical watch used by pilots as a precision instrument, is now made in platinum. Blancpain, which has produced mechanical watches since 1735, combines platinum and the watchmaker's art in a presentation case containing a six horological masterpieces - the ultra-slim watch, the moon face calendar, the perpetual calendar, the split second chronograph, the eight-day tourbillon and the minute repeater. The six masterpieces of watchmaking epitomise the achievement for a master watchmaker; to produce all six in one presentation case is a collector's dream. Also included are two individual world firsts - the automatic split-second chronograph and the tourbillon with eight-day power reserve. The ultimate in watchmaking is a Grande Complication, combining all six complications. Jean Claude Biver, president of Blancpain, realised his dream in December by combining the six traditional masterpieces within one case, in the Blancpain '1735' - a true complication wristwatch and the first of its kind. Each watch costs Pounds 400,000; only 30 will be made, and all have been sold. Audemars Piquet has been making one Grande Complication pocket watch each year since 1889. The company is in the Guiness Book of Records for the world's most complicated pocket watch without precious metals. Patek Philippe started its rival version in 1908, and since 1947 has been manufacturing a series of Grande Complication pocket watches, of which there will be 17. Number 14 can be seen in this year's London salon and costs Pounds 450,000. It is unique in that its bezel has a barley-corn patterned engine-turning and inside the back, the cuvette, is set in sapphire crystal in which the mechanism can be seen working. IWC has just launched its Grande Complication with a platinum case. Although it does not incorporate all six complications, it does have unique features such as a perpetual calendar which is programmed indefinitely. IWC is making 50 a year and already has orders for 350. Each watch costs Pounds 85,000, and is 30mm in diameter and 11mm thick. The Swiss are aware that the Japanese are eagerly eyeing the profitable niche in expensive mechanical watches. As John Keeping, an industry consultant, explains: 'Until the Japanese swamped the market in the 1980s the Swiss believed that no-one could design a watch as well as themselves'. A year later Seiko was the first foreign company to take the Grand Prix de Geneve.</p>

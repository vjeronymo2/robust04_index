			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / People: Michael Weinstein Michael Weinstein, who has died at the age of 47, must have been one of the world's most successful personal insurance salesmen - certainly an unusually cultivated one. Born and brought up in Philadelphia, he had spent his entire career in London, from 1973 working for Metropolitan Life, the US life insurance group. His clientele was drawn from Americans and other foreigners living in the UK. With his irresistible combination of social charm and good looks, backed up with a formidable knowledge of life insurance, business grew exponentially. In his best year, 1989, he personally sold Dollars 250m worth of policies - ahead of MetLife's 12,000 other salesmen in the US and overseas. His success could certainly not be put down to long hours in the office. Knowing that a good salesman had to be relaxed, Weinstein took long lunch breaks, afternoon naps and frequent holidays. He even freed himself from the chore of making routine telephone calls by employing an actor, part-time, to imitate his voice. He had an immensely strong will, and he succeeded by setting himself sales goals. Cynical British friends scoffed at the arcane MetLife honours system ('President's Conference', 'President's Council', 'Million Dollar Round Table', 'President's Trophy'), but Weinstein used it to motivate himself. The MetLife commissions enabled Michael Weinstein to enjoy a truly splendid lifestyle. Everything was in exquisite taste: his social life; the palatial penthouse apartment in Kensington; fine collections of historical art. His premature death from cerebral lymphoma is a great sadness for his large circle of friends and clients - and a considerable financial blow for MetLife.</p>

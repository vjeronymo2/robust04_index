			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Court disappoints The recent run of successful market debuts came to a sudden halt as shares in Court Cavendish, the nursing home company, closed at a hefty discount to their 225p issue price, which had valued the company at Pounds 51m. Dealers blamed a number of factors for the drop, which saw the shares open at 210p and drift back to 204p, before finishing at 207p. Turnover came to 1.6m. One factor cited was the Pounds 33m cash call made last week by rival operator Crestacare, with institutions which would have given the Court shares more support holding back until the allocation of the rights issue is known. In April, Westminster Health Care completed a Pounds 63m rights issue. Another rumour being heard was that Takare, the nursing home market leader, would also return to shareholders for a cash injection in the autumn. Takare shares were steady at 240p, Westminster a penny ahead at 297p and Crestacare level at 43p.</p>

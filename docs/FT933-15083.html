			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / International Company News: Hoechst, Schering to merge units HOECHST and Schering, two of Germany's leading chemicals groups, are to merge their plant protection divisions in a joint venture with annual sales of about DM3.4bn (Dollars 2.1bn), the companies announced yesterday. According to a letter of intent, Hoechst will hold a controlling 60 per cent stake. If there are no objections from the cartel authorities, the Berlin-based business should start operating at the beginning of 1994. The move, an important further step in the consolidation of the international chemicals industry, has been forced by the combined effects of recession and reforms of the common agricultural policy (Cap). The Hoechst division, employing 5,350 people, had sales of DM2.1bn last year, about 5 per cent of the group's total. At Schering, 3,900 are employed in plant protection, which had sales of DM1.3bn accounting for 20 per cent of group turnover. While some factories are expected to close and jobs will be lost, neither company could give any details. The full impact would not be known until the form of the business had been decided during further negotiations, Hoechst said. Schering relies on the European market for 70 per cent of its sales, which plummeted 22 per cent in the first quarter. German trade was hit by the withdrawal of traditional rebates on early orders, while Cap reforms were blamed for an 18 per cent year-on-year drop in volumes. With pesticides, weed killers and fungus treatments off its hands, the company will focus on its core business in pharmaceuticals. Schering has about 18 per cent of the world market for contraceptive drugs and claims global leadership in contrast fluids - diagnostic aids used for X-rays and scanning. The Hoechst business, partly because of its size and its lesser dependence on the European market, has proved more resilient to recent shocks. It makes 30 per cent of its sales in the US, where profits have helped offset operating losses in Europe, which accounts for half the division's turnover. The merger strengthens Hoechst's position in herbicides, which account for more than 60 per cent of its agrochemicals sales, and more than 40 per cent of Schering's turnover in this sector. In spite of the impact of Cap set-aside schemes on arable crops, the herbicides market, accounting for 40 per cent of EC agrochemicals sales, is considered reasonably robust. Even so, analysts reckon that the total European market for agrochemicals will shrink by up to 20 per cent over the next three years. Hoechst said yesterday that companies competing in the sector needed critical mass and resources in order to develop and produce a continuous stream of profitable new products. The agrochemicals business of Roussel Uclaf, France's third largest pharmaceuticals group in which Hoechst holds a 54.5 per cent stake, is set to be merged with the joint venture. Mr Edouard Sakiz, Roussel's president, said last week his agrochemicals operations were not large enough to survive on their own and that if the German groups' agrochemicals merger was achieved, then much of the French company's operations would be added to the venture. The division had sales last year of FFr3.44bn (Dollars 637.6m), representing about 23 per cent of group turnover.</p>

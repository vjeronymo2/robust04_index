			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> IRISH MISSILE FIRM SOLD TO CANADIANS  </P> <P> The British government today signed over the state-owned aircraft and guided  missile maker Short Brothers to the Canadian group Bombardier.  </P> <P> Bombardier, which makes subway rolling stock and small passenger jets, paid $48  million for Shorts. The government gave the Montreal firm $1.25 billion in aid  for the privatization takeover.  </P> <P> "There are exciting times ahead for the aerospace industry, and I feel sure  that under Bombardier's stewardship, Shorts will prosper," Britain's Northern  Ireland Minister Peter Brooke told Bombardier Chairman Laurent Beaudoin.  </P> <P> Bombardier defeated a joint bid by Dutch aircraft maker Fokker and Britain's  General Electric Co. PLC for control of the company. West Germany's  Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm had earlier shown interest in acquiring Shorts,  which once made biplanes under license for Orville and Wilbur Wright.  </P></p>

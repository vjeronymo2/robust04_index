			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Contract problems hit Triplex Lloyd Shares of Triplex Lloyd tumbled 11 per cent, from 144p to 128p on Friday after the industrial engineering group announced reverses at ED Hinchcliffe, the curtain walling company in its engineering division. Losses of Pounds 2.3m at Hinchcliffe, caused by overshooting of costs on three contracts, meant that group pre-tax profits for the six months to end-September were cut by 56 per cent to Pounds 1.45m, against Pounds 3.31m. The losses wiped out operating profits of the company's growing power and automotive divisions. The overall figures were ameliorated by the inclusion of property profits arising from the sale and leaseback of a Sterling International Technology plant. Earnings per share dropped to 1.6p (4.6p). Nevertheless, the directors are maintaining the interim - and now uncovered - dividend at 2.5p, seeing the Hinchcliffe loss as what Mr Colin Cooke, chairman, described as 'a setback against otherwise steady progress.' Problems at Hinchcliffe, detected as it reached the closing stages of the contracts and likely to drag the second half results down by Pounds 800,000, led to the postponement of plans for a new acquisition by the automotive division. Triplex Lloyd has been investing in both its automotive and power divisions. With the disposal of Thermovitrine, a glass processor, it has started to sell its building products companies. Offers have been received for all of them except Hinchcliffe, where a severe restructuring is taking place. Overall group turnover was virtually unchanged at Pounds 81.4m.</p>

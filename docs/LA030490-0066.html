			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> MEXICO PLANT'S ACID LEAK WAS WORSE THAN AQMD MODEL  </P> <P> When air quality officials recommended in January that hydrofluoric acid be  banned from use in Los Angeles County, oil and chemical industry spokesmen  attacked their report as "unrealistic," saying it was predicated on such a  large release of the chemical that no accident of that magnitude is likely to  occur.  </P> <P> However, The Times has learned that an even larger release of the acutely  hazardous substance occurred in 1980 in Matamoros, Mexico, killing two workers  and injuring 11 others.  </P> <P> In the Matamoros accident, which is believed to be the largest release of  hydrofluoric acid on record, the chemical poured out for 20 minutes from a  ruptured valve at a rate of 500 gallons a minute, creating a dense cloud of  toxic fumes.  </P> <P> The report by the South Coast Air Quality Management District was based on a  release of 70 gallons a minute for 100 minutes. Its computer study was based on  a 1987 accident at a refinery in Texas.  </P> <P> The Times has also learned of two other major releases from an Australian  refinery in 1976 and 1977. There were no serious injuries from either of the  Australian accidents.  </P> <P> Ed Camarena, deputy executive director of the AQMD, said last week that  information about the Matamoros accident, as well as the two Australian  releases, refutes industry criticism that the air quality staff is too  pessimistic about the potential for accidents involving the chemical.  </P> <P> Camarena said his staff was not aware of the three incidents -- each involving  the release of thousands of gallons of hydrofluoric acid -- until The Times  made inquiries about them.  </P> <P> He said the information obtained by The Times shows that "significantly larger  quantities can, and have, escaped from these facilities (using hydrofluoric  acid) . . . "  </P> <P> Hydrofluoric acid is so toxic that the release of a teaspoonful in a  500-square-foot room would create an immediate danger to life and health,  according to state health officials.  </P> <P> Four oil refineries in Los Angeles County and an Allied-Signal plant in El  Segundo each typically have acid inventories ranging from 7,000 to 29,000  gallons. The oil refineries are Mobil in Torrance, Ultramar in Wilmington and  Powerine and Golden West in Santa Fe Springs.  </P> <P> The hazards of hydrofluoric acid became an issue in the South Bay after about  12 gallons were released during an explosion and fire at Mobil's Torrance  refinery on on Nov. 24, 1987. One worker at the plant has alleged in a lawsuit  that he suffered lung damage from breathing acid fumes.  </P> <P> Federal safety officials later concluded that Mobil would have avoided the  accident if refinery officials had followed their own written safety  instructions.  </P> <P> Torrance voters go to the polls Tuesday to vote on a ballot measure that would  effectively ban the use of hydrofluoric acid at the refinery.  </P> <P> Representatives from Ultramar, Mobil and Allied-Signal attacked the AQMD in  January when staffers recommended banning the substance after studying the  probable consequences of a major release in the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> One of the critics, William E. Hague, an Allied-Signal engineering expert, said  last week that he had been aware of the Mexican and Australian releases and  that he remains critical of the AQMD study because it was predicated on a  rupture in a four-inch valve; Allied-Signal's plant only uses one-inch valves.  </P> <P> Another critic of the AQMD, Ultramar refinery manager Marshall A. (Bud) Bell,  said he was unaware of the three releases. However, he challenged the relevance  of the information.  </P> <P> "It is not logical to say that just because something happened at some  facility, that it is going to happen at my facility," he said. "While I can  say, 'That is interesting. That is amazing,' I am not really worried about it  because I know it can't happen here."  </P> <P> Mobil spokesman Tom Collins said late Friday that the oil company had no  comment on the information about the three major spills.  </P> <P> Camarena said, however, that the information would be helpful in his agency's  continuing evaluation of the hazards of hydrofluoric acid and "does indeed  verify" that the AQMD did not use "overly pessimistic assumptions" in analyzing  the consequences of a release from local facilities.  </P> <P> The AQMD used computerized estimation techniques to predict the consequences of  an accident here that would be similar to a 1987 release at the Marathon Oil  refinery in Texas City, Tex.  </P> <P> The Texas City accident was caused when construction workers dropped a 30-ton  piece of equipment on pipelines connected to a tank containing 35,700 gallons  of hydrofluoric acid. The resulting leak released an estimated 6,548 gallons of  hydrofluoric acid, forcing the evacuation of 4,000 residents, sending 1,037 to  area hospitals, and defoliating trees for miles. No one died.  </P> <P> The AQMD's main finding was that even with efforts to control such a release, a  cloud of acid fumes would threaten the lives of nearby residents. The report  also said that a similar release of less volatile sulfuric acid, which is being  considered as an alternative in refineries, would not produce a toxic gas  cloud.  </P> <P> The Matamoros accident occurred at the Quimica Fluor plant, which manufactures  hydrofluoric acid. The two employees who died were trapped in a building  engulfed by fumes, plant manager Javier Villarreal said in a telephone  interview.  </P> <P> An employee eventually donned a protective suit and shut off a valve to stop  the release. A small community near the plant, which is in a rural area 4 1/2  miles outside Matamoros, was spared because the wind was blowing the other  direction, Villarreal said.  </P> <P> After the accident, Villarreal said, metallurgical analysis determined that the  studs holding the valve cover had been weakened by hydrofluoric acid. He said  that more resistant alloys now are used and that no similar accident has  occurred.  </P> <P> He added that the 11 employees who were injured have suffered no long-term  consequences and that the plant now receives awards for its safety program.  </P> <P> Dr. Ronald Koopman, a scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory  who has studied the hazards of hydrofluoric acid since the mid-1980s, told The  Times about two major releases from the Ampol refinery in Brisbane, Australia.  His information was confirmed by Ampol refinery general manager Barry Woods and  Australian safety officials.  </P> <P> The first Ampol release, which occurred Dec. 22, 1976, was caused when a heavy  steel bar fell onto a heat exchanger during a construction project. The heat  exchanger was connected to a tank containing 28 tons, or about 7,000 gallons,  of hydrofluoric acid, all of which was released.  </P> <P> Ultramar's Bell and Koopman said Ampol used poor judgment in undertaking a  construction project near the tank without draining it of its dangerous  contents .  </P> <P> "That's pretty foolish," Bell said. ". . . It is certainly contrary to what we  would do. You can't condone that."  </P> <P> Said Koopman: "They never should have worked on the tower without draining the  unit. It is inconceivable, but, of course, Marathon (in Texas) was doing the  same damn thing."  </P> <P> Ampol's Woods said in a statement that the release took about 2 1/2 hours, for  an average rate of about 50 gallons a minute.  </P> <P> Woods said that refinery workers controlled the release with fire sprays and  fog nozzles and that some of the gas was vented to a relief system where it  could be neutralized.  </P> <P> "There is no record of any employee being exposed to HF vapor to the extent  which required any medical or even first-aid treatment," Woods said.  </P> <P> The second Ampol release took place on July 8, 1977, and was caused by the  failure of a weld. It again led to a release of 7,000 gallons but no estimate  of the rate is available.  </P> <P> Woods reported that one worker inhaled toxic fumes, was sent to a hospital for  "precautionary checks and was then sent home." Woods said the employee remains  at the refinery and "is in the best of health."  </P> <P> He added, "Both incidents were handled professionally by the refinery work  force with no outside assistance being required. There were no significant  injuries to refinery personnel. There was no impact beyond the refinery  perimeter. There have been no similar incidents in the elapsed 13 years."  </P> <P> Camarena said that AQMD staff members now are trying to obtain full reports of  the three accidents from local authorities and company officials.  </P> <P> In Torrance, clouds of hydrofluoric acid escaped the Mobil refinery grounds and  led Torrance authorities to close Crenshaw Boulevard for several hours on Nov.  25 and Nov. 29, 1987, according to Torrance Fire Department reports.  </P> <P> The release on Nov. 29 was caused when an employee accidentally opened a valve  to a pipe containing acid vapors, according to the Fire Department. The report  said refinery workers were able to shut the valve within five minutes. An  estimate of the rate of the release or the amount released was not available.  The Fire Department did not list a cause of the Nov. 25 release, and no  injuries were reported in either case.  </P> <P> The most recent incident involving hydrofluoric acid in Los Angeles was a  release Jan. 13 at the Powerine Oil Co. in Santa Fe Springs, which sent seven  refinery workers to the hospital. The incident occurred when a corroded pipe  holding the acid ruptured, creating a vapor cloud that employees diluted with  water and stopped from drifting outside the refinery, according to oil company  officials.  </P></p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Dozen directors earn Pounds 1m a year IN MORE THAN 50 quoted companies at least one director earned Pounds 500,000 or more last year, while a dozen received Pounds 1m or just under. The figures are revealed today in an analysis of company annual reports for 1992. The median increase in the highest paid directors' earnings was 5.5 per cent, says the survey by Monks Partnership, a pay research group. At the same time, many top executives in the largest companies took an earnings cut. In more than a quarter of companies with a turnover greater than Pounds 50m, the highest paid directors' earnings were reduced. Overall the rate of top earnings increases continued to fall. Mr Tony Vernon-Harcourt from Monks said it was important to view the increases in context. 'Most companies reporting to November 1992 or later will have set base earnings changes for their executives in October or November 1991. At that time the underlying growth in average earnings was 7.25 per cent, so an increase of 5 per cent would be looked on as perfectly fair and reasonable.' Performance bonuses, as well as base pay, are included in the survey figures  -not all companies currently separate the two in their annual reports. Listed companies reporting on years ending after June 30 1993 will be required to state the extent to which they have complied with the Cadbury best-practice code. One of the code's requirements is that 'separate figures should be given for salary and performance-related elements and the basis on which performance is measured should be explained'. Monks said that, where companies now disclose the presence of incentive plans, 'there appears to be a reasonable correlation between the payment of an annual cash incentive and company results'. Where it seemed there was a mismatch, it was often because of the payment of longer-term incentives which were dependent on the achievement of pre-set targets over three or more years, the company said. However, it added: 'There is no doubt that, in some cases, there is no discernible, or declared, relationship between individual rewards and corporate performance'. UK Board Earnings, July edition.

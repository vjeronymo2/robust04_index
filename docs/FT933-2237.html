			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Leading Article: A shiver in east London THE EXTREME right's victory in a local authority by-election last week has sent a shiver through British political life. Concern has already been rising over the level of racial attacks reported to the police in many UK cities. Politicians, churchmen and community leaders have been quick to deplore the success of a party that is openly racist in its programme. It is much too soon, however, to see the election of a British National party councillor in the east London borough of Tower Hamlets as evidence of a far-right breakthrough. The BNP victory, on less than 34 per cent of the vote, was achieved only because of a close three-way split in the voting. It was the first electoral success for the party in the 12 years of its existence. Its predecessor, the National Front, won only two council seats, despite a backlash in some parts of the country over the arrival of east African Asians. The docklands to the east of London have offered fertile ground for the BNP's brand of politics. Many white, working-class people in the area have been economically marginalised by the docks' decline. The skyline is dominated by prestige office developments such as Canary Wharf that provide few jobs for the unskilled. Fortified apartments in luxury developments back on to run-down rented housing built by the local council for low-income families. The housing of homeless Bangladeshis in new homes by the council has provided a convenient scapegoat, which the BNP has been quick to target. Indeed, it might be thought surprising that in a recession the BNP has not been able to win more support in this and similar communities throughout the UK. Elsewhere in western Europe, extreme right parties have won as much as 15 per cent of the popular vote, control local authorities and are represented in parliament. Fringe parties That the extreme right has been less successful in the UK is partly due to the first-past-the-post electoral system. This makes it hard for fringe parties to break through. But mostly it can be attributed to the ease with which an island state is able to limit immigration. Britain has been able to reduce the flow of immigrants to a level that makes it easier to absorb newcomers without social conflict. It has also found it all too easy to shut out the tide of refugees flooding into the rest of Europe from the east. Only when ethnic minorities have become concentrated in particular locations has the social fabric been seriously strained. More integration The counterpoint of stiff immigration controls, however, has been a concern to integrate ethnic minorities into British life and offer equality of opportunity. There is also a well-established legal framework to deter racial discrimination and outlaw incitement to racial hatred. This approach can claim some success, certainly in comparison with some other multi-ethnic societies. Yet reports of increasing racial attacks in Tower Hamlets and other urban areas indicate a seamier side to this picture of an open and tolerant multi-racial society. Many people from ethnic minorities live in fear of abuse and violence, not always confident that the police are willing or able to defend them. Their rights must be defended and their property protected if they are not to be forced into defensive ghettos. The law may need to be strengthened if it proves ineffective in dealing with racial violence inspired by extreme right political activities. Choking off the grievances that feed the growth of far-right politics may be rather harder, however. A society where all can aspire to economic opportunity is less likely to seek scapegoats among identifiable minorities. Central and local government clearly has an important, if limited, role to play in creating such a society. Much can also be done by the sort of partnerships between the public sector and business that have already contributed to regeneration in east London, albeit erratically on some occasions. But restoring hope to areas such as docklands is essential if extreme right politics is not to be a recurrent form of protest in elections. Cancers in the body politic - even in the smallest community - disfigure and threaten the whole.</p>

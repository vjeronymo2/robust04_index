			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Bush and Clinton limp to primary victories, Perot leading the way: The universal view is that the winner was the man who did not run 'THIS OBSESSION with Ross Perot is nonsensical,' Ron Brown was saying as the final curtain closed on the primary season. 'This is June, the election isn't until November and we haven't even started the general election campaign.' The frustration of the Democratic Party's national chairman is understandable. Tuesday night should have been a crowning moment for his man, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who had just swept the last six primaries and won enough delegates to be mathematically assured of his party's presidential nomination, barring some improbable coup d'etat against him between now and the convention in July. Over at the White House, President George Bush might have been excused for enjoying similar satisfaction, having pulled off a complete sweep of all the Republican primaries from New Hampshire onwards. Pat Buchanan's last stand in California - which he had promised, recalling the civil war, to make a battle worthy of Antietam for the hearts and minds of the party - had predictably fizzled. But Mr Bush had to suffer another distraction yesterday morning when Ms Sherrie Rollins announced she was resigning her White House communications post. Though she did not say so, this is presumed to be because her husband, Ed Rollins, a veteran Republican campaign strategist, has been enlisted by Mr Perot. Beyond this particular, every headline, every newscast and every pundit yesterday morning reached the same conclusion: that the real winner from California to New Jersey on Tuesday was the man who was not running. It was, as R W Apple put it in the New York Times, 'another in a series of shouts of dissatisfaction from an electorate that has been sounding off against politics as usual, state by state, since the New Hampshire primary began the political year in February'. And there, grinning broadly in many a television interview was Mr Perot himself, chatting merrily about the will of the people, flatly refusing to answer any questions of substance and blithely accusing the Republican party of practising 'saturation bombing with dirty tricks' against him. The evidence for the universal conclusion was not to be found in the ballot papers of the six states, most of which made write-in voting difficult, but in the ubiquitous exit polls. Almost everywhere, with the exception of Republican voters in Ohio, they found that members of both parties would, given the choice, prefer Mr Perot to either Mr Bush or Mr Clinton. A Washington Post analysis found Mr Perot's support overwhelmingly white, predominantly male, and significantly older than the average age of the country. Primary voters tend to be the most politically committed, whereas Mr Perot's appeal is among the disaffected. Add them to his putative total and his current strength becomes truly significant. The only offsetting findings of the exit polls was that his 'unfavourable' ratings rose, mostly among Democrats, perhaps a fragmentary sign that scrutiny of the man himself is beginning to take a toll. The thrust of all the analysis is that both Mr Bush and Mr Clinton are limping, not charging, out of the primaries. Both must now decide whether to take Mr Perot head on or merely hope that exposure will reveal exploitable flaws. Mr Clinton's prime task is also to pick a running mate, a shrewd choice of whom could deflect any last-minute attempt to deny him the nomination. The hard counted numbers showed that Mr Clinton scored 68 per cent in Alabama, 61 per cent in Ohio, 59 per cent in New Jersey, 53 per cent in New Mexico, 47 per cent in Montana, and 48 per cent of an incomplete tally in California. Jerry Brown got 40 per cent in his native California and no more than 20 per cent anywhere else. Mr Clinton won at least 450 of the 700 delegates on Tuesday, ending up, according to the Associated Press count, with 2,510 delegates, well above the 2,145 needed for the nomination. Mr Bush's scores were 83 per cent in New Jersey and Ohio, 75 per cent in Alabama, 72 per cent in Montana, 67 per cent in New Mexico and 74 per cent in California, where Mr Buchanan's 26 per cent was the highest he managed anywhere on Tuesday. The president had weeks ago secured enough delegates for his renomination. In other widely-watched races, two women, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, easily won the Democratic primaries for the two vacant US senate seats in California. Democrats in Iowa selected Jean Lloyd-Jones over another woman as their Senate candidate. With many other local primaries still to come, this means there will be at least five women competing this year for seats in the Senate, which has two female incumbents. Ms Feinstein will face the interim Republican incumbent John Seymour in November, while Ms Boxer will be up against Bruce Herschensohn, a very conservative Los Angeles TV commentator. The latter contest is likely to be dominated by the abortion issue. Maureen Reagan, the former president's daughter, failed to win the Republican nomination for a congressional district in the Los Angeles suburbs, in spite of campaigning on her behalf by her father. Jane Harman won the Democratic primary and will face Joan Flores in November. Two black women, Eva Clayton, a Democrat, and Barbara Gore Washington, a Republican, won run-off elections in North Carolina for new congressional districts. Though some of those victorious yesterday and earlier may lose in the end, it is apparent that women have rediscovered a political voice this year. Working for them, in general, are the abortion issue, with even Republican women critical of the president's pro-life stance, and disgust with the attacks on Anita Hill during the hearings last year into the nomination of Supreme Court judge Clarence Thomas. Incumbents generally fared a little better on Tuesday than in earlier primaries. Mary Rose Oakar, an eight-term Democrat from Ohio who had overdrawn her House bank account more than 200 times, survived a challenge, as, narrowly, did Congressman Bob McEwen in the same state. Among issues on the ballot in California, voters in Los Angeles easily passed a 'buy America' amendment to the city's charter, allowing the city government to prefer California contractors in its procurement orders. This movement was born last year after a mass transit contract was awarded to Sumitomo of Japan, though the decision was later reversed. Foreign investment has been actively sought for the reconstruction of Los Angeles after the riots. Also the city approved new restrictions on the power of the Los Angeles Police Department and its chief, whose conduct over the beating of Rodney King and during the subsequent disturbances has been heavily attacked. Mr Ross Perot yesterday hired two top mainstream political strategists to advise him, Our Foreign Staff writes. Mr Ed Rollins, a Republican who guided President Reagan's successful 1984 re-election bid, and Mr Hamilton Jordan, a Democrat who managed Mr Jimmy Carter's 1976 presidential campaign, were named Mr Perot's co-managers.

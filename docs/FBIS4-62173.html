			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correpondent Boris Krivoshey] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS -- The determination of Moldova  and its breakaway Dniester region to improve their mutual  relations is designed to subdue the entire conflict, the Russian  president's special envoy for Moldova Vladillen Vasev said on  Thursday in an interview with TASS, commenting on the joint  statement signed by the Moldovan and Dniester leaders.    The document signed the other day is quite constructive and  can lay down a good basis for further negotiations on the whole  set of problems facing the confronting sides, Russia's envoy  stressed.    "Both sides have come to understand that the situation  developing in Moldova and its Dniester region calls for a  pragmatic approach. As a result, the sides managed to find  mutually acceptable variants of conflict settlement", he noted.    Vasev laid a special emphasis on the fact that the signed  document stressed the need for defining the state and legal  status of the Dniester region. "This is to considerably  facilitate further efforts aiming to draw the conflicting sides  closer together", he pointed out.    The sides also reached a compromise on a transition period  and a gradual acquirement by the Dniester region of its state  and legal status, the Russian diplomat reported.    There has recently been certain progress in relations  between  Moldova and its separatist province, which agreed upon  approaches to solution of the most pressing problems. "However,  I would warn against excessive optimism at the moment, since a  lot of differences remain to be settled yet, including through  Russia's mediation", Vasev stressed.</p>

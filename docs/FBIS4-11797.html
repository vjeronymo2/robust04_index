			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The National Religious Party [NRP] Knesset  faction supports the halakic injunction of Rabbis Yisra'eli,  Shapira, and Neriya, according to which IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] soldiers should disobey the order to evacuate Jews from  Hebron. The NRP faction states that the evacuation of Jews from  Hebron is a red line from the public point of view and that  following the halakic ruling it is also a halakic red line.

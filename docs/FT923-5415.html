			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / International Company News: Danish insurer plunges into red BALTICA Holding, Denmark's biggest insurer, plunged to a loss of DKr991m (Dollars 176m) in the first six months compared with the DKr762m profit in the first half of last year. Group equity capital shrank to DKr7.92bn from DKr9.20bn. Insurance operations returned a DKr256m profit, down from DKr520m last year. 'The result shows that our primary business area is doing well,' said Mr Peter Christoffersen, group chief executive. The losses arose from large write-offs of property-related investments and the falling value of the bond and share portfolio. Property write-offs were DKr650m, including a substantial provision to cover involvement in a large office complex under construction in Gibraltar. The value of strategic shareholdings in France's Compagnie Financiere de Suez and Sweden's insurer Skandia declined by DKr297m, while last year these holdings showed a gain of DKr305m. Since June 30, the value of the strategic holdings has fallen by a further DKr160m. Baltica's banking subsidiary made a DKr142m loss as loss provisions rose. This compared with a DKr42m profit last year. The group forecast a better second-half result on condition that share and bond values at the end of the year did not deteriorate from the level at June 30.</p>

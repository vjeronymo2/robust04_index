			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Patching a tattered policy: Aid for Bosnian Moslem enclaves ALL ATTEMPTS by the west to patch up its tattered Bosnian policy have merely underlined the increasingly obvious absence of an overall plan for a durable peace settlement. Lip-service is still paid to the ill-fated Vance-Owen plan as the basis for an eventual negotiated settlement guaranteeing 'the full sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence' of Bosnia-Hercegovina, as it was in the latest final communique of the Nato Foreign Ministers' Council in Athens. But hardly any governments believe this is still a realistic proposition. Instead, the western nations are involved in a damage limitation exercise aimed essentially at masking their own failure to come up with effective measures that would make it possible to translate their avowed political objective of an independent and united Bosnia into practice. That exercise, by their own admission, involves temporary measures, such as the setting up of Moslem 'safe areas' in Bosnia which, far from contributing to a peace settlement, risk exacerbating an already inflammatory situation on the ground. Lord Owen, the European Community's representative on the two-man international mediating team, has talked recently of a 'serious unscrambling' of the United Nations sponsored peace initiative, mainly as the result of the so-called 'joint action programme' adopted by the US, Russia, the UK, France and Spain in Washington on May 22. One of the essential provisions of that agreement is the setting up of six safe areas in Bosnia, within which the Moslem population would be protected by the presence of troops from the UN Protection Force (Unprofor). Unfortunately, as Lord Owen has pointed out, the perception of the warring parties in Bosnia was that the five western nations were accepting the fait accompli of territory acquired by force, in the first place by the Serbs. That, in turn, encouraged the Bosnian Croats in the Mostar region to take more territory from the Moslems, with the inevitable result that the Moslems have launched counter-attacks on the Croats, their one-time allies, with considerable success and much additional human suffering. So the net result of the Washington agreement has been more fighting and atrocities, with the ultimate objective of a negotiated settlement appearing even more unattainable than it did before. Yet even in these circumstances the setting up of safe areas might have proved acceptable to international opinion as a desirable interim measure if the western nations had been able to agree on all the practical steps to make them viable. The jury is still out on the final verdict, but the evidence submitted by the west so far on the strength of its commitment to the setting up the safe areas and on other parts of the Washington agreement, such as the placing of international monitors on the Serbian-Bosnian border to supervise sactions, is far from conclusive. Having been thwarted by its allies in its original desire to undertake punitive air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs and to supply arms to their Moslem adversaries, the US has proved extremely reluctant to become more directly involved in the Bosnian crisis. By declining to provide ground troops to protect the Moslem enclaves, while several of its European allies such as France, Britain and Spain already have troops on the ground, the US exposed a serious rift in the western position. It gave the impression, not only to its allies, but to the warring parties in Bosnia, that it was not prepared to match its good intentions with deeds. At the same time, the Serbs will have noted a similar reluctance on the part of the European nations already involved in Bosnia to step up their own commitments of troops. The decision by the Nato Council in Athens on Thursday to offer military planes to protect UN forces around the Moslem enclaves and elsewhere in Bosnia against attack was an attempt both to paper over the cracks in the western alliance and to counter the original signals of western unwillingness to act in Bosnia sent to Belgrade. By joining France, Britain, the Netherlands and Turkey in offering aircraft for these operations, and by offering to provide 300 ground troops to join the UN peace-keeping contingent already in Macedonia, the US has tried to repair the damage - with what effect still remains to be seen. The fact is that air power will be used only to protect UN troops against attack and will not be called upon to defend Moslem civilians against attack if no UN troops are involved. Serbs and Croats will continue to be allowed to grab Moslem territory and pillage with impunity as long as they keep out of the way of UN troops. That is an important distinction which will hardly reassure the long-suffering Moslem population of Bosnia. Among all the squabbling and haggling over stop-gap solutions, and the occasional cries of victory when agreement is finally reached on the type of temporary sticking plaster to be applied to the gaping wound, sight is rapidly being lost by the west of the end result it wants to achieve. Safe areas, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British Foreign Secretary, said earlier this week, were not a magic solution. 'They are only a temporary, first step aimed at keeping people alive.' But those who are being kept alive are desperately looking for signs that the western powers have some idea of the long-term future which awaits the Moslems of Bosnia outside their extended refugee camps, which is all that the enclaves are destined to become. Judging by the results of the EC and Nato meetings in Luxembourg and Athens over the past few days, they will have to wait a long time for their answer.</p>

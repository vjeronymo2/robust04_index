			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This is a revision of an existing collection. Modifications to the existing Form EIA&hyph;871A ``Building Questionnaire'' include eliminating questions that are not related to Federal buildings or to EPACT requirements and adding several questions related to: water heating, energy audits conducted by the DOE Office of Federal Energy Management Programs, and energy consumption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> III. Request for Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Prospective respondents and other interested parties should comment on the actions discussed in item II. The following general guidelines are provided to assist in the preparation of responses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a potential respondent: A. Are the instructions and definitions clear and sufficient? If not, which instructions require clarification?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. Can the data be submitted using the definitions included in the instructions?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Can data be submitted in accordance with the response time specified in the instructions?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. Public reporting burden for this collection is estimated to average 27 minutes per respondent. Given that this survey will be conducted by telephone, how much time do you estimate it will require you to review the advanced letter mailed to you, gather the necessary data needed (square footage of building, year constructed and annual energy consumption) and respond to the telephone interview which includes questions about the physical characteristics of the building and energy-related equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. What is the estimated cost of completing this form, including the direct and indirect costs associated with the data collection? Direct costs should include all costs, such as administrative costs, directly attributable to providing this information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F. How can the form be improved?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G. Do you know of any other Federal, State, or local agency that collects similar data? If you do, specify the agency, the data element(s), and the means of collection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a potential user: A. Can you use data at the levels of detail indicated on the form?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. For what purpose would you use the data? Be specific.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. How could the form be improved to better meet your specific needs?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. Are there alternate sources of data and do you use them? What are their deficiencies and/or strengths?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. For the most part, information is published by EIA in U.S. customary units, e.g., cubic feet of natural gas, short tons of coal, and barrels of oil. Would you prefer to see EIA publish more information in metric units, e.g., cubic meters, metric tons, and kilograms? If yes, please specify what information (e.g., coal production, natural gas consumption, and crude oil imports), the metric unit(s) of measurement preferred, and in which EIA publication(s) you would like to see such information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EIA is also interested in receiving comments from persons regarding their views on the need for the information contained in the form EIA&hyph;871A (FS), ``Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey, Building Questionnaire (Federal Supplement)''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments submitted in response to this notice will be summarized and/or included in the request for OMB approval of the form; they also will become a matter of public record. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Statutory Authorities: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 2(a) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub.

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / ScotRail's franchising criticised THE GOVERNMENT has been accused of structuring the franchising of ScotRail, British Rail's Scottish division, in a way that favours larger bidders or a buy-out by its management at the expense of smaller companies. The Department of Transport plans to seek tenders next year from private-sector companies and buy-out teams. British Bus, a Salisbury-based group which runs buses in parts of Surrey, the Midlands, north-west England and Wales, says offering ScotRail as a single unit makes it impossible for many potential operators to bid for the franchise. ScotRail has annual fares income of more than Pounds 80m before subsidies. It operates 2,180 miles of track, of which 1,440 are passenger route miles. Mr Kenneth Irvine, rail privatisation project manager at British Bus - formerly Drawlane Transport - said the task of carrying out an audit of an operation of that size was too big for most bus com-panies. 'The decision to keep ScotRail as one unit reduces competition and will lower the price the franchise is likely to fetch,' he said. Mr Irvine added that the system favoured larger companies such as Stagecoach, the Perth-based bus operator whose Stock Exchange flotation this month is expected to value it at more than Pounds 120m. Stagecoach has said it is interested in the Scotrail franchise. Mr Irvine said the government's decision would also favour a buy-out by ScotRail's existing management. Mr Cyril Bleasdale, ScotRail's director, has said staff would probably want to bid. Mr Irvine said ScotRail should be split up into somewhere from two to five parts. Edinburgh Waverley and Glasgow Central stations could become the centres of two units. The transport department said ministers were firm in their decision to franchise ScotRail as one unit. It added that in later years franchisees might lose their exclusivity, opening the way to other operators on parts of the network. Observers feel that franchising ScotRail to a buy-out or to Stagecoach would appeal to Scottish national feeling and have more chance of acceptance in a country normally hostile to privatisation.</p>

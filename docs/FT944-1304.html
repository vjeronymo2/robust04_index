			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Drive for Ulster settlement confirmed The UK and Republic of Ireland governments last night underlined their determination to keep the Northern Ireland peace process on track after a 90-minute meeting at Downing Street between Mr John Major and Mr John Bruton, his new counterpart. Speaking after yesterday's 'very refreshing' meeting, Mr Major said British and Irish officials would meet early next month to press on with efforts to agree the joint framework document that the two governments hope will provide the basis for a lasting political settlement. Another meeting 'at foreign minister level' would take place a few days later. Questioned on the prospect of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, joining all-inclusive talks on the province's future, Mr Major said that 'substantial progress' on the decommissioning of arms would have to be made. Mr Bruton, who is to meet Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, this morning, emphasised that the decommissioning of weapons was not the only issue to be addressed in preliminary dialogue with Sinn Fein.</p>
